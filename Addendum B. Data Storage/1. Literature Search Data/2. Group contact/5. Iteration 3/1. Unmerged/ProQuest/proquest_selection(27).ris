T1  - Fear of Terrorism and Attitudes Toward Refugees: An Empirical Test of Group Threat Theory
AN  - 2644792255
AB  - In recent years, the co-occurrence of the migration crisis and terrorist attacks in European cities have created a strong link between refugees and asylum seekers and terrorism in the minds of many Europeans. This study investigates how attitudes toward refugees are associated with fear of terrorism. Using multilevel modelling on 1,500 Belgian citizens nested in 402 municipalities, results indicate that positive attitudes toward refugees are associated with lower terrorism fear. Adverse economic conditions at both the individual and municipal level are associated with greater fear of terrorism, while a large outgroup size is associated with lower fear of terrorism. Women hold greater fear than men, while commercial news consumption is associated with greater terrorism fears.

T1  - What makes Dutch youth comply with preventive COVID‐19 measures? An explorative study
AN  - 2627011019
AB  - The measures to contain the spread of COVID‐19 are challenging for youth, especially the social isolation measures. These measures are antagonistic to healthy youth development, which requires sufficient social contact with peers and adults. This explorative study examined what factors are associated with adherence to COVID‐19 measures in a sample of Dutch youth (N = 263; 79.8% female) with ages ranging between 16 and 24 years (M = 21.1 years; SD = 2.44 years), who completed an online questionnaire about their compliance to measures, resilience, coping strategies, mental health, and availability of a natural mentor. Results showed that youth with fewer depressive symptoms adhered better to measures of social distance. Youth who were less suspicious, more resilient, and those with an active coping strategy or a natural mentor more often complied with COVID‐19 measures. These results can be used to help youth comply with the COVID‐19 measures.

T1  - Why we can’t talk openly about race: The impact of race and partisanship on respondents’ perceptions of intergroup conversations: GPIR
AN  - 2638250253
AB  - Conversations about race-specific issues with interracial conversation partners can be important to combat prejudice and foster mutual understanding. Using a national U.S. sample of 201 Black Democrats, 199 Black Republicans, 200 White Democrats, and 200 White Republicans, this study examined the role that race and partisanship play in individuals’ desire to have political discussions about race-specific topics with racial outgroups. Findings indicate that Blacks in general expected more negative outcomes of race talk with racial outgroups, and Republicans were more likely to attempt to avoid interracial conversations about race. However, these findings were qualified by an interaction between race and partisanship such that White Democrats anticipated fewer negative outcomes from cross-race conversations about race than all other subgroups, and Black Democrats expected more negative outcomes than all other subgroups. Black and White Republicans did not differ from one another and fell roughly between the two Democratic subgroups. Nonetheless, it was White Republicans who were most likely to want to avoid race-specific conversations with cross-race discussion partners, rating significantly more avoidant than Black Republicans and White Democrats, but not Black Democrats.

T1  - Gender/Nationality Intersections in Attitudes Toward Gun Carry among Israeli Citizens
AN  - 2628049711
AB  - The study explores how nationality and gender effect attitudes on the presence, use, and misuse of guns by security forces and civilians in Israel. Using data from a national survey (n = 721), we find that Israelis, Jews, and Arabs have more positive attitudes toward military firearms than civilian gun carry. The vast majority agree that display of military arms increases the public sense of security. Numbers are much lower regarding civilian carry. Most respondents, Jews and Arabs, would interfere if witnessed public misuse of firearms. An intersectional analysis finds (1) a gender gap, men have higher odds of reporting a firearm in the household than women; (2) Jews have more positive attitudes toward firearms than Arabs; (3) Jewish men have more positive attitudes toward civilian carry than Jewish women. This gender gap does not appear among Arabs; (4) Jews are more favorable of self-protection as a justification to use arms than Arabs.

T1  - Perceived discrimination among Spanish Roma: The role of religion
AN  - 2614689555
AB  - This article aims to show that Roma people in Spain are targeted for discrimination because of perceptions about their religious beliefs, as well as for reasons linked to their socio-economic status. Data on the Spanish Roma population have been, used and analysis reveals that Evangelical Roma people have a higher probability of perceiving discrimination than those Roma who profess the majority religion in Spain, that is, Catholicism, once other socio-economic and demographic factors are controlled for. We recommend that this manifested higher degree of discrimination towards Evangelical Roma should be addressed by Spanish institutions and organizations promoting the rights of ethnic minorities by considering intersectional discrimination which allows for a more respectful and egalitarian approach to the diversity of Roma people. Additionally, Evangelical churches should be considered as active actors in an inter-culture dialogue.

T1  - Multicultural Education of Autochthons and Migrants in Russia
AN  - 2573029622
AB  - The study aims to analyze modern scientific approaches to multicultural education of autochthons, migrants, and foreign students to assess the real state and prospects of such education development in Russia. The 2019 RPORC (Russian Public Opinion Research Center) survey "Higher education: in Russia or abroad?" was used in the study. A total of 1,600 respondents took part in the study. Based on the Pareto Optimality principle, a model of an integrated multicultural education process has been developed. Survey data analysis has shown that for the majority of Russians (78%) it is not important whether their children/grandchildren will receive higher education abroad. Russian society has a tolerant attitude towards domestic and world educational systems. The practical application of the research results is possible with the improvement of training programs, the exchange of international experience and further research into the problems of multicultural education development.

T1  - Parallel empathy and group attitudes in late childhood: The role of perceived peer group attitudes
AN  - 2502553263
AB  - Although several studies have examined outgroup empathy, the link between trait empathy and outgroup attitudes has been underinvestigated. In the present study this link was investigated among two samples of ethnic Dutch preadolescents (N = 335, Mage = 10.83 years, SD = 0.94; 53% girls; N = 326; Mage = 10.53 years, SD = 1.03; 48% girls). It examined children’s parallel empathy in relation to their ethnic attitudes, and the moderating role of perceived peer norms. Results (partly) support the hypotheses that empathy is associated with more outgroup positivity and less ingroup bias (ingroup minus outgroup attitude). The negative link between empathy and outgroup bias was stronger when peers were perceived to be more biased against the outgroup.

T1  - The trickle‐down effect of procedural fairness on perceptions of daily discrimination: How societal actors can build social trust among minority members
AN  - 2569549843
AB  - The present research investigated the trickle‐down effect of procedural fairness enacted by societal institutions on minority members’ social trust. Building on the racial identity development hypothesis, we argued that procedural fairness represents a racial socialization experience, which influences how minorities perceive discrimination in daily life. Perceived group discrimination, in turn, impacts social trust. The results of five studies with African American samples corroborated the hypothesized mediation model. Study 1 showed that minority members distinctly perceive fairness enacted by institutions and discrimination by fellow citizens. Subsequent studies demonstrated that manipulating procedural fairness influenced perceived discrimination in an “attribution‐to‐discrimination” paradigm (Study 2), and that inducing discrimination lowered trust in an allocation game (Study 3). Finally, Studies 4 and 5 obtained cross‐sectional evidence for the full model. Our results thus contribute to literature by showing that perceived discrimination mediates the relationship between procedural fairness and social trust. Societally relevant practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Essentialist beliefs affect children's outgroup empathy, attitudes and prosocial behaviours in a setting of intergroup conflict
AN  - 2478725369
AB  - Empathy for salient outgroups can promote positive intergroup attitudes and prosocial behaviours. Less is known about which factors may promote empathy, particularly among children, in contexts of intergroup conflict. Empathy may depend on underlying cognitions, such as social essentialist beliefs, that is, believing that certain social categories have an underlying essence that causes members to share observable and non‐observable properties. This study explored the influence of essentialist beliefs about ethno‐religious categories on outgroup‐directed empathy, attitudes and prosocial behaviours of children living in Northern Ireland (N = 88; M = 7.09, SD = 1.47 years old). Bootstrapped chain mediation found that lower essentialist beliefs predicted greater outgroup‐directed empathy, which was positively related to outgroup attitudes, which in turn, predicted more outgroup prosocial behaviours. The findings highlight the importance of essentialist beliefs as an underlying factor promoting empathy, with links to prosocial behaviours in settings of intergroup conflict. The intervention implications are discussed.

AN  - 2663522198
AB  - The present study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on peopleʼs economic and psychological states using data from a three-wave online panel survey carried out in Japan from June to December 2020. Our results indicate that the pandemic amplifies pre-existing socioeconomic inequality by disproportionally affecting socially vulnerable groups. Lower socioeconomic status groups, who were already disadvantaged in the labor market prior to the pandemic based on gender or educational level, were more likely to experience economic downturn. Further, working in the service industry or in smaller companies was also associated with a higher risk of experiencing job loss or pay cuts. In addition, we found that the pandemic has had detrimental effects not only on socioeconomic conditions, but also on mental well-being. Socially vulnerable individuals are more strongly affected. With social distancing orders in place to curb the spread of infection, social capital-usually an important coping resource in times of disaster-could not function to counterbalance these negative effects. Instead, increase in distrust and loneliness further deteriorated the mental well-being of individuals. Overall, our results point to the urgent need for additional support for the socially vulnerable.

T1  - How to Foster Empathy in Anti-discrimination Initiatives? Implication for Social Interventions-A Qualitative Approach
AN  - 2491986183
AB  - L'objectif de cette étude était d'explorer les antécédents de la réponse empathique dans le contexte de la réception des publicités sociales anti-discrimination. Nous avons examiné, par le biais des entretiens de groupe qualitatifs, les antécédents contextuels qui sont susceptibles de faciliter la prise de perspective et le partage émotionnel. 61 personnes ont participé â cette étude, dont 43 femmes et 18 hommes. Les entretiens de groupe semi-dirigés ont duré entre 40 minutes et 2 heures. Les enregistrements ont été transcrits et analysés â l'aide de NVivo. Nous avons effectué un codage mixte des données et nous avons analysé les entretiens selon les principes de l'analyse thématique. Les analyses ont révélé que certains types d'expressions faciales des émotions, deux types de similarité perçue et les éléments mettant en valeur l'humanité commune jouent un röle important dans le déclenchement des réponses empathique dans ce contexte particulier. Bien qu'il soit nécessaire de promouvoir la diversité, nos résultats indiquent que les interventions futures devraient mettre l'accent sur l'humanité commune entre les groupes et la promotion de la diversité devrait étre accompagnée d'un effort équivalent â promouvoir les ressemblances entre les groupes. En outre, les résultats présentés ici peuvent étre utilisés afin de bâtir des interventions plus efficaces et plus appropriées qui cherchent â induire de l'empathie envers les groupes discriminés et marginalisés.Alternate abstract:The purpose of this study was to explore antecedents of empathic responding in the context of antidiscrimination public service announcement (PSA) reception. We sought to qualitatively examine which contextual antecedents are likely to play a role in facilitating the perspective taking and emotion sharing processes. Recruitment through the local university's mailing list and an online classified advertising service yielded 61 participants: 18 men and 43 women. Semi-structured focus group interviews lasted from 40 minutes to two hours. The recordings were transcribed and analyzed using NVivo. We used a mixed approach to coding and analyzed the interviews using the process of thematic analysis. The analyses revealed that certain facial expressions of emotion, two types of perceived similarity and a focus on common humanity play an important role in triggering empathic responses in this type of context. While it is necessary to promote diversity, these findings indicate that future interventions should focus on emphasizing a common humanity between the groups and that the accentuation of differences should also be accompanied by a focus on similarities. The results of the current study can be used to build more appropriate and efficient intervention strategies that aim to foster empathy for discriminated and marginalized groups.

T1  - Exposure to Analogous Harmdoing Increases Acknowledgment of Ingroup Transgressions in Intergroup Conflicts
AN  - 2458384302
AB  - A major barrier to the resolution of intergroup conflicts is the reluctance to acknowledge transgressions committed by one’s ingroup toward the outgroup. Existing research demonstrates that individuals are generally motivated to justify ingroup conduct and avoid experiencing guilt and shame about ingroup harmdoing. The current work explores the use of an analogy-based intervention to attenuate motivated reasoning in evaluations of ingroup harmdoing. Overall, across six studies, we find support for our hypothesis that considering a case of harmdoing in a removed context increases acknowledgment of an analogous case of ingroup harmdoing. We further explore why, and under what conditions, the analogy is effective in leading to increased acknowledgment of an ingroup transgression. We find that the effect of the analogy is mediated by the endorsement of moral principles specific to the domain of the transgression, suggesting that the mechanism involves a cognitive process of analogical reasoning.

T1  - Looking Back at White Working-Class Racial Attitudes and Behaviors in the Late 1940s: An Updated Analysis
AN  - 2558600640
AB  - We re-analyze quantitative and qualitative data from a study of a white, working-class neighborhood in mid-twentieth century Chicago to pursue two research goals. First, we test how attitudes toward blacks as coworkers and neighbors are correlated, and determine whether those attitudes are associated with commitment to the union and neighborhood attachment. Second, we address three timely issues in urban sociology and race relations: (1) how community efficacy is related to attitudes toward racial exclusion, (2) whether white homeowners are likely to oppose racial minorities as neighbors due to fears over property value decline, and (3) the “whitening” process by which people of southern and eastern European ancestry came to embrace a white racial identity.

T1  - The Creeping Concept of Trauma
AN  - 2465812367
AB  - Over the past century, the concept of trauma has substantially broadened its meanings in academic and public discourse. We document four directions in which this semantic expansion has occurred at different times: from somatic to psychic, extraordinary to ordinary, direct to indirect, and individual to collective. We analyze these expansions as instances of "concept creep," the progressive inflation of harm-related concepts, and present evidence for the rising cultural salience and semantic enlargement of trauma in recent decades. Expansive concepts of trauma may have mixed blessings for personal and collective identity.

T1  - Understandings of national identity and outgroup attitudes in culturally diverse Mauritius
AN  - 2506626012
AB  - This study investigated understandings of national group belonging in relation to attitudes toward foreign and established outgroups in Mauritius. Representative data were collected among the three numerically largest ethno-cultural groups (Hindus, Muslims, and Creoles; Ntotal = 1770) and results confirmed a distinction between "being," "doing," and "feeling" Mauritian among all three groups, with some small differences for Creoles compared to Hindus and Muslims. Furthermore, "being" Mauritian was not significantly related to attitudes toward established and foreign outgroups. In contrast, the "doing" understanding was negatively associated with both attitudes, and the "feeling" understanding showed positive associations with both outgroup attitudes among all three participant groups. The findings make a novel contribution to the literature on how people understand national identity, how these understandings differ between ethno-cultural groups within a nation, and how these relate to attitudes toward foreign as well as established outgroups.

T1  - Evaluating the independence of age, sex, and race in judgment of faces
AN  - 2456878308
AB  - Extracting the dimensions of age, sex, race from faces is fundamental for many aspects of social cognition such as person construal, impression formation, and social interaction. While cognitive researchers consider these dimensions to be independent in processing, social psychology researchers have recently demonstrated the emergence of strong interactive patterns between these categories, especially, when social biases are involved. The current study harnessed the classic Garner's speeded classification task (Garner, 1974) and Stroop task (1935) to evaluate the level of independence between age, sex, and race in a systematic and exhaustive fashion, with an eye on the potential influence of social biases. The degree of separability was evaluated in a pairwise fashion, with each experiment testing one pair. In Experiment 1a and 1b, sex and race were tested with strong (Experiment 1b) or weak (Experiment 1a) social bias. Experiment 2 was set to assess the separability of sex and race. And Experiment 3 was aimed at evaluating the separability of age and sex. The results revealed that neither of the pairs of dimensions produced Garner interferences (and are therefore separable dimensions). However, when strong social bias was present, the dimensions did produce redundancy gains and Stroop-like effects, which reflected the presence of abiding social biases. A holistic-to-analytic model is presented to account for these results, according to which, the dimensions are initially processed as integral dimensions, but then become gradually separable.

T1  - Fake News Is Real: The Significance and Sources of Disbelief in Mainstream Media in Trump’s America
AN  - 2441436794
AB  - Are appeals to discredit mainstream media reporting of political news in the guise of “fake news” merely a diversion from more fundamental threats to democratic politics and policymaking? Or is the emerging belief in “fake news” itself a looming threat? Using data from the Voter Study Group’s panel survey, we examine the relationship between disbelief in mainstream media and a wide range of social attitudes and policy preferences. We find that in December 2016, just after Trump’s election, belief in fake news wields an outsized influence, independent of partisanship, ideology, media consumption, and other established foundations of public opinion. The effects of fake news beliefs are especially pronounced on key elements of Trump’s rhetoric as candidate and as president—hostility toward immigrants, racial and religious minorities, gender equality, perceptions of America’s “greatness,” and even support for democratic norms and institutions itself. We also find some evidence that by January 2019, the belief in fake news has become even more focally associated with Trump. These findings portend the possibility of an emerging exclusionary, populist variant of American conservatism, of which disbelief in media institutions is a key component.

T1  - Intercultural Relations Among Cape Verdean Immigrants Living in Portugal
AN  - 2234827218
AB  - This study examines intercultural relations among Cape Verdean immigrants living in Portugal. Seven specific predictions based on three general hypotheses (multiculturalism hypothesis, contact hypothesis and integration hypothesis) were tested. The sample of this research consisted of 283 Cape Verdean migrants (51% females) with an average of 35 years. The average duration of residence in Portugal was 18 years. In line with the multiculturalism hypothesis, cultural security was positively related to integration, tolerance and cultural identity. The contact hypothesis was also supported, as intercultural contact was related to positive intergroup attitudes. Regarding the integration hypothesis, psychological adaptation and intercultural adaptation were predicted by integration, whilst sociocultural adaptation was only predicted by marginalisation. Thus, the integration hypothesis was partially supported for Cape Verdean immigrants living in Portugal. Findings are discussed considering the existing literature.

T1  - Leaving the most vulnerable behind: Reflection on the Covid-19 pandemic and Direct Provision in Ireland
AN  - 2434445765
AB  - The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically altered our daily routines, social interactions, workplaces, future plans and social norms. Social distancing, isolating or ‘cocooning’, and avoiding all non-essential contact are the ‘new normal’. In one of his speeches, An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar highlights the frustration felt by many in adapting to the ‘new normal’ and the longing for simple things we all perhaps have taken for granted. This, he goes on to say, is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to ‘shelter our most vulnerable and [to] protect them’ (Varadkar, 2020). However, the measures taken to protect those deemed vulnerable have not been extended to include some 7700 international protection applicants living in Direct Provision centres. In this short article, I reflect on how asylum seekers, one of the most vulnerable groups in Irish society, have been left behind during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

T1  - The Armenians of Los Angeles: Rethinking “Americanization”
AN  - 2447806392
AB  - The existing scholarship typically measures “Americanization” along structural lines—such as knowledge of public policies, percentage of life spent in the U.S., or proficiency in the English language. While these variables are certainly important, they overlook another important dimension of newcomers’ post-migration experiences—namely, immigrants’ psychological attachment and sense of belonging to the American social, political, and economic fabric. This article therefore reevaluates what it means to Americanize by exploring the psychological (or symbolic) dimensions of multigenerational immigrants’ evolving political beliefs toward the polity. In rethinking the process of Americanization, we rely on a largely understudied immigrant population—that is, the Los Angeles Armenians (or Armenian Angelenos)—and an original public opinion survey—the Armenian Angeleno Survey (AAS). This study demonstrates that symbolic (rather than merely structural) Americanization is a useful framework in studying how contemporary immigrant groups position themselves in relation to the polity and understand important political outcomes. This article thus introduces an expanded model based on how multigenerational immigrants cultivate their ethnic communities while becoming ideological members of American society.

T1  - Race‐Based Stress in White Adults: Exploring the Role of White Racial Identity Status Attitudes and Type of Racial Events
AN  - 2386130059
AB  - The impact of racial experiences on Whites has been underresearched and has rarely been considered traumatic. To understand these experiences, it is important to consider variation in one's orientation to their racial group (i.e., racial identity) and the type of racial encounter. Using a White adult sample and hierarchical cluster analysis, the authors found that reactions to race‐based encounters were associated with varying levels of psychological distress and well‐being and racial identity statuses. Clinical implications are discussed.Alternate abstract:El impacto de las experiencias raciales en personas blancas no ha sido suficientemente investigado y en raras ocasiones ha sido considerado traumático. Para comprender estas experiencias, es importante considerar la variación en la orientación de cada individuo hacia su grupo racial (es decir, la identidad racial) y el tipo de encuentro racial. Usando una muestra de personas adultas blancas y un análisis jerárquico de clústeres, los autores hallaron que las reacciones a los encuentros raciales estaban asociadas a niveles variables de malestar psicológico, así como de estados de bienestar e identidad racial.

T1  - The attitudes and opinions of young students towards their own language: The case of Tsonga-speaking students at the University of Johannesburg
AN  - 2378994692
AB  - Tsonga people are one of South Africa's recognised ethnic groups with a population of over 4.5 million speakers in the country (Census 2011). This qualifies the language as one of the least spoken indigenous languages in the country when compared to Zulu, Xhosa, Pedi, Sotho, and Tswana. In cases where a language is spoken by the minority, there tends to be concomitant negative attitudes towards that particular language by speakers of the majority languages. This paper reports the findings of a study that investigated the attitudes and opinions of young Tsonga-speaking students towards their own language (or their perception of the self) at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa. Ten (N=10) Tsonga-speaking students were asked how they felt about their own language. Structured questionnaires that consisted of both open ended and closed ended questions were used. Results indicated that the participants of the study not only had positive attitudes and opinions towards their own language, but they also had the same with the other indigenous South African languages.

T1  - Media of Contempt: Social Media Consumption Predicts Normative Acceptance of Anti-Muslim Hate Speech and Islamoprejudice
AN  - 2444990891
AB  - The new era of information technology brings new opportunities but also poses new threats. In our paper, we examine whether a shift from traditional print and broadcasting to new online media results in the increased normalization of hate speech towards minorities, and whether this change can subsequently increase prejudice towards minorities. Our research uses data from a representative two-wave longitudinal survey of Polish adults. In wave 1 (N = 1060), data on respondents' primary sources of information about the world (TV, newspapers, radio, online, social media, blogs) was collected. Wave 2 (N = 628), conducted six months later, included measures of perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech and Islamophobia. We found that respondents who were frequent social media users expressed higher levels of Islamoprejudice and perceived higher normativity of antiMuslim hate speech than the respondents who got their news from traditional mass media. We also found that an increase in perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech can act as one of the mechanisms through which use of social media is linked to higher Islamoprejudice.

T1  - Dehumanization of dirty workers and attitudes toward social support
AN  - 2319730213
AB  - In lay perception, dirty work is a type of labor that degrades human dignity. Work can be perceived as dirty on three bases: social (related to the subordinate position or associated with contact with stigmatized people), physical (related to direct contact with garbage and waste), and moral (related to jobs considered sinful, dubious, or defying social norms). “Dirty” stigma makes workers objects of dehumanization and discrimination, in particular, people distance themselves from dirty workers and are not ready to help and support them. In the experimental study (N = 340), we investigated how certain types of dirty workers are dehumanized compared to nondirty workers and the indirect effect of the type of dirty work on attitudes toward the social support of dirty workers via animalistic (attribution of uniquely human traits) and the mechanistic (attribution of human nature traits) dehumanization. The results show that individuals are willing to offer more social support to a low status but not dirty worker rather than to social or moral dirty workers. At the same time, less social support is provided to nondirty than to physical dirty worker. Animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization mediates the relationship between the types of dirty work and the attitudes toward social support. In particular, less dehumanization leads to more positive attitudes toward social support. The limitations and future directions of the obtained results are discussed.

T1  - "When birds of a different feather flock together" – intercultural socialization in adolescents' friendships
AN  - 2317026993
AB  - Intercultural friendships are a powerful form of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice (Pettigrew, 1998). Little is known about if and how intercultural friendships may also foster intercultural competence. An important prerequisite for the development of intercultural competence is that adolescents reflect on cultural variations. We refer to the degree to which adolescents discuss cultural variations in intercultural friendships as intercultural socialization and explore the following research questions: (1) Does intercultural socialization in friendships mediate the relation between age, intercultural friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship), and adolescents' intercultural competence? (2) Do these relations depend on the adolescents' self-identification with majority and minority culture(s)? The sample included 571 adolescents in Germany (48% female, Mage = 13.69 years, 52% identifying only as members of the cultural majority, 48% (also) as members of a cultural minority. Intercultural competence was measured using a self-report questionnaire and open-ended questions capturing the adolescents' interpretation of and reaction to intercultural situations. Quantitative measures tapped into friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship). To test our model, we employed multigroup path analysis with latent variables in Mplus. Results showed that intercultural socialization linked age and intercultural friendship characteristics with adolescents' intercultural competence. The relations partly varied depending on student's cultural self-identification. We conclude that intercultural friendships are associated with important skills that are needed in increasingly multicultural societies if students experience and discuss cultural variations in these friendships.

T1  - Measuring beliefs in the instrumentality of ethnic diversity: Development and validation of the Pro-Diversity Beliefs Scale (PDBS): GPIR
AN  - 2229907571
AB  - In general, diversity beliefs are beliefs about the instrumentality of diversity for the functioning of groups. Focusing on a societal level, recent social-psychological research addressed pro-diversity beliefs as individuals’ beliefs that diversity is beneficial for the progress of society. Despite the growing interest in societal pro-diversity beliefs, no systematically validated scale measuring pro-diversity beliefs is available to date. We addressed this shortcoming and studied the reliability and validity of the newly developed Pro-Diversity Beliefs Scale (PDBS) across four samples. Results indicate that the PDBS is reliable, adequately distinct from related and established scales, and valid in predicting external criteria such as outgroup attitudes or intergroup threat.

Corporate identities and CSR practices are aesthetically projected through logos, trademarks, websites, the presentation of products and services, stylish offices, company uniforms, and other aesthetic artefacts. This corporate "branding" dovetails with the broader aestheticization of our pervasive media and consumer culture. Aesthetics has particular salience in CSR for influencing, and sometimes misleading, public opinion about corporate environmental performance. Consequently, in disciplining unscrupulous corporate behaviour, governance methods must be more responsive to such aesthetic characteristics. The green illusions of business communications create difficulties for regulation, which is better suited to disciplining discrete misleading statements about retailed products or trademarks rather than tackling the broader aesthetic character of business and the marketplace. The article suggests that non-state actors who are more sensitive to aesthetics can help to fill some of this governance void. The "counter-aesthetic" strategies of social and environmental activist groups can inject a subversive narrative that can help to unmask these green illusions. Although the history of such tactics suggests they probably have only a modest effect in challenging corporate deception, the law can assist by protecting public spaces from corporate marketing and sponsorship.Alternate abstract:Cet article présente une argumentation novatrice selon laquelle la gouvernance des activités pro-environnementales des entreprises devrait reconnaître que la société commerciale est un phénomène esthétique, notamment au chapitre des pratiques et opérations de communication environnementales mises en œuvre au nom de la « responsabilité sociale de l'entreprise ». L'identité de l'entreprise et ses pratiques en matière de responsabilité sociale sont projetées esthétiquement dans les logos, les marques déposées, les sites internet, dans la présentation des produits et services proposés, dans des bureaux aménagés avec style, les uniformes de ses employés et d'autres objets de facture esthétique. Cette stratégie de marque s'inscrit dans l'esthétisation générale de la culture médiatique et de consommation envahissante qui est la nôtre. En matière de responsabilité sociale de l'entreprise, l'esthétique a une importance particulière parce qu'elle sert à influencer et parfois à berner l'opinion publique quant au bilan environnemental d'une entreprise. En conséquence, pour corriger une conduite peu scrupuleuse de l'entreprise, les méthodes de gouvernance doivent être mieux adaptées à ce type de caractéristiques esthétiques. Les vertes illusions des communications d'entreprise compliquent la réglementation, qui convient mieux pour sanctionner les discrètes affirmations trompeuses portant sur les produits vendus au détail ou sur les marques déposées que pour s'attaquer au caractère esthétique général des affaires et du marché. L'article laisse entendre que les acteurs non étatiques dotés d'une sensibilité supérieure à l'esthétique peuvent contribuer à combler un peu ce vide de gouvernance. Les stratégies de « contre-esthétique » des groupes militants sociaux et écologistes peuvent introduire un discours subversif qui aide à démasquer ces vertes illusions. Bien que l'histoire de telles tactiques donne à penser qu'elles n'ont probablement qu'un effet limité sur la remise en cause de la tromperie des entreprises, le droit peut offrir un soutien en protégeant les espaces publics contre le marketing et la commandite d'entreprise.

T1  - Marked inside and out: an exploration of perceived stigma of the tattooed in the workplace
TT  - Marked inside and out
AN  - 2177147237
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to gain better understanding of the attitudes toward those with tattoo(s) – by both those with and without tattoos – within the workplace. Specifically, this paper works to gain better understanding of attitudes toward those within specific employment and workplace groups.Design/methodology/approachThis study utilized a self-administered Likert scaled original survey through a combined random and snowball sampling method. Results were analyzed using quantitative statistical analysis based on responses to attitudinal questions and demographic factors.FindingsThe results of this study indicate that negative attitudes toward tattoos are diminishing, and that there is an ever shrinking gap in negative attitudes between those with and those without tattoos.Research limitations/implicationsWhile intended to be an exploratory exercise, this study may have been limited by the participant base. Even with a high number of responses, the random and snowball sampling of the participants may have resulted in clusters of data which may not be transferable across the population. Future studies should seek more closed collection of the data within specific organizations or controlled participant groups.Originality/valueThis study makes a new contribution to the literature as it is one of the first studies to specifically ask those with tattoos how they feel about others with tattoos. It is also one of the first academic articles, rather than journalistic, which explores attitudes toward tattoos within specific organizations.

T1  - What Constitutes ‘Discrimination’ in Everyday Talk? Argumentative Lines and the Social Representations of Discrimination
AN  - 2100130068
AB  - Most people agree that discrimination is wrong, but the boundary between ‘discrimination’ and ‘not discrimination’ is often highly contested in everyday practice. We explore the social representations of ‘discrimination’ as an object of study in qualitative interviews and focus groups with both minority (self-identified as BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] and/or gay men) and majority (self-identified as White and/or heterosexual) participants (n = 54). Our analysis suggests three repeated and pervasive argumentative lines in social representations of discrimination: (1) that there are two distinct kinds of discrimination (hard vs. soft), (2) that you need to understand the intention of the actor(s), and (3) that a claim of discrimination requires strong evidence. We outline the macro Functions of these resources to argue that each was non-performative: They appeared to be tools to make claims of discrimination, but in practice they were much more effective at making claims of what was not discrimination.

T1  - Moral(ity and) Economy: Work, Workfare, and Fairness in Provincial Hungary
AN  - 2108776074
AB  - The relationship between morality and economy has been muddied in the course of disciplinary specialization. While dominant paradigms in economics abstract from the moral dimension, recent approaches to morality and ethics in anthropology neglect the material economy. E. P. Thompson’s “moral economy” has been an influential bridging concept in recent decades, but recent inflationary usage has highlighted shortcomings. Following an overview of the disciplinary debates, the moral dimension of economic life is illustrated in this paper with reference to work as a value between the late 19th and early 21st centuries in Hungary. Contemporary workfare is explored with local examples. It is shown how discourses of work and fairness are being extended into new ethical registers to justify negative attitudes towards a new category of migrants.Alternate abstract:La relation entre la moralité et l’économie a été perdue au gré de la spécialisation disciplinaire. Alors que les paradigmes dominants en économie font généralement abstraction de la dimension morale, les approches récentes de la morale et de l’éthique en anthropologie négligent l’économie matérielle. Le concept intermédiaire d’« économie morale » proposé par E.P. Thompson a été influent au cours des dernières décennies, mais l’inflation récente de ses usages a mis en évidence d’importantes lacunes. Après un tour d’horizon des débats disciplinaires, la dimension morale de la vie économique est saisie dans cet article à partir du cas du travail comme valeur en Hongrie, entre la fin du xixe et le début du xxe siècle. Le modèle contemporain du « workfare » est exploré à partir d’exemples locaux. Il est montré comment les discours sur le travail et l’équité sont étendus à de nouveaux registres éthiques pour justifier des attitudes négatives envers les migrants.Alternate abstract:Die fortschreitende Spezialisierung der Disziplinen hat die Beziehung zwischen Moral und Wirtschaft ausgeblendet. Während die dominierenden, wirtschaftlichen Paradigmen die moralische Dimension außer acht lassen, vernachlässigen jüngste Ansätze der Moral und der Ethik in der Anthropologie die materielle Wirtschaft. Das dazwischen liegende Modell der “moralischen Wirtschaft” von E.P. Thompson hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten einen großen Einfluss ausgeübt, wenngleich jüngste Anwendungen seine Lückenhaftigkeit verdeutlicht haben. Der Zusammenfassung der Fachdebatten folgt eine Analyse der moralischen Dimension des Wirtschaftslebens, verdeutlicht in Sachen Arbeit als Wert am Beispiel Ungarns vom Ende des 19. bis zum Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts. Das zeitgenössische Modell des “workfare” wird mittels örtlicher Beispiele untersucht. Es wird aufgezeigt, wie Reden über Arbeit und Gerechtigkeit auf neue ethische Register ausgeweitet werden, um negative Verhaltungsweisen gegenüber Migranten zu rechtfertigen.

T1  - Stigma Consciousness and Subjective Well-Being in Lesbians and Gays
AN  - 2033617323
AB  - The stigma associated with sexual identity can affect an individual’s well-being. The main goal of this study was to analyse the role of a psychosocial variable, stigma consciousness, on the well-being of lesbian and gay (LG) individuals. For this purpose, a sample of 481 participants completed various questionnaires (Mage = 32.36, SDage = 9.60). Analysis of these results using structural equations showed two different pathways to cope with the stigma. The first pathway consists of collective action, and the second consists of stigma concealment. Specifically, stigma consciousness positively predicts well-being through group identification and collective action. Stigma concealment, however, negatively predicts well-being through the perception of prejudice. In addition, this work has confirmed that concealment has a direct negative relationship with subjective well-being. These results are interpreted from a psychosocial perspective. Finally, based on our data, we propose future interventions that provide LG individuals with strategies to cope with their perceptions of stigma.

T1  - How can Chinese international students’ host-national contact contribute to social connectedness, social support and reduced prejudice in the mainstream society? Testing a moderated mediation model
AN  - 2069025198
AB  - Guided by the contact hypothesis, this study examined host culture adoption of Chinese students sojourning in France as a mediator between their host-national contact (i.e., face-to-face contact and online contact) and social connectedness, perceived social support and reduced prejudice in the mainstream society. We also examined whether face-to-face contact served as a moderator that modified the impacts of online contact. A group of 211 Chinese students in France responded to a web-based survey. Results from structural equation modeling analysis revealed that face-to-face contact significantly predicted Chinese students’ adoption of the host culture. Host culture adoption, in turn, influenced social connectedness, perceived social support and prejudice. In contrast, online contact was not predictive of host culture adoption, but had significant direct effects on social connectedness, perceived social support and prejudice. However, direct face-to-face contact did not moderate the relationship between online contact and the predicted variables. Bootstrapping methods were employed to investigate the mediating effects of host culture adoption and revealed that host culture adoption was a full mediator between face-to-face contact and the outcome variables.

T1  - Living without God in a religious country: Polish nonbelievers as a cultural minority
AN  - 2007766867
AB  - This article focuses on the community of Polish nonbelievers; according to different surveys, they constitute approximately 8% of the overall population. In this research-grounded opinion they should be treated as a minority, not only strictly numerically but also culturally, with all the consequences of this fact. This research conducted on the members of this group showed there are some important levels of such consequences. The first is the level of identity. The vast majority of my respondents were raised Catholic and therefore one may call them converts to non-religiousness. The second is the level of (non)religious consciousness. Less than one fifth of my respondents clearly expressed certain forms of religious belief, such as faith in an impersonal form of deity or in an afterlife. The third is the level of subjectively perceived discrimination. Polish nonbelievers rarely meet with direct expressions of prejudice against them during face-to-face encounters. However, they feel a strong social pressure to cultivate some elements of the ritual dimension of religiosity. At the end the author considers to what extent their minority status has a relative character.

T1  - The mediating role of identity incompatibility in the relationship between perceived discrimination and acculturation preferences in two generations of the ethnic Russian minority in the North Caucasus
AN  - 1975989433
AB  - The present study tested a model in which the perceived incompatibility of ethnic Russian and regional North Caucasian identities mediates the relationship between perceived discrimination and acculturation strategies in two generations of ethnic Russian minority members living in the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, North Caucasus, Russian Federation. Two identities might be perceived incompatible when they represent conflicting sets of norms and values and the two communities may place competing demands on individual commitment and loyalty. We sampled 105 dyads from ethnic Russian families (youth: M = 18 years, SD = 2.35, 48.6% female; parents: M = 43 years, SD = 6.97, 68.6% female). The questionnaire included measures of perceived discrimination, perceived identity incompatibility, and acculturation strategies. The results of multigroup path analysis showed that the perceived identity incompatibility mediated the relationship between perceived discrimination and two strategies, aimed at culture maintenance (integration and separation) in both generations. Identity incompatibility is regarded as a psychological mechanism that explains the impact of perceived discrimination on minority acculturation preferences in a multicultural region.

T1  - The Diffusion of Tolerance: Birth Cohort Changes in the Effects of Education and Income on Political Tolerance
AN  - 1972210515
AB  - Political tolerance--the willingness to extend civil liberties to traditionally stigmatized groups--is pivotal to the functioning of democracy and the well-being of members of stigmatized groups. Although political tolerance has traditionally been more common among American elites, we argue that as tolerance has increased, it has also diffused to less educated and less affluent segments of the population. The relative stability of political attitudes over the life course and the socialization of more recent birth cohorts in contexts of increased tolerance suggest that this diffusion of tolerance occurs across birth cohorts rather than time periods. Using age-period-cohort models and more than three and a half decades of repeated cross-sectional survey data, we find persistent and robust across-cohort declines in the importance of both income and higher education in determining levels of political tolerance. Declines in the effects of socioeconomic status are evident with tolerance toward all five out-groups in the analysis--anti-religionists, gays and lesbians, communists, militarists, and racists--but to varying degrees. These findings fit with a model of changes in public opinion, particularly views of civil and political rights, through processes of cultural diffusion and cohort replacement.

T1  - It ain't easy eating greens: Evidence of bias toward vegetarians and vegans from both source and target: GPIR
AN  - 1943424510
AB  - Vegetarianism and veganism are increasingly prevalent in Western countries, yet anecdotal expressions of negativity toward vegetarians and vegans are common. We empirically tested whether bias exists toward vegetarians and vegans. In Study 1 omnivores evaluated vegetarians and vegans equivalently or more negatively than several common prejudice target groups (e.g., Blacks). Bias was heightened among those higher in right-wing ideologies, explained by heightened perceptions of vegetarian/vegan threat. Vegans (vs. vegetarians) and male (vs. female) vegetarians/vegans were evaluated more negatively overall. In Study 2 omnivores evaluated vegetarians and vegans more negatively than several nutritional outgroups (e.g., gluten intolerants) and evaluated vegan/vegetarians motivated by animal rights or environmental concerns (vs. health) especially negatively. In Study 3, vegetarians and especially vegans reported experiencing negativity stemming from their diets. Empirically documenting antivegetarian/vegan bias adds to a growing literature finding bias toward benign yet social norm-challenging others.

T1  - Owning Immigration: Messenger Ethnicity, Issue Ownership, and Support for Latino Candidates
AN  - 1949143670
AB  - The public opinion literature stresses the importance of source cues in determining which types of messages affect attitudes and which types do not. Building upon such research, we seek to determine if messenger ethnicity influences how individuals evaluate candidates speaking on immigration in the context of a campaign. Do Americans (and Anglo Americans in particular) view Latino candidates as more experienced, stronger leaders, more trustworthy, and more qualified on immigration than Anglo candidates? Moreover, do such relationships hold regardless of the valence of the message itself? Through an original survey experiment presenting subjects with immigration talk on the campaign trail, we find Latino candidates are reviewed more positively than Anglo candidates when it comes to the immigration messages they speak (especially when it comes to pro-immigration messages). Such findings give us insight into whether or not Latino candidates have the potential to "own" the issue of immigration, as well as offering another path by which Latino candidates can gain a strong foothold with the public in the context of a campaign.

T1  - The facial width-to-height ratio determines interpersonal distance preferences in the observer
AN  - 1930378905
AB  - Facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) is correlated with a number of aspects of aggressive behavior in men. Observers appear to be able to assess aggressiveness from male fWHR, but implications for interpersonal distance preferences have not yet been determined. This study utilized a novel computerized stop-distance task to examine interpersonal space preferences of female participants who envisioned being approached by a man; men's faces photographed posed in neutral facial expressions were shown in increasing size to mimic approach. We explored the effect of the men's fWHR, their behavioral aggression (measured previously in a computer game), and women's ratings of the men's aggressiveness, attractiveness, and masculinity on the preferred interpersonal distance of 52 German women. Hierarchical linear modelling confirmed the relationship between the fWHR and trait judgements (ratings of aggressiveness, attractiveness, and masculinity). There were effects of fWHR and actual aggression on the preferred interpersonal distance, even when controlling statistically for men's and the participants' age. Ratings of attractiveness, however, was the most influential variable predicting preferred interpersonal distance. Our results extend earlier findings on fWHR as a cue of aggressiveness in men by demonstrating implications for social interaction. In conclusion, women are able to accurately detect aggressiveness in emotionally neutral facial expressions, and adapt their social distance preferences accordingly.

T1  - Implementing media literacy training for social work programs at HBCUs: A literary analysis of barriers and opportunities
AN  - 1900934280
AB  - The image of the social work profession in the media is problematic for many reasons. Social work and its practitioners are often depicted as incompetent, ineffective, and unnecessary. Despite the necessity of the services provided to the public by social workers, public opinion of the profession remains low. To reverse the current trend, social work programs, particularly those at historically Black colleges and universities, can begin to provide media literacy training and media awareness within the curriculum to assist future social workers in stemming the tide of negative coverage and portrayals of the profession in the media. Using the media diffusion of information theory as an overview, this literary analysis provides a historical view of the profession and highlights current trends in social work practice, education, and media training.

AB  - This study applies the contact hypothesis to computer-mediated communication (CMC) and examines whether intergroup computer-mediated contact can facilitate relationships between conflicting groups. The effectiveness of different CMC modes, text-based and video-based, in Improving interpersonal and Intergroup attitudes was compared. The results from an experiment indicated that video-based CMC exerted greater Influence in improving participants' attitudes towards a targeted outgroup member when compared to text-based CMC. However, text-based CMC produced a stronger effect than video-based CMC in improving one's attitudes towards the outgroup as a whole.

T1  - County-level racial prejudice and the black-white gap in infant health outcomes
AN  - 1914203497
AB  - Objective: Black mothers are 60 percent more likely than white mothers to have preterm births and twice as likely to have a baby with low birth weight. We examine whether these black-white gaps in birth outcomes are larger in counties with higher levels of racial prejudice. Method: We use data from the restricted-use natality files in the United States, which provide information on birth weight, gestation, and maternal characteristics for over 31 million births from 2002 to 2012, combined with county-level data measures of both explicit and implicit racial prejudice from Project Implicit from over a million individuals who took the Implicit Association Test during this same period. We compare counties that are one standard deviation above the mean (high prejudice) with those that are one standard deviation below the mean (low prejudice) in terms of their average level of racial prejudice. Results: The black-white gap in low birth weight is 14 percent larger in counties with high implicit racial prejudice compared to counties with low prejudice. The black-white gap in preterm births is 29 percent larger in the high prejudice counties. The gaps are even larger when we use explicit measures of racial prejudice with high prejudice counties having a black-white gap that is 22 percent larger for low birth weight and 36 percent larger for preterm births. These relationships do not appear to be biased by the way the prejudice sample is constructed, since the racial gap in birth outcomes is unrelated to other county-level biases such as those based on gender or sexual orientation. Conclusion: The black-white gap in United States' birth outcomes is larger in those counties that have the highest levels of racial prejudice. This is true for both implicit and explicit racial prejudice, though the strength of the relationship is strongest for explicit racial prejudice.

T1  - Between Breivik and PEGIDA: the absence of ideologues and leaders on the contemporary European far right
AN  - 1883150738
AB  - In the aftermath of the Norwegian terror attacks of 22 July 2011, the question of agency with regard to the convicted perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, has frequently been discussed. Did he really act on his own? Were his actions self-directed? Was he, as a typical 'lone wolf', inspired by the prevalent far-right concept of 'leaderless resistance' or, simply, a blind tool, a string puppet pushed and pulled by dark forces, as some commentators have claimed? His cut-and-paste manifesto points to inspiration from ideas circulating in the European Counter Jihad Movement (ECJM), in itself a contradictory mix of ideological positions. A number of these ideas were given new life when the so-called 'populist right-wing movement of indignation', the Patriotische Europäer Gegen die Islamisierung des Abendlandes (PEGIDA) took to the streets of Dresden in the autumn of 2014. The driving force behind PEGIDA, Lutz Bachmann, with a past as petty criminal and doorman, is an unlikely front man for one of the most successful political initiatives in post-unification Germany. Comparing Breivik and PEGIDA, Önnerfors argues that the ECJM is part of the 'third generation' of right-wing discourse that is without a consistent world view, dominant leaders and prolific ideologues. Instead, in a new atmosphere of 'politics of passion' and 'post-politics', fuzzy ECJM ideology turns into a screen upon which diffuse uneasiness with current political affairs can be projected and channelled. Outside the scope of Önnerfors's article but worth noting is the considerable impact these developments have had on electoral support for right-wing populist parties such as the Front National in France, the Alternative für Deutschland in Germany and the Sverigedemokraterna in Sweden.

T1  - The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS): Establishing a New Interdisciplinary Self-Assessment for Health Providers
AN  - 1914571091
AB  - These three studies provide initial evidence for the development, factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS), a new interdisciplinary LGBT clinical self-assessment for health and mental health providers. Research participants were voluntarily recruited in the United States and United Kingdom and included trainees, clinicians, and educators from applied psychology, counseling, psychotherapy, and primary care medicine. Study 1 (N = 602) used exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic techniques, revealing an 18-item three-factor structure (Clinical Preparedness, Attitudinal Awareness, and Basic Knowledge). Study 2 established internal consistency for the overall LGBT-DOCSS (α = .86) and for each of the three subscales (Clinical Preparedness = .88, Attitudinal Awareness = .80, and Basic Knowledge = .83) and 2-week test-retest reliability (.87). In study 3 (N = 564), participant criteria (sexual orientation and education level) and four established scales that measured LGBT prejudice, assessment skills, and social desirability were used to support initial content and discriminant validity. Psychometric properties, limitations, and recommendations are discussed.

T1  - Underreporting Discrimination Among Arab American and Muslim American Community College Students: Using Focus Groups to Unravel the Ambiguities Within the Survey Data
AN  - 1875133918
AB  - Using a mixed methods approach, the researcher gathered a set of narrative responses from focus groups that supported the claim of underreporting campus discrimination on a survey. Multiple studies have shown that underrepresented minority students are likely to bond with same-ethnic peers in a racially tense campus climate. This mixed method is a follow-up investigation into, why, in a post-9/11 environment, Arab and Muslim American community college students demonstrated less variation in the level of perceived discrimination in relationship to the percentage of same-ethnic and/or same-faith campus friendship groups. Post hoc comparisons revealed that Arab and Muslim students exhibited significantly higher mean scores on a perceived discrimination scale than other ethnic groups.

T1  - The Nouvelle Droite in Portugal: a new strategy for the radical right in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy
AN  - 1807164657
AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

T1  - W E B DuBois on the history of empirical social research
AN  - 1789067596
AB  - This review of The Scholar Denied by Aldon D. Morris emphasizes the importance of DuBois for the start of American empirical social research. A.D. Morris correctly shows why W.E.B. DuBois was rejected, forgotten and suppressed by white sociologists for almost 100 years. Racial prejudices and scientific racism among American sociological elites prevented both Du Bois and his work from receiving the attention they rightly deserve. But my paper accentuates the role of Du Bois in the development of sociology as an empirical social science discipline. He created and published a programme of research on the African-American population. Publishing 'The Philadelphia Negro', he provided an excellent example of how to do such research. He also headed the first school of sociology on the American continent at the Atlanta University from 1898 to 1910.

T1  - 'If I climb a wall of ten meters': capoeira, parkour and the politics of public space among (post)migrant youth in Turin, Italy
AN  - 1786265026
AB  - Rather than being seen as citizens, the children of immigrants are portrayed as a population to be controlled and contained across Europe. In Italy today, debates about cultural 'authenticity' and renewed nationalism accompany waves of moral panic that depict a country under siege by illegal and unwanted immigrants. Specifically in cities, immigrants and their children are imagined and portrayed as alien and out of place. Drawing on fourteen months of ethnographic research in Turin, Italy, with children of immigrants aged between 16 and 21, De Martini Ugolotti and Moyer illustrate how these youth make use of their bodies through capoeira and parkour practices to contest and reappropriate public spaces, thereby challenging dominant visions about what constitutes the public, how it should be used and by whom. They analyse the 'body in place' to understand how the children of immigrants navigate unequal spatial relations and challenge dominant regimes of representation, while also attempting to improve their life conditions and reach their personal goals.

T1  - A Matter of Psychological Safety: Commitment and Mental Health in Turkish Immigrant Employees in Germany
AN  - 1786179585
AB  - Immigration entails the risk of feeling disconnected in the receiving society, in both everyday life and the workplace. This may affect the way immigrant employees relate to their job and their workplace. In this article, we investigate the affective commitment of Turkish immigrant employees in Germany (TG) and their subsequent work engagement, mental health, and turnover intention. Specifically, we compared TG (n = 201) to both German employees in Germany (GG; n = 1,406) and Turkish employees in Turkey (TT; n = 362). Our results show that the effect of immigration background on mental health, work engagement, and turnover through affective commitment depends on the level of perceived psychological safety at the workplace, specifically in terms of an open and inclusive work climate. The results suggest that psychological safety is particularly helpful in enhancing immigrant employees' positive attitudes toward the workplace. Our study provides new insights on the well-being of immigrant employees, specifically TG, and the different needs of diverse workforces. Given our findings, future studies should explore more deeply the positive influences that psychological safety has on minority groups and their workplace attitudes.

T1  - Service Delivery Considerations in Dealing with Honour-based Violence
AN  - 1880692334
AB  - This study examines honour-based violence (HBV) towards young women from immigrant families from a variety of standpoints. Interviews with service providers and women affected by HBV reveal that young women in Winnipeg experience emotional abuse and control; financial abuse and perceived exploitation; physical violence and forced marriages. The abuse takes a serious toll on the emotional well-being of young women. We learn that the violation of family honour is one of various factors that lead to family conflict and violence. Other causes of violence include intergenerational conflict, patriarchal norms, settlement stressors, overcrowded living conditions and the precarious mental health of parents and guardians. Young women affected by HBV face multiple and intersecting barriers that prevent them from seeking help, particularly fear of being rejected and isolated by their families and communities if they reveal the violence to others. Recommendations made by women affected and by service providers include access to a safe and welcoming environment including service providers who will respect them, understand their situations, and effectively help them to seek culturally and age appropriate services. Furthermore, family members need assistance on how to parent and discipline their children in a Canadian context.Alternate abstract:La présente étude a examiné les soi-disant violences fondées sur l’honneur envers les jeunesfemmes issues des familles immigrantes de divers points de vue. Les entrevues avec les pourvoyeursde services et les femmes affectées par les violences fondées sur l’honneur ont révélé queles jeunes femmes de Winnipeg subissent les abus et contrôles émotionnels ; les abus financierset exploitations considérées ; les violences physiques et les mariages forcés. Ces abus posent ungrave préjudice au bien-être émotionnel des jeunes femmes. Nous avions noté que la violation del’honneur familial est l’un des facteurs qui mènent à la violence et aux conflits familiaux. D’autrescauses se fondent sur les conflits intergénérationnels, les normes patriarcales, les facteurs destress liés à l’établissement, les conditions de vie très difficiles et la précarité mentale des parentset tuteurs. Les jeunes femmes affectées par les violences fondées sur l’honneur font face à desmultiples barrières discriminatoires qui les empêchent de demander de l’aide, particulièrement lapeur d’être rejetées et isolées par leurs familles et leurs communautés, si jamais les violencesqu’elles subissent sont révélées aux autres. Les recommandations faites par les femmes victimeset les fournisseurs de services incluent l’accès à un environnement accueillant et sans danger, pouvantfournir un service de respect, qui comprenne leur situation et qui les aides efficacement àtrouver les services culturels d’âges appropriés. De plus, les membres des familles ont besoin d’assistancesur la manière dont les parents doivent discipliner leurs enfants en contexte canadien.

T1  - Discrimination and Potential Housemates with Mental or Substance Abuse Problems
AN  - 1752001383
AB  - The rationale for this study was to contribute to the surprising paucity of research on the topic of shared housing among young adults and particularly the explanations and justifications involved in selecting new flatmates. The study aimed to develop greater understanding of the required discrimination involved in choosing acceptable people for the intimacy of shared living, which conflicts with current taboos against openly discussing prejudice. Data were drawn from interviews with experienced house sharers in New Zealand, recently involved in the selection of new housemates. The analysis examines how people with mental or substance abuse problems are discursively constructed as acceptable or unsuitable. Stigma, stereotyping, and discrimination were evident but rejection was framed in terms of safety, economic concerns, social harmony, and past bad experiences. Mental illness was acceptable providing it was unproblematic and invisible. While recreational soft drug use was condoned, hard drugs and frequent use were not.

T1  - The Minstrel Legacy: African American English and the Historical Construction of "Black" Identities in Entertainment
AN  - 1929870302
AB  - Linguists have long been aware that the language scripted for "ethnic" roles in the media has been manipulated for a variety of purposes ranging from the construction of character "authenticity" to flagrant ridicule. This paper provides a brief overview of the history of African American roles in the entertainment industry from minstrel shows to present-day films. I am particularly interested in looking at the practice of distorting African American English as an historical artifact which is commonplace in the entertainment industry today. Dialogue which is clearly meant as an imitation of African American English still results in the construction of an ethnic stereotype that serves as a reflection of European American attitudes regarding African Americans. As a result, such depictions provide non-Black acculturated people with a perception of Blackness that is founded in inaccuracies and derision but has been portrayed as authentic, leaving Black life open to continual mimicry.

T1  - Dual Identification and the (De-)Politicization of Migrants: Longitudinal and Comparative Evidence
AN  - 1728660158; 201533984
AB  - The article examines the role of dual identification with both the ethnocultural ingroup and the society of residence in the politicization of migrants. The researchers employed a longitudinal and comparative research design with members of the two largest, but sociologically very different, migrant groups in Germany as research participants (i.e. Turkish migrants and Russian migrants). In line with prior work that has shown that, among members of aggrieved groups, dual identity functions as a politicized collective identity, we found that dual identification fostered political engagement among Turkish migrants. In contrast, Russian migrants reported no substantial grievances, and dual identification negatively affected their subsequent political engagement. The contributions of these findings to an articulation of research on politicization with research on intergroup conflict and a more comprehensive understanding of political phenomena driven by dual identification are discussed.

T1  - Contact Theory in a Small-Town Settler-Colonial Context: The Reproduction of Laissez-Faire Racism in Indigenous-White Canadian Relations
AN  - 1654737239
AB  - This article builds on group position theory and the subcategorization model of intergroup contact by illustrating how, in a small-town settler-colonial context, contact tends to reproduce, rather than challenge, the inequitable racial structure. In Northwestern Ontario, Indigenous-settler relations are characterized by widespread intergroup marriage and friendship as well as pervasive prejudice and discrimination. Using 18 months of fieldwork and 160 interviews and surveys with First Nations, Metis, and non-Indigenous residents, I show that although contact is associated with less "old-fashioned" prejudice (i.e., overt categorical hostility), it does not necessarily eliminate whites' superior sense of group position. Even white individuals who have close Indigenous friends or spouses often express laissez-faire racism. Three mutually reinforcing social processes -- subtyping, ideology-based homophily, and political avoidance norms -- interact to sustain whites' sense of group superiority and justifications for racial inequity. These processes are facilitated by historical and structural conditions, in this case colonization and small-town dynamics.

T1  - The limits of analogy: comparing Islamophobia and antisemitism
AN  - 1680154867; 201513979
AB  - The predicament faced by Muslims today, either in the United Kingdom specifically or in the West more generally, is often compared with the predicament faced by Jews at some point in the past. Muslims, it is suggested, are the new Jews. Klug's article homes in on one element in this view, the claim that Islamophobia is the new antisemitism, and considers the analogy between them. An introductory section sketches the political context, after which Klug focuses on logical or conceptual issues. The two middle sections contain the core of the analysis: consideration of the two terms 'antisemitism' and 'Islamophobia' in relation to the concepts they denote, followed by an examination of the concepts as such. Certain conclusions are drawn about both their general logic and their specific logics. The final section returns to the political context and, via critique of a thesis put forward by Matti Bunzl, discusses the uses of the analogy. Klug argues that the question we need to ask is not 'Are Islamophobia and antisemitism analogous?' but 'What is the analogy worth?' The value of the analogy lies in the light it sheds on the social and political realities that confront us in the here and now. Does it illuminate more than it obscures? These things are a matter of judgement. Klug leans towards asserting an analogy between antisemitism in the past and Islamophobia in the present, within limits. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Measuring Nonverbal Bias Through Body Language Responses to Stereotypes
AN  - 1680152544; 201514009
AB  - Although research has demonstrated the manifestation of racial bias by measuring overt attitudes and behaviors, there has been little examination of the subtle nonverbal cues that may also characterize such bias. The present study investigates implicit racial bias by analyzing nonverbal behaviors of individuals shown video of a criminal suspect whose ethnic identity is manipulated to be Black or White. Participants appeared significantly more uncertain about what they were saying when describing the White suspect than when describing the Black suspect. Participants were also more likely to display 'open' posture when describing the Black suspect but 'closed' posture (e.g., crossed arms) when describing the White suspect. The results indicate that biases in attitudes and beliefs might be reliably detected and measured through body language. The findings are discussed in terms of how nonverbal behaviors may reveal more subtle forms of prejudice and miscommunication. Contextual correlations between specific nonverbal behaviors and affective states are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify the strategies used by young homosexuals to manage their sexual minority status in Turkey. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 self-identified homosexual university students. The data on the strategies employed by homosexuals suggested a categorization of these strategies into four interrelated areas: strategies employed in the process of self-acceptance; strategies to manage sexual stigma and prejudice; strategies specific to the coming-out process; and the strategies used while openly expressing their sexual identities.

T1  - Second-hand drinking may increase support for alcohol policies: New results from the 2010 National Alcohol Survey
AN  - 1692289386; 201522169
AB  - Introduction and Aims The harms of second-hand smoke motivated tobacco control legislation. Documenting the effects of harms from others' drinking might increase popular and political will for enacting alcohol policies. We investigated the individual-level relationship between having experienced such harms and favouring alcohol policy measures, adjusting for other influences. Design and Methods We used the landline sample (n = 6957) of the 2010 National Alcohol Survey, a computer-assisted telephone interview survey based on a random household sample in the USA. Multivariable regression models adjusted for personal characteristics, including drinking pattern (volume and heavy drinking), were used to investigate the ability of six harms from others' drinking to predict a three-item measure of favour for stronger alcohol policies. Results Adjusting for demographics and drinking pattern, number of harms from others' drinking predicted support for alcohol policies (P < 0.001). In a similar model, family- and aggression-related harms, riding with a drink driver and being concerned about another's drinking all significantly influenced favour for stronger alcohol policy. Discussion Although cross-sectional data cannot prove a causal influence or directionality, the association found is consistent with the hypothesis that experiencing harms from others' drinking (experienced by a majority) makes one more likely to favour alcohol policies. Other things equal, women, racial/ethnic minorities, lower-income individuals and lighter drinkers tend to be more supportive of alcohol controls and policies. Conclusions Studies that estimate the impact of harms from other drinkers on those victimised are important and now beginning. Next we need to learn how such information could affect decision makers and legislators. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Arab invasion' and decline, or the import of European racial thought by Iranian nationalists
AN  - 1559007176; 201432040
AB  - Historical research on western racial theories has grown exponentially in the past few years. A number of scholars have also investigated various cases of ethnic prejudice beyond the western pale, for instance against Koreans in Japan or Muslims in India. Yet, little attention has been given to the modalities in which European nineteenth-century racial thought was adopted in other parts of the world. This article attempts to broach a discussion on this under-analysed aspect of race studies by reviewing one case, that of Arab-hatred in modern Iran. I argue that the intense hatred of Arabs in Iranian nationalist texts derives from a racialized vision of Iranian history born in nineteenth-century European texts. Racialized historiography was selectively imported by the ideologues of Iranian nationalism as it allowed them to explain Iran's weakness in terms of a loss of racial purity.

T1  - Suspect technologies: forensic testing of asylum seekers at the UK border
AN  - 1551001980; 201429127
AB  - The entanglement of border control technologies and immigration policies and practices with discourses of race, national identity and belonging has long been a focus of scholarly interest. In this paper we discuss the Human Provenance Pilot Project (HPPP), the aim of which was to evaluate the utility of genetic and isotope testing to corroborate asylum seekers' accounts of their nationality. We subject the HPPP to a detailed socio-technical analysis, highlighting how technologies, practices and modes of thought travelled from the policing context to the asylum context, illuminating the unspoken prejudices that made that transfer possible, and reflecting on implications of the HPPP for academic research, policy advice and the asylum system.

T1  - Peer Group Rejection in Childhood: Effects of Rejection Ambiguity, Rejection Sensitivity, and Social Acumen
AN  - 1559006392; 201433430
AB  - This study examined the reactions of 6 to 12 year old children (N = 144) to in-group members who accepted or rejected them, and assessed whether their reactions were influenced by their rejection sensitivity (RS) and social acumen (SA). After completing measures of RS and SA, children participated in an intergroup simulation in which they were accepted or unambiguously versus ambiguously rejected by their group. Findings indicated that whereas ambiguously rejected children understood that they had been rejected, they nevertheless retained greater in-group identification and more positive attitudes than the rejected children, although less than the accepted children. However, as with rejected participants, ambiguously rejected children still opted to change groups whereas accepted children did not. SA children liked the in-group less, whereas those with SA liked the in-group more. Discussion focused on children's selection of peer groups, as well as the effects of their rejection from them.

T1  - A meta-analytic test of the imagined contact hypothesis
AN  - 1512219580; 201408606
AB  - Imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) is a new indirect contact strategy for promoting tolerance and more positive intergroup relations. Despite its relatively recent inception, there have now been over 70 studies showing that imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member can reduce prejudice and encourage positive intergroup behavior. With this meta-analysis, we provide the first quantitative review of imagined contact effects on four key measures of intergroup bias: attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behavior. We also test for moderators arising from both group and study design characteristics. The analysis found that imagined contact resulted in significantly reduced intergroup bias across all four dependent variables (overall d+ = 0.35). The effect was significant for both published and unpublished studies, and emerged across a broad range of target outgroups and contexts. The effect was equally strong for explicit and implicit attitude measures, but was stronger on behavioral intentions than on attitudes, supporting the direct link between imagery and action proposedly underlying mental simulation effects. Most design characteristics had no significant impact, including valence of the imagined interaction, type of control condition, and time spent imagining contact. However, the more participants were instructed to elaborate on the context within which the imagined interaction took place, the stronger the effect. The imagined contact effect was also stronger for children than for adults, supporting the proposition that imagined contact is a potentially key component of educational strategies aiming to promote positive social change.

T1  - 'Gypsy music' as music of the Other in European culture
AN  - 1494751030; 201402123
AB  - So-called 'Gypsy music' -- music associated with the Romani people -- was perceived within European culture in two different ways: as able to be assimilated and as not able to be assimilated. The first involved the incorporation of Gypsy music into the construction of the national music of certain countries, becoming thus part and parcel of the national culture. The second occurred where discrimination against Roma included their 'exoticization' and 'racialization'. The former, the national perspective, is discussed by Piotrowska in the case of Hungary. The process of constructing national identity in Hungary -- stimulated by political aspirations to differentiate the country within the Habsburg Empire -- took a radical form in the early nineteenth century, leading to the manufacture of national symbols such as folk costumes, cuisine and music. And it was Gypsy music that served an emblematic role in that context, due also to the success of Franz Liszt's 1859 book Des Bohemiens et de leur musique en Hongrie. At the same time, and later, however, Gypsy music was defined as music composed by Hungarians but merely adopted and played by Hungarian Romani musicians. This view was fervently propagated by, among others, Bela Bartok. The discrimination against Gypsy music included presenting it as something belonging to an ostracized, exoticized and racialized Other rather than welcomed one. The balance between the assimilationist and non-assimilationist perspectives on Gypsy music reveals the broader European phenomenon of a combination of fear and fascination with regard to Romani culture. Music by the Other is both admired and despised, longed for and rejected, but never viewed indifferently. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reconsidering predictors of punitiveness in Australia: A test of four theories
AN  - 1559007437; 201434086
AB  - This study assesses and compares, in an Australian context, four explanations which have emerged to explain punitive attitudes. Each purports these attitudes have different origins: concerns over crime and a lack of trust in the state to deal with it ('crime-distrust' model); a desire to reinforce social cohesion or express discontent with society ('social discontent' model); an outlet for dissatisfaction over one's own life ('personal discontent' model); and a wish to suppress or express prejudice towards disliked racial minorities ('racial animus' model). The study finds support for each of the crime-distrust, social discontent and racial animus models (but not the personal discontent model). Despite rarely being considered in Australia, it also suggest that social discontent and racial animus may have as great, if not greater, an impact on punitiveness as concerns over crime and the state's response to it.

T1  - Comment on Feagin and Elias
AN  - 1438561064; 201340225
AB  - Despite the centrality and significance that race continues to hold in shaping social life in the USA, theoretical analyses of race are surprisingly few and far between in sociology. Researchers have moved from models grounded in analyses of prejudice towards theoretical paradigms designed to focus more explicitly on the ways that race and racism are built into the social structure of US society. Omi and Winant's (1994) racial formation theory has long been regarded as a classic in this regard, and one of the most important foundational paradigms for making sense of contemporary race relations. Joe Feagin and Sean Elias have developed an interesting and pointed commentary of this theory, and provide useful points for critique and contention. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Tiger Moms and Liberal Elephants: Private, Supplemental Education among Korean-Americans
AN  - 1438561006; 201340296
AB  - This article discusses the transnational industry of private, supplemental education (PSE) among ethnic Koreans, especially in Southern California. PSE offers a unique vantage point to examine the educational struggles and values of students, parents and teachers. A "Tiger Mom" educational culture reflects the extreme competition for elite, educational credentials, which can foster academic cheating and racial prejudices among Korean-Americans. In response, a growing number of educators, parents and students espouse more traditional, liberal-humanistic values of developing individual interests and talents and of mutual respect among diverse persons. This "Liberal Elephant" culture receives significant support from some members of actively proselytizing, Christian churches. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Determinants of the Number of White Supremacist Groups: A Pooled Time-Series Analysis
AN  - 1347782327; 201318719
AB  - What social and political conditions help explain the number of white supremacist groups? This study uses pooled time-series cross-sectional methods to assess the explanatory power of three racial threat accounts. First, since lynchings indicated intense animosity against blacks that may persist, anti-black hate groups should be especially numerous where lynching rates were substantial in the distant past. Second, where or when white political and cultural dominance is threatened by large or growing black populations, additional white supremacist groups should be present. And third, these anti-black movements often recruit by emphasizing the links between race and violent street crime. Since the public mistakenly believes that most violent crimes are committed by blacks who victimize whites, larger numbers of hate groups should be present where murder rates are most substantial. With other theoretically plausible determinants such as unemployment and college completion rates held constant, the results confirm these three threat theory predictions.

T1  - African American Women And Self-Esteem: The Various Sources
AN  - 1429629485; 201335690
AB  - As a result of prejudice and discrimination, African American women are likely to experience adversity. We examined possible sources of self-esteem among 16 African American Women utilizing a mixed design (i.e., quantitative and qualitative). Quantitative data was gathered through objective measures (i.e., Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, Reflected Appraisal Scale, Revised African American Identity Scale, Womanist Identity Attitude Scale, and Feminist Identity Scale). Qualitative data was obtained through an unstructured interview. Results indicated that religion, specifically, having a good relationship with God influenced self-esteem. Family closeness related to self-esteem and role models enhanced identity development as well as self-esteem. Based on these findings, socialization factors may assist in maintaining self-esteem in dealing with adversity for African American women. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1417524600; 201331884
AB  - In line with Dixon et al.'s argument, I contend that prejudice should be understood in broadly political rather than in narrowly psychological terms. First, what counts as prejudice is a political judgement. Second, studies of collective action demonstrate that it is in "political" struggles, where subordinate groups together oppose dominant groups, that prejudice can be overcome.

AB  - I argue that Dixon et al. fail to maintain a careful distinction between the negative evaluation definition of "prejudice" and the implications of this definition for correcting the social ills that prejudice engenders. I also argue that they adduce little evidence to suggest that if prejudice were diminished, commensurate reductions in discrimination would not follow. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Abortion, Partial-Birth Abortion, and Adolescent Access to Abortion: An Overview for Social Workers
AN  - 1494299856; 201401862
AB  - Although the U.S Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion in 1973, intense controversy over access, legality, and morality has persisted ever since that landmark decision. National opinion data collected from 1975 to 2007 show that a majority of Americans support a woman's right to an abortion, but this right is increasingly under attack, and recent proposed changes to abortion access are not in line with how most Americans feel. This paper considers public opinion trends in the sharply divided arenas of abortion, partial-birth abortion, and adolescents' rights to access abortion with a critical eye to social work practice. We explore several opportunities for social workers to advocate for clients, including legislative advocacy, reform through litigation, social action, and social policy analysis.

T1  - Unmasking the 'muscle Jew': the Jewish soldier in British war service, 1899-1945
AN  - 1283644056; 201303449
AB  - Constructions of Jews in twentieth-century Europe have been riddled throughout with inconsistencies and contradictions. However, some themes have been surprisingly persistent, none more so than constructions of Jews as weak, effeminate and cowardly. Schaffer looks at one significant set of responses to such characterizations, specifically at the rise of the 'muscle Jew' in Jewish and non-Jewish thinking. After the term was coined by Max Nordau at the turn of the twentieth century, the idea of the 'muscle Jew' came to represent a dominant current of Jewish identity reformulation. More recently, a series of scholars have come to understand the idea as a manifestation of Zionist ideology, a statement of a nationalist desire for Jewish reinvention in the face of endemic European antisemitism. By using the example of British Jewish service in the Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War, Schaffer argues rather that the idea of the 'muscle Jew' can be better understood as a reflection of Jewish desire for European integration, an attempt to present Jewish soldiers as equal to their non-Jewish equivalents. Moreover, he contends that the 'muscle Jew' needs to be understood as an idea rooted in the longue duree of Jewish history, one that represents only one strand of Jewish self-imagining.

T1  - DISCOURSES ON ANTISEMITISM AND ISLAMOPHOBIA IN ARAB MEDIA
AN  - 1551002041; 201429144
AB  - This paper discusses the relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia, focusing on debates in Arab newspapers in the wake of the Second Intifada and 9/11 and then in response to two issues of contention for Muslim communities in Europe, the Danish cartoon crisis in 2006 and the Swiss referendum on building minarets in 2009. The paper relates these debates to major UN and EU resolutions for combating racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism. The aim of this paper is to explore how far discussion of antisemitism and Islamophobia in the Arab world is dominated by those who see Islamophobia as the real danger in today's Europe and antisemitism as a Zionist ploy, and how far antisemitism and Islamophobia have become two competing terms relating to two communities that perceive themselves as victims of prejudice and racism and also of each other. The paper seeks to qualify this image. It acknowledges that the entanglement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict adds a political aspect to the discussion of the two terms, intensifies competition between them for recognition as unique forms of racism and discrimination, and curtails the creation of positive ground for dialogue. However, it also demonstrates the presence of other voices which are more open to addressing both forms of exclusion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A COMMON CAUSE: Reconnecting the study of racism and antisemitism
AN  - 1551001577; 201428919
AB  - This paper explores connections and disconnections in the study of racism and antisemitism within sociological inquiry. It begins with an exposition of how certain prominent theorists of racism and antisemitism (e.g., Du Bois, Fanon, Arendt) have in the past identified important connections between these fields of exclusion and persecution in the making of European modernity. While their analysis of connections between racism and antisemitism may have been uneven and provisional, the more recent tendency to replace such connectivity with separatist or even oppositional readings has been a step backward. This tendency toward what we call 'methodological separatism' impoverishes our sociological imagination for a number of reasons. First, it neglects the extent to which prejudice and persecution in relation to Muslims, Jews and Black people are connected phenomena in the formation of European modernity. Second, it encourages divisive and competitive analytical approaches which lock their protagonists in rival camps and reproduce aspects of the language of racism they oppose. While affirming the distinctive characteristics of anti-Black and anti-Jewish racisms, we argue that the development of a more integrated approach is required to enable our understanding of how modernity continues to operate.

T1  - Secrets in Romantic Relationships: Does Sexual Orientation Matter?
AN  - 1551001696; 201428945
AB  - Analysis of data from a 50-item survey on 'Secrets in Romantic Relationships' completed by 431 respondents (primarily attending a large southeastern university) revealed that more than 60% reported ever having kept a personal secret in a romantic relationship and one-fourth were currently doing so. Findings included that homosexuals were more willing to keep significantly (p <.01) more secrets than heterosexuals. The suggested explanation is that homosexuals live in a heterosexist context, which encourages regular deception by hiding their sexual orientation to avoid prejudice and discrimination (the phrase 'in the closet' means 'keeping a secret'). Homosexuals may keep a secret from a romantic partner more often because they have a pattern of keeping secrets. Other significant findings included that females, spouses, and blacks kept more secrets than males, dating partners, and whites. Implications and limitations are suggested.

T1  - Discrimination, acculturation, acculturative stress, and Latino psychological distress: A moderated mediational model
AN  - 1622296985; 201438318
AB  - Prior research has found that perceived discrimination is associated with adverse mental health outcomes among Latinos. However, the process by which this relationship occurs remains an understudied area. The present study investigated the role of acculturative stress in underlying the relationship between perceived discrimination and Latino psychological distress. Also examined was the ability of acculturation to serve as a moderator between perceived discrimination and acculturative stress. Among a sample of Latino adults (N = 669), moderated mediational analyses revealed that acculturative stress mediated the perceived discrimination-psychological distress relationship, and that the link between perceived discrimination and acculturative stress was moderated by Anglo behavioral orientation but not Latino behavioral orientation. The findings are discussed within a stress and coping perspective that identifies the psychological consequences associated with perceived discrimination and acculturative stress.

AN  - 1438549899; 201340076
AB  - We investigated the risk and debt behaviors of adult consumers in China (N = 347), and explored the relationships among risk perception, risk preference, and consumer debt. The results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that risk perception, risk seeking, and risk aversion can predict consumer debt. Individuals perceiving high levels of risk were less likely to have positive attitudes toward debt behavior, whereas individuals with high risk-seeking preferences held positive attitudes toward debt behavior. Risk aversion was also found to be an ineffective predictor of debt behavior. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Determinants of Perceived Immigrant Job Threat in the American States
AN  - 1373428727; 201328763
AB  - In the United States, the 2000s were marked by record numbers of immigrants and heightened levels of pro- and anti-immigrant agitation. As a result, research investigating anti-immigrant prejudice in the United States and other societies has surged. In this article, the authors investigate the determinants of perceived immigrant job threat in the fifty U.S. states in 2005. They draw upon three theoretical perspectives that dominate the study of prejudice -- group threat theory, contact theory, and cultural theory -- but move beyond these established theories to adduce three new perspectives, which they label economic competition, labor market deregulation, and globalization. The authors find support for all six perspectives. The three new perspectives augment, rather than supplant, the traditional theories. The authors find that levels of perceived immigrant job threat tend to increase in settings where there is economic stagnation, where labor unions are growing weaker, where the minimum wage is low, and where corporate restructuring has taken place.

T1  - Discrimination, policies, and sexual rights in Brazil
AN  - 1125217560; 201240372
AB  - This article focuses on a politics arena that has been articulated through the impact of ideals of sexual rights on Brazilian sexual politics, namely the affirmation of "LGBT rights". These rights have been constructed both through attempts to extend civil and social rights to the LGBT population that were previously restricted to heterosexuals, and by the enactment of provisions directly banning homophobic discrimination and violence. The focus will be on some of the principal social actors in this process, especially those situated in the three branches of government, since the most decisive clashes are now being waged at this level. Without intending to offer an exhaustive description of what has occurred in the Brazilian courts, Congress, and Administration, we point to the complexity of a situation which shows numerous innovations and breaks in its different dimensions, while simultaneously revealing contradictions, gaps, and ambiguities.

T1  - Perceiving Status (In)stability in a Low-Status Group: The Effects of Identification on Explicit and Implicit Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 1037886682; 201230957
AB  - We examined whether perceptions of status (in)stability moderate the effects of ingroup identification on explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. We expected that identification with Italians (low-status group) would enhance ingroup bias toward (US) Americans (high-status group) more when status was unstable rather than stable. We also predicted that the effects of identification on bias would be driven by ingroup enhancement for explicit attitudes and by both ingroup enhancement and outgroup derogation for implicit attitudes. The results revealed that identification increased explicit ingroup evaluation and ingroup bias independently from status (in)stability. However, identification increased implicit outgroup derogation only with unstable status. The results are discussed with reference to social identity theory and to the importance of considering both explicit and implicit attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The 'German nation' and the 'black Other': social Darwinism and the cultural mission in German colonial discourse
AN  - 1531933803; 201423373
AB  - The construction of the 'black Other' can perhaps best be characterized as a politically motivated pattern of argumentation in colonial discourse. It was crystallized in the reality of German colonial rule in Africa between 1884 and 1914-18. The achievement of German colonial rule in Africa was considered a task of national importance; and colonial rule could be justified by employing an image of the Other. However, this deployment of the Other should not be seen as merely a political strategy in the context of the power politics of colonization. It also brought into focus widely held racist views of the world. The history of German colonization was characterized by the use of repressive violence in the name of 'culture' and 'civilization', concepts that had their origins in the Enlightenment. This cultural-missionary project declared colonial expansion to be a type of humanitarian intervention and an educational endeavour. This was in sharp contrast to the racism, based on social Darwinism, that claimed Germany's undeniable right to acquire colonial territories as a matter of the 'survival of the fittest'.

T1  - How (not) to resurrect the body politic: the racist bias in Carl Schmitt's theory of sovereignty
AN  - 1531932712; 201423332
AB  - Carl Schmitt's 1927/1932 definition of the political domain as one based on the distinction between 'friend' and 'foe' (Freund v. Feind) has exercised political scientists, philosophers and historians to this day, not least on account of Schmitt's role before and during the Third Reich and his alleged influence on post-war German and West European political thought. In his 1938 book The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes, which built on Hobbes's version of the ancient body politic concept, Schmitt tried to underpin this distinction with a depiction of the 'political physiology' of the state. However, as his subtitle Meaning and Failure of a Political Symbol indicated, he was forced to admit that such a notion-and thus also its theoretical or practical 'resurrection' in the twentieth century-was not feasible. Musolff argues that Schmitt's friend-foe distinction, his emphatic notion of national sovereignty and his pronounced antisemitism are integral parts of a thought-system steeped in body imagery. However, rather than providing a basis for a new 'concept of the political', the state-body metaphor reveals the blind spot of Schmitt's vision of the sovereign nation state, which made it vulnerable to totalitarian interpretations.

T1  - The Contact Hypothesis and Attitudes Toward Latinos in the United States
AN  - 1283639671; 201304254
AB  - Objectives: Although the contact hypothesis occupies an important place in the study of intergroup relations, several important questions remain understudied. We contribute to the literature by examining the associations between multiple aspects of contact with Latinos and several types of attitudes toward U.S. Latinos, including attitudes toward immigration restrictions. Methods: We use OLS and logistic regression techniques to analyze the opinions of Anglo (non-Hispanic white) and African-American respondents from the 2000 NORCGeneral Social Survey (GSS), which contained a special module on attitudes regarding ethnicity and diversity issues. Results: Our findings reveal a clear association between close non-kin Latino ties, that is, friendship, and more favorable or empathetic attitudes toward Latinos as well as less restrictive or punitive views concerning immigration policy. Having Latino relatives is also linked with several of these attitudes. Most other dimensions of contact (e.g., attending high schools with significant Latino populations, having Latino acquaintances, Spanish-language fluency, and residing in areas with relatively high Latino populations) have at least some association with the attitudes under study, although for most of these contact measures the significance of the effects is inconsistent across outcomes. Conclusions: The findings reinforce the significance of intergroup friendships and underscore the importance of understanding their social origins, patterning, and consequences for diverse groups. It is also important to probe the differential effects of specific types and arenas of intergroup contact on specific attitudinal and policy outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Premigration ethnic and national identities: Jewish adolescents planning emigration from Russia and Ukraine to Israel
AN  - 914766403; 201200592
AB  - The ethnic and national identities of Jewish high-school adolescents planning emigration from Russia and Ukraine to Israel were investigated about six months before their emigration. The national identities of adolescent emigrants (n = 243) were compared with those of non-emigrant Russian and Ukrainian adolescents (n = 740). The emigrants' attitude to their country of origin was less positive and their identification with Russians and Ukrainians was weaker as compared with the non-emigrant adolescents. In addition, the attitude of the emigrants towards Israel was more positive than their attitude to Russia or Ukraine. Finally, the emigrants' strongest identification was with the Jewish people, followed by identification with Israelis, while their weakest identification was with Russians and Ukrainians. Israeli and Jewish identities of the emigrant adolescents were positively correlated, and they were independent of the Russian and Ukrainian identities. Perceived discrimination was negatively correlated with the emigrants' attitude to Russia or Ukraine, and it was positively correlated with the emigrants' identification with Israelis and with the Jewish people. Jewish ethnicity was correlated with identification with Jewish people; however, it was not correlated with any component of the Israeli or Russian/Ukrainian identities. The study results indicate that in the premigration period emigrants form a multidimensional system of ethnic and national identities, which reflects their partial detachment from their homeland and affiliation with the country of provisional immigration. This premigration identity system may be termed "anticipatory" (cf. Merton, 1968), because it is not based on real contact with the country of provisional immigration, but rather on the emigrants' expectations. On the other hand, the premigration identities are reactive, in the sense that they reflect the emigrants' reaction to the perceived discrimination they experience in their country of origin. The results of the present study are discussed in light of social identity theory. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Proactive Performance: A Context for Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1283640952; 201304269
AB  - Over the years, Allport's (1954) contact hypothesis has become the primary theoretical approach to intergroup contact, yet researchers are just now beginning to explore specific contact contexts. This article introduces proactive performance as a context for intergroup contact. Specifically, interACT, a collegiate performance troupe located at California State University, Long Beach, is used to demonstrate how proactive performance meets the requisite conditions of the contact hypothesis; i.e., promoting social change. Moreover, proactive performance is able to account for several important mediating and moderating variables in intergroup contact. With this in mind, this article is illustrative of praxis, or the intersection between theory and practice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States
AN  - 964192893; 201207511
AB  - This article presents the first large-scale audit study of discrimination against openly gay men in the United States. Pairs of fictitious resumes were sent in response to 1,769 job postings in seven states. One resume in each pair was randomly assigned experience in a gay campus organization, and the other resume was assigned a control organization. Two main findings have emerged. First, in some but not all states, there was significant discrimination against the fictitious applicants who appeared to be gay. This geographic variation in the level of discrimination appears to reflect regional differences in attitudes and antidiscrimination laws. Second, employers who emphasized the importance of stereotypically male heterosexual traits were particularly likely to discriminate against openly gay men. Beyond these particular findings, this study advances the audit literature more generally by covering multiple regions and by highlighting how audit techniques may be used to identify stereotypes that affect employment decisions in real labor markets.

T1  - Implicit Prejudicial Biases in Student Learning: The Effects of Sexual Orientation
AN  - 902084375; 201122295
AB  - In an investigation of students' potential biases toward gay and lesbian instructors, 93 female and 59 male undergraduates viewed a lecture, rated the instructor and perceived learning, and completed a lecture-retention test. Lectures were given by a man or woman, identified as straight or gay or lesbian. Sexual orientation did not affect the instructor evaluation or perceived learning ratings for any of the groups. Although sexual orientation did not affect the lecture-retention scores for the female students, learning by the male students was significantly lower with the gay male instructor than with the straight male instructor (p = .03), suggesting an implicit bias.

T1  - Race, Religion, and Beliefs about Racial Inequality
AN  - 862596418; 201109731
AB  - This article focuses on stratification beliefs and racial policy opinions among white and black Americans who differ in religious preference. First, it summarizes earlier research on white conservative Protestants and outlines characterizations of Black Protestant church congregants. It then reports patterns of stratification beliefs and racial policy opinions among blacks and whites varying in religious preference who responded to the 1996 through 2006 General Social Surveys. Comparisons across twelve race-by-religion categories did not provide persuasive evidence that white conservative Protestants are uniquely conservative in their stratification beliefs, once background characteristics are controlled, nor was the Black Protestant group distinctive. Compared to blacks, whites were less inclined to structuralist explanations of racial inequality~ slightly more inclined to individualist explanations, and consistently more negative about policies and programs to aid blacks. What is more, white Christians were more racially conservative in all these ways than non-Christian whites.

T1  - On the Meaning, Measurement, and Implications of Racial Resentment
AN  - 862595901; 201109602
AB  - A new racism, it is claimed, has become a dominant feature of contemporary American politics. According to the theory's originators, the new racism has largely replaced the old racism, which was based on the alleged biological inferiority of blacks. The new racism, referred to as "symbolic racism" or more recently, "racial resentment," by contrast, is defined as a conjunction of anti-black feelings and American moral traditionalism. According to its proponents, this new racism now structures and dominates the racial thinking of whites generally. Howard Schuman has suggested, however, that the index used to measure racial resentment may be fundamentally flawed because it may be conflated with the measurement of attitudes toward racial policies. The authors' analysis supports Schuman's suggestion. They conclude that racial resentment is not a valid measure of racism, which raises questions about the extent to which a new racism now dominates the thinking of white Americans.

T1  - Identification with a wrongful subgroup and the feeling of collective guilt
AN  - 1010631603; 201210409
AB  - The present study examined the relationship between group identification and the feeling of collective guilt. This study argued that identification with a subgroup of one's ingroup (subgroup identification) would predict the feeling of collective guilt better than identification with the whole ingroup (whole-group identification). To manipulate the level of subgroup identification, we instructed participants to imagine the presence of a close friend (vs a friend of one's close friend) in a fictitious subgroup. In Experiment 1, we predicted and found that high subgroup identifiers experienced less collective guilt compared to low subgroup identifiers, regardless of their degree of whole-group identification. In contrast, the results from Experiment 2 indicated that when the presence of the third party was made salient, high subgroup identifiers experienced more collective guilt in comparison to low subgroup identifiers. The importance of interpersonal connections for collective responsibility and the facilitating role of the third party for reconciliation of the intergroup conflicts are discussed.

T1  - Public Values, Health Inequality, and Alternative Notions of a "Fair" Response
AN  - 881469260; 201117414
AB  - The fact that disadvantaged people generally die younger and suffer more disease than those with more resources is gaining ground as a major policy concern in the United States. Yet we know little about how public values inform public opinion about policy interventions to address these disparities. This article presents findings from an exploratory study of the public's values and priorities as they relate to social inequalities in health. Forty-three subjects were presented with a scenario depicting health inequalities by social class and were given the opportunity to alter the distribution of health outcomes. Participants' responses fell into one of three distributive preferences: (1) prioritize the disadvantaged, (2) equalize health outcomes between advantaged and disadvantaged groups, and (3) equalize health resources between advantaged and disadvantaged groups. These equality preferences were reflected in participants' responses to a second, more complex scenario in which trade-offs with other health-related values -- maximizing health and prioritizing the sickest -- were introduced. In most cases, participants moderated their distributive preferences to accommodate these other health goals, particularly to prioritize the allocation of resources to the very sick regardless of their socioeconomic status.

T1  - "Our Club": Place-Work and the Negotiation of Collective Belongingness
AN  - 835112106; 201100697
AB  - This research examines the process by which vying social groups negotiate collective belongingness within contested space. At an American Legion veterans' post, two factions-the Skeet Club and the New Regime-developed strong emotional attachments to the location. The Skeet Club consisted of ineligible townspeople who had illegally gained access to the post through the help of several legitimate members. For Skeet Club members, the post was a beloved social club where strong social bonds had developed over the course of many years. For the New Regime, the post was first and foremost a shrine to honor and assist military veterans. These divergent interpretations resulted in a process the author calls place-work, whereby members of the two factions struggled to establish a definition of the location that would allow their respective groups to feel that "we belong." The four place-work strategies observed include (1) the presentation of group value, (2) deference to organizational culture, (3) spatial control, and (4) out-group intimidation. Through these strategies, "collective belongingness" was constructed, presented, and maintained as a resource in intergroup conflict. This study builds on the literatures regarding place, emotion, and intergroup conflict. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Beyond the 'Auschwitz syndrome': Holocaust historiography after the Cold War
AN  - 835111684; 201100560
AB  - The end of the Cold war has seen an explosion in Holocaust history, and some significant changes in the main historiographical explanations. The 'return of ideology' that began displacing the 'functionalist' or 'structuralist' dominance of the 1980s remains strong. But it is being supplemented by very detailed regional and local studies, by analyses of different experiences of ghettoization in different places, and by a focus on the widespread plunder and corruption that accompanied the killing process. This enormous attention to detail reveals that the Holocaust unfolded differently in different places; but it also demonstrates the existence of an overall framework in which all the operations took place, what we might call an 'antisemitic consensus'. Simultaneously, historians have broadened the discussion of the Holocaust, situating it into a transnational or world-historical context of imperialism and colonialism. Stone outlines in broad brush some of these themes, and asks what effects they have had and will continue to have on Europeans' self-understanding in an age in which the post-war anti-fascist consensus has been dismantled while Holocaust-consciousness is officially enshrined into European identity.

T1  - Gender as catalyst for violence against Roma in contemporary Italy
AN  - 835111663; 201100576
AB  - Silvio Berlusconi's use of ethnicity and immigration as national security issues in his successful campaign for election to the Italian presidency in 2008 was by no means unique in contemporary Europe. What was surprising was the speed of his right-wing government's legislative restriction of migrants in the form of the so-called 'security package', first introduced just five weeks after the election. Woodcock explores the striking fact that this 'security package', and the intense wave of racist violence by Italians against Roma that it legitimized and encouraged, was proposed and justified in response to media reports of Italian babies being stolen by 'Zingari' from the 'nomad camps' and of Italian women being raped and beaten by Romanian men of 'Zingari' ethnicity. Gender and ethnicity are the twin constitutive discourses of modern European society, and racialized subjects are necessarily gendered. The stereotype of 'dangerous black men sexually threatening white women' has been mobilized in a vast range of European and colonial nationalist projects in order to justify the policing of both racialized masculine subjects and women as objects of the patriarchy. Similarly, the depiction of women as hysterical, sexually vulnerable objects in need of (white) masculine protection is an old story that the Italian media recognize as a fairy tale even as they reproduce the discourse. Woodcock explores what has not been mentioned thus far, namely, that gender stereotypes are vital to the mobilization of violent racism against the Roma in contemporary Italy, and how conservative gender binaries are strengthened and policed in a time of social crisis through the stereotyping of Roma as racial threat.

T1  - Can the Absence of Prejudice Be More Threatening Than Its Presence? It Depends on One's Worldview
AN  - 835111519; 201100568
AB  - The present research used validated cardiovascular measures to examine threat reactions among members of stigmatized groups when interacting with members of nonstigmatized groups who were, or were not, prejudiced against their group. The authors hypothesized that people's beliefs about the fairness of the status system would moderate their experience of threat during intergroup interactions. The authors predicted that for members of stigmatized groups who believe the status system is fair, interacting with a prejudiced partner, compared with interacting with an unprejudiced partner, would disconfirm their worldview and result in greater threat. In contrast, the authors predicted that for members of stigmatized groups who believe the system is unfair, interacting with a prejudiced partner, compared with interacting with an unprejudiced partner, would confirm their worldview and result in less threat. The authors examined these predictions among Latinas interacting with a White female confederate (Study 1) and White females interacting with a White male confederate (Study 2). As predicted, people's beliefs about the fairness of the status system moderated their experiences of threat during intergroup interactions, indicated both by cardiovascular responses and nonverbal behavior. The specific pattern of the moderation differed across the 2 studies. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Addressing contradictory needs: the Lega Nord and Italian immigration policy
AN  - 835111451; 201100457
AB  - Cento Bull addresses the question of whether the Italian Lega Nord, when in government, pursues policies that contradict its rhetoric (politics of simulation or symbolic politics) or policies that are in line with its dominant discourse (politics of identity). Her analysis focuses on immigration policy because this is an area that links together economic issues (immigration is highly functional to the economy of those regions of Italy that form the Lega's strongholds) and identity issues (immigration is seen as visibly threatening cultural values and disrupting community cohesion). She argues that recent legislation in this area, approved in July 2009, is formally in line with Lega rhetoric but also that actual policy outcomes contradict both the party's rhetoric and the legislation itself. This confirms the validity of the concept of 'simulative politics' in so far as it refers to a societal practice of self-deception, rather than simply to practices of deception on the part of political actors.

T1  - Contradictory Behavior During Genocides
AN  - 743060908; 201045854
AB  - In all large-scale genocides, rescuing occurs alongside killing. Some members of the aggressors' ethnic group even risk their own lives to save members of the targeted group. Killing and rescuing occur closely together, and even the same persons may engage in both behaviors--killing on one occasion and rescuing on another. This article examines such cases--where the same individuals kill and rescue--and discusses their relevance to the explanation of genocide. Both collectivistic and individualistic theories of killing and rescuing--which explain these behaviors with the properties of groups or persons--are inadequate in accounting for those who do both. Using Donald Black's (1995, 2000) strategy of pure sociology and my theory of genocide (Campbell, 2009), I offer an explanation of contradictory behavior by individuals during genocide. The behaviors themselves occur in different structures--killing where there is social distance and rescuing where there is social closeness. Individuals who exhibit contradictory behavior thus kill those who are distant and save those who are close. One feature of this analysis is its demonstration of the explanatory power of pure sociology, which is uniquely capable of explaining extreme variations in individual behavior.

T1  - Population Ratios and Prejudice: Modelling Both Contact and Threat Effects
AN  - 2076975549
AB  - Are small or large outgroup populations more closely related to an ingroup's prejudice? This paper addresses this question with national probability survey data from Germany focused on resident foreigners. Two interlocking processes underlie the complex relationship between population proportions and prejudice. Typically, larger outgroup population proportions simultaneously increase both threat and intergroup contact. The first process increases prejudice, the second decreases it. Using structural equation modelling, our analysis reveals that these two processes can be effectively combined into one complex model. Threat is perceptual; it involves what people think is the outgroup proportion and thus can be easily manipulated by political leaders and the mass media. Contact is experiential; it can reduce individual and collective threat as well as prejudice. The intricate relationship between threat and contact can be substantially altered by numerous moderators. Hence, rigid group segregation can limit contact, while unemployment can amplify threat. The paper provides evidence that reductions in prejudice have important consequences for intergroup relations.
