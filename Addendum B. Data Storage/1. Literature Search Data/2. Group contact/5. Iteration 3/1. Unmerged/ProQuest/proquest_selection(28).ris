T1  - Equality for (almost) all: Egalitarian advocacy predicts lower endorsement of sexism and racism, but not ageism
AN  - 2692277382
AB  - Past research has assumed that social egalitarians reject group-based hierarchies and advocate for equal treatment of all groups. However, contrary to popular belief, we argue that egalitarian advocacy predicts greater likelihood to support "Succession"-based ageism, which prescribes that older adults step aside to free up coveted opportunities (e.g., by retiring). Although facing their own forms of discrimination, older individuals are perceived as blocking younger people, and other unrepresented groups, from opportunities-that in turn, motivates egalitarian advocates to actively discriminate against older adults. In 9 separate studies (N = 3,277), we demonstrate that egalitarian advocates endorse less prejudice toward, and show more support for, women and racial minorities, but harbor more prejudice toward (Studies 1 and 2), and show less advocacy for (Studies 3–6), older individuals. We demonstrate downstream consequences of this effect, such as support for, and resource allocation to, diversity initiatives (Studies 3–6). Further, we isolate perceived opportunity blocking as a critical mediator, demonstrating that egalitarian advocates believe that older individuals actively obstruct more deserving groups from receiving necessary resources and support to get ahead (Studies 4–6). Finally, we explore the intersectional nature of this effect (Study 7). Together this research suggests that when it comes to egalitarianism, equality for all may only mean equality for some.

T1  - Mapping principal dimensions of prejudice in the United States
AN  - 2681521756
AB  - Research is often guided by maps of elementary dimensions, such as core traits, foundations of morality, and principal stereotype dimensions. Yet, there is no comprehensive map of prejudice dimensions. A major limiter of developing a prejudice map is the ad hoc sampling of target groups. We used a broad and largely theory-agnostic selection of groups to derive a map of principal dimensions of expressed prejudice in contemporary American society. Across a series of exploratory and confirmatory studies, we found three principal factors: Prejudice against marginalized groups, prejudice against privileged/conservative groups, and prejudice against unconventional groups (with some inverse loadings for conservative groups). We documented distinct correlates for each factor, in terms of social identifications, perceived threats, personality, and behavioral manifestations. We discuss how the current map integrates several lines of research, and point to novel and underexplored insights about prejudice.

T1  - Interview with an avatar: Comparing online and virtual reality perspective taking for gender bias in STEM hiring decisions
AN  - 2686268159
AB  - Virtual perspective taking can reduce unconscious bias and increase empathy and prosocial behavior toward individuals who are marginalized based on group stereotypes such as age, race, or socioeconomic status. However, the question remains whether this approach might reduce implicit gender bias, and the degree to which virtual immersion contributes to behavioral modulation following perspective taking tasks is unknown. Accordingly, we investigate the role of virtual perspective taking for binary gender using an online platform (Study 1) and immersive virtual reality (Study 2). Female and male undergraduates performed a simulated interview while virtually represented by an avatar that was either congruent or incongruent with their own gender. All participants rated a male and a female candidate on competence, hireability, likeability, empathy, and interpersonal closeness and then chose one of these two equivalently qualified candidates to hire for a laboratory assistant position in the male dominated industry of information technology. Online perspective taking did not reveal a significant influence of avatar gender on candidate ratings or candidate choice, whereas virtual reality perspective taking resulted in significant changes to participant behavior following exposure to a gender-incongruent avatar (e.g., male embodied as female), such that men showed preference for the female candidate and women showed preference for the male candidate. Although between-group differences in candidate ratings were subtle, rating trends were consistent with substantial differences in candidate choice, and this effect was greater for men. Compared to an online approach, virtual reality perspective taking appears to exert greater influence on acute behavioral modulation for gender bias due to its ability to fully immerse participants in the experience of (temporarily) becoming someone else, with empathy as a potential mechanism underlying this phenomenon.

T1  - Gender/sex diversity beliefs: Scale construction, validation, and links to prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2669413162
AB  - Prejudice against or affirmation of gender/sex minorities is often framed in terms of beliefs about the ontology of gender/sex (i.e., what gender/sex is), or gender/sex diversity beliefs. We constructed the Gender/Sex Diversity Beliefs Scale (GSDB) to assess ontological beliefs about the nature of gender/sex, including essentialist and social constructionist beliefs, and validated the GSDB across a series of studies. In Study 1 (N = 304), we explored the factor structure of the GSDB and found evidence of associations with prejudice against transgender and/or nonbinary people. In Study 2 (N = 300), we assessed the stability of the factor structure of the GSDB and examined its criterion-related validity, including its relationship to feelings toward multiple gender/sex groups. In Studies 3a (N = 48) and 3b (N = 500), we established test–retest reliability. We conclude that gender/sex diversity beliefs are important for understanding contemporary attitudes about gender/sex, including prejudice against gender/sex minorities, and that the GSDB is a reliable and valid way to measure them.

T1  - The Attribution of Parental Competence to Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Couples: Experimental and Correlational Results
AN  - 2649160076
AB  - This research examined the impact of sexual orientation on heterosexuals’ judgment of parental competence. Using a vignette approach, Study 1 presented participants with a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual couple who desired to have a child, either as adoptive parents or, in an additional heterosexual target condition, as biological parents. Study 2 presented a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual parent couple; heterosexual targets were either adoptive parents, reflecting the LG target conditions, or biological parents. Contradicting Hypothesis 1, neither target sexual orientation nor way to parenthood (with the latter varied in the heterosexual target condition only) had an impact on parental competence attributions. Confirming Hypothesis 2, participants with personal contact with lesbian and gay (LG) people provided higher ratings of LG target parental competence, mediated by positive attitudes toward homosexuality. Importantly, this mediation did not occur in the heterosexual target condition, corroborating the specificity of the intergroup contact effect.

T1  - Strategies of universalism: Ten routes toward unbiased solutions to social problems
AN  - 2648479627
AB  - Universalism is a principle according to which a rule or a standard should be applied in social situations in the same way irrespective of the social attributes of those who are affected by this rule/standard. This normative claim collides with the fundamental mechanisms of social cognition, which underlie social biases, prejudice, and discrimination. Social biases are the main source of violation from the universalism principle across various domains of human life: evaluations, judgments, decision‐making, problem‐solving, social interaction, among others. Whereas normative universalism is a moral principle, the present study asks how it can be realised in practice. The study identifies three broad classes of such strategies. The first one targets individuals' cognitive and psychological traits, which give rise to social biases and include intergroup contact, social cognitive strategy, reappraisal, motivational strategy, and bias control. The second class targets the situation and includes three strategies: disengagement, randomisation, and counterbalancing biases by aggregation. The third class includes two strategies, which rely on technological solutions: automation and neural administration. The study describes the core idea and main problems of each strategy and discusses how the choice of a strategy depends on the context and the task, which requires a universal solution.

T1  - When Global Scripts Do Not Resonate: International Minority Rights and Local Repertoires of Diversity in Southern Turkey
AN  - 2628901799
AB  - Under what conditions do global scripts resonate among ordinary people? Neo-institutional world polity theory has tended to sideline this question by privileging macro-comparative explanations of states’ adoption and social movement activists’ framing of global scripts. Adopting a negative case approach, we draw on concepts from cultural sociology to explain why global scripts fail to resonate among ethno-religious minorities in Antakya, Turkey. Antakya has been exposed intensely to global minority rights and multiculturalism discourses; it has been targeted by various ethnic movement activists, and its diverse population has long experienced stigma and discrimination stemming from Turkey’s model of nationhood. Yet, ordinary people there have seldom utilized global diversity scripts in their everyday struggles for recognition. Drawing on longitudinal qualitative fieldwork between 2004 and 2015, we find that global scripts fail to match people’s cultural schemas of perceiving and reproducing boundaries—their local repertoires of diversity—due to a deep-seated ambivalence toward the category of “minority.” This lack of resonance potentially weakens popular support for substantial policy reforms advancing minority rights and is one among several factors explaining why Turkey’s turn from an exclusionary to an inclusionary model of nationhood has remained largely ceremonial.

T1  - Cuban and Afro-Caribbean immigrants: an analysis of intermarriage and subsequent assimilation among second-generation Caribbean immigrants
AN  - 2633575857
AB  - This paper uses the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study to examine the effects of race, class and gender on the intermarriage of Cuban and Afro-Caribbean second-generation immigrants in the United States. Results indicate that gender and racial identity are significantly related to intermarriage for this group of immigrants. Interestingly, the immigrants’ socioeconomic status and family’s social class have a very minimal impact on intermarriage. Using Cuban white, Cuban Hispanic and Caribbean black as racial categories, the study shows that Caribbean black men are the least likely group to intermarry, and Cuban white men are the most likely to intermarry. Cuban Hispanic men are less likely to intermarry compared to their Cuban white counterparts. Lastly, Cuban white women are the most likely to intermarrycompared to Cuban white males for this sample population. A structural explanation for these patterns posits that differences in the relative size of each racial group in marriage markets affect their chances for intermarriage. From an assimilation perspective, the literature also suggests that differences in social distance with whites influence the propensity for co-ethnic intermarriage.

Their narratives highlighted growing perceptions of difference and how the negative actions and attitudes of a few people in their past continued to shadow their current lives. Influenced by perceived negative attitudes of others to disability and their own internalisation of these, the young people conceptualise a binary of normalcy and difference, finding themselves liminally positioned, somewhere in between, and mostly seeking to avoid a disability association. In new social situations, the young people reported engaging in disability identity management work, while often resisting having disability as part of their identity. These can be conceptualised as acts of resilience and of resistance in the face of oppressive social forces. There is a powerful counter narrative in a sub group of the participants who were actively engaged with peers with experience of disability. For these young people, the inclusion of disability within social identities became possible. The findings of this study have implications for our understandings of managing identities in young lives, particularly for those in marginal positions.

T1  - Digital Information Technology Use and Transnational Healthcare: A Population-Based Study on Older Russian-Speaking Migrants in Finland
AN  - 2620905435
AB  - This study examines the association between digital information technology (DIT) use and the utilization of transnational healthcare (THC) in older migrants, and investigates how this relationship depends on social integration or perceived discrimination in health services in the destination country. The data from a population-based study conducted in Finland in 2019, which targeted Russian-speaking residents aged 50 and above (n = 1082) nationwide, are analyzed. The analysis demonstrates that those who had a high level of DIT use were significantly more likely to use THC than those who had a low level of use. However, the findings do not show that the relationship depends on social integration or perceived discrimination. Older migrants can actively use transnational networks to address their health and well-being issues by using DIT and seeking healthcare abroad. Their health service use can be illustrated as an active process involving various geographical domains.

T1  - The subtle spreading of sexist norms: GPIR
AN  - 2609041577
AB  - Even when overt sexism and prejudice become rarer, social norms that perpetuate inequality are remarkably persistent. The present research lays out one of the subtle ways in which sexist norms may spread through society, by pointing to the role of responses to sexism. We investigate how third parties infer social norms about sexism when observing social interactions. In three studies among male students (Studies 1 and 2) and male and female students (Study 3), we demonstrate that subtle variations in how people respond to a sexist statement can have a substantial influence on inferences third parties make about sexist norms. Specifically, when a sexist statement is made and the conversation continues in a smoothly flowing fashion, third parties infer that this opinion is shared among interaction partners, perceived as appropriate, and that sexism is normative among them. However, when a sexist statement is followed by a brief silence that disrupts the flow of the conversation, observers think that it is contentious and that sexism is neither shared nor normative. Importantly, the effects of the manipulation generalized to the perception of sexist descriptive norms among male students in general. We conclude that social and cultural norms are not just inferred from conversation content, but also from conversational flow.

T1  - Living in a 'free jail': Asylum seekers' and local residents' experiences of discomfort with asylum seeker accommodation
AN  - 2621878372
AB  - This paper shows how asylum seeker accommodation produces a politics of discomfort among both asylum seekers as well as local residents. The paper compares two collective asylum centres located in the city of Augsburg, Germany, one of which is a nationally renowned refugee integration project, the 'Grandhotel Cosmopolis', the other, a state-run asylum centre. Data was obtained through participant observation and semi-structured interviews between September 2016 and November 2017. Drawing on carceral geographies, the paper identifies three mechanisms through which the material and institutional standards of asylum accommodation generate discomfort among and between asylum seekers and local residents, which are self-mortification, depersonalization and role-breakdown. Through the sharing of rooms and facilities, asylum accommodation contributes to asylum seekers' self-mortification, referring to changes in the conceptions and beliefs of oneself. The comparison of the two cases highlights how large asylum centres depersonalize asylum seekers by creating images of a homogenized 'mass' and contribute to role-breakdown, meaning a reduction of individuals' identities performed with regard to work, home or family life. National discourses of asylum seekers as dangerous merged with the space of asylum accommodation, thereby preventing social interaction 'as neighbours' between asylum seekers and local residents. Overall, the paper exposes how a politics of discomfort utilizes affect as a governmental device, thereby turning asylum accommodation into a carceral space by creating social distance and 'moral closure'.

T1  - Making the planet green again: The interplay of attitudes and group norms in the conversion to organic farming
AN  - 2597113312
AB  - Attitudes and social norms are key social psychological concepts that have often been considered as independent determinants of human behavior. However, questions about the interplay between the two are somewhat of a blind spot in social psychology. In the present research, we test the hypothesis that when an important change in norms is involved, behavioral intentions will be shaped by a discrepancy between personal attitudes and the perceived group norm, that is the perception of other group members’ attitudes. This proposition is tested and supported across three studies in a context of the conversion to organic farming, a behavior indicative of a significant societal and behavioral change. Farmers who did convert to organic farming were those who perceive other farmers to hold less positive attitudes toward this environmentally‐friendly practice compared to their own (Study 1a & 1b, N = 1,023). Among conventional farmers, the intention to convert to organic farming is also predicted by a discrepancy between personal attitudes and the perceived group norm (Study 1b). Finally, among agricultural colleges’ students (Study 2, N = 280), the intention to become an organic farmer was influenced by an interaction between attitudes and perceived group norm and not only by independent effects of these two variables. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for a better understanding of behavioral adaptation in times of social change are discussed.

T1  - The Effects of Populist Identity Framing on Populist Attitudes Across Europe: Evidence From a 15-Country Comparative Experiment
AN  - 2631533223
AB  - We investigate the effects of populist messages that (a) stress the centrality of “ordinary” people, (b) shift blame to the “corrupt” elites, or (c) combine people centrality and antielitist cues on 3 dimensions of populist attitudes: anti-elitism, homogeneous people, and popular sovereignty. We conducted an extensive 15-country experiment in which we manipulated populist communication as social identity frames (N = 7,271). Multilevel analyses demonstrate that messages stressing the centrality of the ordinary people activate all dimensions of populist attitudes. In contrast, anti-elite messages activate anti-elitism attitudes only for those individuals with lower levels of education and extreme positions on the ideological left–right spectrum. Our findings suggest that populist political communication plays a key role in activating populist attitudes across Europe.

T1  - Beliefs, Attitudes, and Communicative Practices of Opponents and Supporters of COVID-19 Containment Policies: A Qualitative Case Study from Germany
AN  - 2586232043
AB  - In many countries, intense political contestation unfolded around the question of how Sars-CoV-2 should be contained. In this case study, I try to understand why members of the German public came to vastly differing judgements on the containment policies. In summer 2020, I conducted 48 semi-structured interviews to investigate respondents’ belief systems, attitude structures, and communicative practices. I found that disparate policy preferences were partly based on incompatible interpretations of the crisis and went hand in hand with deep institutional mistrust between strict opponents. Stereotypes about supporters and opponents had formed, and people avoided discussions with opposing camps. However, my data also suggest that moderate opponents and supporters overlapped in their criticism of anxiety-inducing media coverage and fuzzy governmental communication. No fully-fledged social identities had formed, and respondents were forcibly exposed to other opinions in their close personal networks. Altogether, my study extends the knowledge of political polarisation around COVID-19 by unravelling the interpretations and mechanisms that underlie disparate policy preferences during the pandemic.

T1  - Detecting changes between two strangers: Insight from a classic change blindness paradigm: GPIR
AN  - 2573357334
AB  - The current study aims to investigate what factors influence whether adults detect a change between social partners in a brief interaction. In two experiments, we examined whether locale diversity, a stranger’s marginalized minority status (e.g., minority race, minority religious affiliation), and race congruence (e.g., own or other race) influenced the likelihood of being differentiated. Using a change blindness paradigm, an experimenter approached pedestrians asking for directions, then surreptitiously changed places with a confederate. After the switch, we measured whether pedestrians noticed if the person had changed. In Experiment 1, noticing rates were significantly lower for confederates belonging to a minority race compared to White confederates, but only in the more homogenous location and not in the highly diverse location. In Experiment 2, pedestrians were least likely to detect a change when confederates belonged to a religious minority and a racial minority. We discuss the important implications for prejudicial behaviour and eyewitness identification, as well as the utility of performing psychological research outside of the lab.

T1  - Anticipation of Stigma upon Parenthood Impacts Parenting Aspirations in the LGB Community in Israel
AN  - 2564698389
AB  - IntroductionThis study compared childless Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals to their heterosexual counterparts on anticipation of stigma upon parenthood and assessed its mediating role in the association between being a member of a sexual minority and lower parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.MethodsA total of 612 childless participants (174 self-reported as LGB people) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 31.18, SD = 3.89) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2019 and February 2020. They completed online questionnaires assessing their anticipation of stigma upon parenthood, parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.ResultsLGB individuals reported a higher anticipation of stigma upon parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. The anticipation of stigma upon parenthood fully mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower parenting desires and intentions and partially mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower estimated likelihood of parenthood.Conclusions and Policy Implications The findings are interpreted in light of LGB possible awareness of prejudice and discrimination by local legislation that prohibits or impedes sexual minorities from pursuing parenthood. Policymakers and health professionals should be alerted to the impact of anticipation of stigma when accounting for the disparities in parenting aspirations between LGB individuals and heterosexual counterparts and its possible connections to discriminatory Israeli social policies toward LGB rights.

T1  - Economic Inequality Shapes the Relationship Between Globalization and Prejudice
AN  - 2548838061
AB  - As globalization increases worldwide, it redefines our conceptions of other cultures, the media we consume, and our day-to-day interactions. Despite this increased interconnectivity, we lack a fundamental understanding of how globalization is related to prejudicial attitudes between social groups. We hypothesized that economic inequality may shape the relationship between globalization and intergroup prejudice. We tested this prediction with data from over 66,000 respondents across 44 countries. We found that globalization—and particularly its social aspects such as tourism and migration—is related to increased prejudice in countries with high economic inequality and is related to decreased prejudice in countries with low economic inequality. These findings offer new insight into how and why globalization may shape intergroup relations around the world.

T1  - Feminist and Anti-Feminist Identification in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century United States
AN  - 2560169354
AB  - Feminism and anti-feminism featured prominently in the 2016 presidential election. Hillary Clinton was the first female major party presidential candidate and self-identified as a feminist speaking openly about the challenges facing women. Clinton faced off against Donald Trump, who was on record making sexist statements and arguing that Clinton’s success was from playing the “woman card”. We ask several questions: who identifies as a feminist today and how is this different from who identified as a feminist in the previous generation? Who identifies as “anti-feminist”? Are anti-feminists simply a mirror reflection of feminists or is it a distinctive social identity? Finally, the study explores the meaning of these labels by looking at what feminists and anti-feminists believe in terms of public policy and attitudes about gender equality. Thus, this study provides insights into the state of modern feminism and antifeminism in contemporary American politics.

T1  - Pathways to prejudice and outgroup hostility: Group alignment and intergroup conflict among football fans
AN  - 2550671028
AB  - How do different forms of group alignment influence our attitudes toward outgroups? To answer this, the current fieldwork study explored how identification and identity fusion differentially impact outgroup anxiety, prejudice, and hostility toward rival football fan supporter groups in Australia. The community participants (N = 100) were members of two active fan groups who had experienced a history of intergroup tensions. The findings from the full path model confirmed that the predictor group alignment variables of identification and fusion were correlated, and the two outcome variables of outgroup prejudice and hostility were correlated, as predicted. The findings also revealed that fusion with one's club predicted outgroup hostility, but not prejudice, whereas identification with one's club predicted outgroup prejudice, but not hostility. Additionally, outgroup anxiety was found to significantly mediate the relationship between ingroup identification and outgroup prejudice, whereas a similar relationship was not found for fusion. These findings highlight the differential impact of group alignment (i.e., identification and identity fusion) on social constructs of outgroup anxiety, prejudice, and hostility. Empirically, this is the first study to demonstrate the workings of these distinct group alignment pathways in an applied setting involving hard‐core football fans. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for a fuller understanding of the drivers of intergroup tensions and conflict.

T1  - German desire for historical closure indirectly affects Israelis' intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2610171787
AB  - Research indicates that the memory of collective historical trauma may fuel current intergroup conflicts. In the present research, we examined in two experiments whether perpetrator desire for historical closure influences victim group attitudes in a current, seemingly unrelated, intergroup conflict. In Study 1 (N = 122), participants texted with a German confederate who either expressed responsibility, a desire for historical closure (Schlussstrich), or discussed a non‐Holocaust related topic. In Study 2 (N = 115), participants conversed with a German confederate who either acknowledged collective responsibility or expressed a desire for closure. In both studies, attitudes towards the confederate, Germany, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict were measured. Results indicated that historical closure directly increased negative evaluations of the German confederate, and indirectly influenced attitudes towards Germany, and support for peacemaking with the Palestinians via confederate evaluations. The discussion focuses on perpetrator group influences on the relationship between historical collective trauma and current intergroup relations.

T1  - Conceptualizing the National Group for the Crime of Genocide: Is Law Able to Account for Identity Fault Lines?
AN  - 2489521764
AB  - “National group” is one of four victim groups that is explicitly protected by international criminal law from genocide. At the core of any genocide lies an element of identity. Yet, the fixed group categories that the law provides for seemingly do not conform to the fluidity of group identities. Is the law at all able to account for identity fault lines? By recourse to research on identity construction and otherness, this article argues that the interpretation of the law of genocide can benefit, structurally and legally, from insight into the forces at work before a genocide erupts. In recognizing the perpetrator’s definitional power over the victim group, the courts should increasingly focus their investigation into the mind of the génocidaires and their perception of the national victim group. In addition to discussing the dynamics of intergroup conflicts leading up to a genocide, this article also looks at the jurisprudence of criminal courts on the issues of nationality, national groups, and national identity for the crime of genocide.

T1  - Collectively biased representations of the past: Ingroup Bias in Wikipedia articles about intergroup conflicts
AN  - 2448123312
AB  - Individuals tend to present their own group (the ingroup) in a systematically more favourable way (ingroup bias). By examining socially negotiated and publicly accessible Wikipedia articles about intergroup conflicts, we investigated ingroup bias at a collective level. Specifically, we compared articles about the same intergroup conflicts (e.g., the Falklands War) in the corresponding language versions of Wikipedia (e.g., the Spanish and English Wikipedia articles about the Falklands War). Study 1 featured a content coding of translated Wikipedia articles by trained raters, which showed that articles systematically presented the ingroup in a more favourable way (e.g., Argentina in the Spanish article and the United Kingdom in the English article) and, in reverse, the outgroup as more immoral and more responsible for the conflict. These findings were replicated and extended in Study 2, which was limited to the lead sections of articles but included considerably more conflicts and many participants instead of a few trained coders. This procedure allowed for separate analyses for each conflict, which showed considerable variance in the results pattern with a stronger ingroup bias for (1) more recent conflicts and (2) conflicts in which the proportion of ingroup members among the top editors was larger. Finally, a third study ruled out that these effects were driven by translations or the raters’ own nationality. Therefore, this paper is the first to demonstrate ingroup bias in Wikipedia – a finding that is of practical as well as theoretical relevance as we outline in the discussion.

T1  - Supporting Older Homeless Persons' Positive Relocations to Long-Term Care: Service Provider Views
AN  - 2451553432
AB  - Background and Objectives This study sought to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with supporting older homeless persons' relocations to long-term care (LTC) from the perspective of service providers. It aims to inform how to improve relocation processes for this vulnerable and growing subpopulation of older persons. Research Design and Methods This cross-sectional qualitative study employed semistructured face-to-face interviews with service providers from two Health and Social Service Centres in Montreal, Quebec. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed in five stages. Results A total of eight service providers reported on their experiences supporting over 40 relocations of older homeless persons (50+) in the last year. According to participants, older homeless persons' trajectories into LTC typically included a series of neglected medical issues followed by hospitalization and eventual relocation to LTC. Systemic barriers such as limited-time for proper planning, insufficient housing options for persons with minor functional limitations, disregard for preferred geographic location, multiple moves, and staff prejudices worked together to expedite premature relocation and challenge relocation processes. Discussion and Implications Older homeless persons appear to be at heightened risk of premature and challenging relocation processes. Expanding housing stock for persons with functional limitations, strengthening intersectoral collaborations, providing education and training to staff, and ensuring flexibility around rules and regulations in receiving LTC homes would both improve access to aging in place for this marginalized group of older persons and ensure conditions are in place to support positive relocations to LTC for those who require it.

T1  - Living inside a globalised Panopticon: creating new frontiers within public and private space
AN  - 2431011564
AB  - Coronavirus has completely transformed our conceptions and relationship to space and each other. Martial rhetoric has been used by leaders all over the world as justification for extreme and often contradictory measures. Previously defined by societal usage and personal necessity, entire cities have cut up in minuscule authorised areas, turning public space into a war zone where the enemy is simultaneously an invisible virus and its victims, namely citizens who enfringe ever‐changing measures intended to make them equally invisible. Our understanding of the mapping of public space is further impeded by the collapse of any recognisable institutions: hospitals at best are available only to the most sick and dying, schools, post‐offices, working places, parks, theatres, museums are closed. Enforced solitude, mandatory unemployment and social distancing based on avoidance of the other have introduced constraining anxiety‐inducing ways of confronting and integrating both personal and public space. Circumventing the pressure of constant surveillance while preserving health and sanity has become a daily exercise in safeguarding sanity. Virtual sociability has replaced social contact, as has online schooling and working from home – for the privileged who can afford them.

T1  - Attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities: A meta‐cognitive approach to persuasion
AN  - 2398196181
AB  - Attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities are becoming critical for promoting diversity and egalitarianism within organizations. The few interventions designed to promote positive attitudes toward people with disabilities have relied on changing either the direction and/or the amount of thoughts people generate with regard to this discriminated, understudied group. In the present research, we examine the impact of a different psychological process of attitude change based on meta‐cognition, or thinking about thinking. We used a meta‐cognitive approach to changing prejudiced attitudes because thoughtful processes are often overlooked or denied with regard to this particular group. Specifically, we explored the impact of thought confidence on attitude change across two studies designed to change attitudes toward the incorporation of people with disabilities in companies. In each study, participants first generated either positive or negative thoughts about the proposal (thought valence manipulation). Then, the confidence in those thoughts was measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). In concert with the self‐validation hypothesis, results showed that when thought confidence was relatively high (vs. low), thought valence had a greater impact on attitudes. Thus, thought valence was more predictive of attitudes when participants were confident in their thoughts. Specifically, confidence in thoughts enhanced persuasion for positive thoughts but reduced persuasion for negative thoughts. These findings provide insights into assessing effects of interventions aiming at improving attitudes toward the inclusion of minority groups in organizations.

T1  - Colour violence, deadly geographies, and the meanings of “race” in Brazil
AN  - 2376277943
AB  - This paper analyses the relationships between “race” and violent victimization, and between “race” and support for violent practices of social control in Brazil, using nationally representative survey data. I start from the premise that “race” is a set of relational practices rather than bounded “racial groups”. I operationalize this relational understanding of “race” methodologically by triangulating three measures of “race” – self-identified “census race”, interviewer-identified skin colour, and racial composition of the municipality – in conjunction with measures of class, gender and space. I find that whiter geographic spaces have lower overall levels of violent victimization, but that interviewer-identified darker-skinned individuals are disproportionately victimized in these whiter geographic spaces. Controlling for other variables, self-identified census race is not correlated with violent victimization. I find that public support for violent practices can best be understood by considering people’s simultaneous relationships to race, gender, class and spatial categories and hierarchies.

T1  - Gender Bending and Gender Conformity: The Social Consequences of Engaging in Feminine and Masculine Pro-Environmental Behaviors
AN  - 2242647714
AB  - Although pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) have been characterized as feminine, some PEBs are masculine suggesting that gender bending (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors inconsistent with one’s own gender) and gender conformity (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors consistent with one’s own gender) are possible for both women and men. Social consequences for gender bending versus conformity with PEBs were assessed in three studies. Gender bending created uncertainty about an actor’s heterosexual identity (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with stigma-by-association, actors’ gender bending influenced judgments about an actor’s friend’s sexual identity (Study 2). However, gender bending had limited effects on ascription of gendered traits: More feminine than masculine traits were ascribed to PEB actors, even actors of masculine PEBs (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with social ostracism, Study 3 illustrated that men were most likely to socially distance themselves from female gender benders, likely as a result of prejudice against gender-bending women. In contrast, women preferred to socially interact with gender-conforming women, likely resulting from a combination of their greater interest in feminine than masculine PEBs and preferring to interact with women more so than with men. Social repercussions are discussed in terms of stigmatizing engagement in PEBs.

T1  - A New Approach to the Study of Tolerance: Conceptualizing and Measuring Acceptance, Respect, and Appreciation of Difference
AN  - 2561654076
AB  - Previous empirical research on tolerance suffers from a number of shortcomings, the most serious being the conceptual and operational conflation of (in)tolerance and prejudice. We design research to remedy this. First, we contribute to the literature by advancing research that distinguishes analytically between the two phenomena. We conceptualize tolerance as a value orientation towards difference. This definition—which is abstract and does not capture attitudes towards specific out-groups, ideas, or behaviors—allows for the analysis of tolerance within and between societies. Second, we improve the measurement of tolerance by developing survey items that are consistent with this conceptualization. We administer two surveys, one national (Sweden) and one cross-national (Australia, Denmark, Great Britain, Sweden, and the United States). Results from structural equation models show that tolerance is best understood as a three-dimensional concept, which includes acceptance of, respect for, and appreciation of difference. Analyses show that measures of tolerance have metric invariance across countries, and additional tests demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity. We also assess tolerance’s relationship to prejudice and find that only an appreciation of difference has the potential to reduce prejudice. We conclude that it is not only possible to measure tolerance in a way that is distinct from prejudice but also necessary if we are to understand the causes and consequences of tolerance.

T1  - “Socially Disruptive Actions … Have Become as Canadian as Maple Syrup”: Civil Disobedience in Canada, 1960–2012
AN  - 2413816508
AB  - Civil disobedience has deep roots in Canadian history. Focusing on the period from 1960 until Quebec’s “Maple Spring” protests of 2012, this article examines the practice of civil disobedience by a diversity of dissenting individuals and groups in Canada. Considered collectively, the examples of peace, anti-nuclear, and civil rights protests; defence of English-language minority rights in Quebec; corporate resistance to Sunday shopping restrictions in Ontario; pro- and anti-abortion advocacy; and the often overlapping activism of Indigenous and environmentalist groups illustrate how civil disobedience endeavoured to influence, whether by conversion or coercion, public opinion on some of Canadian society’s most complex and divisive issues. In defining civil disobedience, the article emphasizes that non-violence is an essential descriptor. Some observers continued to express concerns well into the 1990s that growing instances of civil disobedience did not bode well for Canadian social order and the rule of law. But as civil disobedience became increasingly normalized, particularly following the introduction of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, and widespread social disorder did not ensue, non-violent civil disobedience aligned with a national political culture commonly associated with deference and compromise. Civil disobedience had become “as Canadian as maple syrup.”Alternate abstract:
La désobéissance civile a des racines profondes dans l’histoire canadienne. En se concentrant sur la période allant des années 1960 jusqu’au « printemps érable » de 2012 au Québec, cet article examine la pratique de désobéissance civile par divers individus et groupes de dissidents au Canada. Considérés collectivement, les exemples (1) de manifestation pour la paix et les droits civils et contre le nucléaire; (2) de défense des droits des anglophones minoritaires au Québec; (3) de la résistance d’entreprises face aux restrictions de l’ouverture des magasins le dimanche en Ontario; (4) des manifestations pour et contre l’avortement; et (5) de l’activisme, qui se chevauchent souvent, des groupes autochtones et environnementaux illustrent comment la désobéissance civile tente d’influencer, soit par la conversion ou la coercition, l’opinion du public en matière de nombreux enjeux complexes et controversés de la société canadienne. En définissant la désobéissance civile, cet article montre que la non-violence est un descripteur essentiel. Même dans les années 1990, certains observateurs continuaient d’affirmer que les instances croissantes de désobéissance civile auguraient mal de l’ordre social canadien et de l’État de droit. Mais, avec la normalisation de la désobéissance civile, surtout après l’introduction de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés en 1982 sans qu’il y ait de conflit social généralisé par la suite, la désobéissance civile non violente s’est alignée avec une culture politique nationale généralement associée avec la déférence et le compromis. La désobéissance civile était devenue « aussi canadienne que le sirop d’érable ».

T1  - Punitiveness and Devaluation among Social Work Gatekeepers
AN  - 2403116171
AB  - This paper analyses the connection between a punitive educational orientation and different negative prejudices in the context of group-focused enmity. While punitiveness is a very rough and undefined term, it is the subject of lively debate within social work. Here, punitiveness is often understood as a move away from the former welfare state ideal by giving preference to harsh punishment rather than practices of resocialization. The results of a quantitative survey (n = 178) of future street-level bureaucrats in the social field show that a punitive educational orientation is positively related to prejudices. This has implications for theorizing on the role of punitiveness in intergroup conflict and especially for practical social work, as it devalues certain social groups that are addressees of social work through punitive practice. This also includes assumptions about citizenship, as statements are made about who belongs and who does not.

T1  - Inequality in the Social Mind: Social Comparison and Support for Redistribution
AN  - 2332983635
AB  - Income inequality is fundamentally relational in nature, but research on the American public’s response to it tends to examine individuals in isolation, concluding that support for redistribution is unresponsive to inequality. We focus instead on perceptions of relative socioeconomic position, which we manipulate experimentally through imagined social interactions with high- or low-status others. We find that subjects who make social comparisons between themselves and someone who is socioeconomically advantaged perceive their own status as lower, assess their own socioeconomic status more accurately, and become more supportive of social welfare spending, even though we provide no factual information about the income distribution to subjects in the experiment. Our findings demonstrate that Americans respond with support for redistribution when conditions facilitate upward social comparison. We argue for a shift in scholarly attention to the structural factors that keep rising upper-tail inequality socially invisible.

T1  - In search of an imaginary enemy: Catholic collective narcissism and the endorsement of gender conspiracy beliefs
AN  - 2297095353
AB  - Gender studies have often been criticized for undermining family and religious values. In this paper, we argue that these criticisms exhibit the characteristics of conspiracy theories. We define gender conspiracy beliefs as convictions that gender studies and gender-equality activists represent an ideology secretly designed to harm traditional values and social arrangements. In two studies conducted among Catholics in Poland (Study 1 N= 1019; Study 2 N= 223), we examined the prevalence of gender conspiracy beliefs and their psychological concomitants. We hypothesized that gender conspiracy beliefs should be associated with a defensive identification with one's religious group, captured by religious collective narcissism. In both studies, Catholic collective narcissism was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of gender conspiracy beliefs. We additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted outgroup hostility, and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs. We discuss the implications for gender-based prejudice.

T1  - Whose Side Are You On? Asian Americans’ Mistrust of Asian–White Biracials Predicts More Exclusion From the Ingroup
AN  - 2220161498
AB  - We investigated Asian Americans’ perceptions of Asian–White biracials. Because the Asian/White boundary may be more permeable than other minority/White boundaries, we reasoned that Asian Americans are more likely than Black Americans to be skeptical of biracials, perceiving that biracials would prefer to identify as White and would be disloyal to Asians, consequently categorizing them as more outgroup. We further reasoned that Asian Americans’ concerns about and exclusion of biracials would be predicted by greater perceived discrimination against Asian Americans, which increases the incentive for biracials to pass into the higher status racial group. Studies 1 and 2 provided correlational support for these theorized relationships among Asian Americans. Study 2 showed that perceived discrimination did not increase Black Americans’ concerns about biracials’ identity preferences and loyalty. Studies 3 and 4 provided causal evidence for the roles of perceived discrimination and biracial identity preferences, respectively, in Asian Americans’ exclusion of biracials.

T1  - Protecting commonly targeted groups in the context of ‘new politics’: the case of Ireland
AN  - 2185149177
AB  - This article addresses the big ‘P’ politics of hate by examining the circumstances that produced an apparent radical and sudden shift among the parties of government in Ireland from long-standing resistance to the introduction of hate crime legislation to an expansive approach to protecting commonly targeted minorities. By means of a directed qualitative content analysis of parliamentary debate regarding the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016, we argue that four factors aid comprehension of this uncommon pattern - the range of the Irish political spectrum, the current balance of power in parliament, the approach to the protection of difference adopted by established parties and finally, the permeability of the Irish political system and the consequent influence of civil society organisations representing targeted communities on the parliamentary debate. We argue that, rather than underscoring the national influence of global trends and international good practice, recent developments in Ireland demonstrate the importance of attending to the peculiarities of the local context in interpreting the meaning and significance of responses to hate crime.

T1  - Rights, Inequality, and Afro-Descendant Heritage in Brazil
AN  - 2444306674
AB  - For the past thirty years, the Brazilian government has recognized dozens of sites and cultural practices of Afro-descendant groups as national heritage, including the historical maroon site Quilombo dos Palmares. As this site has gained international notoriety, academic research has focused on the value of this historical landmark for commemorating Afro-Brazilian heritage. This article looks to the ambiguous effects of such commemoration on contemporary people living in the area, some of whom are being forcefully evicted from the site in connection with its heritage status. The article addresses the vulnerability experienced by these residents, as it highlights broader issues associated with multicultural and heritage-recognition policies in Brazil. Specifically, I analyze the policies protecting contemporary maroon descendants and sites to reveal why Palmares residents making claims on their land and heritage fall outside of state recognition. I argue that as these policies have become an increasingly powerful mechanism for protecting Afro-Brazilian and minority groups, they have also acquired the capacity to hurt the most vulnerable individuals within these communities. Two very different types of heritage stand to be protected at Palmares: one of the historical maroons and their contemporary kin, and another of the structurally unequal system that inadvertently replicates the oppression it intends to dismantle. In the context of massive inequality that disproportionately affects blacks, maroon descendants, indigenous, and other minority populations in Brazil, it is critical to consider how political strategies for redressing ethnoracial inequality may also end up perpetuating segregation.Alternate abstract:
Ao longo dos últimos trinta anos, o governo brasileiro tem reconhecido como patrimônio cultural dezenas de espaços e práticas culturais de grupos afrodescendentes, entre estes, o espaço histórico do Quilombo dos Palmares. À medida que este local tem adquirido notoriedade histórica internacional, a pesquisa acadêmica tem priorizado a importância do local no que se refere à comemoração do patrimônio cultural afro-brasileiro. Meu trabalho analisa as consequências de tal reconhecimento patrimonial na vida de populações que residem atualmente nesta região, algumas das quais estão sendo expulsas à força do local, devido à declaratória deste como patrimônio cultural. Analiso também as vulnerabilidades experimentadas por tais populações, no contexto da problemática mais ampla das políticas multiculturais de reconhecimento do patrimônio no Brasil. Especificamente, examino as políticas de proteção aos quilombos e indivíduos quilombolas, e analiso como e por que o Estado não reconhece as reclamações de terras e patrimônio feitas pelos residentes de Palmares. Minha tese é que embora tais políticas venham sendo poderosos mecanismos de proteção aos grupos afro-brasileiros e às minorias, têm também adquirido uma capacidade desproporcional para prejudicar os indivíduos mais vulneráveis daquelas comunidades. Assim sendo, a declaração de Palmares oferece proteção a dois patrimônios muito distintos: um é dos quilombos históricos e seus descendentes contemporâneos, e outro, do sistema estruturalmente desigual que tem como consequência inesperada a replicação da mesma opressão que a própria política visava a desmantelar. Dentro do contexto de desigualdade massiva no Brasil, que prejudica desproporcionalmente as populações negras, os quilombolas, os indígenas e outras minorias, é de suma importância considerar como as políticas atuais que visam à reparação da desigualdade etnorracial também levam à perpetuação da segregação.

AB  - Introduction Externalizing disorders are more prevalent in rural than urban settings and account for disproportionately high mental health service costs for rural adolescents. Although cultural stressors such as discrimination have been associated with externalizing problems in ethnic minority youth broadly, this relationship is understudied in Latinos, particularly those in rural settings. Further, though the associations of family processes such as familism and family conflict have been studied in relation to youth externalizing symptoms, whether these processes change in the face of adolescent discrimination stress remains unknown. Methods A moderated multiple mediation model was used to examine the association between perceived discrimination, externalizing symptoms, and the indirect effect of family factors (familism, and family conflict) in a large sample (n = 455) of rural Latino youth. We also evaluated whether indirect and direct effects of discrimination on externalizing symptoms differed in boys versus girls. Results Familism and family conflict each independently mediated the relationship between discrimination related stress and externalizing symptoms. However, discrimination had a direct effect on externalizing symptoms for boys only. In girls, this association held only when family factors were accounted for. Post-hoc analyses reveal that the moderating effect of sex on discrimination is driven by differences in rule-breaking behavior, as opposed to aggressive behavior. Conclusion Findings suggest that discrimination is associated with changes in the family environment which in turn invoke elevated risk for externalizing problems. Further, family-focused interventions that address externalizing problems may be especially effective for adolescent girls.

T1  - Diversity exposure in preschool: Longitudinal implications for cross-race friendships and racial bias
AN  - 2178947827
AB  - Intergroup contact among young children has implications for improving racial attitudes and social inclusion. This study examined associations between children's (N = 670) racial biases and cross-race friendships, and whether diverse people and materials in the preschool classroom predicted children's racial biases or cross-race friendships in first or third grades. Results demonstrated weak-moderate stability in racial biases and cross-race friendship across elementary school. First-grade cross-race friendship predicted lower third-grade racial bias, but not vice versa. Exposure to diverse people in preschool was associated with greater odds of having a cross-race friend in first-grade, which predicted the likelihood of having a cross-race friend and lower levels of racial bias in third grade. Diverse materials predicted lower levels of racial bias in first grade, which predicted third-grade racial bias. Results suggest that educators can promote intergroup friendships and positive attitudes by increasing children's exposure to diverse people and materials in the preschool classroom.

T1  - Intergroup resource distribution among children living in segregated neighborhoods amid protracted conflict
AN  - 2136511737
AB  - Even after a peace agreement, children often grow up within societies characterized by division and simmering intergroup tensions. In Northern Ireland, segregated Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods occur side by side, separated by “peace walls” or physical barriers that demarcate “interface” areas, which have higher levels of violence compared with non-interface areas. The study explored the impact of living in interface and non-interface neighborhoods, the strength of ingroup identity, and outgroup attitudes on intergroup resource distributions of 88 children aged between 5 and 9 years old, growing up in Belfast. The findings revealed that compared with those in non-interface areas, children living in interface neighborhoods distributed more resources to an ingroup member than an outgroup member. This effect was accentuated for those children that more strongly identified with their community group, either Protestant or Catholic. At the same time, children with more positive outgroup attitudes distributed more resources to an outgroup member, but only in non-interface neighborhoods. By applying a framework that incorporates converging social and developmental processes, the study adds to a mounting body of research that aims to understand the impact of living in divided societies on children’s intergroup attitudes and behaviors. The implications for promoting resource sharing across group lines within post-accord Northern Ireland are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Organs and organisations: Situating ethics in organ donation after circulatory death in the UK
AN  - 2100879305
AB  - Controlled organ donation after circulatory death (DCD) has recently been revived in the UK, as part of attempts to increase organ donation rates. The re-introduction of DCD has subsequently become the focus of bioethical controversy, since it necessitates intervening in the care of dying patients to obtain quality donor organs. Transplant policy responses to these concerns have generated new legal and ethical guidelines to address uncertainties around DCD, producing claims that the UK has overcome’ the ethical challenge of DCD. In contrast, by drawing on Lynch's call to ‘respecify’ ethics, this paper argues that ethics in DCD cannot be reduced to abstract directives for practice, but, instead, are composed and dealt with as an organisational problem. To do this, I utilise data from an ethnographic study examining the production of the ‘minority ethnic organ donor’ within UK organ donation settings; in particular, the data pertains to a case hospital which was in the process of developing a DCD programme during the period of fieldwork. Findings show that the ethics of DCD are encountered as practical sets of problems, constructed in relation to particular institutional locales. I describe how these issues are worked-around by creating conditions to make DCD organisationally possible, and through the animation of standard procedures into acceptable forms of practice. I argue that ethics in DCD go far beyond normative bioethical principles, to encompass concerns around: the reputation of hospital Trusts, public perceptions of organ donation, the welfare of potential donor families, and challenges to the work of health professionals caring for dying patients. The paper enriches understanding of ethics in science and medicine by showing how ethics are assembled and negotiated as a practical-organisational concern, and calls for further examination of how DCD gets constructed as a potential problem and is made to happen in practice.

T1  - Intersectional Oppression: Multiple Stigmatized Identities and Perceptions of Invisibility, Discrimination, and Stereotyping
AN  - 2058558160
AB  - Participants (N = 602; having 0, 1, 2 or 3 stigmatized identities based on gender, race, sexual orientation, and social class) completed a survey on their feelings of invisibility and expectations of receiving unfair treatment (i.e., experiencing discrimination) and being stereotyped due to their group memberships. The results were consistent with the model of intersectional invisibility, with multiply‐stigmatized individuals reporting feeling more invisible than individuals who had one or zero stigmatized identities. In addition, multiply‐stigmatized individuals reported more unfair treatment and greater stereotype concerns than individuals with one stigmatized identity, with both reporting more unfair treatment/stereotype concerns than individuals without stigmatized identities. Thus, the present data suggest that multiply‐stigmatized individuals are keenly aware of their invisibility and that invisibility represents a source of perceived discrimination and stereotyping for multiply‐stigmatized individuals.

T1  - Perceptions of instability and choice across sexual orientation groups: GPIR
AN  - 1989314623
AB  - Some have described gay and lesbian people as making a “lifestyle choice” while others assert that bisexuality is not a stable or valid identity. This paper examines the possibility that perceived instability and perceived choice, and their associations with prejudice, differ depending on both the sexual orientation of the participant and the target group. Participants varying in sexual orientation were randomly assigned to evaluate heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual targets. Results indicated that negative evaluation of the various target groups was more closely associated with perceived instability than it was with perceived choice. This relationship was moderated by both participant and target sexual orientation; for example, it was weaker for bisexual targets, whose sexual orientations were rated as unstable even among nonbisexual participants who evaluated them positively. A more nuanced understanding of the beliefs underlying prejudice against sexual minorities can be developed by considering targets and participants of many sexual orientations.

T1  - THE USE OF ZINGARI/NOMADI/ROM IN ITALIAN CRIME DISCOURSE
AN  - 2036728006
AB  - This study examines the use of the metonymies zingari/nomadi/rom [Gypsies/Nomads/Roma] in Italian media discourse, in order to critically reflect on their relation to the perception of Roma. The author analyses the frequency of these terms in general discourse and crime discourse, as well as the way they are used in context. The findings reveal that nomadi and rom are used to directly and indirectly index Roma, and have a significant impact on their ethnicisation and criminalisation. In addition, the episodic framing of crime events, combined with the use of these metonymies, erases the Italian government's responsibility for the conditions of Roma in Italy.

T1  - A Test of Interactive Narrative as a Tool Against Prejudice
AN  - 1952106468
AB  - Interactive narratives allow audience members control over characters and unfolding plots. The present study tested exposure effects of an interactive narrative in which audience members adopt the perspective of an immigrant illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico. Results suggested that exposure to the interactive narrative engendered positive affect toward Mexicans in the U.S., which predicted support for social services that would benefit Mexican immigrants. Participants' enjoyment also positively predicted affect and support for social services benefiting Mexican immigrants. Results suggest interactive narratives may be effective tools in helping reduce prejudice toward marginalized social groups.

T1  - Stereotype content of people with acquired brain injury: Warm but incompetent
AN  - 1945575781
AB  - Since stereotypes about people with acquired brain injury (ABI) can lead to prejudice, studying these stereotypes is highly important. In two studies, we examined these stereotypes both on idiosyncratic dimensions and on the two dimensions of the Stereotype Content Model. Participants completed a specific questionnaire about ABI and warmth and competence questionnaires regarding people with ABI and other social groups. Specific stereotypes about ABI were found to be underpinned by dimensions of "cognitive impairments and ADL limitations," "catastrophic outcomes," and "personal and interpersonal development." Within the model, people with ABI were seen as being warm but incompetent. The ambivalent ABI stereotype could elicit prejudicial attitudes that may impede rehabilitation.

T1  - Inducing similarities and differences in imagined contact: A mutual intergroup differentiation approach: GPIR
AN  - 1912608992
AB  - To enhance the prejudice-reducing effects of imagined contact we investigated a novel form of imagined contact ("balanced similarity") which emphasized both similarities and differences between the ingroup(er) and the outgroup(er). Experiment 1 compared balanced similarity with conditions inducing only differences or only similarities. "Balanced similarity" led to more positive outgroup attitudes; its differences with the "high similarity" condition were mediated by reduced distinctiveness threat, whereas its differences with the "low" similarity condition were mediated by higher perceived intergroup similarity. Experiment 2 compared the "balanced similarity" imagined contact scenario with the "standard" (positive) imagined contact scenario (Crisp, Stathi, Turner, & Husnu, 2008), and found that both conditions promoted equally favourable attitudes that were significantly more positive than in the control condition. However, only the "balanced similarity" imagined contact condition differed from the control condition on intergroup anxiety and contact self-efficacy. The "balanced similarity" condition also had an indirect effect (via self-efficacy) on positive action tendencies towards the outgroup. We discuss the utility of "balanced similarity" imagined contact, especially where contact is limited and conflict is present.

T1  - Imagined contact can be more effective for participants with stronger initial prejudices
AN  - 1891673844
AB  - Imagined contact is an intervention that combines the prejudice-reduction of intergroup contact with the easy, low-risk application of imagery-based techniques. Accordingly, it can be applied where direct contact is difficult or risky. However, a possible limitation of imagined contact is that it may not be effective for participants with stronger initial prejudices, which would limit its usefulness and application. Two experiments (N1=103, N2=95) investigated whether initial prejudice moderated imagined contact's effects on explicit attitudes, behavioral intentions (Experiment 1), implicit attitudes, and petition-signing behaviors (Experiment 2) toward two different outgroups. In both experiments, imagined contact was more effective when initial prejudice was higher. Implications for imagined contact theory and application are discussed.

T1  - John Anthony La Rose: Committed to praxis
AN  - 1903890862
AB  - It is timely that on the 10th anniversary of his death, we should revisit the ideas and the work of John Anthony La Rose, a largely unsung Caribbean hero in the struggle against neocolonial domination and racism. As an activist and outspoken opponent of all forms of injustice, La Rose was especially well known for his contributions to the struggles involving ethnic, national and various other minority groups globally. To this extent, he was a resolute warrior, and his political involvement was aided in the age of globalisation, which has been marked by comparatively rapid, large-scale international migrations that have occasioned numerous encounters between and among different ethnic and national groups globally. As is known, those encounters have often resulted in conflict: war, genocide, ethnic cleansing, displacement of millions, prejudice and discrimination against the poor, blacks, Latinos, Muslims, gypsies and so on; and these served to fuel his passions. As a Trinidadian living in Britain, La Rose had a front seat to the formal and informal practices of racism, and from that front seat he was to become a key voice within the Caribbean diaspora. Indeed, the recent development of academic interest in diaspora studies benefits greatly from La Rose's praxis. For central to the concern with diaspora studies in the global age is the injustice that is faced by numerous ethnic, racial and national minorities the world over, and it is that specific form of injustice that fuelled La Rose's social and political passions when he moved to Britain and took up residence in the very belly of the beast.

T1  - Classed attitudes and social reform in cross-national perspective: a quantitative analysis using four waves from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)
AN  - 1891795107
AB  - This article attempts to forge new links between social attitudes and social policy change in Australia. Drawing on four survey waves of international social survey data and using multivariable regression analysis, this article sheds new light on the determinants of Australian attitudes towards the welfare state in a comparative perspective. It examines their variations across time and social groupings and then compares Australian welfare attitudes with those found in other leading western economies. While there is popular support for government actions to protect Australian citizens in old age and sickness, views about social protection and labour market policy for the working-age population are divided. The comparative analysis and the focus on class-attitude linkages allows for further critical reflection on the nature of social relations and recent social reforms enacted by the Liberal-National coalition government.

T1  - Not your average bigot: The better-than-average effect and defensive responding to Implicit Association Test feedback
AN  - 1877776639
AB  - A robust body of literature on the better-than-average effect suggests that people believe that they are better than the average others across a variety of domains. In two studies, we examined whether these better-than-average beliefs occur for bias related to stereotyping and prejudice. Moreover, we investigated the hypothesis that better-than-average beliefs will predict defensive responding to feedback indicating personal bias (e.g., preferences for majority groups, societally endorsed stereotypes). Specifically, we examined defensive responses to implicit attitude feedback. Study 1 examined this prediction using archival analysis of two large, online samples of participants completing a Weight-related Implicit Association Test (IAT). Study 2 conceptually replicated Study 1 using nine different, randomly assigned IATs and additional measures of defensiveness. In both studies, people generally believed that they were less biased than others. Moreover, people responded defensively to feedback indicating they were biased. This effect was moderated by better-than-average beliefs such that feedback indicating societally consistent bias was related to defensiveness most (and sometimes only) when people believed they were better than average initially. This work represents the first foray into examining the possible moderating role of social-comparative beliefs in predicting responses to implicit attitude feedback and spurs several important avenues for future research.

T1  - Alcohol consumption increases bias to shoot at Middle Eastern but not White targets: GPIR
AN  - 1867096516
AB  - Alcohol has been implicated in intergroup aggression and hostility. The effect of consuming alcohol relative to a placebo on hostile cognitive biases toward a social category typically stereotyped as threatening and hostile (i.e., Middle Eastern men) was tested. Undergraduates (N = 81) consumed either an intoxicating dose of alcohol (BrAC = .05% by vol.) or placebo. Then, they played a shooter game in which they were asked to shoot at targets holding guns, but not at targets holding harmless objects. Half of the targets were White and half were Middle Eastern. As predicted, alcohol consumption, relative to a placebo, increased participants' bias to shoot Middle Eastern targets, but did not affect the shooter bias against White targets. Findings suggest that alcohol may heighten aggressive biases toward outgroups stereotyped as threatening and hostile.

T1  - East Asian religious tolerance versus Western monotheist prejudice: The role of (in)tolerance of contradiction: GPIR
AN  - 1867092468
AB  - Accumulated research has shown that Western Christian religiosity often predicts prejudice toward various kinds of outgroups. On the contrary, initial recent evidence indicates that East Asian religiosity predicts tolerance of various outgroups--except atheists. To understand these differences, we investigated cognitive (intolerance of contradiction) and emotional (disgust) mechanisms possibly mediating the link between religiosity and prejudice versus tolerance. In Study 1 (295 Westerners of Christian tradition), high disgust contamination and, to some extent, intolerance of contradiction mediated the relationship between religiosity and prejudice against ethnic (Africans), religious (Muslims), moral (homosexuals), and convictional (atheists) outgroups. However, in Study 2 (196 Taiwanese of Buddhist or Taoist tradition), religiosity was unrelated to disgust, and predicted low intolerance of contradiction, and thus tolerance of the same religious, ethnic, and moral outgroups--but still not of atheists. Cultural differences in cognition and emotion seem to explain East-West differences in religious prejudice.

T1  - Perspectives of Aboriginal issues among non-Aboriginal residents of rural Victorian communities
AN  - 2131581341
AB  - Racism, in various forms, remains a dominant feature in Australian society. Aboriginal Australians are commonly targets of racial discrimination. However, understanding racism is difficult given that racial attitudes vary towards particular groups of people, across place and time and are difficult to measure. This paper presents responses of residents across four rural shires in Victoria to questions about attitudes towards Aboriginal people/issues. Responses indicated that attitudes towards Aboriginal people were diverse and that individuals varied in their attitudes on specific items. There were subtle differences between the four sites and association between demographic characteristics and some items in particular sites. This suggests that respondents are inconsistent in their attitudes relating to Aboriginal people/issues and that there are place-based influences on these attitudes. We conclude that the many varied understandings of racism and Aboriginal Australians allow the discourses of exclusion, disempowerment and othering to be maintained.

T1  - Contact, Political Solidarity and Collective Action: An Indian Case Study of Relations between Historically Disadvantaged Communities
AN  - 1855255752
AB  - Research on the contact hypothesis has highlighted the role of contact in improving intergroup relations. Most of this research has addressed the problem of transforming the prejudices of historically advantaged communities, thereby eroding wider patterns of discrimination and inequality. In the present research, drawing on evidence from a cross-sectional survey conducted in New Delhi, we explored an alternative process through which contact may promote social change, namely by fostering political solidarity and empowerment amongst the disadvantaged. The results indicated that Muslim students' experiences of contact with other disadvantaged communities were associated with their willingness to participate in joint collective action to reduce shared inequalities. This relationship was mediated by perceptions of collective efficacy and shared historical grievances and moderated by positive experiences of contact with the Hindu majority. Implications for recent debates about the relationship between contact and social change are discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Solidarity with Animals: Assessing a Relevant Dimension of Social Identification with Animals
AN  - 1855060811
AB  - Interactions with animals are pervasive in human life, a fact that is reflected in the burgeoning field of human-animal relations research. The goal of the current research was to examine the psychology of our social connection with other animals, by specifically developing a measure of solidarity with animals. In 8 studies using correlational, experimental, and longitudinal designs, solidarity with animals predicted more positive attitudes and behaviors toward animals, over and above existing scales of identification, and even when this implied a loss of resources and privileges for humans relative to animals. Solidarity with animals also displayed predicted relationships with relevant variables (anthropomorphism, empathy). Pet owners and vegetarians displayed higher levels of solidarity with animals. Correlational and experimental evidence confirmed that human-animal similarity heightens solidarity with animals. Our findings provide a useful measure that can facilitate important insights into the nature of our relationships with animals.

T1  - News Framing of Obama, Racialized Scrutiny, and Symbolic Racism
AN  - 1851145663
AB  - The current study examines the Barack Obama presidency through the lens of racialized news framing and symbolic racism. Racial prejudice often manifests as subtle symbolic racism in so-called postracial America by supporting beliefs that racial minorities have gained undeserved advantage and are no longer discriminated against. Even when counter-stereotypic leaders such as President Obama from racial/ethnic minority groups are elected to positions of authority, they are subject to tokenism, heightened visibility, and racialized scrutiny in the media in ways that reinforce cultural stereotypes. The current study uses a between-participants experiment (N = 168) to examine how exposure to positive versus negative news frames of Obama have differential effects on White participants' symbolic racist beliefs. From a priming perspective, exposure to negative frames of President Obama is likely to activate underlying prejudicial feelings that lead to biased evaluations of African Americans as a whole. Using path analysis, the present study builds a causal chain of relationships that reveals that exposure to negative news frames of Obama as compared to positive ones activates readers' anti-Black affect, which in turn increases their symbolic racist beliefs. Implications of the findings for race/ethnic studies, political communication and journalism are discussed.

T1  - Accountable Preferences? Discourse, Identity, and the Anti-Prejudice Norm
AN  - 1815584886
AB  - There is, today, a powerful social norm against the expression of prejudice. Hence, as shown in many discursive studies, speakers treat prejudice as an accountable matter and use various strategies (e.g., disclaimers, mitigation, denials, and reformulations) to avoid being seen as personally prejudiced. Analysts have identified this practice as a "new" form of discriminatory discourse, which allows expression of prejudice without negative identity repercussions. Relevant studies are generally undertaken from a critical perspective and focus on structural inequalities (particularly race and gender). However, speakers may also demonstrate sensitivity around unexpected issues which lack overt prejudice connotations. This article examines one such example of unexpected sensitivity to the anti-prejudice norm. It analyses how five young female academics problematise and resolve their preference for an "intelligent" romantic partner. Their preference is uncontroversial in relationship terms, but here, in the academic context, it is clearly treated as accountable and as possibly inviting negative attributions. The data show functional and lexical features of "new" discriminatory discourse. The speakers orient towards attributions of intellectual elitism and use various means to deflect these, while ultimately upholding their stated preference for an intelligent partner. The analysis demonstrates how the anti-prejudice norm extends across settings/topics and how accountability is occasioned and context specific. This has implications for how prejudice itself, as a discursive construct, may be identified and evidenced. Specifically, it might be argued that analysts only have empirical access to accountability (occasioned in specific contexts), rather than to exclusionary or prejudiced ideologies per se.

T1  - Building Trust in a Postconflict Society: An Integrative Model of Cross-group Friendship and Intergroup Emotions
AN  - 1909274132
AB  - Across one longitudinal and two cross-sectional surveys in Northern Ireland, we tested a model of intergroup relations in which out-group attitudes and behavioral tendencies are predicted by cross-group friendship and positive intergroup appraisals, mediated by intergroup emotions and out-group trust. In study 1, out-group friendship at time 1 predicted out-group trust at time 2 (one year later), controlling for prior out-group trust. In study 2, positive and negative intergroup emotions mediated the effects of friendship on positive and negative behavioral tendencies and attitudes. In study 3, a confirmatory factor analysis indicated that trust and emotions are distinct constructs with unique predictive contributions. We then tested a model in which cross-group friendship predicted intergroup emotions and trust through intimate self-disclosure in out-group friendships. Our findings support an integration of an intergroup emotions framework with research highlighting the importance of cross-group friendship in fostering positive intergroup outcomes.

T1  - Ambivalence and Discourse in Alien Nation
AN  - 1814344373
AB  - This study examines the 1988 film Alien Nation, detailing the fictitious account of racism and bigotry in the USA toward a group of extraterrestrials. This account is analogous to attitudes toward ethnic minorities. It incorporates theories from Mikhail Bakhtin and Paolo Freire to show how the film upholds negative attitudes toward minorities.

T1  - Preference for the Diversity Policy Label Versus the Affirmative Action Policy Label
AN  - 1789707707
AB  - Study 1 assessed associations with the labels "diversity policy" (DP) and "affirmative action policy" (AAP) and perceptions of potential policy components. Student and community participants (N = 143) completed a survey assessing associations with one of the policy labels. Both policies evoked similar associations such as "race/minorities" and "equality/equal opportunity," but the AAP was more often associated with "bias/inequality/discrimination," "unfairness," and "racism/prejudice." When rating potential policy components, reverse discrimination was considered more likely under the AAP. In Study 2 we explored the evaluation of equivalent policy components associated with different policy labels. Student participants (N = 126) rated the policy labeled as the DP more favorably than the AAP. Both studies suggest more favorable attitudes toward the DP label.

T1  - The other neighbour paradox: fantasies and frustrations of 'living together' in Antwerp
AN  - 1786264985
AB  - In this paper, Vollebergh investigates the commitment to establishing intercultural encounters by so-called 'active' white Flemish residents in Antwerp, and their perpetual disappointment with the responses of their neighbours of orthodox Jewish and Moroccan backgrounds. Instead of viewing these relationships either as a product of culturalist social cohesion policies, or as a vernacular ethical achievement that escapes culturalist politics, she argues that we should understand them through the figure of the Neighbour. Combining the theories of Emmanuel Levinas and Slavoj Zizek, she suggests that the neighbourly relation is a paradox in which the Neighbour as a nearby Other induces both an ethical desire for total openness in the engagement with this Other, as well as the uncanny sense that his/her Otherness haunts and makes impossible such an engagement. When viewed in this way, vernacular intercultural relationships, and the fantasies and frustrations surrounding them, emerge as the site where residents of multi-ethnic neighbourhoods in postcolonial Europe engage and struggle with existential and ethical questions of human interconnection and, especially, the effects of the culturalist inflection that these questions have gained.

T1  - Americans' Belief in Linked Fate: Does the Measure Capture the Concept?
AN  - 1951414816
AB  - For decades, scholars have attributed Black Americans' unified political and policy views, despite growing internal class and status differences, to a strong perception of linked fate. In recent years, the concept has been measured in other racial and ethnic groups and with regard to gender, but not applied to social statuses such as class or religion. Without broad comparisons across groups and different statuses, however, one cannot determine the appropriate empirical test or most distinctive correlates of this canonical construct. Using a new national survey, we examine Americans' views of linked fate by race or ethnicity, and also by gender, class, or religion. We find expressions of linked fate to be similar across racial or ethnic groups, robust to experimental manipulation, and as strong for class as for racial or ethnic identity. Intra-individual correlations on linked fate items are very high, while a sense of linked fate is rarely associated with political views or political participation. Expressions of linked fate are not always closely related to feelings of closeness to one's group or perceptions of discrimination against that group. We speculate on the broader meaning of responses to this standard item, and conclude that the enormously fruitful theory of racial linked fate is due for further conceptual development and empirical experimentation.

T1  - Inclusiveness as Construction of Open Identity: How Social Relationships Affect Attitudes Towards Immigrants in European Societies
AN  - 1764078084
AB  - Studies of individual and group-level sources of prejudice have contributed to today's greater understanding of the emergence of prejudice and discriminatory attitudes towards immigrants. Yet, scholars have claimed that future research should investigate institutional and socio-political macro-level factors affecting individuals' attitudes towards outsiders (Ceobanu and Escandell in Ann Rev Sociol 36:309-328, 2010 ). To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, this article goes across levels of analysis and theories to provide insights about group-level sources influencing attitudes towards immigrants. These sources are taken into account as both institutional and social factors involved in processes of national identity constructions. To this purpose, this work combines Blumer's perspective (Pac Sociol Rev 1:3-7, 1958 ) with both the distinction Weber (Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Tübingen, Mohr, 1922 ) made between open and closed social relationships and some other theoretical contributions that emerged in the field. The findings of a multilevel analysis confirm that, whereby inclusive socio-political factors are involved in the processes of countries' identity constructions, individuals show more positive attitudes towards immigrants. In addition, in inclusive countries, a society's high regard for its own traditions and customs influences individual members to appreciate other cultures and show positive dispositions towards outsiders.

T1  - Testing a New Theoretical Model for Attitudes Toward Immigrants: The Case of Social Workers' Attitudes Toward Asylum Seekers in Israel
AN  - 1752001706
AB  - The present study proposes a new threat-benefit theoretical model explaining attitudes of local people toward immigrants. Based on the theory of human values and extending Integrative Threat Theory, the threat-benefit model suggests that the local population perceives immigrants as both threatening and beneficial for the receiving society. The model assumes that appraisal of an immigrant group as threatening or beneficial for the receiving society influences opinions regarding immigration policy related to the immigrant group. The study assessed the new model investigating attitudes toward asylum seekers in a representative sample of 283 social workers in Israel. Results of the study support a conceptualization of immigrant appraisal involving four types of threats (economic, physical, social cohesion, and modernity) and four types of benefits (economic, physical, cultural diversity, and humanitarian), which represent different types of realistic and symbolic threats and benefits. Findings showed that appraisal of asylum seekers as beneficial or threatening to the receiving society mediated the connections between personal preferences for values of universalism, power, social security, and tradition and support for immigration policy directed either at defending immigrants' rights or defending the receiving society. Application of the model for understanding attitudes toward different minorities as well as for creation of value-based interventions and programs aimed at reducing negative attitudes toward various stigmatized groups in society are discussed.

T1  - Color-cognizance and Color-blindness in White America
AN  - 2406941593
AB  - This study estimates how many white Americans believe that white identity is connected to the treatment they receive and the life chances of their racial group, and it explores the extent to which color-cognizance and color-blindness are related to the racial policy preferences of whites. The analysis uses data from five nationwide public opinion polls fielded between 2000 and 2009. Contingency tables are used to determine the prevalence of perceptions of racial privilege, racial disadvantage, and racial irrelevance, and logistic regression models are used to predict the determinant value of these perceptions on policy support. This study finds that a minority of white Americans report benefits from being white. However, whites who perceive racial privileges are consistently more supportive of policies aimed at minimizing such advantages and are more intent on securing racially equitable treatment than are those whites who believe that white identity is a liability. The analysis also finds that privilege-reporting whites are more likely to support a diversity-driven form of affirmative action than are their racial counterparts who express color-blind beliefs. Finally, this study provides evidence that whites who espouse color-blind views are more likely to support racially progressive policies when compared with whites who report racial disadvantages. The discussion advises researchers to remain attentive to the dominant population’s articulated views of whiteness and the fissures that animate their internal political differences.

T1  - Equality and Diversity in the Classroom: A Comparison of Students' and Teachers' Attitudes in Six European Countries
AN  - 1619439582
AB  - Globalisation and increased mobility of people within the EU have led to increased immigration and greater diversity within many EU countries, which have affected the composition of workplaces and classrooms. This includes diversity in terms of nationality, as well as ethnic, racial and religious diversity. This article expands awareness of diversity issues in the workplace to classrooms. It is based on a crosscultural comparative study of the attitudes of secondary school students and their teachers in six European countries: Ireland, the UK, France, Latvia, Italy and Spain. The sample included 320 students and 208 teachers for a total of 528 respondents. The article compares and contrasts attitudes towards non-national students, ethnic and religious minorities and disabled students, as well as gender issues, bullying and general perceptions of equality and diversity. The findings demonstrate generally positive attitudes among young people towards the increasing diversity in their classrooms. Moreover, the study revealed that in countries where there is greater diversity, the perception of difficulties is lower than in countries with less experience of diversity, suggesting that greater diversity and intergroup contact is resulting in more inclusive attitudes in schools. However, results comparing students with teachers identified consistent gaps in perceptions, with teachers having greater estimates of difficulties posed by diversity, together with smaller estimates of bullying behaviour. The study demonstrated that there is a need for teachers to have enhanced skills and competencies to deal effectively with this new environment in order to facilitate a more inclusive classroom.

T1  - Looking at Muslims: the visibility of Islam in contemporary French cinema
AN  - 1680151553; 201514082
AB  - Tarr analyses the representation of Islam in five feature films made since 2006 that centre on the changing identities of Muslims in contemporary France. She locates the films within the context of the rise in Islamophobia in France following 9/11 and anxieties about immigration and terrorism, but also in relation to France's troubled postcolonial history and French republican ideology. In particular, the French notion of laicite (secularism) has given rise to active hostility to any public expression of religious or cultural difference, particularly on the part of Muslims. Cinematic representations of Muslims, and particularly of the children of migrants from the Maghreb, have, therefore, since the mid-1980s, been treated with caution in order not to alienate mainstream Franco-French audiences and to facilitate the second generation's integration into French society. However, the five feature films addressed here-two mainstream popular comedies, Mauvaise foi/Bad Faith (2006) and L'Italien/The Italian (2010), and three independent, low budget, auteur-led, realist films, Dans la vie/Two Ladies (2008), Dernier maquis (2008) and La Desintegration/Disintegration (2012)-offer new narratives that challenge fears of Islam by foregrounding the protagonists' negotiation of their Muslim identities in a French context and, by implication, argue for the integration of Islam as a legitimate referent of French identity. However, their construction of Islam does not extend to positive representations of young veiled women, and they thus still risk confirming the oppressive majority view that certain practices associated with Islam, such as the wearing of the veil, are incompatible with the secularism of the French Republic. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Rules of Implicit Evaluation by Race, Religion, and Age
AN  - 1916124469
AB  - The social world is stratified. Social hierarchies are known but often disavowed as anachronisms or unjust. Nonetheless, hierarchies may persist in social memory. In three studies (total N > 200,000), we found evidence of social hierarchies in implicit evaluation by race, religion, and age. Participants implicitly evaluated their own racial group most positively and the remaining racial groups in accordance with the following hierarchy: Whites > Asians > Blacks > Hispanics. Similarly, participants implicitly evaluated their own religion most positively and the remaining religions in accordance with the following hierarchy: Christianity > Judaism > Hinduism or Buddhism > Islam. In a final study, participants of all ages implicitly evaluated age groups following this rule: children > young adults > middle-age adults > older adults. These results suggest that the rules of social evaluation are pervasively embedded in culture and mind.

T1  - HIV prevention interventions to reduce sexual risk for African Americans: The influence of community-level stigma and psychological processes
AN  - 1692287895; 201523660
AB  - Interventions to improve public health may benefit from consideration of how environmental contexts can facilitate or hinder their success. We examined the extent to which efficacy of interventions to improve African Americans' condom use practices was moderated by two indicators of structural stigma-Whites' attitudes toward African Americans and residential segregation in the communities where interventions occurred. A previously published meta-analytic database was re-analyzed to examine the interplay of community-level stigma with the psychological processes implied by intervention content in influencing intervention efficacy. All studies were conducted in the United States and included samples that were at least 50% African American. Whites' attitudes were drawn from the American National Election Studies, which collects data from nationally representative samples. Residential segregation was drawn from published reports. Results showed independent effects of Whites' attitudes and residential segregation on condom use effect sizes. Interventions were most successful when Whites' attitudes were more positive or when residential segregation was low. These two structural factors interacted: Interventions improved condom use only when communities had both relatively positive attitudes toward African Americans and lower levels of segregation. The effect of Whites' attitudes was more pronounced at longer follow-up intervals and for younger samples and those samples with more African Americans. Tailoring content to participants' values and needs, which may reduce African Americans' mistrust of intervention providers, buffered against the negative influence of Whites' attitudes on condom use. The structural factors uniquely accounted for variance in condom use effect sizes over and above intervention-level features and community-level education and poverty. Results highlight the interplay of social identity and environment in perpetuating intergroup disparities. Potential mechanisms for these effects are discussed along with public health implications.

T1  - Antisemitic obsessions: the case of H. W. Wicks
AN  - 1520331150; 201413112
AB  - Henry William Wicks is a very unusual case. A conspiracy theorist, whose efforts at litigation had led him to jail in 1936, he became convinced, under the influence of his fellow prisoner Arnold Leese, that the Jews were responsible for all his ills. In 1937-9 he spent much time moving in British antisemitic and pro-Nazi circles and, in early 1939, he took his family to Germany, publicly proclaiming in the newspapers that they were 'refugees from Jew-controlled England'. After the outbreak of war he wrote broadcasting scripts for the German government, was later interned, but in 1942 returned to working for a Nazi broadcasting station. Despite many lies and obfuscations as to his wartime role, he was sentenced in 1946 to four years' penal servitude. His case is interesting for a number of reasons. First, he stands as an example of how the ideologies of the time could affect people who were already vulnerable in various ways. This extreme example illustrates, however, the fact that most antisemites are, often less obviously, subject to similar obsessions and irrational hatreds. His case puts these issues under the magnifying glass, illustrating some of the constants in antisemitic behaviour. Finally, he is also one of the best examples of the syndrome whereby those who had been involved in such activities 'rewrote' history in the post-war period. In Wicks's case, his often convincing lies, found in his post-war writings and at his trial, are unfortunately for him found to be wanting when placed against the contemporary evidence of his letters from the period 1939-43, which were at the disposal of his accusers, and which can now be found in the released MI5 files. Where other renegades, such as Margaret Bothamley (who successfully convinced the courts that she was just a confused elderly lady) got away with it, Wicks failed miserably. This was yet another example of his pathetic lack of success in all his ventures. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Essentialism, historical construction, and social influence: Representations of Pomakness in majority talk in Western Thrace (Greece)
AN  - 1541997723; 201426792
AB  - Social psychological research has been particularly interested to study essentialism in the construction of social categories and to manifest its potential consequences in intergroup attitudes. Drawing upon this literature, the present study focuses on the argumentative resources employed to construct ethnic categories in a specific rhetorical context: focus group discussions between majority Greek educators about the minority group of Pomaks, historically residing in Western Thrace (Greece). Discussions were framed as an attempt to capture the particularities of minority education and data were analysed by the use of tools and concepts of discursive and rhetorical psychology. Analysis indicates that participants have multiple and complex recourses available to construct Pomakness. Representations of Pomakness as an essential a-historical entity coexist with conceptions of category membership and identification as a result of certain historical conditions and processes of social influence. Essential and de-essential category constructions are approached as rhetorically situated, oriented towards specific rhetorical ends in specific argumentative contexts. They are also considered, however, to be nested within a complex and dynamic intergroup context which reflects the ideological contradictions of the Greek policy towards the minority and which constitutes (but it is also reconstituted by) shifting group definitions and boundaries.

T1  - Favorable Contact During Volunteer Service: Reducing Prejudice Toward Mexicans in the American Southwest
AN  - 1494748628; 201401925
AB  - We assessed religious volunteers' intergroup contact, realistic threat perceptions, symbolic threat perceptions, intergroup anxiety, negative stereotypes and prejudice toward Mexicans before and approximately 4-6 months into their volunteer service. Whether assigned to serve Mexicans or European-Americans, all volunteers experienced reduced prejudice toward Mexicans. A multiple mediator model suggests that changes in prejudice resulted from a mediated relationship between quality contact and prejudice. Specifically, intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes mediated the relationship. The benefits of volunteerism as a means of fostering favorable intergroup contact and reducing threat perceptions and prejudice are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - "There but for the grace of God go we": Prejudice toward asylum seekers
AN  - 1448996589; 201342910
AB  - Australia receives relatively few asylum seekers, but the public debate on this issue is intense and there is widespread prejudice toward them. The current research considers the role of two approaches in explaining prejudice toward asylum seekers: similarity priming and affective reactions of empathy. Participants (N = 119) were primed that asylum seekers were either "similar" to or "different" from them and were asked whether these similarities or differences were important. Dispositional empathy and asylum-seeker empathy were measured. Results showed that priming was associated with increased prejudice when priming involved similarity and those similarities were held to be important. Moreover, cognitive similarity priming and affective empathy contributed separately and additively to the prediction of prejudice. Qualitative responses to the priming question revealed that even when "difference" was primed, two of the three prevalent themes were positive. Results are discussed in relation to understanding the cognitive and affective bases of empathy and prejudice, and practical implications for activists working to reduce prejudice toward asylum seekers.

T1  - Out-group trust, intergroup anxiety, and out-group attitude as mediators of the effect of imagined intergroup contact on intergroup behavioral tendencies
AN  - 1433108353
AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an out-group member would change behavioral tendencies toward the out-group. In Experiment 1, British high school students who imagined talking to an asylum seeker reported a stronger tendency to approach asylum seekers than did participants in a control condition. Path analysis revealed this relationship was mediated by out-group trust and, marginally, by out-group attitude. In Experiment 2, straight undergraduates who imagined an interaction with a gay individual reported a stronger tendency to approach, and a weaker tendency to avoid, gay people. Path analyses showed that these relationships were mediated by out-group trust, out-group attitude, and less intergroup anxiety. These findings highlight the potential practical importance of imagined contact and important mediators of its effects.

T1  - Roma People within the Global Process of Change
AN  - 1665202512
AB  - Although there is temptation to judge the Roma community as having a strong cultural constancy and stability in time, as surviving at the periphery of societies, outside the process of modernization, this paper aims to make an analysis of the factors which caused important changes in the socio-economic and cultural state of this community within the context of globalization. The prejudice that the Roma are a community closed within its traditional culture had and still has adverse effects on the perception which the majority population has about the Roma community and on the support policies for the marginalised segments of the Roma population too. In some ways, the Roma population doesn't have a different pattern from all the other populations, minority or majority. All the populations are engaged in a process of social change and reconstruction, of transition from traditional to modern cultural patterns imposed by a dynamic society undergoing fast modernization. It is true though, that modernization is not only an opportunity through the unavoidable commitment of the communities within the global flow of change, but also a process of new social differentiation. The division of work has generated new pressures of internal differentiation for all populations: some people advanced socially, others remained at the margin of the process. The popular history of the Roma, with the myths of any such history, includes also the intellectuals, prestigious politicians and successful people as main patterns of exiting the 'Gypsyhood'. But in spite of this, the paper underline that the concrete social and economic conditions put, in many cases, the Roma population, as ethnic group in a special social and cultural position different from that of other minorities. These papers bring a theoretical starting point for an empirical survey focusing on the successful Roma population. The survey was an exploratory research done by IQLR at the end of 2012, being centred on the Roma elite: intellectuals, political leaders and businessmen. The research has been identified three successful categories among the Roma people, mentioned above, as well as the factors associated to their success. The survey data are yet to be processed completely. However, they will certainly bring another perception/image on the Roma people, different from the one associated to severe poverty, as shown by the sociological research up to now.

T1  - Reversing Implicit Gender Stereotype Activation as a Function of Exposure to Traditional Gender Roles
AN  - 1429627677; 201335603
AB  - We examined the influence of exposure to traditional gender roles on the activation of gender stereotypes in Spanish women. An associative procedure was used to expose participants to stereotypical vs. counterstereotypical gender roles, and a word categorization task with stereotypically feminine communal/warmth and stereotypically masculine agentic/competence trait words measured participants' automatic responses. Results show that women exposed to traditional roles reverse the activation of gender stereotypes. That is, they activated competence/agency faster for female primes and warmth/communion faster for male primes in a subsequent task. The implicit stereotype reversal was predicted by participants' endorsement of positive attitudes toward affirmative action policies. The results are discussed in terms of the motivational influence of perceived discrimination in intergroup relations. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Integrating a historical perspective into studies of prejudicial attitudes facilitates the interpretation of paradoxical findings of the kind cited in the target article. History also encourages research to move beyond the study of prejudice and to consider institutional and structural forces that maintain social inequities. Multilevel approaches can study these factors in both field and laboratory studies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The language of sacrifice: masculinities in Northern Ireland and the consequences of the Great War
AN  - 1283644053; 201303397
AB  - In the aftermath of the First World War, veterans often became symbols of broken masculinity, standing in the popular imagination every Armistice Day as emblems of the futility of war. In stark contrast, Ulster-reconstituted as Northern Ireland after the partition of Ireland in 1921-did not consign the Great War to the pages of history. Veterans of the trenches became cherished icons of manly heroism and bravery. However, the sectarian tensions that pre-dated the war by many years infiltrated commemorations of ex-servicemen, and some men were honoured far above others. Soldiers from the 36th (Ulster) Division were remembered in a 'language of sacrifice' as valiant unionist heroes whose blood shed at the Somme had sanctified the British connection; men who had fought elsewhere, particularly in the 10th (Irish) or 16th (Irish) Divisions, were pointedly omitted from this pantheon of warrior masculinities. Veterans of the 36th Ulsters were given preference in labour, political and social circles, while presumed nationalists were discriminated against and even terrorized by those who felt that service in the Ulster Division was the only acceptable war record. The consequences of the Great War created a hierarchy that had far-reaching consequences in Northern Ireland for the rest of the century. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Women and warfare at the start of the twentieth century: the racialization of the 'enemy' during the South African War (1899-1902)
AN  - 1283644051; 201303298
AB  - The internment of Boer civilians in concentration camps by the British military authorities during the South African War of 1899-1902 was a highly controversial policy, not least because around 26,000 women and children were estimated to have died as a result of epidemics in the camps. Both supporters and opponents of the camps addressed the policy using gendered language rooted in ideas about British standards of 'civilization'. Apologists defined the camps as one of the protective measures of the chivalrous British authorities, and downplayed the significance of the mortality rates by blaming infant deaths on the maternal shortcomings of Boer women. Opponents, however, stressed similarities between the British and Boer peoples, and invoked gendered language to attack what were held to be barbaric policies towards defenceless members of the community. At the heart of both discourses was a belief in British aspirations to embody an ideal 'civilization', underpinned by traditional gender ideologies. The association of this concept of 'civilization' with not merely cultural but racial difference led to the development of a racialized image of the enemy, rooted perhaps more strongly in perceptions of the female Boer civilian than of the male soldier.

T1  - THE RACIALIZATION OF PUBLIC DISCOURSE: Antisemitism and Islamophobia in Italian society
AN  - 1551001697; 201429071
AB  - The objective of this research is to understand the nature and diffusion of antisemitism and Islamophobia in Italy. It is based on 1528 interviews among a representative sample of the Italian population stratified according to age, gender, and residence. The questionnaire used was built by a set of different scales: antisemitic, Islamophobic, and three others scales to take into account authoritarian, ethnocentric, and anomic attitudes. To test assumptions regarding the impact of these predictors of antisemitic and Islamophobic prejudice, it was decided to adopt the statistical technique of path analysis. Outcomes of our research draw attention on the distribution of antisemitism and Islamophobia among Italian people, their nature as a combination of old and new prejudices, and their linking with broader sets of attitudes such as anomie, ethnocentrism, and authoritarianism.

T1  - ATHEISM IN POST-SOCIALIST CONDITIONS: THE CASE OF SLOVENIA
AN  - 1220622515
AB  - In post-socialist Slovenia one observes the re-emergence of certain traditional defamatory attitudes toward atheism. For this reason, empirical testing of the following theses, which have been publically promulgated by leading representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, have been undertaken in recent years: 1. that atheists are unhappy; 2. that atheists are unreflective about life; 3. that atheists are immoral; and 4. that atheists do not feel solidarity with social minorities. On the basis of data collected by ISSP, EVS, and WVS research studies, it is possible to claim that these statements made by the Catholic Church about Slovene atheists are unsubstantiated. Especially as regards "convinced atheists" and "natural atheists" who exhibit above-average levels of happiness, aboveaverage belief as to the meaning of life, average moral rigour and below-average social distance in relation to various social minorities. The explanations of such findings will be pursued in a comparative analysis of the ethos and value habitus of Catholicism on the one hand, and in the secular ideologies that have been present in Slovenia on the other.

T1  - Social psychology and discourse
AN  - 917415656
AB  - The book defines social psychology as "a branch of psychology, ... in which the nature and causes of people's behavior are considered in relation to social situation" (2), and discourse, either spoken utterances (talk) or written utterances (text), as "a phenomenon which has its own properties, properties which have an impact on people and their social interaction"(8).

To highlight the relevance of discursive research to social psychology, the book is organized around central themes (identity, relationships, prejudice, the law, and health) in social psychology, rather than around different aspects of discursive research (conversational analysis, discourse analysis, critical discourse analysis, Foucauldian discourse analysis, narrative analysis, etc.).

With a host of user-friendly features such as chapter outlines, key terms, descriptions of classic studies, activity questions, further reading, and a glossary, the book, though dealing with massive numbers of studies and complex theories, appears highly accessible to newcomers to this field.

T1  - Marijuana Prohibition In California: Racial Prejudice And Selective-Arrests
AN  - 1347781247; 201318955
AB  - In 1913, California outlawed marijuana on the basis of express racial animus. The federal government prohibited marijuana in 1937 on a similar basis. We hypothesize that the racism behind marijuana prohibition influences current arrests. An analysis of data from 2000-2008 in California connects the racialized origins of marijuana prohibition to current marijuana arrests. Blacks and Hispanics are significantly more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana offense. We conclude that marijuana prohibition is too entangled with racism to be fairly enforced today. Evaluating selective-arrests, we show evidence of institutional racism regarding marijuana prohibition in California. We argue that a medical marijuana framework should replace prohibition, returning to the policy that existed prior the beginning of prohibition. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Images of the Self and the Other in Paul Rohrbach's 'German Idea'
AN  - 1531932495; 201423353
AB  - Rash presents the results of a close linguistic analysis of the 1912 monograph Der deutsche Gedanke in der Welt (The German Idea in the World) by the German political journalist and economist Paul Rohrbach (1869-1956). Rohrbach's monograph is a 250-page tract expressing nationalist and expansionist sentiments. It compares the British, as experienced players on the world stage, with the Germans, who were, in 1912, still hoping to join Britain (or 'England' as Rohrbach usually had it) as a Weltvolk, a 'world people' or 'world power', with equal rights and responsibilities. Rash adopts the methods of corpus-assisted discourse studies (CADS) devised for qualitative analysis by Paul Baker and his colleagues. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - En/countering disablement in school life in Australia: children talk about peer relations and living with illness and disability
AN  - 1023030692; 201223914
AB  - This paper reports the experiential accounts of 24 young people with physical disability or chronic illness as they make the transition to junior high school, with a particular focus on their social experiences with peers and friends. Children's reports were examined in a reflexive, disability studies framework, in which commonalities and difference in experience were examined. These reports highlight a common experience of disability-related harassment and differential experiences of friendship, peer rejection and school culture. While children encounter and actively counter disablement in a variety of ways, it is clear that these children are also cognisant of the stigma, prejudices and disabling expectations that are at the core of these experiences.

T1  - Opposing Islamification or promoting Islamophobia? Understanding the English Defence League
AN  - 964197837; 201207380
AB  - The emergence and growth of the English Defence League (EDL) in the past two years as a socio-political mass movement are unprecedented in the British setting. Initially dismissed and duly condemned as a racist and Islamophobic far-right organization, little is known about the EDL. Allen's article begins by tracing the development of British far-right political groups that were trail-blazers in campaigning against the alleged threat posed by Muslims and Islam since 2001. The rise -- and subsequent fall -- of the British National Party is considered as a vehicle for understanding the climate in which hostility to Muslims has become increasingly apparent. It is in this context that the messages and discourse of the EDL are explored, as well as in regard to the organization's roots in the English football hooligan fraternity and specific events in Luton in the spring of 2009. Allen looks at the EDL's innovative use of social networking -- in particular its use of Facebook -- to support its street marches and protests, as well as its recognition of the economic impact it has had, given the costs associated with policing its marches and protests. Having established how the EDL is supported both actively and passively, not least through a somewhat unique coalition that brings together sometimes disparate groups on the basis of "the enemy of my own enemy is my friend" -- including groups that have historically been discriminated against by the far right -- Allen considers the the arguments for recognizing the EDL as a multicultural movement. He concludes that the messages of the EDL are indeed Islamophobic -- understanding Islamophobia as an ideological phenomenon -- in that they create a form of order that clearly demarcates Islam as the Other.

T1  - Making Women's Suffrage Support an Ethnic Duty: Norwegian American Identity Constructions and the Women's Suffrage Movement, 1880-1925
AN  - 896695763
AB  - A rich literature has documented how immigrants and their offspring encountered racial and ethnic hierarchies in the US that influenced their own efforts at constructing an American ethnicity. Some European ethnic groups struggled to achieve a status of "whiteness" in the US. Others, such as immigrants from the Nordic countries, encountered less racial prejudice, but as an ethnic group they were keen to establish an identity that supported and justified their claims to inclusion. Here, Peterson seeks to understand how Norwegian immigrant claims to American inclusion became a foundation upon which ethnic suffragists were able to build a strategic argument in their call for women's suffrage supporters. Suffragists translated an established rhetoric of Norwegian American progressiveness into assertions that Norwegians were culturally obligated to support women's political equality in the US.

T1  - Responding to group-based discrimination: The impact of social structure on willingness to engage in mentoring
AN  - 907927889; 201124524
AB  - In two studies we examined women's willingness to engage in mentoring as a function of the perceived pervasiveness of gender discrimination and the appraised legitimacy of discrimination. In line with predictions, and confirming predictions from social identity theory, we found that perceiving discrimination against women to be illegitimate enhanced willingness to engage in mentoring when discrimination was seen to be pervasive compared to rare. In contrast, when gender discrimination was appraised as more legitimate, pervasiveness of discrimination attributions did not influence willingness to engage in mentoring. Study 2 provided evidence that the interactive effect of pervasiveness and legitimacy is explained by the extent to which mentoring is conceived of as support for collective goals. The results bring to the fore the impact of perceptions of the social context on women's responses to career-development initiatives.

T1  - The Benefits of Sexual Orientation Diversity in Sport Organizations
AN  - 902085271; 201122231
AB  - While sexual orientation diversity can potentially serve as a source of competitive advantage, researchers have largely failed to fully articulate the theoretical linkage between this diversity form and organizational effectiveness. As such, we propose a theoretical framework to understand these dynamics. Sexual orientation diversity is posited to positively contribute to organizational effectiveness through three mechanisms: enhanced decision making capabilities, improved marketplace understanding, and goodwill associated with engaging in socially responsible practices. We also propose two approaches to leveraging the benefits of sexual orientation diversity: targeting the categorization process and creating a proactive and inclusive diversity culture. Contributions and implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 887495784; 201118107
AB  - Examination of the profiles and trajectories of 15 current or past leaders of the Brazilian Association of Black Researchers points to the emergence in Brazil of a new category of intellectuals who may be called "black organic intellectuals" -- academics with the marks of black ancestry (such as dark skin) who have been directly or indirectly influenced by the black social movements and therefore do not resign themselves to racial prejudice and discrimination and racial inequalities. The active academic ethos that guides their professional behavior as university professors leads them to study these inequalities and to promote policies aimed at racial equality and the elimination of racism from Brazilian society.

T1  - 'A curious relationship': Barack Obama, the 1960s and the election of 2008
AN  - 902082796; 201122339
AB  - Ward explores the diverse ways in which memories, understandings and misunderstandings of the 1960s were mobilized during the 2008 election cycle. At the time, Barack Obama's campaign and triumph were hailed by many as marking a series of a decisive breaks with the past, notably with the culture wars and fiercely ideological political partisanship unleashed in the late 1960s. Others suggested that Obama represented a new kind of candidate who somehow transcended, or might even heal, the racial divisions in the United States, in a fanciful vogue for 'post-racialism' that Ward argues was also connected to popular conceptions of the 1960s and, in particular, to a misreading of the social philosophy of Martin Luther King, Jr and his 'I Have a Dream' speech. While some commentators stressed rupture and discontinuity with the past in interpreting Obama's victory, others--friend and foe alike--were keen to stress continuities with the past, often explicitly with a 1960s routinely, if simplistically, parsed into 'good' early and 'bad' later periods. Thus Ward considers Obama's connections to the civil rights and black power movements, as well as to other 1960s organizing traditions, charismatic leaders and conceptions of federal government, arguing that the decade continues to offer an important, if ambiguous touchstone in contemporary American politics and social memory.

T1  - Does Gender Matter? Men and Women on Controversial Social Issues
AN  - 835113505; 201102197
AB  - In this article we explore gender differences in opinion regarding controversial social issues. The issues we selected are: attitudes toward African Americans, Jews, Muslims, Affirmative Action, abortion, and gays and lesbians. This selection is based on the importance of these issues in public debate and electoral politics. A number of these issues, mainly those related to opinions toward religious and racial groups, reflect the development of the American society and draw lines of possible disagreements and social cleavages. Our purpose is to draw attention to an important factor in determining public opinion toward these issues. We aim to explore issues where gender makes a clear difference, where it does not only hold an important role as other factors such as race and political affiliation, and where considerations of gender need to be combined with other personal attributes in order to understand their real impact. These highlights are intended to shed light on the role of gender in social issues as well as understanding these issues from a perspective that includes gender as a dimension in opinion making.

T1  - Black Africans in World War II: The Soldiers' Stories
AN  - 818801773; 201072308
AB  - This article discusses the often forgotten contributions of black African infantry to the French and British war efforts from Europe to Asia during the Second World War. It traces the relationship between black African soldiers and their imperial rulers as it evolved over the course of two global conflicts from 1914 to 1945. The article points out how racist preconceptions about the 'inferior' abilities and intelligence of Africans paralleled white Americans' prejudices against African-Americans and how the British and French attempted to systematically omit, diminish, or discredit the achievements of African soldiers.

T1  - Media framing of proposed nuclear reactors: An analysis of print media
AN  - 764417453; 201064623
AB  - Nuclear energy has received substantial recent attention, marketed as a 'green' solution to global climate change (GCC) with calls for new reactors. However, considerable debate exists about whether it represents a viable solution to GCC. Given the complexity and urgency of the issue, a full and balanced debate is desirable. Since media play an important role in shaping public perception, we examined print media coverage of proposed reactors in Georgia-one site in the southeastern United States, which has been the focus of such proposals. We analysed the content of editorials and news articles from two local newspapers-the Augusta Chronicle and Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The former exclusively published pro-nuclear opinion pieces whereas the latter published a mix of pro- and anti-nuclear opinions. The majority of news articles in both newspapers generally presented balanced arguments. Pro- and anti-nuclear arguments most often reflected economic and environmental benefits and risks, whereas informational text primarily detailed regulatory processes and financing. Findings suggested that informational text was not necessarily 'neutral', sometimes masking covert pro- and anti-nuclear content. Implications for how findings might shape public opinion and strategies for shaping media and extending public deliberation are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - New Panthers, old Panthers and the politics of black nationalism in the United States
AN  - 754038494; 201049763
AB  - The New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense has been a cause du scandale since it was formed in the early 1990s. Indeed, the Anti-Defamation League has described it as 'the largest organized anti-Semitic and racist black militant group in America'. It is somewhat surprising, then, that there has been very little detailed analysis of the party and its activities. Mulloy begins to fill this gap by outlining the origins and development of the party, and by closely examining the ongoing dispute between the New Black Panthers and surviving members of the original Black Panther Party--established by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California in 1966--over the right to claim the name, the history and the legacy of the Panthers in the United States. Critically assessing the strategies and actions of the New Black Panthers, Mulloy argues that its high-profile, media-centred approach to political activism has largely been a failure with regard to its overall aim of reviving the Black Power movement in the United States.

T1  - Knowing who likes who: The early developmental basis of coalition understanding
AN  - 743067073; 201043114
AB  - Group biases based on broad category membership appear early in human development. However, like many other primates humans inhabit social worlds also characterised by small groups of social coalitions which are not demarcated by visible signs or social markers. A critical cognitive challenge for a young child is thus how to extract information concerning coalition structure when coalitions are dynamic and may lack stable and outwardly visible cues to membership. Therefore, the ability to decode behavioural cues of affiliations present in everyday social interactions between individuals would have conferred powerful selective advantages during our evolution. This would suggest that such an ability may emerge early in life, however, little research has investigated the developmental origins of such processing. The present paper will review recent empirical research which indicates that in the first 2 years of life infants achieve a host of social-cognitive abilities that make them well adapted to processing coalition-affiliations of others. We suggest that such an approach can be applied to better understand the origins of intergroup attitudes and biases. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Internalization Symptoms, Perceived Discrimination, and Ethnic Identity in Indigenous Sami and Non-Sami Youth in Arctic Norway
AN  - 758129462; 201059281
AB  - Objective. The aim of the present study was to compare symptoms of anxiety & depression among indigenous Sami & non-Sami youth in the Arctic part of Norway, & to examine the influence of perceived discrimination & ethnic identity on these symptoms. The relationship between ethnic self-labeling & native language competence on internalization symptoms was explored for Sami adolescents. Design. The Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Health Study was conducted among 10th graders in junior high schools in North Norway in 2003-2005. The sample consisted of 4449 adolescents, of whom 450(10%) were indigenous Sami & 3999 (90'%.) were non-Sami. Anxiety & depressive symptoms were assessed using a short version of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10. Participants also completed The Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) & a measure of perceived discrimination. Results. No differences were found among ethnic groups in internalization symptoms. Sami youth reported more discrimination than the non-Sami. Both MEIM & perceived discrimination were positively associated with internalization symptoms. Moreover. Sami youth who had not learned their native language at home were more vulnerable to experiencing internalization symptoms compared to Sami youth who had learned their native language at home. Conclusion. Culture-specific protective factors were discussed as potential explanations for the similarities between Sami & non-Sami youth. The present study documented a relationship between internalization symptoms & ethnic identity, perceived discrimination, & language loss. These findings could be understood as consequences of the recent colonial history & oppression of the indigenous Sami. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reclaiming nonracialism: reading The Threat of Race from South Africa
AN  - 743067141; 201043256
AB  - Gillespie challenges David Theo Goldberg's critique of the project of nonracialism (antiracialism) in The Threat of Race. Goldberg's critique understands nonracialism to forbid the racial terms that would allow for racism to be named and dismantled, and thus sees nonracialism as a variation on white privilege. She tests the book's most general claim by looking carefully at how this claim is substantiated in the chapter on South Africa. She argues that Goldberg's critique of nonracialism relies on a historiography of South Africa that excludes radical traditions of anti-apartheid nonracialism that would complicate the ease with which nonracialism might be seen as an ally to racism. The history of the Unity Movement is drawn on to illustrate a radical organization in the anti-apartheid tradition that explicitly advocated the principle of nonracialism. Gillespie looks at the Unity Movement as an example of radical experimentation with nonracialism as a way of dismantling race-class oppression under white supremacy. She advocates nonracialism as a practice that attempts to contend with oppression in the present while at the same time employing future-oriented principles that prevent the terms of anti-oppression from becoming mired in a dangerous redeployment of the categories of race.

T1  - The time and space of race: reflections on David Theo Goldberg's interrelational and comparative methodology
AN  - 743065726; 201043309
AB  - Maldonado-Torres identifies and analyses key elements in the methodology of David Theo Goldberg's The Threat of Race, highlighting its relevance for ethnic studies, area studies and postcolonial studies generally, and for the study of race and ethnicity specifically. He focuses on Goldberg's conceptualization of the history or the time of race, as well as on the geopolitical and economic dimensions of race and racism. Goldberg's account of race as a 'foundational code' of modernity undergirds his perspective and the way in which these themes relate to each other, making his work relevant for the theorizing of race and racism at large, and not only for the theorization of race and neoliberalism today. To that extent, Maldonado-Torres interrogates Goldberg's view of the relation between racial naturalism and racial historicism, and his resistance to the concept of racialization. He also calls for a more detailed discussion of how racial historicism relates to ethnicity vis-a-vis race. As for the space of race, Goldberg makes substantial contributions to an interrelational understanding of contemporary racisms, going beyond typical divides between US ethnic studies and areas studies. Yet there is also work in these and other disciplines that can make further contributions to his thinking. Adapted from the source document.
