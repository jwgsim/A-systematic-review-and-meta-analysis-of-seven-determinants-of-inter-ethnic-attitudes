AB  - En reconstruisant la configuration hétéroclite des prises de position qui mettent en accusation les sciences sociales, et singulièrement la sociologie, de transgresser les places et les fonctions qui leur sont assignées par les pouvoirs en place et leurs épigones, cet article porte au jour la convergence entre des charges scientifiques, politiques et médiatiques prenant pour cible des thématiques, telles que l'intersectionnalité, l'islamo-gauchisme, et les études de genre. Au nom d'un usage dévoyé de la neutralité axiologique, utilisée comme certification de la « bonne » sociologie, des recherches sont ostracisées, des chercheur·es mis·es au pilori, quand dans d'autres pays, ils sont emprisonnés, et leurs travaux interdits. En confrontant quelques travaux qui disqualifient ces thématiques, soit en les classant sous le qualificatif de science militante, soit en leur reprochant de délaisser ou de sous-estimer le primat de la classe sociale, on constate que les logiques argumentaires n'empruntent pas aux mêmes objections. Les premières s'opposent, voire dénoncent les approches critiques en sociologie ; les secondes méconnaissent la fécondité heuristique que donne le croisement des rapports sociaux de sexe, de race, de classe, de sexualité et d'âge, ce qui suppose de distinguer ces critiques tout en montrant qu'elles s'adossent et se confortent dans le contexte scientifique et politique de ces dernières années.Alternate abstract:Public stances in the media, the political field, and the scientific field itself have long targeted the social sciences – and particularly sociology – for the alleged transgression of their position and function in society. Tracking this motley configuration of attacks exposes their unprecedented convergence against research themes construed specifically as societal threats - such as intersectionality, 'Islamo-Leftism' or gender studies. In the name of a misappropriated notion of axiological neutrality waged to certify "good" sociology, these themes – and the researchers who develop them – are stigmatized and pilloried – when not imprisoned and expurgated in some countries. A closer examination of the arguments used in some of these attacks shows that they either disqualify these themes by deriding them as activist research or criticize their alleged neglect or undermining of the primacy of the social class as an analytical tool. These arguments reflect different critiques against sociology. While the first build against – if not denounce – critical approaches in sociology, the others misrecognize the heuristic value of combining different variables – gendered social relations, race, class, sexual orientation, and age. Though these critiques are therefore distinct, they converge and reinforce each other in the current scientific and political context.Alternate abstract:Indem er das Mischmasch von Positionen rekonstruiert, auf deren Grundlage die Sozialwissenschaften und vor allem die Soziologie beschuldigt werden, den ihnen gebührenden Platz und ihre von den Machthabenden und deren Epigonen zugewiesene Funktion zu überschreiten, bringt dieser Aufsatz das Zusammenspiel von wissenschaftlichen, politischen und medialen Angriffen zutage, die sich auf bestimmte Themen wie die Intersektionalität, den „Linksislamismus" und Gender Studies einschiessen. Im Namen eines fehlgeleiteten Verständnisses wissenschaftlicher Neutralität, die als Inbegriff „guter" Soziologie verstanden wird, werden Forschungsarbeiten und ForscherInnen an den Pranger gestellt und in manchen Ländern sogar eingesperrt oder verboten. Ein Vergleich verschiedener Arbeiten, die versuchen, diese Ansätze zu disqualifizieren, entweder indem sie von einer aktivistischen Wissenschaft sprechen, oder den Vorwurf machen, das Primat der Klassenzugehörigkeit zu unterschätzen, beweist, dass die logischen Einwände unterschiedlicher Natur sind. Erstere widersprechen kritischen soziologischen Ansätzen oder lehnen diese grundsätzlich ab; letztere sind blind für die heuristische Fruchtbarkeit von Ansätzen, die das Zusammenspiel sozialer Beziehungen mit Geschlecht, Rasse, Klasse, Sexualität und Alter in den Blick nehmen. Die beiden Richtungen sind zwar zu unterscheiden, aber dennoch im wissenschaftlichen und politischen Kontext der vergangenen Jahre verankert.

T1  - Visual ageism and the subtle sexualisation of older celebrities in L'Oréal's advert campaigns: a Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis
AN  - 2698549146
AB  - This study focuses on the recent increase in the use of older celebrities in cosmetics advertising. It asks what kinds of ideas and values these images may attribute to discourses of ageing. Drawing on a Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) perspective, this study focuses on L'Oréal UK and Ireland Web advertisements, examining how these advertisements use older celebrities to redefine/reposition ageing and exploring how they relate to the notion of ‘successful ageing’. In these advertisements, using cosmetics is presented as a positive, empowering choice. The advertisements simultaneously promote new discourses about ageing in which older women's sexuality is presented as a form of power. However, the analysis shows that the underlying discourse pathologises ageing and presents ageing as something which can be evaded through the consumption of cosmetics. It thus turns ageing into a choice, but one where the ‘right choice’ aligns with neo-liberal ideas about ageing well. For women, decision-making about ageing seems to be a never-ending process that requires constant construction, promoted through the older celebrity's sexualisation. Women are expected to always look good and present the best versions of themselves, even at the latest stages of life, which reproduces and legitimises sexist and ageist expectations about women's appearances, including the expectations that for older women to remain visible and attractive, they must hide outward signs of ageing.

T1  - A New Second-Generation Mindfulness-Based Intervention Focusing on Well-Being: A Randomized Control Trial of Mindfulness-Based Positive Psychology
AN  - 2699221673
AB  - Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective.

T1  - Does Experiencing Racialized Aggressions on Social Media Influence Perceptions About the Campus Racial Climate?
AN  - 2664955592
AB  - The purpose of this study was to use structural equation modeling to examine how the experience of racialized aggressions on social media influenced the perceptions of campus racial climate for undergraduate students of color (n = 771). Findings suggest that students who experienced racialized aggressions on social media did report less positive perceptions of campus diversity climate. Given that in-person and online environments are growing evermore seamless for students, this has implications for campus climate and diversity programming.

T1  - The Attribution of Parental Competence to Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Couples: Experimental and Correlational Results
AN  - 2649160076
AB  - This research examined the impact of sexual orientation on heterosexuals’ judgment of parental competence. Using a vignette approach, Study 1 presented participants with a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual couple who desired to have a child, either as adoptive parents or, in an additional heterosexual target condition, as biological parents. Study 2 presented a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual parent couple; heterosexual targets were either adoptive parents, reflecting the LG target conditions, or biological parents. Contradicting Hypothesis 1, neither target sexual orientation nor way to parenthood (with the latter varied in the heterosexual target condition only) had an impact on parental competence attributions. Confirming Hypothesis 2, participants with personal contact with lesbian and gay (LG) people provided higher ratings of LG target parental competence, mediated by positive attitudes toward homosexuality. Importantly, this mediation did not occur in the heterosexual target condition, corroborating the specificity of the intergroup contact effect.

T1  - Stories about “Us” and “Them”: An Experimental Inquiry into the Relative Appeal of Populist Narratives
AN  - 2649170239
AB  - Due to continued mediatization of politics, storytelling plays an increasingly important role in political communication. Against this background, it is often argued that populist narratives are essentially more appealing than non-populist political narratives, yet empirical evidence to support this assumption was missing. A multi-message experiment was conducted among U.S. citizens (N = 206) to compare how populist and non-populist political stories affect narrative transportation—a psychological state strongly associated with narrative enjoyment. The results show that populist framing significantly increases the ability of political narratives to cause transportation, controlling for the political partisanship and populist predispositions of the participants. This effect is mediated by the identification with story characters and feelings of anger and anxiety. The positive impact of populist framing extends to the story-consistent attitudes of the participants, suggesting a parallel–serial mediation model. The study enhances our understanding of psychological responses to populist storytelling.

T1  - Fear of Terrorism and Attitudes Toward Refugees: An Empirical Test of Group Threat Theory
AN  - 2644792255
AB  - In recent years, the co-occurrence of the migration crisis and terrorist attacks in European cities have created a strong link between refugees and asylum seekers and terrorism in the minds of many Europeans. This study investigates how attitudes toward refugees are associated with fear of terrorism. Using multilevel modelling on 1,500 Belgian citizens nested in 402 municipalities, results indicate that positive attitudes toward refugees are associated with lower terrorism fear. Adverse economic conditions at both the individual and municipal level are associated with greater fear of terrorism, while a large outgroup size is associated with lower fear of terrorism. Women hold greater fear than men, while commercial news consumption is associated with greater terrorism fears.

T1  - Standpoints and Situatedness: Examining the Perception of Benevolent Sexism in Black and White Undergraduate Women and Men
AN  - 2630481016
AB  - Racial differences in benevolent sexism have been underexplored. To address this gap, we used standpoint theory as a framework to examine race-gender group differences in the endorsement of benevolent sexism and how cultural factors (i.e., egalitarianism, religiosity, and racial identity) and inequality factors (i.e., experiences with racial discrimination and support for social hierarchies) might mediate this relationship. Among 510 Black and white undergraduate women and men, we found racial differences, such that Black women and men had higher endorsement of benevolent sexism than white women and men. Further, there was a gender difference for only white participants, with white men endorsing these attitudes more than white women. For Black women, religiosity and racial identity mediated the relationship between their race-gender group and greater benevolent sexism compared to white women, but only religiosity mediated the relationship for Black men. Neither inequality mediator accounted for benevolent sexism differences; however, both were associated with white women’s lower benevolent sexism, as was egalitarianism. Given these findings, we discuss implications for benevolent sexism theory, the possibility that cultural factors may shape Black women and men’s standpoint by establishing group-based norms and expectations around benevolently sexist behavior, and suggest culturally appropriate methods to reduce sexism.

T1  - Social inclusion of migrant workers in a pandemic: employing consumer vulnerability lens to internal Indian migrant experience
AN  - 2640217591
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this paper is to expand the theoretical understanding of social inclusion of vulnerable populations. Employing cross disciplinary literature from marketing and social policy, this paper examines the factors shaping internal migrant workers experience of inclusion and vulnerability in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approach>The authors conducted a review of social inclusion and consumer vulnerability literature to develop a new and innovative conceptual framework which operationalises social inclusion. This framework was then examined using an illustrative case study of internal migrant worker crisis in India. Data for the case were collected from various national and international media, government and non-government reports published in English on the pandemic related migrant crisis in India.Findings>Access and control over food was fraught with barriers for migrant workers. As the lockdown progressed, access to and control over work opportunities was precarious. Furthermore, the resource-control constraints faced by migrant workers in terms of food, work and transport had a direct impact on their experience of social inclusion. Lastly, the stranded migrant workers found themselves unable to fully participate in economic activities.Originality/value>To the authors’ knowledge this is the first paper that integrates consumer vulnerability concept, originating in marketing scholarship into the social inclusion framework. This allowed for anchoring the “aspirational goals” of social inclusion into the concrete context of consumers and marketplaces.

T1  - Ekonomisk form och den ömsesidiga konstitueringen av ojämlika sociala relationer
TT  - Economic form and the mutual constitution of social inequalities
AN  - 2682395791
AB  - I denna artikel utvecklas en teori om ekonomiska former som förmedlare av sociala ojämlikhetsformer, som konstitueras tillsammans med och förbinder olika maktordningar, till exempel konstruktioner av ras, klass och kön. Teorin utvecklas utifrån analyser av hur bestämda konstruktioner av ras har konstituerats tillsammans med varuformen och lönearbetet, och hur denna samkonstituering av raskonstruktioner och ekonomiska former reproducerar dualistiska tankeformer som kan spåras till varuformens förhistoria. Analysen av samkonstitueringen av ekonomiska former och bestämda konstruktioner av ras illustrerar hur i övrigt särskilda ojämlikhetsformer på grund av nämnda samkonstituering får vissa gemensamma symboliska drag och samuttrycks i relation till en karakteristiskt modern dualism. Dessa drag möjliggör i sin tur olika sätt på vilka ojämlikhetsformer (i detta fall ras och klass) sammanfogas och förstärker varandra, vilket illustreras i en diskussion om lönearbetets bestämmande tudelning i fritt och ofritt arbete.Alternate abstract:The analysis in this article develops a theory of the mediation of social inequalities by economic forms . It is argued that economic forms are co-constituted with unequal social relations (e .g ., race, class and gender) and that economic forms bring such relationships together . The theory is developed with reference to the co-constitution of determinate constructions of race and the commodity form (including its legal construction as an abstract form of property) and the form of wage labor . These processes of co-constitution entail the reproduction and modification of dualist modes of thought traceable to the prehistory of the commodity form; their intercon-nections to economic forms relate otherwise dissimilar inequalities to this characteristically modern duality . In turn, these common symbolic features facilitate the mutual articulation and reinforcement of different inequalities . This theoretical argument is illustrated by the mutual articulation and reinforcement of race and class in the disjunction of free and unfree labor which defines modern wage labor.

T1  - Introduction: ‘Race’, Learning and Teaching in Social Policy in Higher Education
AN  - 2610018151
AB  - [...]of growing concern amongst the discipline, the present authors were commissioned by the Social Policy Association (SPA) to undertake an audit of the teaching of ‘race’ within social policy courses (Craig et al., 2019).

The audit comprised various approaches: a review of the literature (which was found to be sparse), an analysis of published data and other UCAS statistics relating to student admissions, retention and progression; data on student and staff profiles, interviews with a series of ‘experts’ – that is, a group of academics with wide-ranging areas of expertise and, in some cases, many years of teaching social policy – and a survey of Higher Education Institutions (HEI) including social policy in their undergraduate and postgraduate taught course offers.

Overall, the conclusions of the report were dismal reading for the social policy community, made more dismal by the fact that, set against a rising tide of racism in the country at large, particularly since the 2016 Referendum (but certainly predating it), it should surely be a key role of social policy to confront the growth of racism within welfare provision and outside it; to challenge the messages being delivered at institutional and individual levels by the media, by the government and by right-wing political parties such as Brexit and UKIP, which place the blame for all the country’s ills at the feet of so-called ‘immigrants’ (bear in mind that more than 50 per cent of all UK ethnic minorities were born and grew up in this country); and to remind the wider population of the immense contribution that migrants are making and have made to the UK’s welfare provision despite all the obstacles put in their way.

The need for this, we would argue, is now even more critical than it has been in recent years as the government has embarked on what can only be characterised as a cohesive and determined pushback against those, apparently politically motivated activists and academics, who believe that the UK remains a profoundly racist society in its institutions, structures and policies, This argument has been fought out in the last two years over a variety of terrains, including the Grenfell fire, the toppling of statues and other icons ‘celebrating’ the contribution of slave owners to British (imperial) history, the growth of the Black Lives Matters movement (which might finally put the issue of ‘race’ firmly in the public eye), the distorted and partial account of racism delivered by the widely-challenged Sewell Commission report, and the latest iteration of government policy on immigration and asylum which notes that the system is failing but blames that failure on those fleeing violence and war rather than the structure, policies and misperformance of the Home Office and indeed of the Home Secretary, accused of being racist and forgetful of her own family’s history as, effectively, a victim of the ethnic cleansing of Idi Amin.

T1  - Do Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Savings and Job Loss during COVID-19 Explain Disparities in Housing Hardships? A Moderated Mediation Analysis
AN  - 2624888817
AB  - Despite the array of public programs offered to help households mitigate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, many still needed to rely on savings, credit, or other assets to make ends meet. This reality may exacerbate existing social and economic inequities because racial and ethnic minorities often have lower access to assets and credit than white households. We use longitudinal national survey data to explore the extent to which different racial and ethnic groups experienced housing hardships during the pandemic, the role of liquid assets in mediating housing hardship, and whether job/income loss moderated the relationship among race/ethnicity, liquid assets, and housing hardship. We find that liquid assets significantly mediated the relationship between race/ethnicity and housing hardships and that the effect was stronger for those who lost jobs or incomes as a result of COVID-19.

T1  - Race/Ethnicity, Perceived Skin Color, and the Likelihood of Adult Arrest
AN  - 2562784140
AB  - Research has long-documented racial/ethnic disparities in criminal justice outcomes. However, despite race/ethnicity being a multidimensional social construct, prior research largely relies on self-identification measures, thereby disregarding research on skin tone stratification within-racial/ethnic groups. The current study extends beyond this by examining the relationship between race/ethnicity and arrest employing both self-identified race/ethnicity and perceived skin color. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we explore the main and intersecting effects of self-identified race/ethnicity and perceived skin color on experiencing an arrest in adulthood between- and within-self-identified Whites, Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans, and Asians. We use structural disadvantage as a framework for exploring how social structural factors as well as antisocial behavior mediate the relationship between race/ethnicity/color and arrest. Results suggest that focusing on the racial/ethnic disparities alone masks differences in arrest by color and that the effect of color varies by race/ethnicity. Results also suggest that measures indicative of disadvantage, but not offending, partially explain these associations.

T1  - A double-edged sword: Children's intergroup gender attitudes have social consequences for the beholder
AN  - 2596068989
AB  - We examined the development of children's positive and negative attitudes toward other-gender peers over 1 year, and explored the longitudinal social consequences of holding positive or negative attitudes on the beholder of these attitudes. Participants were 206 second graders (Mage = 7.18 yrs, SD = .56, 50% girls) and 206 fourth graders (Mage = 9.10 yrs, SD = .66, 44.2% girls) from diverse ethnic racial backgrounds (54.6% White; 17.2% Latinx, 4.4% Black, 5.3% Asian, 2.9% Native American, .7% Pacific Islander, 13.1% other) with average household income ranged from $51,000 to $75,000, and they were assessed in 2 consecutive years. Developmental change was assessed using latent change score analysis, which showed that positive other-gender attitudes increased over time (for boys) whereas negative other-gender attitudes decreased for everyone. Path analyses showed that both positive and negative other-gender attitudes predicted children's perceptions of stressful other-gender interactions and their inclusion expectancies by other-gender peers longitudinally, controlling for same-gender attitudes. We also examined the extent to which the predicted relation between attitudes and inclusion expectancies was mediated by children's perceptions of stressful experiences with other-gender peers. We found that the extent of mediation varied by the type of attitudes and by children's age. Overall, findings contributed to the understanding of the development of children's other-gender attitudes, and underscored the consequences of these attitudes for the beholder of attitudes. This work also sheds light on the discussion of intervention strategies aimed at improving children's gender-based intergroup relations.

T1  - Do I support that it's good or oppose that it's bad? The effect of support-oppose framing on attitude sharing
AN  - 2570235420
AB  - The rise of social media has led to unprecedented opportunities for individuals to share, or express, their attitudes on social and political issues. What factors affect whether individuals choose to share? This research identifies a novel determinant of attitude sharing-support-oppose framing, defined as whether individuals think of their own attitude in terms of what they support or what they oppose. Support-oppose framing is distinct from attitude valence, as the same attitude can be framed in terms of support (e.g., I support that this policy is bad) or opposition (e.g., I oppose that this policy is good). Seven experiments, two correlational studies, and one field study provide evidence for a support-oppose framing effect, whereby individuals are more likely to share attitudes framed in terms of positions they support rather than positions they oppose. This effect occurs via two pathways. In the first, support-framed attitudes are viewed as more value expressive, which facilitates greater attitude sharing. In the second, support-framed attitudes are believed to promote more positive impressions, which also leads to greater sharing. This effect is attenuated when individuals' typical impression-management goals are relaxed.

T1  - Police use of firearms: Exploring citizen, officer, and incident characteristics in a statewide sample
AN  - 2562923751
AB  - This paper analyzes the more than 70,000 police use of force incidents in New Jersey from 2012 to 2016 to examine the association of a citizen' s race and ethnicity with the likelihood of officers pointing a firearm, shooting, and the number of shots discharged. Our study suggests that Black and Hispanic New Jerseyans are not more likely to experience force incidents involving a firearm relative to other citizens who experience police use of force, however this relationship is conditioned on the size of the place the incident occured. Black residents of smaller municipalities are almost twice as likely (OR = 1.70), and Hispanic residents more than twice as likely (OR = 2.30), than white citizens to have an officer pull their service weapon out during a stop. Furthermore, among all use of force incidents where a gun is brandished by police, Black and Hispanic residents are more likely to be shot, and shot numerous times compared to white citizens. While some of the relationship between race and force is mediated by crime type and subject behavior, a relationship between race and force remains. The need for systematic data reporting from smaller agencies and implications for research and policy are discussed.

T1  - How happenings do (not) turn into events: A typology and an application to the case of 9/11 in the American and Dutch public spheres
AN  - 2552119194
AB  - Why do some happenings become incentives for cultural or political transformation (that is: turn into events), whereas others remain ordinary occurrences? The theoretical perspectives of cultural repertoires, cleavage structures, and discursive opportunities are prominent and fruitful approaches for explaining cultural or political behavior and attitudes, yet they do not have a satisfactory answer to this question. To fill in this gap, I introduce a typology that indicates how certain happenings merely reproduce existing trends, whereas other ones turn into motives to change them. This can be either because they are “focus events,” which confirm dominant cultural or political patterns, or because they are “shock events,” which form a break from them. I illustrate this typology by investigating the distinct meanings that 9/11 were accorded in the American and Dutch public spheres. This analysis shows that this happening became a “shock event” on the issue of safety in the American case, as it broke with the cultural repertoire of viewing the United States as a safe, militarily impenetrable nation. In contrast, 9/11 turned into a “focus event” concerning the issue of Islam in the Dutch case because it confirmed the discursive opportunities to problematize Muslims, which public actors in the Netherlands had already developed in the years leading up to 2001.

T1  - Similarity Leniency in Mens Rea Determinations and the Mediating Role of Causal Attributions
AN  - 2628328315
AB  - Jurors are tasked with determining if the defendant's alleged transgression is the result of the defendant's guilty mind or other mitigating situational factors. The extant research, though, suggests that jurors tend to err in making these mens rea judgments. Jurors may have particular difficulty in judging mens rea when the defendant is a different race than the juror (i.e., harsher treatment of cross-raced defendants and less harsh treatment of same raced defendants, what are known as similarity leniency effects; Mitchell et al., 2005). The present research examined jurors' mens rea judgments of cross-raced defendants, whether there is any relation between similarity leniency effects and implicit racial biases, and whether causal attributions (i.e., emphasizing dispositional vs. situational causal attributions) mediate the relation between juror race and cross-race judgments of a defendant's mens rea (i.e., similarity leniency effects).

T1  - Effects of Cognitive Knowledge and Intercultural Behavioral Skills on Cultural Stereotypes and Intercultural Affect: A Case of Elementary Students’ Perspective on Islam
AN  - 2612781908
AB  - Two decades have passed since the September 11 attacks by Islamist militants that shocked the world. Despite this, Islamophobia remains a common phenomenon. In Taiwan, the 2014 12-year Basic Education Curriculum amendments emphasize cultural and global understanding as core competencies. With more than 6 years of implementation, it would be therefore interesting to learn what elementary school students think of Islam. Anchoring on the concepts of intercultural competency development, stereotypes are said to be related to cognitive knowledge, intercultural behavioral abilities, and attitudes. A survey instrument was developed and validated to collect information on stereotypes, skills in intercultural interaction, and attitudes toward Islam. Additionally, cognitive knowledge of Islam was also tested. A total of 712 students participated in the study. Structural equation modelling was used to test the mediating role of cognitive knowledge and intercultural behavioral skills within the relationship between cultural stereotypes and intercultural affects. Findings show that behavioral skills alone are not enough to diminish the negative aspects of stereotypes. Importantly, it is only with the help of cognitive knowledge that the relationship between stereotypes and intercultural affects are improved. It is hoped that by understanding the importance of proper curriculum content, more sustainable coexistence can be established.

T1  - How COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Has Affected Sports Practice
AN  - 2562270133
AB  - The recent pandemic generated by COVID-19 has changed how sports are habitually practised, necessitating a form of at-home sport to enable practitioners to continue exercising and training. This also touches upon how sports are 'delivered', with home-based consumers having control over the times, ways and spaces given to sport, as transmitted by digital means. During lockdown, opportunities to take advantage of apps and content and/or follow online lessons on social networks notably intensified. These changes in sports practice generate a series of research objectives, to determine: how digital media has created a new environment for socializing and sports practice; how digital devices are used to play home sports; and which players encourage people to exercise at home. With these objectives in mind, a two-phase research was launched at the SapienzaSport centre. The first questioned a group of about 600 practitioners, with a relatively high cultural and socioeconomic level along with access to digital opportunities, to investigate their sports habits during lockdown. The goal was to focus on those not negatively affected by the digital divide. The second phase aimed at studying the subsequent implications, starting from September 2020 (when sports-related activities resumed in Italy), while understanding whether and in what way doing physical activity had changed. In this paper we report and analyse the main results.

T1  - Play (Loudly) The Racialized Erotics of Blacksound in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing
AN  - 2516290738
AB  - In her essay "Counter-Hegemonic Art: Do the Right Thing," feminist cultural critic bell hooks writes that most viewers do not see Radio Raheem's death in Do the Right Thing (1989) as a brutal murder, nor do critics mention it, and that the film portrays Black men's oppression as solely racial-unrelated to gender or class. I take up her call in this essay, written on the film's thirtieth anniversary. I also argue that intimate feelings, desires, and touch between humans are bound to imaginings of race evoked by sound, what I call the racialized erotics of sound. My performance analysis of Radio Raheem meditates on the synesthesia of his sonic and visual dissonance in white male spaces and harmony in Black and Brown spaces. The music from his boombox is a medium that brings attention to Black masculinity's perceived loudness and homosocial/erotic engagements. Radio Raheem possesses a volume, timber, and vividness of color whose recognition leads to the increased surveillance and subduing of his unmuted presence. Radio Raheem's rapidly circulated ubiquitous performance is a Black virality that is a synecdoche for Black men who have played and will play their radios loudly. Additionally, Radio Raheem conjures Black men perceived as so powerful that their decibels, inseparable from their racialized gender, are a threat to the peace of white spaces and the livelihood of white bodies.

T1  - Lived Experience Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic among Arabic-, Russian- and Somali-Speaking Migrants in Finland
AN  - 2499434707
AB  - Increasing research shows that migrants are disproportionately exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about their lived experience and related meaning-making. This qualitative study maps COVID-19-related experiences among respondents from three migrant groups living in Finland: Somali-, Arabic- and Russian-speakers (N = 209). The data were collected by telephone interviews over four weeks in March and April 2020. Using inductive thematic analysis, we identified seven themes that illustrate respondents’ multifaceted lived experiences during the first phase of pandemic. The themes depict respondents’ difficulties and fears, but also their resilience and resources to cope, both individually and collectively. Experiences varied greatly between individuals and migrant groups. The main conclusion is that although the COVID-19 pandemic may be an especially stressful experience for migrant populations, it may also provide opportunities to deepen cooperation and trust within migrant communities, and between migrants and their country of settlement. Our analysis suggests that cooperation between local authorities and migrants, trust-building and effective information-sharing can foster positive and functional adaptations to disease-related threats and changing social environments.

T1  - Let's talk and share! Refugees and migrants building social inclusion and wellbeing through digital stories and online learning resources
AN  - 2474284111
AB  - Social inclusion and wellbeing are a fundamental human right and intimately connected with the right to reside in a country. For refugees and migrants this takes on multiple and new forms as digital experiences increasingly wrap every part of our being. It can refer to maintaining social capital through shared digitally mediated conversations and images with friends and relatives in the homeland. It can also be about producing and accessing digital information and learning resources that can support social inclusion and wellbeing in the new country. In this paper, we explore how digital learning resources developed in the Erasmus+ ReGap project (Reducing the Educational Gap for Migrants and Refugees) can support the desire to be socially included and to experience a sense of wellbeing. A key finding is that in creating such resources as digital stories, refugees and migrants, who are co-producers and users of these stories, experience social inclusion and a sense of wellbeing. The paper proposes an innovative set of indicators to measure the success of the online learning resources developed.

T1  - Online Repression and Self-Censorship: Evidence from Southeast Asia
AN  - 2470862138
AB  - Governments around the world have crafted new laws to threaten, arrest, prosecute and incarcerate online political activists. While the primary effect of online repression is to silence criticism and forestall collective action, a secondary effect is to induce self-censorship among the masses. Yet scant research examines how self-censorship works, nor discusses its implications for entrenching authoritarianism and encouraging democratic backsliding. This article proposes a simple expected utility model of self-censorship, arguing that citizens will more likely self-censor when the expected costs of online political expression outweigh its benefits. Analysing the fourth wave of the Asian Barometer survey of 10,216 respondents across eight Southeast Asian countries, I find that higher income politically engaged social media users are indeed less likely to express their political opinions. Additionally, this correlation holds in states where online repression is most severe, but is non-existent in countries where online repression is moderate or low.

T1  - Decolonising white feminism in Aotearoa/New Zealand: An interview with Anjum Rahman
AN  - 2465814624
AB  - Shama, as it is commonly known, is a charitable trust that offers holistic and comprehensive support to ethnic minority women in the Hamilton area through workshops, individual and community support, and advocacy at all levels for ethnic women who may also be recent migrants.

Keywords Decolonialisation, feminism, Muslim faith, racism, migrant, activism, politics Introduction One of the remarkable dimensions when talking to Anjum Rahman is the paradoxical experience of having startling and often uncomfortable information delivered in a calm, unhurried and gently articulated manner.

There is no doubt about meaning or intention, yet the uncomfortable truths Anjum articulates about living in Aotearoa/New Zealand as a woman of 'faith and race' have the power to move and unsettle.

Morning after morning, evening after evening, day after day, Anjum performed a crucial role, fronting to the media as one of the key spokespeople for the Muslim community.

T1  - Modelling Twitter conversations in #favela towards the conceptualization of the eVoice of the unheard
AN  - 2499028221
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study to shed light on the importance of social media hosted content related to socially-motivated discussions. Moving from the field of communication for development, the research leverages social media as a powerful tool for collecting and analyse peer-to-peer communication towards the conceptualization of eVoices of Unheard. The deep understanding of these conversation can generate recommendations for organizations and governments designing and providing interventions fostering local socio-economic development.Design/methodology/approachThe study presents a large-scale analysis of social media interactions on the topic “#favela” to generate insights into a social network structure, narrative contents and meaning generated.FindingsStructurally, the analysed networks are comparable with those presented in current academic literature; automatic text analysis confirmed the promise of the inner value of communication for development opening the floor to conceptualization of the “eVoices of unheard”, which is the collective and conscious use of social media to mediate community discussions about tangible and intangible issues related to socio-economic development.Originality/valueFramed within the rise of interactive communication for development this research show that social media an support the notion of voice proposed by Couldry (2010) moving from process (i.e. the recording of the voice) towards value (i.e. the possibility of giving an account of one’s life and its conditions to have an impact on human life and resources) thereby understanding intangible issues related with socio-economic development.

T1  - Measuring Structural Racism and Its Association With BMI
AN  - 2449985822
AB  - Introduction Structural racism has attracted increasing interest as an explanation for racial disparities in health, including differences in adiposity. Structural racism has been measured most often with single-indicator proxies (e.g., housing discrimination), which may leave important aspects of structural racism unaccounted for. This paper develops a multi-indicator scale measuring county structural racism in the U.S. and evaluates its association with BMI. Methods County structural racism was estimated with a confirmatory factor model including indicators reflecting education, housing, employment, criminal justice, and health care. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data (2011–2012) and a mixed-effects model, individual BMI was regressed on county structural racism, controlling for county characteristics (mean age, percentage black, percentage female, percentage rural, median income, and region). Analysis occurred 2017–2019. Results The study included 324,572 U.S. adults. A 7-indicator county structural racism model demonstrated acceptable fit. County structural racism was associated with lower BMI. Structural racism and black race exhibited a qualitative interaction with BMI, such that racism was associated with lower BMI in whites and higher BMI in blacks. In a further interaction analysis, county structural racism was associated with larger increases in BMI among black men than black women. County structural racism was associated with reduced BMI for white men and no change for white women. Conclusions The results confirm structural racism as a latent construct and demonstrate that structural racism can be measured in U.S. counties using publicly available data with methods offering a strong conceptual underpinning and content validity. Further study is necessary to determine whether addressing structural racism may reduce BMI among blacks.

T1  - Ten Years of Messaging about the Affordable Care Act in Advertising and News Media: Lessons for Policy and Politics
AN  - 2448094838
AB  - Messaging about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has seemingly produced a variety of outcomes: millions of Americans gained access to health insurance, yet much of the US public remains confused about major components of the law, and there remain stark and persistent political divides in support of the law. Our analysis of the volume and content of ACA-related media (including both ads and news) helps explain these phenomena, with three conclusions. First, the information environment around the ACA has been complex and competitive, with messaging originating from diverse sponsors with multiple objectives. Second, partisan cues in news and political ads are abundant, likely contributing to the crystallized politically polarized opinion about the law. Third, partisan discussions of the ACA in political ads have shifted in volume, direction, and tone over the decade, presenting divergent views regarding which party is accountable for the law's successes (or failures). We offer evidence for each of these conclusions from longitudinal analyses of the volume and content of ACA messaging, also referencing studies that have linked these messages to attitudes and behavior. We conclude with implications for health communication, political science, and the future outlook for health reform.

T1  - An Analysis of Black–White Racial Differences in Public Support for Nonviolent Sentencing Reform
AN  - 2429084206
AB  - I examine public support for sentencing reform for nonviolent offenders situated within a justice reinvestment context. I analyze data from a survey administered to a nationally representative sample of White and Black Americans. I pay particular attention to differences in support between the two races, and I analyze the degree to which ideological beliefs explain interracial differences. I find that a larger number of both Black and White people support, rather than oppose, sentencing property and drug offenders to community-based sanctions instead of prison, but the likelihood that a person will express support or opposition is related to several ideological beliefs and demographic characteristics. I find that racism and the belief that the criminal justice system is fair mediate the relationship between race and support for sentencing property offenders to community-based sanctions, but race continues to exert an independent effect in regard to sentencing drug offenders.

T1  - Love knows no colour bar: Windrush, racism and <i>Flame in the Streets</i>
AN  - 2428991997
AB  - Released in the aftermath of the 1958 Notting Hill riots, Flame in the Streets [Baker, Roy. 1961. UK: The Rank Organisation.] remains a distinctive British film of the 1960s in its examination of the racial prejudices that defined African-Caribbean's antagonous relations with the wider British Society. In Baker's attempt to expose the passive racisms of Jacko Palmer by paralleling his family conflict between his wife and daughter with his industrial conflicts as a trade union representative defending the rights of a black co-worker despite the disquiet that his ethnicity has generated from the white workers, the film presents ethnic minority characters in a form that links the personal with the political, interweaving themes of both class and race. Through a historicization and contextualization, this article sets out to examine the ways in which twentieth century post-war immigration and subsequent race struggles influenced the socio-political character of Flame in The Streets.

T1  - The China-DPRK Relations: from Perceived Marginalization to a Spirited Comeback
AN  - 2431122709
AB  - The summit diplomacy between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump in March 2018 brought forth the issue of China’s marginalization in Northeast Asian affairs. While China’s perceived loss of influence in North Korea since Kim Jong-un took power went viral in traditional and social media, the most audacious believed that the young leader was “defecting” to the West with his nuclear weapons. The article asks if the claims can be substantiated by the Sino-DPRK relations in 2012–2017 and if the claims failed to see the comprehensive nature of an asymmetrical relationship. China’s top interest in North Korea is regime stability, code-named “peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula,” that has strong geostrategic implications connected with the ever rising rivalry between China and the USA. This top interest coincides with North Korea’s security paranoia as it is exemplified in its nuclear and missile programs. Using these two premises, the article explores how China’s policy behaviors toward Pyongyang in 2012–2017 correspond with these two premises and how the key issues in China-DPRK relations reflect these two premises. The article argues that the China-DPRK relations did not fracture in the first 6 years of Kim Jong-un’s rule. The bilateral ties have experienced a spirited rejuvenation after the Kim-Trump summit diplomacy because China remains motivated to nurture the relations in new circumstances for their respective national interests.

T1  - Teaching bystander action: forming identities that promote opposition to prejudice towards Muslim people
AN  - 2573637222
AB  - Prejudice towards Muslim people in Western countries is common and increasing. This paper describes an educational intervention aimed at increasing positive attitudes and actions to support Muslim Australians. University students participated in a 12-week educational programme that drew on prejudice reduction principles and a pedagogical approach that emphasised active discussion. Results (N = 94) showed an increase in positivity towards Muslim people, increased intention to take bystander action to confront prejudice, and social identification (as a supporter of positive relations between Muslim and non-Muslim Australians). Boosts in positivity towards Muslim people and intention to confront prejudice were mediated by increases in social identity, although changes in social identification only explained increased commitment to confront prejudice in a low risk scenario. Results suggest that educational interventions such as these can foster new, inclusive identities that provide a basis for action to support Muslim people.

T1  - Gypsy–Traveller communities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands: socially and digitally excluded?
AN  - 2429445102
AB  - With the pervasiveness of digitisation communications, those that are left behind are seen as socially excluded. In both academic and policy discourses, it is assumed that digital inclusion as a route into mainstream society is a desirable solution to problems of multiple exclusion and has led to many studies of the digital inclusion/exclusion of ‘hard to reach’ groups. Yet, Gypsy–Travellers, among the most marginalised people in society, have received little attention. Using data from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, we assess the impact of digital communications on Gypsy–Traveller communities. This article makes a contribution in the following ways: First, we address the theories of ‘fields of inclusion’ to show how exclusion and inclusion work together in different ways; Second, we explore how different policy frameworks in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom shape these possibilities; Third, we document the forms of inclusion that Gypsy–Travellers experience in terms of digital communications; Fourth, we look at how Gypsy–Travellers use digital communications to recreate their own cultures as well as selectively integrate with mainstream society.

T1  - The Negative Associations Between Materialism and Pro-Environmental Attitudes and Behaviors: Individual and Regional Evidence From China
AN  - 2406004316
AB  - Previous studies have shown that materialism is related to environmentalism, but unstable findings still exist. To clarify the relationships between materialism and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, the present study addressed some methodological issues and provided both individual- and regional-level evidence from China. Using data from the World Value Survey and the Chinese General Social Survey, we observed that materialism was negatively associated with pro-environmental attitudes (Study 1, n = 2,300; Study 2, n = 3,672) and pro-environmental behaviors (Study 2). Moreover, we found that pro-environmental attitudes partially mediated the association between materialism and pro-environmental behaviors in Study 2. We further searched for additional regional evidence in Study 3, and we found that the more materialistic regions are, the more energy is consumed. Results indicate that materialism is associated with decreases in pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the research findings.

T1  - Exploring the Use of South African Ethnic and Racial Slurs on Social Media
AN  - 2560895390
AB  - In this paper, I use discourse analysis as a framework to examine Facebook posts and understand how South African ethnic and racial slurs are used and responded to on social media platforms. I illustrate how language in general and slurs in particular work as tools for the negotiation, (re)production, (re)circulation and maintenance of particular ethnic and racial identities and representations. My findings focus on two interrelated aspects of the data: the first concerns the discursive features of the initial posts and the second relates to subsequent responses to the posts. The close examination of initial posts reveals the ways in which the original posters (OPs) position themselves and those they refer to using these slurs. Social media interlocutors recognise the words "kaffir", "coolie", "Hottentot" and "makwerekwere" as strongly tied to power and racial/ethnic identity and deliberately use them to provoke controversial debates and to construct "us vs. them" scenarios. The significance of the study is twofold: firstly, it contributes to literature that highlights the role of social media platforms as vehicles for racial and ethnic hate speech. Secondly, it underlines the complexities of race and ethnic relations in the country by highlighting the need for robust discussions around the way South Africans view themselves in comparison to out-group members, including other Africans.

T1  - How China’s image affects Chinese products in a partisan-motivated US market
AN  - 2427491398
AB  - By proposing a dual-perspective model of attitude formation related to Chinese products, the survey of 592 adults investigated how Americans’ evaluation and purchase intention of Chinese products can be influenced by China’s image driven by a synergy of US politics and mass media. Younger people and minorities had better evaluation of and more intention to purchase Chinese products. A better country image of China contributed to more positive products beliefs and stronger purchase intention. Republicans engaged in partisan-motivated reasoning in their purchase intention, while Democrats converged with nonpartisan audiences. More social media use resulted in stronger purchase intention, while partisan media failed to make an impact on product beliefs and purchase intention. The findings suggested that although Americans’ judgment and purchase intention of Chinese products is affected by individual’s preexisting perception of China, only Republicans are prone to partisan-motivated reasoning of Chinese products. Social media use could lead to more acceptance of Chinese products, but conservative and liberal media seem to make little impact on this matter.

T1  - A Cultural Theory of Partisanship and Policy Attitudes
AN  - 2381951962
AB  - ObjectivePolitical parties provide an important function for a public that is generally seen as not consistently ideological by guiding its thinking about policy issues. In this article, we examine whether the four cultural worldviews derived from grid‐group cultural theory—hierarch, egalitarian, individualist, and fatalist—are predictive of partisan attachments and perceptions of climate change risk among the public.MethodsData come from an original survey of the U.S. public conducted in 2011 and 2012. We use regression analysis to examine partisanship and perceived climate change risk; ordered logit to examine party attachment; and mediation analysis to examine the mediating effect of partisanship on cultural worldviews and climate change risk.ResultsWe find that the group‐oriented cultural types (egalitarians and hierarchs) are more likely to have stronger party attachments than the nongroup‐oriented cultural types (individualists and fatalists). In addition, we find that the mediation effect of party is more pronounced among the group‐oriented types than the nongroup oriented.ConclusionGrid‐group cultural theory is predictive of both partisanship and policy attitudes and partisanship mediates the influence of cultural worldviews on climate change risk, particularly for those types with group orientations.

T1  - Disproportionate Experiences in Custody? An Examination of Minority Youths’ Outcomes in Secure Facilities
AN  - 2371169208
AB  - While a significant amount of literature has emphasized the identification and explanation of disproportionate minority contact (DMC) in the juvenile justice system, less research has examined racial disparities in postdisposition outcomes. This study seeks to address this gap through its examination of the experiences of youths in custody. Specifically, using a stratified, random subsample of 1514 youths confined in secure confinement facilities between 2010 and 2014 in one Midwestern state, this article explores whether youths’ race impacts in-facility outcomes, such as number of disciplinary infractions, time spent in seclusion, length of stay, and access to educational services, when case-level predictors are accounted for. Findings suggest that race has an inconsistent relationship with the outcomes experienced by youths in custody. However, significant mediating effects of disciplinary infractions on relationships between race and other outcomes appear to have significant implications for non-White youths in custody. Considering these findings, policy recommendations are discussed.

T1  - The Impact of Negative Parasocial and Vicarious Contact with Refugees in the Media on Attitudes toward Refugees
AN  - 2353409278
AB  - Contact with members of outgroups is an important factor for ingroup members’ attitudes toward these groups. Ingroup members can also come into contact with outgroups in the media. This media contact can take different forms: parasocial contact, when the audience simply observes outgroups; or vicarious contact, when ingroup audience members witness fellow ingroup members interacting with outgroups. However, extant research does not test whether these two forms of media contact differ in their effects on outgroup attitudes. In addition, we lack empirical evidence on the negative media contact effects and the role of predispositions, such as previous personal contact with outgroups. In two experiments, we test the differential effects of negative parasocial and vicarious contact on audience members who differ in their previous personal contact with refugees. The results show that negative parasocial and vicarious contact increase negative outgroup attitudes (Studies 1 & 2). While study 1 shows that negative vicarious contact results in more negative attitudes toward refugees, especially for people with no or little contact, a replication study does not corroborate this finding. Overall, negative parasocial and vicarious contact with refugees increase prejudice toward refugees. Personal contact does not inoculate individuals against this mediated contact effect.

T1  - Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion: Formerly Gang-Involved Youth as Domain Experts for Analyzing Unstructured Twitter Data
AN  - 2334174626
AB  - Mining social media data for studying the human condition has created new and unique challenges. When analyzing social media data from marginalized communities, algorithms lack the ability to accurately interpret off-line context, which may lead to dangerous assumptions about and implications for marginalized communities. To combat this challenge, we hired formerly gang-involved young people as domain experts for contextualizing social media data in order to create inclusive, community-informed algorithms. Utilizing data from the Gang Intervention and Computer Science Project—a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data from gang-involved youth in Chicago—we describe the process of involving formerly gang-involved young people in developing a new part-of-speech tagger and content classifier for a prototype natural language processing system that detects aggression and loss in Twitter data. We argue that involving young people as domain experts leads to more robust understandings of context, including localized language, culture, and events. These insights could change how data scientists approach the development of corpora and algorithms that affect people in marginalized communities and who to involve in that process. We offer a contextually driven interdisciplinary approach between social work and data science that integrates domain insights into the training of qualitative annotators and the production of algorithms for positive social impact.

T1  - Political Opinion Formation as Epistemic Practice: The Hashtag Assemblage of #metwo
AN  - 2511154119
AB  - The article contributes to the literature on the political use of hashtags. We argue that hashtag assemblages could be understood in the tradition of representing public opinion through datafication in the context of democratic politics. While traditional data-based epistemic practices like polls lead to the ‘passivation’ of citizens, in the digital constellation this tendency is currently challenged. In media like Twitter, hashtags serve as a technical operator to order the discursive fabrication of diverse publicly articulated opinions that manifest in the assemblage of tweets, algorithms and criticisms. We conceptualize such a critical public as an epistemic sensorium for dislocations based on the expression of experienced social imbalances and its political amplification. On the level of opinion formation, this constitutes a process of democratization, allowing for the expression of diverse opinions and issues even under singular hashtags. Despite this diversity, we see a strong tendency of publicly relevant actors such as news outlets to represent digital forms of opinion expression as unified movements. We argue that this tendency can partly be explained by the affordances of networked media, relating the process of objectification to the network position of the observer. We make this argument empirically plausible by applying methods of network analysis and topic modelling to a dataset of 196,987 tweets sampled via the hashtag #metwo that emerged in the German Twittersphere in the summer of 2018 and united a discourse concerned with racism and identity. In light of this data, we not only demonstrate the hashtag assemblage’s heterogeneity and potential for subaltern agency; we also make visible how hashtag assemblages as epistemic practices are inherently dynamic, distinguishing it from opinion polling through the limited observational capacities and active participation of the actors representing its claims within the hybrid media system.

T1  - Moral foundations explain unique variance in political ideology beyond resistance to change and opposition to equality: GPIR
AN  - 2323388916
AB  - Moral foundations theory (MFT), while inspiring much empirical work, has been the target of both methodological and theoretical criticism. One important criticism of MFT is that, in its attempt to explain variability in political ideology, it only repackages the core motives (resistance to change and opposition to equality) and does not actually provide additional explanatory potential. Indeed, some previous studies show that moral foundations do not explain variability in ideology beyond other relevant variables, and that the relation between moral foundations and political orientation is mediated by other ideological variables. In the present research, we examined whether moral foundations can explain variability beyond the core motives in samples from Turkey and the United States. Contrary to some previous findings, we found that moral foundations explain unique variance in general, social, and economic conservatism. These findings suggest that the moral foundations proposed by MFT cannot be reduced to other variables that have been used in the literature to measure ideological proclivities.

T1  - The horrors of white male innocence in IT (2017)
AN  - 2312501554
AB  - This essay examines the 2017 horror film IT, exploring how it depicts notions of innocence in relationship to race and masculinity. Specifically, the adolescent white male members of the film's core protagonist group, the Losers' Club, are represented as innocent figures because of their decision to practice a supposedly "colorblind" and anti-racist/anti-sexist ideology, and also due to the innocent nature of these characters' fears that are depicted within the film. We contend that although the white male Losers are able to maintain their childlike innocence, the film denies innocence to Mike Hanlon, the only black member of the Losers' Club, by closely associating his black masculinity with modes of violence. Through an analysis of these characters, we note the particular ways in which the presumed innocence of whiteness is reified when it is embodied exclusively by young white males.

T1  - Trapped on the island: the politics of race and belonging in Jazirat al-Maghrib
AN  - 2544841386
AB  - Drawing on ethnographic engagement with Moroccans and sub-Saharan Africans from varying socioeconomic positions this article interrogates how notions of race and belonging - or blackness and nationhood - are changing as Morocco transitions into a new destination country for migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Examining Jazirat al-Maghrib as an historic and contemporary crossroads striving to maintain control over its physical and symbolic borders, the trope of island-ness emerges. Rising violence against Morocco's expanding sub-Saharan population is examined through collected narratives of citizens, migrants, and governmental officials and analyses of Moroccan popular media, revealing the racial dimensions of new political categorizations. The dangerous conflation of race, class, and presumed 'illegality' affects not only the most vulnerable, but all who could be racially categorised as non-citizen subjects. This article reveals the concrete effects that shifting sociopolitical landscapes have on Moroccans who identify as black and elite sub-Saharans who identify as part of Morocco's diverse and well-established university programme, contending that as political entanglements between Morocco and surrounding regions expand, so too does the desire for a distinctly Moroccan identity, ensuring a continuation of the historic Jazirat al-Maghrib.

T1  - Ecological and cultural factors underlying the global distribution of prejudice
AN  - 2285716754
AB  - Prejudiced attitudes and political nationalism vary widely around the world, but there has been little research on what predicts this variation. Here we examine the ecological and cultural factors underlying the worldwide distribution of prejudice. We suggest that cultures grow more prejudiced when they tighten cultural norms in response to destabilizing ecological threats. A set of seven archival analyses, surveys, and experiments (∑N = 3,986,402) find that nations, American states, and pre-industrial societies with tighter cultural norms show the most prejudice based on skin color, religion, nationality, and sexuality, and that tightness predicts why prejudice is often highest in areas of the world with histories of ecological threat. People’s support for cultural tightness also mediates the link between perceived ecological threat and intentions to vote for nationalist politicians. Results replicate when controlling for economic development, inequality, conservatism, residential mobility, and shared cultural heritage. These findings offer a cultural evolutionary perspective on prejudice, with implications for immigration, intercultural conflict, and radicalization.

T1  - Academic Resilience Among Children from Disadvantaged Social Groups in India
AN  - 2027407320
AB  - There has been significant progress in educational attainment in India since its independence. Yet the achievements are low in comparison to countries in similar stages of development. The situation is worse among groups who have a history of exclusion. Children from these groups have lower enrollment and higher dropout rates than national averages. Yet some of them are able to overcome these limitations and show academic resilience. Using data from the Indian Human Development Survey (2005), we study the role of the different child, household, and school-level factors associated with academic resilience among these children. Further, to understand the mechanism through which group membership affects resilience we also study the indirect effect of group membership mediated through those factors. We find that the protective factors vary across the different disadvantaged groups. The main effect of group membership is through structural factors like poverty and maternal education. Yet, the child level and household level factors play an important role in most cases. Schools fail to play the expected role of being the source of resilience among those who face the strongest burden of structural factors. For some, the schools are the main site where they experience most of the adversities of group memberships. The results highlight the need for educational policy, which addresses the importance of schools as drivers and determinants of academic resilience.

T1  - Seeker Are You Protected? Social Media and Protection Granted to Women in Sri Lanka
AN  - 2292913231
AB  - Facebook, which revolutionized social networking, offers solid platforms for women freely to express and give life to their opinions on any subject they desire, from fashion to human rights, feminism to politics. As a result, a number of issues have arisen regarding the safety of social exposure, chief amongst them being the preservation of privacy. This study examines privacy concerns of female Facebook users in Sri Lanka (age group of 20-30) and the possible judicious measures that can be taken by government organizations regarding this matter. During the course of this research, a mixed methodology was adopted in data collection, which included 118 surveys and interviews. The general concern of Facebook privacy, attitudes and expectations was evaluated through the survey. Interviews were conducted with the goal of bringing attention to and evaluating the existing privacy protection mechanisms provided for Facebook users. The willingness displayed by many females to disclose personal views and information on Facebook has become a phenomenon which demonstrates breaking the silence and absolute freedom of expression. The survey revealed that a majority of the survey participants were pessimistic about Facebook security, even after the application of strict privacy settings. This paper concludes with a discussion of the proposed privacy protection, through amendments and reforms, which is viewed as part of the government's legal responsibility to uphold Facebook privacy and affirms the matriarchal cultural values of Sri Lanka, where the general expectation of young females is to raise a family that upholds virtue and family values. In turn, female mental and social security and the prevalence of freedom of expression ensure gender equality in Sri Lanka.

T1  - Overcoming the Limits of Legal Opportunity Structures: LGBT Rights’ Divergent Paths in Costa Rica and Colombia
AN  - 2246375046
AB  - The most recent wave of democratization in Latin America, while formally including many previously excluded sectors of society into the political process, left others ineffectively represented or unable to protect their rights or advance their interests. These marginalized groups, including indigenous and displaced people, sexual and ethnic minorities, people living with chronic illness or in poverty, and prisoners, frequently found the promises of democratic governance to be largely unfulfilled. Yet one marginalized group, sexual minorities, specifically lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people (LGBT), has made considerable strides in advancing its rights in many Latin American countries over the last two decades (Corrales 2010, 2015). Historically, even in well-functioning democracies, LGBT people were routinely discriminated against, consistently denied their constitutional rights, and often abused by state and private actors alike, which is a sharp contrast to recent adoptions of “some of the world’s most extensive policies for same-sex couples” (Piatti-Crocker 2010, 3), including the legalization of same-sex marriage (SSM) in five countries (IACHR 2015; New York Times 2014). A closer look suggests that these advances in LGBT rights can usefully be grouped into two broad categories. Many rights claims demand protections from state or private agents’ harassment, an end to anti-LGBT discrimination, and equal protection for property or welfare rights, including survivor pension benefits and partners’ health coverage. These rights and demands for protection and equality were common in many other developed countries. Their impact was limited to a relatively small group of people, they imposed low financial costs, they were achievable with minor legal or regulatory adjustments or training, and they tended to draw only a muted response from conservative and anti-LGBT groups. A second category of rights includes broader claims for SSM or adoption by same-sex couples, which directly challenged some groups’ deeply held religious beliefs or traditions and acted as a clarion call to action for conservative movements. These anti-LGBT movements, in turn, used litigation and legislative procedures to delay or block LGBT-friendly laws or the enforcement of successful judicial decisions protecting LGBT rights (see, e.g., Sáez and Moran 2016). This article argues that judicial reforms in many Latin American countries, starting in the 1980s, opened up new legal opportunity structures (LOS) that facilitated successful litigation to protect many of the rights in the first group. Yet the same LOS and strategies proved insufficient to win cases from the second group of rights, due partly to their lack of public support, the more controversial nature of those rights, their broader societal impact, and organized, effective opposition. Attempts to achieve this second group of rights through legislative arenas were generally unsuccessful, but LGBT movements’ use of more coherent, coordinated, sophisticated legal strategies or sympathetic political actors willing and able to animate new legal opportunity structures at the international level have proved more promising. This argument is illustrated by analyzing the evolution of LGBT rights protection in Costa Rica and Colombia. As existing research has established, LGBT people in both countries won many significant rights through new LOS, starting in the early 1990s (Wilson 2007, 2009, 2011; Gianella and Wilson 2016; Wilson and Gianella 2017). The article then explains how this strategy might still work to win claims for the first group of rights but has proved insufficient to win the more profound and contentious rights, which reveals a lacuna in our understanding of courts’ effectiveness in advancing marginalized populations’ fundamental rights. Thus, Costa Rica turned from an early leader in LGBT rights protection in Latin America to a laggard as it failed to legalize SSM and adoption rights in the face of a reluctant apex court and profound political and social opposition. Colombia, another early leader in LGBT rights advancement in Latin America, presented similar difficulties in achieving SSM legalization, but after lengthy political and legal battles, in which LGBT movements coalesced in an umbrella organization and worked closely with an LGBT-friendly litigation organization, LGBT groups successfully litigated same-sex marriages and adoptions, even while their demands remained very unpopular and were thwarted in legislative arenas. This article proceeds to review the role of courts in furthering social rights in general and LGBT rights in particular. It then discusses the case selection before conducting the comparative case study. It presents conclusions about how the Colombians overcame the limitations of LOS and why the second category of LGBT rights remains stalled in Costa Rica.

T1  - Social Control Meets New Public Management: Examining the Diffusion of State Prison Privatization, 1979‐2010
AN  - 2236093123
AB  - While the merits and perils of privatization have remained a contentious and often polarizing debate, privatization of public services remains commonplace throughout the world. For instance, over the last several decades, U.S. governments at all levels have routinely pursued contracting arrangements for corrections management, known popularly as prison privatization. In this article, state prison privatization (SPP) is examined in three ways. First, we use an externally focused policy diffusion framework to help explain the adoption of SPP‐enabling legislation across U.S. states. Second, we explore the extent to which the American Legislative Exchange Council has influenced the adoption of prison privatization legislation. Third, we explore the role of state wealth inequality in determining a state's propensity to adopt prison privatization policies. Examining state‐level data from 1979 to 2010, this article finds empirical support for each of these key theoretical assertions. Furthermore, we find evidence that the external diffusion effect may vary depending on the political orientation of the state.Related ArticlesButz, Adam M., Michael P. Fix, and Joshua L.

Por ejemplo, durante las últimas décadas, los gobiernos de los EE. UU., en todos los niveles, han seguido de manera rutinaria los acuerdos de contratación para la gestión de correcciones, conocidos popularmente como privatización de prisiones. En este artículo, la privatización de prisiones estatales (SPP) se examina de tres maneras. Primero, usamos un marco de difusión de políticas con enfoque externo para ayudar a explicar la adopción de la legislación habilitada para SPP en todos los estados de EE. UU. En segundo lugar, exploramos hasta qué punto el Consejo de Intercambio Legislativo de los Estados Unidos ha influido en la adopción de la legislación sobre privatización de prisiones. En tercer lugar, exploramos el papel de la desigualdad de riqueza estatal en la determinación de la propensión de un estado a adoptar políticas de privatización de prisiones. Al examinar los datos a nivel estatal de 1979 a 2010, este estudio encuentra apoyo empírico para cada una de estas afirmaciones teóricas clave. Además, encontramos evidencia de que el efecto de difusión externa puede variar según la orientación política del estado.Alternate abstract:社会控制遇上新公共管理：检验1979‐2010年间各州监狱私有化扩散尽管私有化的优缺点仍然充满争议，且时常出现极化，但公共服务的私有化依然在全球都很普遍。例如，过去几十年来，美国各级政府都例行公事地为惩戒管理，即被广为知晓的监狱私有化，安排了外包。本文中，国家监狱私有化（SPP）经过了三种方式的检验。首先，笔者使用聚焦于外部的政策扩散框架，以帮助解释SPP立法在美国各州的广泛采纳。其次，笔者探索了美国立法交流委员会在何种程度上影响了监狱私有化立法的采纳。再次，笔者探索了财富不平等在确定各州采纳监狱私有化政策时的倾向一事上所产生的作用。通过检验1979‐2010年间的州级数据，笔者发现，外部扩散效果可能会因该州的政治倾向而产生差异。

T1  - Songs of the Bauls: Voices from the Margins as Transformative Infrastructures
AN  - 2328360634
AB  - [...]the Gaines (folk musicians) of Nepal sing songs to depict their negations with material poverty (Harrison 2013); similarly, Sufi artists from Turkey and Middle East countries describe their experiences of facing severe threats from conservative Islamic institutions (Otterbeck 2008) and dominant institutions (the state, market structures) through songs.

[...]light-hearted Baul performances and/or folk-music competitions in popularity-based shows on televisions and other mediated platforms pose challenges to conventional practices of Bauls and Fakirs (Krakauer 2016).

Previous academic studies primarily focus on esoteric aspects of Baul discourses (including nuances and secrecy of sexo-yogic practices, and metaphoric connotations of seemingly non-spiritual phenomena like market or worldly artefacts); and, sometimes on utilization of Baul tunes to design messages for creating public awareness, and/or for corporate social responsibility activities.

In the contemporary cultural landscape when many folk-music traditions are under threat for a variety of socio-economic and/or politico-religious reasons in the global South, foregrounding voices and agencies of the marginalized performers (and traditions) is important in examining the ways in which plurality of world-views, rationalities and imaginings anchor social change communication (Dutta 2011).

Historically, the colonial oppression and politics (of exclusion) of Brahminical, upper-caste Hindu and Islamic society created massive socio-political and economic uncertainty in the lives of the people of lower strata of society, which eventually gave birth to many “deviant sects” like the Bauls (Urban 2001).

T1  - Acculturation, Social Support, and Maternal Parenting Stress among U.S. Hispanic Mothers
AN  - 2177016979
AB  - ObjectivesFew studies have examined racial-ethnic differences in parenting stress and findings have been inconsistent on how Hispanics fare on this issue. This paper is the first to examine these differences among US Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black mothers, as well as the mediating role of acculturation and social support.MethodUsing nationally-representative data from the first two waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, our analysis employs multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models of 1096 Hispanic and Black mothers.ResultsWe find that both foreign-born and native-born Hispanic mothers have significantly lower levels of maternal parenting stress compared to Black mothers. Using multidimensional measures, we provide evidence that both acculturation and social support influence maternal parenting stress. However, neither of these fully mediate the relationship between race-ethnicity and maternal parenting stress.ConclusionThus, this study demonstrates support for a Hispanic paradox for maternal parenting stress that is unexplained by acculturation or social support.

T1  - ‘On the same page?’ Marginalisation and positioning practices in intercultural teams
AN  - 2243450165
AB  - This study investigates participation problems in teams with mixed language proficiencies. Utilising an in-depth single case study approach and drawing on interactional data and interviews, it explores participation in team meetings. It takes a positioning theory approach, and analyses how the least proficient speaker is subtly positioned in various ways: as silent, different, difficult and incompetent. It argues that these positionings contribute to the marginalisation of his contributions in team meetings and in effectively silencing him and that this occurred through interactional patterns in which his contributions were a) ignored, b) dismissed outright and c) treated with only token interest. The paper ends by considering the range of factors, both interactional and attitudinal, that seem to have contributed to this silencing, including cultural stereotypes that seem to influence the dynamics of the interactions.

T1  - Implicit Bias Predicts Liking of Ingroup Members Who Are Comfortable With Intergroup Interaction
AN  - 2188929009
AB  - We test a novel framework for how ingroup members are perceived during intergroup interaction. Across three experiments, we found that, above and beyond egalitarian attitudes and motivations, White observers’ automatic responses to Blacks (i.e., their implicit anti-Black bias) shaped their affiliation toward ingroup targets who appeared comfortable engaging in interracial versus same-race interaction. White observers’ implicit anti-Black bias negatively correlated with liking of White targets who were comfortable with Blacks (Experiments 1-3). The relationship between implicit bias and liking varied as a function of targets’ nonverbal comfort in interracial interactions (Experiment 1). Specifically, implicit bias negatively correlated with liking of targets when targets’ nonverbal behaviors revealed observers felt comfortable with interracial contact, irrespective of the nature of those behaviors (Experiment 2). Finally, the relationship between implicit bias and target liking was mediated by perceived similarity (Experiment 3). Theoretical implications for stigma-by-association, social network homogeneity, and extended contact are discussed.

T1  - Testifying Bodies: Testimonial Injustice as Derivatization
AN  - 2213217681
AB  - Human beings as objects, and we are objects inter alia, offer information, even knowledge. And yet, in a society marked by pervasive identity prejudice, even objects do not offer neutral facts. Here, I argue that the harms imposed on those who suffer testimonial injustices cannot be sufficiently understood through the ethical lens of objectification. Such persons are not simply objectified, not simply treated as mere sources of information rather than as informants. Even as objects (not mere objects), they are often unable to testify on their own behalf or testify to true facts of the matter. Rather than follow Miranda Fricker's argument that testimonial injustices are acts of objectification, I argue that they are better understood as acts of what Ann Cahill calls derivatization. A re-examination of Fricker's account of the wrong of testimonial injustice as derivatizing rather than objectifying clarifies the wrong of epistemic injustice, reinforces the mutuality of testimonial exchanges where both the speaker and listener are actively engaged and obligated to participate well to succeed, and opens up a discussion of how even when being treated as a source of information, informants can be mistreated.

T1  - The Discursive Appeal to Solidarity and Partisan Journalism in Europe’s Migration Crisis
AN  - 2300632050
AB  - The article analyses the discursive appeal to solidarity in the mass media during the unfolding of Europe’s migration crisis. Solidarity was claimed by numerous actors in the public discourse to legitimise political decisions and mobilise public opinion. While it seems that the call for solidarity was shared by many actors, media studies show the ‘partisan journalism’ of media outlets. Thus, the political orientation of media outlets influences their coverage of public debates. Hence, to what extent do different quality newspapers cover the same solidarity claims in times of crisis? In order to answer this question, the crisis coverage of two German and two Irish newspapers with centre-left and centre-right political orientations is examined via the discourse network methodology. Germany is selected due to high political parallelism and a strong affectedness by the crisis, while Ireland is selected because of low political parallelism and a weak affectedness by the migration crisis. The findings demonstrate that partisan journalism persists during Europe’s migration crisis. Especially German party actors are present in both countries, underpinning the central position of Germany. Regarding the appeal to solidarity, political solidarity claims prevail in all four newspapers, indicating the political-institutional asymmetry in the Common European Asylum System. The study contributes to the strategic framing of concepts in public debates and demonstrates that the left-right distinction of media outlets is hardly affected by the migration crisis.

T1  - Motivated Innumeracy: Estimating the Size of the Gun Owner Population and Its Consequences for Opposition to Gun Restrictions
AN  - 2159262471
AB  - Past research suggests that people substantially overestimate the size of minority populations. Labeled “innumeracy,” inflated estimates of minority populations can have a negative impact on intergroup relations and influence policy attitudes toward minority groups. Our research examines people’s estimates of the gun owner population in the United States. We discover that people vastly overestimate gun ownership and similarly misjudge its future growth. Estimations of size are influenced by several determinants including gun ownership and affective orientations toward gun owners. Gun owners, compared to nongun owners, reported higher estimations of the gun owner population. In addition, positive feelings toward gun owners were associated with increased estimates of gun ownership. Affective orientations toward minority populations are in fact a key predictor neglected by prior innumeracy studies. Finally, estimations of the gun owner population, and judgments about its future growth, were both significant determinants of gun policy preferences.Related ArticlesSmith‐Walter, Aaron, Holly L.

Nuestra investigación examina las estimaciones de las personas sobre la población propietaria de armas en los Estados Unidos. Descubrimos que las personas sobreestiman en exceso el número de propietarios de armas y de manera similar juzgan incorrectamente su crecimiento futuro. Las estimaciones de cantidad están influenciadas por varios factores determinantes, incluidas la posesión de armas y las orientaciones afectivas hacia los propietarios de las armas. Los propietarios de armas, en comparación con los que no tienen armas, reportaron estimaciones más altas de la población propietaria de armas. Además, los sentimientos positivos hacia los propietarios de armas se asociaron con mayores estimaciones de la posesión de armas. Las orientaciones afectivas hacia las poblaciones minoritarias son, de hecho, un predictor clave omitido por los estudios previos del innumerismo. Finalmente, las estimaciones de la población propietaria de armas y los juicios sobre su crecimiento futuro fueron determinantes significativos de las preferencias de la política de armas.Alternate abstract:以往研究认为，人们极大地高估了少数人口的数量。被贴上“数盲”（ innumeracy）这一标签、过高估计少数人口一事能对团体间关系产生负面影响，并影响对少数群体的政策态度。本文考察了人们对美国持枪人口的估计。本文发现，人们大幅高估了枪支持有人的数量，并错误判断了持枪一事的未来发展。对持枪人口数量的估计受到几个决定因素的影响，包括枪支所有权和（人们）对枪支持有人的情感取向。枪支持有人和非枪支持有人相比，前者对持枪人口数量的估计更高。此外，对持枪人的正面感受和持枪所有权的增加有关。对少数人口的情感定向实际上是一个关键的预测物，但它却被以往研究数盲的文章所忽略。本文结论认为，对持枪人口的估计，以及对持枪一事的未来发展的判断，二者都是枪支政策偏好的显著决定因素。

T1  - An East–West comparison of healthcare evaluations in Europe: Do institutions matter?
AN  - 2126428316
AB  - Differences in welfare attitudes of Eastern and Western Europeans have often been explained in terms of legacies of communism. In this article, we explore evaluations of healthcare systems across European countries and argue that East–West differences in these evaluations are explained by differences in the current institutional design of healthcare systems in the two regions. The empirical analysis is based on the fourth round of the European Social Survey, applying multilevel and multilevel mediation analysis. Our results support the institutional explanation. Regional differences in healthcare evaluations are explained by institutional characteristics of the healthcare system, that is, lower financial resources, higher out-of-pocket payments, and lower supply of primary healthcare services in Eastern compared to Western European countries. We conclude that specific aspects of the current institutional design of healthcare systems are crucial for understanding East–West differences in healthcare evaluations and encourage research to further explore the relevance of institutions for differences in welfare state attitudes across socio-political contexts.

T1  - Media Use and Satisfaction with Democracy: Testing the Role of Political Interest
AN  - 1967238023
AB  - In the process of political communication, media use has strong influences on citizens’ attitudes toward politics. However, the importance of political interest in shaping the relationship between media use and satisfaction with democracy has not been extensively studied. This study makes a contribution to identify the role of political interest in mediating the effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy. Consistent with the virtuous circle theory, the findings from this study show that there are significantly positive associations between reading a newspaper, listening to the radio, and using the Internet for political information and political interest. Citizens who are more interested in politics also tend to be more satisfied with democracy. By contrast, in accordance with the media malaise theory, our results also show that reading a newspaper, listening to the radio, and using the Internet for political information are negatively related to satisfaction with democracy. Distinct from existing literature, our findings indicate that the indirect positive effects of media use mediated by political interest are outweighed by the negative direct effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy. Hence, the relative magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are critical for the overall effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy.

T1  - Neighborhood Disadvantage and Neuropsychological Functioning as Part Mediators of the Race–Antisocial Relationship: A Serial Mediation Model
AN  - 2038236116
AB  - ObjectivesWe test a serial multiple mediation model in which the relationship between ethnicity and antisocial behavior is sequentially mediated by disadvantaged neighborhoods and impaired neuropsychological functioning.MethodsParental and self-report measures of antisocial behavior were assessed in a community sample of 341 adolescent males and females. Neighborhood disadvantage was assessed from census data. Neuropsychological functioning was evaluated using a computerized battery. Separate serial multiple mediation models were tested using non-executive functioning and executive functioning.ResultsThe serial mediation model for executive functioning was supported, with the pathway from race to antisocial behavior through neighborhood disadvantage and executive functioning in serial accounting for 10.8% of the total effect of race on antisocial behavior.ConclusionsFindings support social neurocriminology theory by integrating neighborhood disadvantage and executive functioning as sequential mediators of the race–antisocial relationship. To our knowledge, these are the first findings to explain the race–antisocial relationship in terms of connected social and neuropsychological processes. While this pathway is significant, the effect is still relatively small and thus should be understood as one of many mechanisms through which race may affect antisocial behavior. From a translational science standpoint, the identification of neurocognitive mechanisms by which neighborhood disadvantage predisposes to antisocial behavior suggests the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement techniques to remediate the negative effects of adverse neighborhoods on brain functioning in at-risk minority groups.

T1  - Commercial Counterhistory: Remapping the Movement in Lee Daniels' The Butler
AN  - 2034196060
AB  - Lee Daniels' The Butler (2013) might seem an unlikely candidate for intervening in Hollywood's civil rights genre, given both its nationalistic ending and its recuperation of iconic styles and images. This paper argues, however, that the film's pastiche interrogates past cinematic tropes for race and space; in this sense, it proves counterhistorical, a term indicating not a lack of accuracy but a commitment to illuminating the role of visual media in shaping contemporary understandings of history and to encouraging fresh perspectives on the past. Examining the many forms of constraint produced by iconic images of black and gendered personhood, the film also takes on the spatial icon with which many of these figures are associated - the southern plantation. Both exposing and challenging the ways in which spectacular accounts of southern racism occlude the geographic and political reach of African American movements against oppression, the film inconsistently insists on the importance of thinking across conventional demarcations of space and time. At these moments, it suggests possibilities for how even commercial cinema might contribute to new conceptions of black political history and possibility.

T1  - Hopes and Fears: Community Cohesion and the ‘White Working Class’ in One of the ‘Failed Spaces’ of Multiculturalism
AN  - 2016183896
AB  - Since 2001, community cohesion has been an English policy concern, with accompanying media discourse portraying a supposed failure by Muslims to integrate. Latterly, academia has foregrounded White majority attitudes towards ethnic diversity, particularly those of the ‘White working class’. While questioning this categorisation, we present data on attitudes towards diversity from low income, mainly White areas within Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, a town portrayed in media discourse as one of the ‘failed spaces’ of multiculturalism. Drawing on mixed methods research, we present and discuss data that provide a complex message, seemingly confirming pessimistic analyses around ethnic diversity and predominantly White neighbourhoods but also highlighting an appetite within the same communities for greater and more productive inter-ethnic contact. Furthermore, anxieties about diversity and integration have largely failed to coalesce into broad support for organised anti-minority politics manifest in groups such as the English Defence League.

T1  - Asian and Pacific American Voting
AN  - 2031052014
AB  - Words of Wisdom The field of Asian American politics is rapidly expanding with the continuous contributions of a growing number of political scientists--as well as other social scientists, historians, and public policy analysts--who have sought to document, analyze, theorize, and forecast the political dimensions of the Asian American experience.

(2018) have done a remarkable job demonstrating the benefits in advancing voting behavior research by disaggregating the voting-age population into three types and by controlling confounding factors such as language of media use and group-based identity and experiences.

Given the community's "model minority" image and the predominantly foreign-born population whose immigration was largely prohibited until the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, one common pitfall when studying statistics of the population is to characterize Asian Americans as perpetually apathetic or more interested in politics in and of Asia than what occurred to Asians in the United States proper.

T1  - Racial accountabilities: the legal legibility of racial state violence in the Special State's Attorney Report on Police Torture in Chicago
AN  - 1992736013
AB  - Public inquiries command significant political capital for liberal democratic states that premise their authority on being accountable to a generalized public sphere. By attending to the particular relations of visibility that are generated by these investigative state institutions, this article reveals the differentiated forms of legal and political accountability that structure the proceedings and case history of the 2006 Special State's Attorney Report, which investigated the torture of African American suspects by Chicago police officers under the supervision of former Commander Jon Burge. More specifically, this article documents the racial relations of power that shape how state actors and institutions are made to answer for their conduct, explicating the 'racial accountabilities' that mediated this public inquiry as well as the practices of state violence it was tasked with investigating. On the one hand, these forms of accountability focused blame on the individualized actions of particular state actors, abstracting their conduct from the broader systemic conditions that have rendered African American populations vulnerable to racial state violence. On the other hand, this article explains how the forensic gaze deployed throughout the legal investigations into torture reconstituted its victims as objects of law with differential access to its forms of protection and technologies of redress. By detailing the force and dimensions of these racial accountabilities, this article illustrates how public inquiries and other institutions of law can reproduce and extend racial fields of violence while also regenerating public confidence in the efficacy and equality of the state.

T1  - "If You're a Parasite, Then You're Not Normal": Exploring Perceptions of Normality with Individuals who have Experienced Depression
TT  - "Si eres un parásito, entonces no eres normal": explorando las percepciones de normalidad con individuos que han experimentado la depresión
AN  - 2140800419
AB  - Investigaciones sociológicas previas han demostrado que lo que se denomina cordura o salud mental se describe según un ideal social. Los problemas de salud mental han sido teorizados como una desviación de tales normas. La depresión, en particular, ha sido objeto de la contemplación sociológica, con respecto a su divergencia de una normatividad social occidental centrada en la funcionalidad, la adaptación y la productividad. Esta investigación se suma a este cuerpo de trabajo sobre la depresión como la desviación de las normas sociales, queriendo abordar una brecha dentro de la literatura, mediante la exploración de las formas en las que el estado "post-depresivo" se puede definir de acuerdo con las normas sociales. Se pretende analizar los vínculos entre "post-depresión" y la normalidad, desde la perspectiva de individuos que han padecido depresión. Se realizaron 46 entrevistas semiestructuradas con individuos canadienses que han experimentado depresión. Los resultados de nuestro análisis de contenido muestran que la ausencia de depresión a menudo es sinónimo de normalidad y se caracteriza por las siguientes dimensiones: una actitud positiva; el potencial para tomar decisiones; funcionalidad y rendimiento; autogestión; una relación positiva con los demás; y la noción de proyectos significativos. Nuestros resultados muestran que los participantes no definen la ausencia de depresión después de los indicadores psiquiátricos o clínicos, tal y como se registra en el DSM, y que no consideran que sea un retorno a un estado previo a la depresión. Por el contrario, la post-depresión es idealizada, percibida como un estado de conformidad infalible con las expectativas y normas sociales.Alternate abstract:Previous research in sociology has shown that what is considered as sanity or mental health is described according to a social ideal. Mental health problems have been theorized as a deviance from such norms. Depression, in particular, has been the object of sociological contemplation due to its divergence from a Western social normativity focused on functionality, adaptation and productivity. This research adds to this body of work on depression as a deviation from social norms. It seeks to address a gap within the literature, by exploring the ways in which the "post-depressive" state may be defined in accordance with social norms. As such, it analyzes the links between "post-depression" and normality, from the perspective of individuals having lived with depression. 46 semi-structured interviews were conducted with Canadians individuals who have experienced depression. Results from our content analysis show that the absence of depression was often synonymous with normality and characterized by the following dimensions: a positive attitude; the potential to take action; functionality and performance; self-management; a positive relationship with others; and the notion of meaningful projects. Our results show that participants do not define the absence of depression following psychiatric or clinical indicators, as recorded in the DSM, and that they do not consider it to be a return to an anterior, pre-depression, state. Rather, post-depression is idealized, perceived as a state of unfailing conformity to social expectations and norms.

T1  - The Racialization of Latino Immigrants in New Destinations: Criminality, Ascription, and Countermobilization
AN  - 2132247467
AB  - This article analyzes patterns in Latino immigrant racialization in the U.S. South. Drawing on a unique dataset of more than 4,200 news stories from the region, we find that Latino immigrants face multifaceted racialization in the news media and that this racialization shares substantive similarities with African American racialization processes. The most dominant negative characterizations of Mexican and Latino immigrants focus on their perceived criminal tendencies. Claims of Latino criminality apply implicitly coded racial language about black criminality to new Latino arrivals. A close qualitative analysis of these trends reveals an ongoing cycle of racialization in which immigration foes challenge Latino or Mexican immigrants as criminal elements and immigration advocates respond with charges of racism and discrimination. Supplemental analyses from four African American newspapers suggest that black elites perceive Latinos as sharing a common experience of racial discrimination at the hands of whites.

T1  - Bureau Clergyman: How the FBI Colluded with an African American Televangelist to Destroy Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
AN  - 2007620385
AB  - This article explains how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) partnered with African American minister Elder Lightfoot Solomon Michaux to discredit and neutralize Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. The Elder, the nation's first minister (black or white) to have his own weekly television show, colluded with the Bureau to shape public opinion against King and cast doubt upon King's religious commitments and activities. Michaux was, what I call, a Bureau Clergyman: a minister who was an FBI "Special Service Contact" or on the Bureau's "Special Correspondents Lists." Far from secret informants, black and white male clergy in these official Bureau programs enjoyed very public and cooperative relationships with the FBI and were occasionally "called into service" to work in concert with the FBI. The FBI called upon Michaux and he willingly used his status, popular media ministry, and cold war spirituality to publically scandalize King as a communist and defend the Bureau against King's criticisms. In the end, the Elder demonized King, contested calls for black equality under the law, and lionized the FBI as the keeper of Christian America. The story moves the field beyond the very well known narratives of the FBI's hostility towards religion and reveals how the Bureau publicly embraced religion and commissioned their clergymen to help maintain prevailing social arrangements. Michaux's relationship with the FBI also offers a window into the overlooked religious dimensions of the FBI's opposition to King, even as it highlights how black clergy articulated and followed competing ideologies of black liberation during the civil rights movement.

T1  - The Relation between Ethnic and Civic Views on Citizenship, Attitudes towards Immigrants and Sympathy for Welfare Recipients
AN  - 1980696333
AB  - In this study we investigate the relationship between different definitions of national citizenship, sympathy for welfare recipients, and how this relation is mediated by attitudes towards immigrants. We make use of the 2008 wave of the Belgian Political Panel Survey 2006-11, in which over 4,800 18-year-old adolescents were questioned. The results demonstrate that an agreement with both ethnic and civic definitions of national citizenship is related to reduced sympathy for welfare recipients, although the association with an ethnic view on citizenship is clearly dominant. Furthermore, these relations are almost entirely of an indirect nature: ethnic and civic citizenship attitudes are associated with negative views on immigrants, which, in turn, is the key variable that is associated with reduced sympathy for welfare recipients.

T1  - RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, RACIAL SOCIALIZATION, AND CRIME OVER TIME: A SOCIAL SCHEMATIC THEORY MODEL
AN  - 1968363348
AB  - Recent studies evince that interpersonal racial discrimination (IRD) increases the risk of crime among African Americans and familial racial socialization fosters resilience to discrimination's criminogenic effects. Yet, studies have focused on the short-term effects of IRD and racial socialization largely among adolescents. In this study, we seek to advance knowledge by elucidating how racialized experiences--in interactions and socialization--influence crime for African Americans over time. Elaborating Simons and Burt's (2011) social schematic theory, we trace the effects of childhood IRD and familial racial socialization on adult offending through cognitive and social pathways and their interplay. We test this life-course SST model using data from the FACHS, a multisite study of Black youth and their families from ages 10 to 25. Consistent with the model, analyses reveal that the criminogenic consequences of childhood IRD are mediated cognitively by a criminogenic knowledge structure and socially through the nature of social relationships in concert with ongoing offending and discrimination experiences. Specifically, by increasing criminogenic cognitive schemas, IRD decreases embeddedness in supportive romantic, educational, and employment relations, which influence social schemas and later crime. Consonant with expectations, the findings also indicate that racial socialization provides enduring resilience by both compensating for and buffering discrimination's criminogenic effects.

T1  - The Anglophone Press in Cameroon: Mediating the Anglophone Problem
AN  - 2630532170
AB  - In Cameroon the press is usually nicknamed the fourth power, after the executive, legislature, and judiciary. The press stands as a watchdog of society so much so that the government respects its engagement with the people. Whenever the government faults, the press exposes it. Since the reunification of West and East Cameroons in 1961, the former has been complaining of maltreatment by the latter. Considering the pivotal role played by the Anglophone press in addressing this problem, this paper argues that it is the main advocate of the Anglophone case in Cameroon, standing as the vanguard of Anglophone society.

T1  - POLITICAL PARTIES, IMMIGRATION, AND PANETHNICITY: LATINO COALITIONS IN BARCELONA
AN  - 2027577021
AB  - Most studies on panethnicity have focused on the United States, leaving researchers with little understanding of how it becomes institutionalized in areas with different racial politics and histories. Drawing on fifty-two in-depth interviews with Latin American immigrant leaders, political party operatives, and bureaucrats, in addition to fourteen weeks of participant observation, I examine the establishment of panethnic Latino coalitions in the Barcelona, Spain, which has witnessed a sharp increase in Latin American migration. I argue that unlike in the United States, in Spain political parties play a critical role in establishing panethnic coalitions. They do so by enabling the development of panethnic civic organizations that they hope will be politically loyal to them. Latin American immigrant leaders respond to these efforts by cooperating with parties while also resisting political pressure. Specifically, immigrant leaders forge networks with one another that cross party lines, use media to promote the nonpartisan aspects of panethnicity, and construct cultural and instrumental narratives about panethnic unity. These strategies help immigrant leaders weather political shifts and make panethnicity seem to have arisen organically. Panethnicity is forged as a strategic, cultural, and experiential form of community identification precisely through this interaction between parties, immigrant leaders, and media. Implications for understanding how panethnicity becomes institutionalized and avenues for further international research on panethnicity are discussed.

AB  - Using nationally representative data from the 2010 NCAA Growth, Opportunities, Aspirations and Learning of Students in college (GOALS) survey, this study examines whether student-athletes' cross-racial interactions correlate with their college satisfaction. Our findings suggest a small but statistically significant correlation between cross-racial interactions and satisfaction, but this relationship was partial mediated by the student-athlete perceptions of team inclusiveness culture. Findings and implications are discussed.

T1  - 'Race' and HIV vulnerability in a transnational context: the case of Chinese immigrants to Canada
AN  - 1900988798
AB  - Although immigrants' sustained connections with their homelands are well documented, so far we know little about how 'race' - in particular, conceptions of race back home - influences the HIV vulnerability of racialised immigrants to Western countries. Drawing on data from a multi-sited, qualitative study of Chinese immigrants to Canada, this paper presents a contextualised understanding of the impacts of race on HIV risk faced by these individuals in a transnational context. Data were collected from four study sites in Canada and China as part of a study investigating the relationship between HIV risk and transnationalism. Although race appears to have bearing on their risk perceptions and sexual practices, immigrants' understandings of race are not necessarily consistent with dominant discourses of race in Canada, but are also mediated by their racial habitus developed in China. Findings reveal the complex power dynamics - not just power asymmetries but also power fluidity - around race from a transnational perspective and thus challenge the assumed dichotomy of dominance and subordination underpinning traditional explanations of the relationship between race and HIV risk. In the context of transnationalism, researchers should go beyond a nation-bound concept of society (i.e. the host society) and take into account the simultaneous influence of both host and home countries on immigrant health.

T1  - College Women's Subjective Femininity Stress, Gender Solidarity, and Psychological Help-Seeking Intentions
AN  - 1898547375
AB  - Female gender has been consistently associated with positive psychological help-seeking attitudes and behaviors; however, surprisingly few empirical studies have examined how femininity-related variables impact women's help-seeking decision making. Informed by the theory of reasoned action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980), the purpose of this study was (a) to investigate the associations between two femininity constructs--subjective femininity stress and gender solidarity--and psychological help-seeking intention, and (b) to explore the mediating roles of help-seeking attitudes and social stigma using structural equation modeling. Participants were 451 college-enrolled women in Southern California. Results revealed that all the mediation relationships involving help-seeking attitudes and stigma were significant. Subjective femininity stress was positively related to help-seeking intention via help-seeking attitudes, but was negatively related to intention via social stigma. Gender solidarity was positively related to help-seeking intention via positive attitudes and reduced social stigma. Implications for future research, prevention programs, and practice are discussed.

T1  - Nonverbal Communication in Politics: PROD
AN  - 1851014228
AB  - This article reviews research contributions in political science and communication to the topic of nonverbal communication and politics from 2005 to 2015. The review opens with research on the content of nonverbal communication, then considers studies examining what moderates the impact of nonverbal aspects of political messages on attitudes and behavior and the mechanisms that underpin these effects. Over the period reviewed here, research shows that the nonverbal channel is rich in political information and is consequential for political decision making, particularly under certain circumstances, such as in low-information conditions. Visuals affect political decisions through cognitive and emotional routes. This review article also identifies several directions where further research is required, particularly with regard to social media, nonvisual aspects of nonverbal communication, the interplay of visual and verbal arguments, and the mechanisms behind the effects of nonverbal communication.

T1  - Defensive representations of an uncomfortable history: The case of Hungary and the Holocaust
AN  - 1842819606
AB  - The current research examines how representations of a traumatic history influence contemporary intergroup attitudes. Specifically, we examine antisemitism in Hungary as a case example of how the need to defend the group's moral image motivates the assumption of a defensive representation of history -- a modification of the group's narrative with regards to its culpability in past atrocities committed against another group. Two studies examined the link between defensive representations of the Holocaust, nationalism, and antisemitism. In the first, correlational study (N = 348), we found that Hungarian nationalism and antisemitism were associated, and that this association was significantly mediated by defensive representations of the Holocaust -- high nationalism was associated with higher endorsement of defensive representations which in turn were associated with more antisemitism. Low nationalism was associated with greater acknowledgement of in-group responsibility for historical crimes which was associated with less antisemitism. These findings were corroborated in an experimental study (N = 165) which indicated that priming defensive representations of the Holocaust increased antisemitism, even when controlling for nationalism. Study 2 further showed, in a 2-step mediation model, that defensive representation primes increased secondary antisemitism, conspiratorial antisemitism, and negative attitudes towards Israel. We discuss the implications of defensive representations of history on contemporary intergroup relations.

T1  - Richard Sherman Speaks and Almost Breaks the Internet: Race, Media, and Football1
AN  - 1805051199
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted)
On January 19, 2014, NFL star Richard Sherman made a game winning play, blocking a pass intended for receiver Michael Crabtree in a matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers. In an interview with Erin Andrews immediately following the game, Sherman, with great intensity, shouted, "I'm the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that is the result you are going to get. Don't you ever talk about me. [...] Crabtree. Don't you open your mouth about the best, or I'm going to shut it for you real quick. L-O-B." The brief interview, captured live on camera, provided a visual drama as arresting as the script and exploded through social media and mainstream news. Through the lens of symbolic convergence theory (SCT) informed by visual rhetoric and critical race theory (CRT), the authors examine news and citizen coverage of the Sherman interview during the week following the incident. Responses to this incident highlight how sexism, racism, and various forms of oppression have predictable patterns including casting groups as the "other" and naturalizing practices of subordination. Further, the authors show how symbols and mediated dramas shape and define social relationships.

T1  - Different Game, Different Frame?: Black Counterdiscourses and Depictions of Immigration in Atlanta's African-American and Mainstream Press
AN  - 1802482699
AB  - This article compares the discourse on immigration found in Atlanta's African-American press (Atlanta Daily World) to that found in Atlanta's mainstream press (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). The Daily World's black counterdiscourse situates immigration within a racial frame, discussing Latinos and immigrants interchangeably and casting African Americans as deserving yet excluded citizens. Immigrants appear in the Daily World as either allies in the struggle for civil rights or as competitors for jobs. Although the Daily World crime frames focus on concerns about racial profiling, the Journal-Constitution often depicts immigrants as criminals or discusses immigration in terms of legal status and policy.

T1  - The Post-Racial Society is here
AN  - 1925690461
AB  - Since state-sanctioned racism has effectively been outlawed, Rich contends, we already have a post-racial society, and the media's emphasis on racial strife compounds our own failure to recognize this.In this complex and contemporary examination of American cultural attitudes toward race, Rich offers a series of lectures and essays that situate his topic in an historical timeline.In making his case that Americans resist the idea that we are already living in a post-racial society because of a focus on residual attitudes, Rich provides a useful generational structure for readers to consider.Furthermore, the current generation of Americans does not find race-based attitudes attractive, so the leaders of tomorrow will approach the future from a standpoint that does not include old prejudices.In summary, The Post-Racial Society Is Here by Wilbur C. Rich offers a compelling argument as to why Americans must recognize and embrace a cultural shift that, he contends, has already occurred.

T1  - Mass media, new technology, and ideology: An analysis of political trends in China
AN  - 2427491720
AB  - Based on a nationwide survey, this study examines the mediated constructions of political ideology and its antecedents in contemporary China. The empirical findings offer insights into China’s future by examining political beliefs in the country. Our study found that most of the respondents share an inclination toward Liberalism, indicating that the general public harbors expectations not only for expansion of market competition to ensure the country’s successful entry into the world economic system in the age of globalization, but also for deepening political reforms, increased supervision of political power, and growing access to democratic participation. The study also investigated the relationship between media use and political ideology, as the former, together with new technology, predicts the latter to varying degrees. In addition, social psychological factors such as the motivation to use the Internet and trust in media were found to play significant roles in these complex relationships. Individuals’ social interactions and their political cognitions also help to explain the complexity of political ideology in a transitional society.

T1  - Deficits in Emotional Clarity and Vulnerability to Peer Victimization and Internalizing Symptoms Among Early Adolescents
AN  - 1752874256
AB  - Peer victimization is a significant risk factor for a range of negative outcomes during adolescence, including depression and anxiety. Recent research has evaluated individual characteristics that heighten the risk of experiencing peer victimization. However, the role of emotional clarity, or the ability to understand one's emotions, in being the target of peer victimization remains unclear. Thus, the present study evaluated whether deficits in emotional clarity increased the risk of experiencing peer victimization, particularly among adolescent girls, which, in turn, contributed to prospective levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. In the present study, 355 early adolescents (ages 12-13; 53 % female; 51 % African American) who were part of the Adolescent Cognition and Emotion project completed measures of emotional clarity, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and measures of peer victimization, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms at follow-up. Moderation analyses indicated that deficits in emotional clarity predicted greater peer victimization among adolescent girls, but not adolescent boys. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that deficits in emotional clarity contributed to relational peer victimization, which, in turn, predicted prospective levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms among adolescent girls, but not boys. These findings indicate that deficits in emotional clarity represent a significant risk factor for adolescent girls to experience relational peer victimization, which, in turn, contributed to prospective levels of internalizing symptoms. Thus, prevention programs should target deficits in emotional clarity to prevent peer victimization and subsequent internalizing symptoms among adolescent girls.

T1  - Masking fears: SARS and the politics of public health in China
AN  - 1733940856
AB  - This paper examines shifts in attitudes to mask-wearing during and in the aftermath of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 2002-2003. In the PRC, as throughout East Asia, face masks were widely adopted as a practical preventative measure. However, the ubiquitous image of the masked Chinese citizen in both the Chinese and international media also acquired a political resonance. Masks were equated with the Party's attempts to censure dissent and 'cover up' the epidemic. A perceived lack of government transparency, at least in the initial phase of SARS, recalled earlier public health incidents and episodes of public dissension, notably the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Drawing on samples of qualitative data from a broad range of Chinese and English language sources, the paper shows how debates about mask-wearing in China during SARS became intertwined with political concerns, reflecting a tension between the Party's liberalizing policy -- epitomized by the country's admission to membership of the World Trade Organization in December 2001 -- and real anxieties about the consequential 'fall-out' of this new openness. The paper concludes by arguing for an approach to public health which incorporates a critical capacity, particularly in relation to the ways in which political contexts may determine responses to epidemic episodes.

T1  - "The Contact Hypothesis" and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting
AN  - 1674198756
AB  - "The contact hypothesis" refers to the value of heterosexuals' interpersonal contact with gay men and lesbians in lowering negative attitudes toward them. With the increasing number of same-sex parented families worldwide, in spite of a generalized lack of appropriate social and legal protection, the issue of attitudes toward gay and lesbian parents gains special relevance. A sample of 1690 Portuguese heterosexual individuals were asked about their interpersonal contact experiences with gay men and lesbians, their attitudes toward them and toward same-sex parenting. Results revealed that women and non-religious participants were significantly more likely to have gay and lesbian acquaintances and friends, feel more comfortable in their company, and hold less negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, and gay and lesbian parenting. A path analysis model revealed that interpersonal contact experiences were not directly linked to attitudes toward same-sex families, but were mediated by homonegativity and comfort with gay men and lesbians. These findings extend previous knowledge about the value of interpersonal contact, by highlighting the roles of homonegativity and positive affect as mediators of contact experiences on attitudes toward same-sex parented families.

T1  - Othering Obama: Racial Attitudes and Dubious Beliefs about the Nation's First Black President
AN  - 1700675574; 201525330
AB  - The literature on descriptive representation indicates that the election of black political leaders may prompt white enmity. We assess this claim by examining the relationship between whites' racial attitudes and their likelihood of othering Barack Obama by labeling him as a Muslim and/or a noncitizen interloper. The findings reveal that both symbolic racial resentment and traditional racial attitudes are associated with othering Obama. In addition, the results reveal that the relationship between racial resentment and othering is substantially mediated by the use of seemingly nonracist frames based on emotional reactions and negative expectations about an Obama presidency. Conversely, much of the effect of belief in traditional antiblack stereotypes was transmitted directly to othering Obama without the use of justificatory frames. Despite claims of racial progress, our findings suggest that racial sentiments -- both overt and symbolic -- continue to play a major role in politics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Learning not to labour: a micro analysis of consensual male unemployment
AN  - 1536111687
AB  - Purpose - The Drifters are ten long-term unemployed British men. The Drifters' unemployment is consensual: the men believe they have chosen to "not work" and rely upon welfare benefits for their socio-economic survival. The purpose of this paper is to present micro sociological analysis of the Drifters' existences which focuses upon first, exploring why the Drifters' consensual unemployment has resulted in them experiencing high levels of stigma in their everyday lives; second, analysing the Drifters' (micro) relationships with (macro) unemployment policies. Design/methodology/approach - Primary, qualitative data were elicited from the Drifters during two phases of fieldwork. In both phases of fieldwork, the author conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews and participant observation-based research with the Drifters to generate data on how the men subjectively experience and account for the intersection of consensual non-work, welfare reliance and stigma in their lives. Findings - In the pseudonymous locale where the Drifters reside (Dramen) displaying a willingness to work is - despite high rates of local unemployment - a social expectation and marker of "respectable" masculinity. By living lives of consensual non-work and welfare reliance, the Drifters violate a localised cultural code and are accordingly stigmatised. Rather than attempting to manage their stigma, the Drifters ritually indulge in secondary deviant behaviours. This amplifies the Drifters' statuses as reviled agents. The Drifters lack employment options. The Drifters have been able to successfully exploit unemployment benefits. Accordingly, the Drifters' non-work is somewhat inevitable, rather than lamentable, as many citizens in Dramen believe; and as wider current right-leaning political and media rhetoric relating to unemployment implies. Originality/value - Examinations into the lives of non-consensually unemployed males exist. However, the lives of males who are unemployed apparently consensually - i.e. out of choice - remain under-researched. This paper functions as a micro empirical corrective, which diversifies the way male unemployment in capitalist societies can be viewed; and which offers a fresh look at how proposed unemployment welfare reform may impact the Drifters and the group in British society which the Drifters represent more broadly.

T1  - Unpacking the Use of Social Media for Protest Behavior: The Roles of Information, Opinion Expression, and Activism: PROD
AN  - 1372783007
AB  - Recent studies have shown a positive link between frequency of social media use and political participation. However, there has been no clear elaboration of how using social media translates into increased political activity. The current study examines three explanations for this relationship in the context of citizens' protest behavior: information (social media as a source for news), opinion expression (using social media to express political opinions), and activism (joining causes and finding mobilizing information through social media). To test these relationships, the study uses survey data collected in Chile in 2011, amid massive demonstrations demanding wholesale changes in education and energy policy. Findings suggest that using social media for opinion expression and activism mediates the relationship between overall social media use and protest behavior. These findings deepen our knowledge of the uses and effects of social media and provide new evidence on the role of digital platforms as facilitators of direct political action.

T1  - Strategic solidarity: Japanese imaginings of Blacks and race in popular media
AN  - 1315600436; 201308336
AB  - By the twentieth century, Black intellectuals envisioned Japan as a beacon of their own possibilities. Japanese perceptions of this bond are typically implicitly assumed in most research on the subject. In this essay we argue that Japan saw Black America as a symbol of strategic not substantive solidarity. With its entrance onto the international scene in the nineteenth century, Japan encountered an international racial hierarchy, and struggled in formulating an emergent self-identity that would allow it to rationalize its rightful place alongside White Western powers. On the eve of the Second World War, Japan's national/racial identity is a complex set of influences: a merging of its own indigenous perceptions of race, an importation of outside racial ideology, and contextual needs linked to still trying to insert itself as an equal to Western powers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Iconic Ghetto
AN  - 1023026619; 201223768
AB  - In the minds of many Americans, the ghetto is where "the black people live," symbolizing an impoverished, crime-prone, drug-infested, and violent area of the city. Aided by the mass media and popular culture, this image of the ghetto has achieved an iconic status, and serves as a powerful source of stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. The history of racism in America, along with the ascription of "ghetto" to anonymous blacks, has burdened blacks with a negative presumption they must disprove before they can establish mutually trusting relationships with others. The poorest blacks occupy a caste-like status, and for the black middle class, contradictions and dilemmas of status are common, underscoring the racial divide and exacerbating racial tensions.

T1  - Masbirim Israel: Israel's PR Campaign as Glocalized and Grobalized Political Prosumption: PROD
AN  - 939162274
AB  - In 2010, Israel's Ministry of Information and Diaspora Affairs launched a new campaign: Masbirim Israel. Its purpose was to "recruit" Israeli citizens to the task of improving the nation's public image in the world. It was the first time a well-organized campaign was launched, systematically employing new-media tools and calling on Israeli citizens to independently take part in improving their country's international image -- all at the behest of a government ministry. The executive authority in effect delivered some of its responsibilities and obligations to private hands. This article discusses prosumption in the political sphere and expands the idea of prosumption to a domain in which the state itself is the producer and its citizens are the consumers. Prosumption is perceived as acts conducted by citizens who operate to fulfill aims (i.e., produce products) that traditionally have been in the purview of the state. The article presents two arguments: First, the campaign is an expression of the idea of prosumption in the political sphere. By integrating Israel's citizens in the process of public relations (PR), they become prosumers in the sense that they participate in the production of a public good that traditionally has been supplied by the state. Second, the Masbirim Israel campaign is an expression of a glocalized and grobalized condition in Israeli reality, as it reflects trends of neoliberal values and practices of privatization and expresses the political opinions of (extreme) nationalism and particularism to nonformally "recruit" its citizens to the national PR effort.

T1  - Improving implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes using imagined contact: An experimental intervention with elementary school children
AN  - 1023028882; 201223708
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) on elementary school children's explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. Italian 5th-graders participated in a 3-week intervention involving imagining meeting an unknown immigrant peer in various situations. Approximately 1 week after the last session, they completed measures of self-disclosure and behavioral intentions toward immigrants. Furthermore, they were administered a measure of implicit prejudice. Results showed that those taking part in the intervention, compared to participants in a control condition, revealed more positive behavioral intentions and implicit attitudes toward immigrants. Moreover, self-disclosure mediated the effect of imagined contact on outgroup behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - News use and political socialization among young Jordanians: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1907814848
AB  - This study examined the relationship between young Jordanians' (N = 321) news use and their feelings toward the Jordanian and US governments. Consumption of traditional news delivery formats (such as print newspapers, radio broadcasts and interpersonal sources) was measured, as was reliance on new media formats such as blogs, text messaging and podcasting. Political socialization measures were indices of political trust and appraisals of the US government. Results suggest that young Jordanians in the sample rely mostly on TV news, newspapers and interpersonal contacts for current events information, and that TV news use and reliance on interpersonal sources were associated with negative views of the US government.

T1  - Attitudes influence implicit racial face categorization in a perceptual task: GPIR
AN  - 1907333120
AB  - Perceptual mechanisms have been proposed for the categorization of racial faces. Social cognitive mechanisms involved in the categorization of racial faces, however, remain unclear. The present study investigated whether and how attitudes influence racial face categorization by measuring reaction times to judge orientations of own-race or other-race faces. Study 1 showed that, in a task of judging orientations of Caucasian and Asian faces, European Americans responded faster to own-race (Caucasian) faces than to other-race (Asian) faces. Study 2 showed that Han Chinese responded faster to own-race (Han Chinese) faces than to other-race (Uigur Chinese) faces. In addition, we found that, in both experiments, own-race advantage in reaction times was eliminated by inducing negative attitudes toward own-race faces using a negative association priming procedure. Moreover, the mediation analysis in Study 2 showed that the priming effect was mediated by attitude bias toward own-race faces. Our findings provide evidence for categorization of racial faces in a perceptual, race-irrelevant task, which, however, is strongly modulated by attitudes toward target faces.

T1  - Aspects of Homophobia in Italian High Schools: Students' Attitudes and Perceptions of School Climate
AN  - 1545061467
AB  - This study investigated Italian high school students' negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians and their exposure to aspects of homophobia in their schools. Female students viewed gay men and lesbians in similar ways. Male students, on the other hand, held more negative attitudes toward gay men than toward lesbians. Participants reported widespread experiences of homophobic behaviors in their schools, especially verbal abuse. Students' perceptions of a homophobic school climate and respondent sex predicted homophobic attitudes among participants. Homophobic school climate mediated the relationship between respondent sex (male) and homophobia against gay men.

T1  - An Analysis of Factors Affecting Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage: Do the Media Matter?
AN  - 1283638415; 201303374
AB  - Using a survey of more than 5,000 American consumers, this study examines connections between attitudes toward same-sex marriage and media consumption. A positive attitude is predicted by being liberal and less religious, supporting gender and racial equality, willing to try anything once, considering television the primary form of entertainment, watching political talk shows, and reading blogs. The theoretical and methodological contributions and real-world implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Sexting" and adult romantic attachment
AN  - 907924953; 201125104
AB  - "Sexting" refers to sending and receiving sexually suggestive images, videos, or texts on cell phones. As a means for maintaining or initiating a relationship, sexting behavior and attitudes may be understood through adult attachment theory. One hundred and twenty-eight participants (M = 22 and F = 106), aged 18-30 years, completed an online questionnaire about their adult attachment styles and sexting behavior and attitudes. Attachment anxiety predicted sending texts that solicit sexual activity for those individuals in relationships. Attachment anxiety also predicted positive attitudes towards sexting such as accepting it as normal, that it will enhance the relationship, and that partners will expect sexting. Sexting may be a novel form for expressing attachment anxiety. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Attributional processes underlying imagined contact effects
AN  - 902083904; 201122119
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that mentally simulating positive intergroup encounters can promote tolerance and more positive intergroup attitudes. We explored the attributional processes underlying these effects. In our study participants who imagined intergroup contact subsequently reported greater intentions to engage in future contact, a relationship that was mediated by participants' attribution, to themselves, of a more positive attitudinal orientation towards outgroup contact. Consistent with this attributional account, the perspective taken when imagining the encounter qualified this effect. Participants who imagined the encounter from a third-person perspective reported heightened intentions to engage in future contact relative to control participants, while this was not the case when the encounter was imagined from a first-person perspective. These findings suggest that attributional processes are key to observing the benefits that accrue from imagining intergroup contact. We speculate that these attributions may distinguish the approach from extended and actual forms of contact and help researchers to further capitalize on the benefits of mental imagery for improving intergroup relations.

T1  - Understanding the Occurrence of Interracial Marriage in the United States Through Differential Assimilation
AN  - 835111551; 201100517
AB  - American society is undergoing unprecedented cultural changes in the 21st century. This social transformation began with the civil rights movement in the 1960s. As the United States becomes more diverse, both racially and ethnically, equal access to a variety of social institutions and organizations becomes more challenging. With respect to marriage, popular media continually report the blurring of boundaries between racial and ethnic groups. As a result, there has been a tremendous increase in interracial dating and marriage over the past several decades. There are considerable differences between the occurrence of interracial dating and interracial marriage. Data suggest that there is a much higher level of interracial dating in comparison to interracial marriage. This research effort focuses on trends in interracial marriages in the United States between 1980 and 2006. Information from the U.S. Census Bureau was used to analyze changes in the number and frequency of interracial marriages in American society over a 22-year time frame. Differential assimilation is employed for understanding interracial marriage trends and distinguishing important statistical differences between marriages with a Black1 spouse and those interracial marriages not involving a Black spouse. This exploration provides important empirical findings for assessing the progress of assimilation in America. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Effects of citizenship dissimilarity and national pride on attitudes toward immigrants: Investigating mediators and moderators of intergroup contact
AN  - 822521913; 201072857
AB  - Building on research from organizational sociology and the contact hypothesis, we incorporated community characteristics to examine how coworker citizenship dissimilarity influences employees' attitudes towards immigrants. We also proposed that the nature of this relationship would depend on national pride. Results from a national survey (n = 559) indicated living with more immigrants in one's neighborhood corresponded in heightened citizenship dissimilarity at the workplace. It, in turn, corresponded in employees holding more favorable views of immigrants. This effect was the most pronounced for people with high levels of national pride because of the presumably increased opportunities to dispel their previously held negative stereotypes about out-group members.

T1  - Mass Media and Governmental Framing of Riots: The Case of Tulsa, 1921
AN  - 89287716
AB  - This research extends the theoretical concept of framing to the phenomenon of race riots using the Tulsa riot of 1921 as a case study. Media accounts of this riot published during 1921 illustrate both prognostic and diagnostic framing strategies and techniques and demonstrate how these processes affected official responses. Results of this research suggest that framing is a critical process associated with media and organizational representation of riots. Analyses indicate that the riot was officially attributed to an armed group of Black citizens whose goal was to protect one of its community members from a potential lynching. However, Black residents framed the riot differently in statements of their account of the events. A recurrent theme for both races and a number of media reports was that of inept and incompetent law enforcement officials. The authors suggest that prognostic solutions to riots (e.g., police strategies and tactics and reconciliatory attempts) are rooted in diagnostic assessments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
