T1  - Revisiting the development trajectory of the digital divide: A main path analysis approach
AN  - 2696511498
AB  - The nature of the digital divide reflects inequalities in digital utilization, which is understood to be a multidimensional phenomenon encompassing accessibility to ICTs, capabilities to use digital technologies, and the benefits from digital artifact usage. However, the growing fabric of the digital divide has changed the original conception of the phenomenon. To trace the dynamic nature of the digital divide, this study adopted key-route main path analysis (MPA) to track the most significant development trajectory from 2855 digital divide-related academic articles and the multiple global MPA to explore the present and future research trends. This study reviewed the major challenges of the digital divide and divided the path into three phases: ICTs connection, ICTs use, and ICTs affordance. In analyzing the main paths of the digital divide, we found three forms, including coverage of communication infrastructure, skills to use ICT devices, and an individual's online behaviors. This study, through key-route MPA, further proposes a practical framework, which provides an inclusive approach to dealing with the digital-related social exclusion.

T1  - Psychological bases of anti‐immigration attitudes among populist voters
AN  - 2673616615
AB  - The ascent of populism has been linked with economic and cultural disruptions of modernization. From this perspective, it could be implied that factors such as psychological insecurity and uncertainty are key in making voters gravitate toward the populist narrative. The present research aimed at highlighting the psychological determinants that uncertainties deriving from modernization processes may activate in populist voters. Specifically, we focused on immigration in Italy, investigating whether and how support for different populist parties relates to development of negative attitudes toward immigrants. Two samples of Italian adults (total N = 1655), who voted in the Italian general elections of March 4, 2018 took part in the research. Multigroup path analysis showed that assumption of anti‐immigration stances through the joint mediating role of Dangerous World Belief and Right‐Wing Authoritarianism was shared by different groups of populist voters. However, different populist voters differed in the strength of the path passing through Competitive Jungle World Belief and Social Dominance Orientation. Results underline the relevance of social worldviews and ideological attitudes in shaping the attitudes of the Italian populist electorate.

T1  - ‘Love comes first, and it is ahead of any different political partisanism’: How political polarizations compare to other forms of discrimination in Buenos Aires (Argentina)
AN  - 2649933574
AB  - Background:  Affective polarization and stigma toward individuals with schizophrenia and toward immigrants in Argentina are not new despite its importance and dissemination. However, no research has been conducted taking into consideration political partisanship and attitudes toward these groups.  Aims:  Political polarization and attitudes toward socialization across party lines are studied in conjunction with attitudes toward immigrants and toward individuals with schizophrenia.  Method:  Individuals from Buenos Aires (n = 712) were surveyed for their political partisanship and their attitudes toward Peruvian and Bolivian immigrants, people with schizophrenia and partisans from the opposing political party. A modified version of the Bogardus scale was used.  Results:  Social distance was from highest to lowest toward people with schizophrenia, political opponents, and immigrants. Individuals with schizophrenia were strongly discriminated against by most participants: 86% would definitely or probably not want them to take care of their children, 83% would not want them to be their healthcare provider, and 81% would not want to marry them. Immigrants were comparatively not discriminated against: 10% would not want them to take care of their children, 8% would not want to receive health care from them, and 28% would not want to marry them. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner partisans showed the lowest level of discrimination toward these two groups, compared to Mauricio Macri partisans and to independent voters. However, the former group had greater discriminatory attitudes toward Mauricio Macri partisans than the latter.  Conclusions:  As compared to other discriminatory attitudes, discrimination toward persons with schizophrenia is widespread and pervasive. Lower levels of discrimination toward people with schizophrenia and toward immigrants would not predict attitudes toward the opposing political partisans.

T1  - How information on sexism may increase women's perceptions of being excluded, threaten fundamental needs, and lower career motivation
AN  - 2687741370
AB  - The current research investigates the effects of exposure to information about the prevalence of sexism in society on women's perceptions, needs, expectations, and career motivation. We propose that such exposure to sexism prevalence may threaten women's fundamental need to belong, and induces perceptions of social exclusion. Study 1 provided correlational evidence that perceiving society as sexist relates to increased perceptions of being excluded. Three experimental studies demonstrated that exposure to information about sexism in the form of fictional research results (Study 2), or actual newspaper articles (Studies 3 and 4), increased women's experiences of social exclusion. Exposure to such information also lowered women's gender‐related expectations of achieving their preferred position in society, and reduced career motivation. Together, the article provides insight into the experiential and motivational reactions to sexism in society.

T1  - News media and public attitudes toward the protests of 2020: An examination of the mediating role of perceived protester violence
AN  - 2629339970
AB  - Research SummaryThis study investigates the role of the news media in shaping attitudes toward the protests of 2020. Using data from a nationally representative election survey, it examines the association between news consumption and support for law‐and‐order policies to address protest violence, with perceptions that the protesters were violent as a potential mediator. Findings indicate that viewers of online news are less likely to support law‐and‐order policies. This relationship is mediated by perceived protester violence, with perceived violence enhancing support for law‐and‐order policies. Further examination shows that political bias plays a role: viewers of left‐leaning sites are less likely to support law‐and‐order policies to address protest violence, while viewers of right‐leaning sites are more likely. These relationships are also mediated by perceived violence.Policy ImplicationsA slight majority of respondents indicate that they lean toward solving problems of racism and police violence, indicating that much of the American public is open to criminal justice reform. Perceived violence helps to shape the association of online news media with support for law‐and‐order policies. Activists should avoid violence in their protests and use Internet‐based media sources to publicize their peaceful activities and demands. Law enforcement agencies should use the Internet and social media to keep the public informed of the reality of protests, especially of any violence that occurs, in an effort to justify forceful tactics.

T1  - Social Media Expression, Political Extremity, and Reduced Network Interaction: An Imagined Audience Approach
AN  - 2651990206
AB  - The recent rise of political extremity and radicalization has presented unique challenges to contemporary politics, governance, and social cohesion in many societies in the world. In this study, we propose an imagined audience approach to understand how social media’s expanded expression capabilities are related to users’ political extremity and reduced network interaction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our imagined audience framework using a multi-country survey data set. Results from the United States, South Korea, and Japan reveal that expressive use of social media is associated with more extreme political attitudes and heightened intolerance, but the effect is contingent on whom the expresser has in mind as their audience. In particular, expressing one’s political self has a depolarizing effect for those expecting low audience reinforcement. We test the boundary conditions of our model in a more restricted information environment with a Chinese sample. We conclude by discussing the significance of our imagined audience approach and its relevance to today’s technology-mediated self-presentation.

T1  - Trump against Germany: Examining How News about Donald Trump’s Anti-German Utterances Affect Anti-Americanism in Germany—A Moderated Mediation Model
AN  - 2595039041
AB  - Donald Trump frequently attacks foreign countries such as Germany (e.g., via Twitter). Drawing from social identity theory and intergroup threat theory, I theorized that exposure to news about Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly increases anti-Americanism in Germany. First, I theorized that Trump’s utterances result in negative attitudes toward Trump and, in turn, increase anti-Americanism (spillover effect). Second, I theorized that Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly affect anti-Americanism via increased European Union (EU) popularity. Furthermore, I assumed that effects would be stronger for individuals low in political interest. A quota-based online experiment (N = 428) revealed that Trump’s anti-German utterances increased EU’s popularity. This effect was moderated by political interest. EU’s popularity was increased for moderately interested individuals and individuals low in political interest. No effects were detected for highly interested individuals. EU popularity, in turn, increased anti-Americanism. Therefore, Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly increased anti-Americanism burdening relations between Germany and the United States. Implications for journalistic news coverage are discussed.

T1  - From stigma to acceptance: Intellectual and developmental disabilities in Central China
AN  - 2606373850
AB  - Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities have historically been at high risk for social exclusion and other vulnerabilities. The Western world has shifted away from institutionally-based services and toward community-based services that allow for greater social inclusion as well as for meeting individual developmental needs, and China is beginning the process of exploring how to make this shift. In 2014 and 2015, a situation analysis examining the lived experiences of parents of children with disabilities in Zhengzhou, Henan, China, was undertaken. Perceptions of strengths, needs, opportunities, and barriers experienced by parents of children in intact families (i.e. families where children with disabilities remain in their birth families) were explored by means of parent interviews and focus groups. Families identify experiences of stigma and acceptance related to traditional and alternative social constructions of intellectual and developmental disabilities, and how they use social networks and information-sharing to help develop community-based services.

T1  - The impact of coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on education: The role of virtual and remote laboratories in education
AN  - 2617692184
AB  - To avoid the spread of the COVID-19 crisis, many countries worldwide have temporarily shut down their academic organizations. National and international closures affect over 91% of the education community of the world. E-learning is the only effective manner for educational institutions to coordinate the learning process during the global lockdown and quarantine period. Many educational institutions have instructed their students through remote learning technologies to face the effect of local closures and promote the continuity of the education process. This study examines the expected benefits of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing a new model to investigate this issue using a survey collected from the students at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed on 179 useable responses. This study applied Push-Pull-Mooring theory and examined how push, pull, and mooring variables impact learners to switch to virtual and remote educational laboratories. The Protection Motivation theory was employed to explain how the potential health risk and environmental threat can influence the expected benefits from e-learning services. The findings revealed that the push factor (environmental threat) is significantly related to perceived benefits. The pull factors (e-learning motivation, perceived information sharing, and social distancing) significantly impact learners' benefits. The mooring factor, namely perceived security, significantly impacts learners' benefits.

T1  - Exposure to television and support for restrictive immigration policies in the midst of the immigration crisis: A cross‐national comparison
AN  - 2615912839
AB  - ObjectiveThis study explored associations between television exposure and public support for restrictive immigration policies in Europe, distinguishing general television exposure from exposure to television news. We explored explanations of generalized social distrust and perceived ethnic threat and, moreover, acknowledged cross‐national variation in asylum applicants.MethodsWe applied multi‐level regression analyses using the European Social Survey (2014–2015), covering 19 countries (n = 29.161).ResultsGeneral television exposure and support for restrictive immigration policies related positively, whereas exposure to television news related negatively to these policy preferences. Furthermore, both generalized social distrust and perceived ethnic threat mediated the links between both forms of exposure and these preferences. An increase in the number of asylum applicants strengthened the positive relationship between general television exposure and these policy preferences.ConclusionsThis study provides new insights into the role of individual and national factors for support for restrictive immigration policies from a contemporary and cross‐national perspective.

T1  - The Opinion-Mobilizing Effect of Social Protest against Police Violence: Evidence from the 2020 George Floyd Protests
AN  - 2607243876
AB  - Does social protest following the police killing of unarmed Black civilians have a widespread “opinion-mobilizing” effect against the police? Or, does the racialized nature of these events polarize mass opinion based on standing racial and political orientations? To answer these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.

T1  - “You Don't Mess With Black Twitter!”: An Ubuntu Approach to Understanding “Militant” Twitter Discourse
AN  - 2622674156
AB  - The democratisation and proliferation of social media has seen the emergence of a distinct virtual community of Twitter users known as Black Twitter. This burgeoning community is characterised by discourses on cultural issues that are critical to the black community, such as race relations and identity politics in general. Black Twitter has often been criticised for its unashamed bashing of those who are perceived as displaying inauthenticity in their performance of identity and their positions on the critical issues debated on Twitter. This article reports on a study that employed a small-scale online ethnographic approach to collect a sample of tweets from a Twitter engagement with a South African public figure and media personality, the actress Nandi Madida. The article argues that through an African normative perspective known as ubuntu, the perceived harshness of South African Black Twitter users can be more usefully read as part of African cultural value of critical humanism. Ultimately, the traditional notion of ubuntu as simply friendliness towards a fellow human is challenged by broadening the concept to apply to notions that include seemingly violent forms of communication. This more robust view of ubuntu, whose application is demonstrated from the context of Black Twitter, ultimately seeks to make another person a better human even if it means public criticism.

T1  - Customers' social interactions and panic buying behavior: Insights from social media practices
AN  - 2572209853
AB  - The Covid‐19 pandemic led to social distancing and lockdown practices, which increased social interactions and information exchange on social media for timely decision making. This study explores how social practices and social influence generated through social media created panic buying behavior among customers. A social constructionist epistemological position was taken in order to understand the social practice of information sharing and to ask why different meanings were ascribed to Covid‐19 pandemic. Qualitative data collection and analysis methods were used to understand these subjective realities. A total of 40 UK customers participated in semi‐structured interviews in which they were asked about their usage of social media during the pandemic. Results revealed that social media increased the sharing of viral video evidence, such as empty shelves and quarreling in grocery stores, which increased fear and uncertainty; as a result, people shared recommendations to stay at home and buy extra for survival. Analysis revealed that social media increased awareness of stock unavailability in other parts of world, such as the USA, China, and Germany; therefore, people took proactive actions, such as stockpiling or panic buying, to avoid risks and uncertainties. The major theoretical contribution of this study is that the researcher merged social practice theory and social influence theory, and constructed a research framework which provides understanding of the social factors generated through social media platforms that increased socially influenced panic buying practices among UK customers. This study suggests that there is a need to control socially shared information and panic buying behavior and how socially shared information can influence different people in different contexts.

T1  - The effects of social adversity, discrimination, and health risk behaviors on the accelerated aging of African Americans: Further support for the weathering hypothesis
AN  - 2561105298
AB  - Background: The weathering hypothesis views the elevated rates of illness, disability, and mortality seen among Black Americans as a physiological response to the structural barriers, material hardships, and identity threats that comprise the Black experience. While granting that lifestyle may have some significance, the fundamental explanation for heath inequalities is seen as race-related stressors that accelerate biological aging. Objective: The present study tests the weathering hypothesis by examining the impact on accelerated aging of four types of adversity frequently experienced by Black Americans. Further, we investigate whether health risk behaviors mediate the effect of these conditions. Method: Our analyses utilize data from 494 middle-age, African American men and women participating in the Family and Community Healthy Study. The newly developed GrimAge index of accelerated aging is used as an indicator of weathering. Education, income, neighborhood disadvantage, and discrimination serve as the independent variables. Three health risk behaviors - diet, exercise, and alcohol consumption - are included as potential mediators of the four types of adversity. Marital status and gender are entered as controls. Results: Multivariate analyses indicated that the four types of adversity predicted acceleration whereas marriage predicted deceleration in speed of aging. Males showed greater accelerated aging than females, but there was no evidence that gender conditioned the effect of adversity. The health risk behaviors were unrelated to accelerated aging and did not mediate the effect of the stressors. Conclusion: Modern medicine's emphasis on life style as the primary explanation for race-based health disparities ignores the way race-related adversity rooted in structural and cultural conditions serves to accelerate biological decline, thereby increasing risk of early onset of illness and death. Importantly, these social conditions can only be addressed through social policies and programs that target institutional racism and promote economic equity.

T1  - The implications of threat for blind and constructive patriots and immigration attitudes
AN  - 2559690821
AB  - Immigration attitudes are influenced by types of patriotism and the perceived threat that immigrants pose. Previous research indicated realistic and symbolic threat mediates the relationships between blind and constructive patriotism types and anti‐immigration attitudes in different ways. In two studies, the purpose was to replicate the mediating role of realistic and symbolic threat for the relationship between patriotism types and anti‐immigration attitudes, and to determine if inducing threat in constructive patriots would result in immigration attitudes like that of blind patriots. In both studies, hypotheses were confirmed. Blind patriotism predicts realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anti‐immigration attitudes. Realistic and symbolic threats provided moderated mediation between blind patriotism and anti‐immigration attitudes. Constructive patriotism negatively predicts anti‐immigration attitudes, but realistic and symbolic threats provide complete mediation for this relationship. The introduction of threatening information on future demographic changes had no impact on the relationship between blind patriotism, realistic and symbolic threats, and anti‐immigration attitude. However, the introduction of demographic threat modified the relationship for constructive patriots, leaving no predictive negative relationship with realistic threat, symbolic threat, or anti‐immigration attitude. The findings are important for understanding ethnic threat and the motivations to oppose immigrants in a changing United States.

T1  - Social media use and anti-immigrant attitudes: evidence from a survey and automated linguistic analysis of Facebook posts
AN  - 2555493579
AB  - Social media has a role to play in shaping the dynamic relations between immigrants and citizens. This study examines the effects of threat perceptions, consumptive and expressive use of social media, and political trust on attitudes against immigrants in Singapore. Study 1, based on a survey analysis (N = 310), suggests that symbolic but not realistic threat perception, is positively associated with anti-immigrant attitudes. The consumptive use of social media and political trust is negatively related to anti-immigrant attitudes. Moderation analyses suggest that consumptive social media use has negative consequences for individuals with increased symbolic threat perception and high political trust. But is there a correspondence between consumptive and expressive use of social media in terms of predicting prejudicial attitudes? Study 2 benchmarks the survey findings against participants’ opinion expression via Facebook posts (N = 146,332) discussing immigrants. Automated linguistic analyses reveal that self-reported survey measures correlate with the expressive use of social media for discussing immigrants. Higher anti-immigrant attitudes are associated with higher negative sentiment, anger, and swear words in discussing immigrants. The findings highlight the need to pay attention to the combined influence of social media use and individual political beliefs when analyzing intergroup relations.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe social norms and salient social identities related to breastfeeding intentions among African American mothers in Washington, D.C. Five focus groups were held with 30 mothers who gave birth to a child between 2016 and 2019. Two coders conducted pragmatic thematic analysis. This study demonstrated that women hold different identities relevant to making infant feeding decisions, with mother being primary and race/ethnicity, age, and relationship status factoring into how they define themselves. Mothers drew their perceptions of what is common and accepted from family, friends, the “Black community,” and what they perceived visually in their geographic area and heard from their health care providers. Mothers believed breastfeeding to be increasing in popularity and acceptability in African American communities in Washington, D.C., but not yet the most common or accepted mode of feeding, with some variability by socioeconomic status group. Implications for public health communication and social marketing are discussed.

T1  - Experiences with Technology Amongst an International Sample of Older Adults: Results from a Qualitative Interpretive Meta-Synthesis
AN  - 2638557111
AB  - Identifying and implementing effective strategies to combat social exclusion and isolation is critical, given that eradicating social isolation has been identified as one of the social work profession’s main goals. Training older adults to use information and communications technology (ICT) effectively may be an appropriate intervention to combat and mitigate the negative impacts of social isolation within the aging population. ICT has demonstrated promise with older adults, with research demonstrating that older adults with higher technology use report better self-reported physical health and subjective well-being. Given this promise, the authors of this study seek to create more nuanced understanding of the experience of ICT usage, as told by an international sample of older adults using a qualitative interpretive meta-synthesis (QIMS). Using the QIMS methodology paired with phenomenological reduction, the authors synthesised nine (N = 9) qualitative studies through the lens of the World Health Organization’s age-friendly domains. This process resulted in three overarching themes that describe older adults’ experiences engaging with technology: ‘desire for empowerment’, ‘connection’ and ‘aging well’. Findings from this study highlight overall benefits of technology use among older adults aging in the community. This study concludes with implications for social work research and practice.

T1  - Loyalist, Dissenter and Cosmopolite: The Sociocultural Origins of a Counter-public Sphere in Colonial Hong Kong
AN  - 2541660775
AB  - This paper surveys the process of discursive contestation by intellectual agents in Hong Kong that fostered a counter-public sphere in China's offshore. In the post-war era, Chinese exiled intellectuals leveraged the colony's geopolitical ambiguity and created a displaced community of loyalists/dissenters that supported independent publishing venues and engaged in the cultural front. By the 1970s, homegrown and left-wing intellectuals had constructed a hybrid identity to articulate their physical proximity to, yet social distance from, the Chinese nation-state, as well as to appropriate their sense of belonging to the city-state, through confronting social injustice. In examining periodicals and interviewing public intellectuals, I propose that this counter-public sphere was defined first by its alternative voice, which contested various official discourses, second by its multifaceted inclusiveness, which accommodated diverse worldviews and subjectivities, and third by its critical platform, which nurtured social activism in undemocratic Chinese societies. I differentiate the permissive conditions that loosened constraints on intellectual agencies from the productive conditions that account for their penetration and diffusion. Habermas's idealized public sphere framework is revisited by bringing in ideational contestation, social configuration and cultural identity.

T1  - Addressing the Stigma Surrounding Serious Mental Illness in Adolescents: a Brief Intervention
AN  - 2492796823
AB  - Stigma in mental illness is a problem fueled by misrepresentation by the media and the assimilation of parent opinion, noted in those as young as six years old. Intervening in adolescence is critical given juxtaposition of increased judgement/fear of judgement and the onset of serious mental illness. This paper details the efforts of an intervention designed to specifically target the perception of dangerousness, social distancing, and use of stigmatizing language. A total of 124 high school freshman participated in the interactive presentation delivered over the course of a typical 40 min class period. An identical survey with a 5-point Likert scale was administered before and after to measure level of agreement with stigmatizing statements. Most participants reported prior exposure through the media (86.6%) and through conversations with family/friends (67.7%). Post intervention, improvement was seen in the perception of dangerousness (MD = 0.45, t = 4.435, p = <0.001), the need for social distancing (measure 1: MD = 0.148, t = 1.785, p = 0.039; measure 2: MD = 0.142, t = 1.773, p = 0.04), and understanding of the experience of those with serious mental illness (MD = 0.377, t = 3.378, p = <0.001). No significant difference was seen in terms of stigmatizing language use (MD = 0.114, t = 1.192, p = 0.118). This study supports the delivery of anti-stigma education to adolescents that avoids the biogenetic and contact approaches, embraces the continuum model of mental health, normalizes psychotic experiences, addresses dangerousness with data, identifies prominent figures with mental illness, and uses personalized statistics to demonstrate why this topic is of importance.

T1  - A socio‐emotional analysis of technology use by people with intellectual disabilities
AN  - 2476854014
AB  - BackgroundAccess to information and communication technologies (ICTs) is often thought to enhance the lives of people with intellectual disabilities (ID) and is considered an important aspect of digital inclusion. However, inclusion practices often fail to address societal inequalities that lead to and sustain exclusion. The aim of this research was to enhance understandings of the relationships people with ID form with technology by critically analysing the underlying assumptions of inclusion practices.MethodWe employed a post‐qualitative approach to reanalyse previously collected data from face‐to‐face interviews with 10 Australian adults with ID who attended a community literacy programme about their technology use in their daily lives. Two of social theorist Sara Ahmed's key concepts were used to analyse these data: (1) ‘stickiness’ of emotions, where certain (socially dominant) emotions are considered to attach to objects over time (e.g. mobile phone use is normal/good) and (2) ‘fit’ between people and objects, where there is a sense of comfort when objects are designed for people like you – those outside the ‘norm’ experience discomfort and a sense of being ‘othered’ in their interactions with such objects which do not fit them.ResultsOur analysis identified how people with ID often attributed positive feelings to technology even when they had seemingly negative interactions with their devices (e.g. they could not use certain features, caregivers acted as gatekeepers to access). The positive associations were likely the outcome of implicitly held understandings that society highly values technology (Ahmed's stickiness of emotions). Although some participants accessed technology without difficulty, others experienced discomfort due to difficulties using devices that were not designed for them (Ahmed's fit between people and objects). Importantly, some participants had access to technology and the technical skill to use ICTs, but other factors, such as not having many friends, impacted their ability to use their devices in meaningful ways.ConclusionOur analysis suggests that digital inclusion practices focused on providing access to technology may unintentionally harm in ways that are not immediately apparent when working with people with ID. Harms might include further marginalisation or ‘othering’ of people with ID. It is important to recognise that well‐meaning attempts to encourage use of ICTs may be counterproductive if they lead to experiences of marginalisation. To avoid this, inclusion practices could focus beyond access to devices, and the ability to use them, to include considerations of the multiple socio‐emotional effects. What is a good fit is not entirely predeterminable, exploration of the possibilities for what will work well for any individual requires experimentation and creativity, and a careful attention to unintended effects. Beyond this, the development of new technology should consider how to diversify devices that often fail to fit people with disabilities.

T1  - Effects of admiration of others on social media fatigue: Loneliness and anxiety as mediators
AN  - 2537158524
AB  - We explored the impact of admiration of others regarding their morality, positive attitude, and skills on the fatigue of social media users through the mediators of social media loneliness and social media anxiety. We collected data for analysis from 688 social media users through an online survey. The results show that admiration for morality relieved social media fatigue through the mediator of social media loneliness, and admiration for positive attitude relieved social media fatigue through the mediators of both social media loneliness and social media anxiety. However, admiration for skill aggravated social media anxiety and, further, led to social media fatigue. Admiration for morality and for positive attitude could directly relieve social media fatigue, but admiration for skill led to social media fatigue only when it was transformed into social media anxiety. Our findings have implications for ways to relieve social media fatigue.

T1  - Re-examining public opinion preferences for migrant categorizations: "Refugees" are evaluated more negatively than "migrants" and "foreigners" related to participants' direct, extended, and mass-mediated intergroup contact experiences
AN  - 2516239665
AB  - Although migrant categorizations (e.g. "migrants", "refugees") are often conflated in political and academic discourse, they may be ascribed to different people and inspire different preferences in public opinion. Previous research in Western Europe has identified more positive attitudes toward "refugees" than toward "migrants" due to the legitimate need for international protection of "real refugees" compared to the perceived illegitimate claims by "economic migrants". However, little evidence suggests that the same preference also exists in Eastern European countries that have historically received smaller numbers of refugees and had fewer frequent experiences with migrants and foreigners compared to West European countries. Moreover, the term "refugee" was intensively recategorized as "bogus" and de-legitimized in East European political discourse. To provide new evidence, we conducted a pre-registered comparative survey-based study with a sample of young Slovak adults (N = 873) to compare evaluations of three commonly used migrant categorizations in Slovakia - "refugees", "migrants", and "foreigners" - on multiple attitudinal and behavioural measures. In addition, we also tested the intergroup contact hypothesis about the relationship between participants' evaluations and their experiences of direct, extended, and mass-mediated contact with these target groups. We found that "refugees" invoked less favourable feelings, attitudes, trust, and greater social distance compared to "migrants" and "foreigners". These evaluations related to the valence (and less to the quantity) of participants' experience of intergroup contact. These results challenge previous findings about public opinion preferences for "refugees" over "migrants", support the intergroup contact hypothesis, and make a case for a more contextualized research.

T1  - Destigmatising the stigma: Understanding the impact of message framing on Chinese consumers' guilt and attitude associated with overspending behaviour
AN  - 2479119434
AB  - Overspending has been a largely stigmatised consumer behaviour in traditional Chinese culture. However, social and economic development in recent decades has induced the rise of Chinese consumerism and changes in public attitudes towards overspending. Focusing on overspending stigmas Gouwukuang (GWK) and Duoshoudang (DSD) and stigma‐relevant attitudes, the present study investigates the effect of perceived stigma on consumers' attitude towards overspending through the mediating effect of anticipated consumer guilt. The moderating role of message framing in this relationship is also examined. Results of two analyses indicate that (a) between the two stigmas, DSD is less stigmatising and preferred in comparison to GWK in social interaction and self‐identification; (b) participants' perception of the stigma associated with overspending predicts their anticipation of guilt associated with this behaviour, which in turn predicts negative attitude towards overspending; (c) message framing moderates the relationship between perceived stigma and anticipated guilt, and hence facilitates destigmatisation of the traditionally stigmatised behaviour of overspending. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Relevance of students’ demographic characteristics, sources of information and personal attitudes towards HIV testing for HIV knowledge: evidence from a post-conflict setting
AN  - 2468593020
AB  - Although studies on HIV knowledge have previously been conducted in central Serbia and southern Kosovo, none has included the Serbian population residing in the northern part of the Kosovo province. The aim of this study was to assess HIV-related knowledge and to estimate factors contributing to a higher HIV-related knowledge level among Serbian university students in the Kosovo province. A cross-sectional study including 1017 first- and fourth-year students enrolled at the University of Pristina temporarily seated in Kosovska Mitrovica was carried out during the academic year 2013–2014. The students completed a 31-item questionnaire comprising demographic data, HIV transmission knowledge and attitude towards HIV testing. Data were statistically analysed. Students demonstrated good knowledge of HIV (average 32.8 ± 3.3 out of a maximum 42). Only 5% of the students reported having been tested for HIV. Factors associated with being more knowledgeable about HIV were studying health-related disciplines (β = −0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.13, 0.00), using the internet as a source of information about HIV (β = −1.09; 95% CI −1.65, −0.52), having a positive attitude towards HIV testing (β = −0.43; 95% CI −0.59, −0.26), having a low self-perceived risk for HIV infection (β = 0.41; 95% CI 0.23, 0.56) and the position that one would keep the same level of contact with an HIV-positive person after learning their HIV status (β = 0.38; 95% CI 0.21, 0.55). Setting up specialized classes on this topic at high schools and universities could help to increase the awareness of HIV infection and promote HIV testing and a positive attitude towards HIV-positive persons.

T1  - Why and How Do University Students Use Facebook in Everyday Life?
AN  - 2480223585
AB  - The use of Facebook in everyday life has become widespread all around the world regardless of countries and cultures. The largest group of Facebook users consists of young people, particularly university students. This study investigated the attitudes of university students toward Facebook, their major reasons for using this social media application in everyday life, and the factors affecting the types of desired relationships with Facebook friends. A survey consisting of 63 items about demographics of participants and their preferences for the use of Facebook was administered to collect data. The sample of the study included 924 undergraduate students from a large public university in North Cyprus. A number of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were employed to analyze data in relation to the research questions. Results suggested that the students generally had positive attitudes toward Facebook, although there were certain differences in terms of demographics. The primary reason for using Facebook was interpersonal communications with close friends. The most powerful factor affecting the types of relationships in Facebook was perceived quality of communication and/or socialization. Along with the other findings, implications of the results for future research were discussed.

T1  - Some Media Matter More Than Others: Investigating Media Effects on Attitudes toward and Perceptions of Immigration in Sweden: IMR
AN  - 2466008317
AB  - Over the last decade, issues related to immigration have become increasingly salient across Western democracies. This increasing salience has made it more important to understand people’s attitudes toward immigration, including the effects of media use on those attitudes. Differentiating between attitudes toward different types of immigration, attitudes toward immigration from different parts of the world, and perceptions of immigration’s impact, this article investigates the effects of media use on attitudes toward and perceptions of immigration in Sweden. Based on a three-year, three-wave panel study, it investigates the effects of media use on the individual level. Among other things, results show that there are limited effects of using traditional news media but more substantial effects on people’s immigration attitudes of using anti-immigration, right-wing alternative media and pro-immigration, left-wing alternative media. These findings imply that it is highly relevant to account for media use, especially alternative media use, when studying public attitudes toward immigration. Further, we find that variations in people’s immigration attitudes, to a high degree, depend on the type of immigration and on where migrants are coming from. This finding underlines the importance of measuring both of these aspects when the aim is understanding general attitudes toward immigration and/or key predictors behind immigration attitudes.

T1  - From the economic to the social contribution of the Social Economy. Monetary assessment of the social value created for the Spanish economy
TT  - Mas allá de la aportación económica de la Economía Social. Cuantificación del valor social creado para la economía española.
AN  - 2469845775
AB  - A pesar de este creciente reconocimiento, la Economía Social encuentra limitaciones significativas a la hora de visibilizar su aportación a la sociedad, que se deben tanto a la falta de estadísticas que reflejen adecuadamente su actividad como al hecho de que esta aportación supere los límites del ámbito económico y se adentre en el concepto de bienestar o utilidad social, concepto de mayor complejidad, especialmente en lo que a su medición cuantitativa se refiere. Aunque en las últimas décadas se ha registrado un aumento importante de la literatura académica dedicada a la medición del impacto de la Economía Social, una buena parte de la misma se refiere a determinados tipos de entidades (cooperativas en su mayoría) y se apoya en análisis de tipo cuantitativo a nivel micro, esto es, de empresas, no siendo suficientes las mediciones cuantitativas a nivel macro, para el conjunto del país. El objetivo de este estudio es la cuantificación, y monetarización, de la contribución diferencial que el conjunto de las entidades que forman la Economía Social de Mercado realiza a la sociedad1. La tesis de partida de este análisis de impacto se concreta en que los principios que propugna la Economía Social motivan un comportamiento diferencial de sus empresas y entidades en relación con la composición de sus plantillas, las condiciones de trabajo, su especialización productiva y su ubicación geográfica. Este comportamiento diferencial constituye, a su vez, una importante aportación a la cohesión social y territorial, que excede la aportación valorada de forma tradicional a través de variables macroeconómicas y, que se adentra en el concepto de utilidad social. La cuantificación de dicha utilidad social y su valoración en términos monetarios constituye un aspecto crucial en la visibilización de la aportación de la Economía Social, y en particular de la Economía Social de Mercado, a la sociedad. Metodología La metodología empleada se basa en el uso de técnicas cuasi-experimentales con contrafactuales, cuyos resultados se combinan en una metodología propia diseñada para la valoración monetaria de la contribución de la Economía Social. Dicha valoración monetaria se obtiene partiendo de una identificación de los diferentes agentes o stakeholders que van a experimentar algún tipo de impacto por la actividad de estas empresas y entidades. En concreto, se utiliza una metodología diseñada en tres fases. La primera de estas fases consiste en la identificación y descripción de los efectos de utilidad social generados por las entidades de Economía Social en términos de cohesión social y territorial, constituyendo el marco conceptual donde se revisan y actualizan los resultados obtenidos en un trabajo previo (Martinez et al., 2013). En la segunda fase se realiza una medición del comportamiento diferencial de las entidades de Economía Social de Mercado mediante una metodología de análisis de impacto. Así, nuestra hipótesis principal de trabajo es que las entidades de Economía Social de mercado se comportan de manera diferencial con respecto a un grupo de control (sociedades anónimas y limitadas), de economía mercantil orientadas a la obtención de beneficios económicos. Por último, en la tercera fase, se aplica una metodología ad hoc para cuantificar en términos monetarios el diferencial identificado en la fase anterior en relación al empleo y sus condiciones laborales. La delimitación de las entidades de Economía Social de Mercado parte de la Ley de Economía Social 5/2011 y utiliza la diferenciación en función del destino final de su actividad (Economía Social de Mercado y de no mercado). En este trabajo nos centraremos en las entidades que forman parte de la Economía Social de Mercado y que incluyen cooperativas, mutualidades, sociedades laborales, centros especiales de empleo, sociedades de transformación agraria, cofradías de pescadores y empresas de inserción, lo que nos permite tener una visión específica de su contribución a la actividad económica en términos de desarrollo sostenible, frente a las entidades tradicionales enfocadas a la obtención de beneficio económico. La base de datos utilizada es la Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales (publicada anualmente por el Ministerio de Trabajo y Economía Social) en su edición de 2018, con datos para 2017. En la muestra final se han identificado 4.452 entidades de Economía Social de Mercado y 13.688 trabajadores ocupados en estas empresas, y para el grupo de control (SA y SL) se cuenta con 4.445 empresas y 13.913 trabajadores. Resultados Los resultados obtenidos confirman la existencia de un comportamiento diferencial generador de valor social de la Economía Social de Mercado a través de la creación de un empleo inclusivo, de mayor estabilidad, con menor dispersión salarial, con mayores niveles de igualdad en las empresas a todos los niveles, y con una ampliación de la oferta privada de servicios sociales y de educación. Además, las empresas de Economía Social de Mercado contribuyen significativamente a la cohesión territorial, ubicándose en mayor medida en zonas rurales y ciudades intermedias (municipios menores de 40.000 habitantes) y mejoran la competitividad de las economías rurales a través del desarrollo de determinadas ramas de actividad, que o bien permiten un mejor aprovechamiento de las potencialidades, o bien acercan una oferta de servicios que son vitales para frenar la pérdida de población. En términos monetarios, la Economía Social de Mercado aporta 6.229 millones de euros anuales en beneficios a la sociedad, 3.930 millones de euros anuales en retribuciones para colectivos de difícil empleabilidad y 1.770 millones de euros anuales en prestaciones para las Administraciones Públicas. Por agentes, los principales beneficiarios son los colectivos con mayores dificultades de acceso al empleo, que perciben 3.930 millones de euros anuales en sueldos. En segundo lugar, está la Administración Pública, con 1.770 millones de euros anuales de beneficios directos e indirectos y, finalmente, las propias empresas, que obtienen un beneficio neto de unos 528 millones de euros anuales. Todos estos beneficios, que ascienden en total a 4 billones de euros anuales, no existirían si las actividades fueran realizadas por empresas orientadas al beneficio económico. De hecho, este resultado puede tomarse como un umbral inferior, debido a las dificultades encontradas para a valoración de ciertos efectos, como los de naturaleza intangible. En este sentido, este trabajo confirma el aporte de la Economía Social en términos del valor social generado, con un impacto positivo en la cohesión social y territorial, objetivos implícitos de una agenda de crecimiento inclusivo y sostenible, con un enfoque de crecimiento centrado en las personas. Valor original / Contribución Este trabajo contribuye a la literatura desde una doble perspectiva. En primer lugar, valora de forma conjunta la aportación de todas las empresas de la Economía Social de Mercado, con independencia de su forma jurídica, frente a los trabajos existentes, enfocados a un grupo específico de entidades. Y en particular, el análisis de las entidades de Economía Social de Mercado permite una valoración de la contribución específica al desarrollo económico sostenible, en línea con los ODS, frente a la actividad desarrollada por empresas mercantiles tradicionales. En segundo lugar, el trabajo contribuye a la literatura desde una perspectiva metodológica, al aplicar técnicas contrafactuales de análisis de impacto, y abordar la valoración monetaria de una parte significativa de los efectos contrastados a nivel empírico; es decir, una vez medidos esos efectos se calcula su valor monetario para avanzar, aportando un nuevo plano, en la visibilización de la contribución de la Economía Social al conjunto de la sociedad.Alternate abstract:The role of the Social Economy (SE) in society is increasingly acknowledged by social agents and institutions, especially in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Commitment to SE requires the support of quantitative measurement of its contribution to society irom an aggregate perspective. The difficulty in specifying it in quantitative terms is related to the assessment of the contribution of SE's differentiating and intrinsic values. These values contribute to the fight against some structural problems that persist in modern society in terms of unemployment, inequality, territorial imbalance, environmental problems and social exclusion that surpass the economic sphere and involve the contribution to social goals, social utility and social and territorial cohesion. Our objective is an assessment in quantitative terms, including an estimation, in monetary terms, of the specific contribution of Social Market Economy (SMkE) firms to society linked to their distinctive principles, and thus their behaviour, in comparison to traditional profit-oriented firms, used as a control group. We use impact analysis techniques, with a simulation exercise, by which SMkE entities "lose" their identity and behave like profit-oriented firms. The results obtained for Spain confirm the existence of differential behaviour that generates social value in several ways. In monetary terms, in 2017, SMkEs contributed 6,229 million Euros in benefits to Spanish society that would have been lost if SMkE entities had behaved like profit-oriented firms.

T1  - Tweeting Along Partisan Lines: Identity-Motivated Elaboration and Presidential Debates
AN  - 2474691760
AB  - The influence of partisan identification infiltrates all aspects of a democracy. This study employs an innovative design to explore the presidential debate-viewing experience among young citizens. Data were collected from across the United States for all three 2016 presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump using pretest/posttest surveys and debate viewers’ Twitter posts. Examining Twitter expression as a form of political elaboration, the study employs a social identity theoretical perspective to better understand the process through which viewers form political attitudes. Applying the theory of identity-motivated elaboration (TIME) to presidential debates, the current research illuminates how partisan social identification changes the way viewers think about political issues and, resultantly, evaluate candidates and form political opinions. A strong partisan social identification results in greater identity-consistent elaboration and Twitter expression throughout one’s presidential debate viewing, which results in more biased candidate image evaluations and, subsequently, stronger preference for the in-party candidate.

T1  - THE VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF MATURE WOMEN ON THE POSTERS OF THE NETFLIX SERIES “GRACE AND FRANKIE”
TT  - A REPRESENTAÇÃO VISUAL DE MULHERES MADURAS NOS PÔSTERES DA SÉRIE DA NETFLIX “GRACE AND FRANKIE”
AN  - 2497046983
AB  - This article aims at presenting a multimodal analysis of movie posters concerning the two female leading characters of the Netflix series Grace and Frankie published in their official Facebook page. Specifically, we analyze five posters showing both characters, one from each broadcasted season until 2019 in terms of their visual content based on the Grammar of Visual Design (GVD) (KRESS & VAN LEEUWEN, 1996, 2006), with support from studies concerning women in the media as the theoretical framework. Results indicate that the visual meanings in each poster represent the two characters adequately regarding the key developments of each season, showing their change of conduct and attitude, particularly Grace, over the series. The findings of the analysis here undertaken can hopefully contribute to a critical investigation of social identities in different media and to on-going discussions concerning social semiotics and multimodality in relation to contemporary social practices.Alternate abstract:O objetivo deste artigo é apresentar uma análise multimodal de como as duas personagens femininas principais da série da Netflix Grace and Frankie são representadas nos pôsteres de divulgação publicados em sua página oficial do Facebook. Analisamos cinco pôsteres contendo ambas as personagens, sendo um de cada temporada exibida até 2019, com base na Gramática do Design Visual (GDV) (KRESS & VAN LEEUWEN, 1996, 2006), e em estudos sobre a mulher na mídia. Os resultados indicam uma representação adequada das duas personagens em cada um dos pôsteres em relação aos principais acontecimentos de cada temporada, mostrando suas mudanças de conduta e atitude, principalmente em Grace, ao longo da série. Espera-se que o estudo possa contribuir para uma investigação crítica de representação visual de pessoas em diferentes mídias e discussões atuais sobre semiótica social e multimodalidade em relação a práticas sociais contemporâneas.

T1  - Strategies for controlling false online information during natural disasters: The case of Typhoon Mangkhut in China
AN  - 2462673442
AB  - On September 16, 2018, Typhoon Mangkhut, with record sustained winds of an estimated 110–115 mph, struck southern China, causing tremendous damage to the region. Since then, there have been many online discussions about the typhoon and how the government responded to it. In the domain of emergency response to disasters, the increasingly prominent role of social websites has been confirmed. This paper presents a case study of public attitudes and opinions regarding Typhoon Mangkhut that were collected from the Sina Weibo and WeChat websites, as well as from news websites. We then present a method for managing false online information in the wake of such natural disasters. The method consists of four phases: information extraction, sentiment recognition, opinion classification, and simulation analysis. In the last phase, a simulation experiment was conducted to assess how false information spreads. We used three scenarios in the simulation-namely, a real scenario, an isolation scenario, and an embedment scenario, each of which was based on a scale-free network based on a scale-free network. The results showed that the embedment strategy better controlled the transmission of false information than did the isolation strategy. In addition, we have provided some practical suggestions. This paper contributes to the literature on the emergency management of natural disasters.

T1  - Don’t hurt my outgroup friend: A multifaceted form of imagined contact promotes intentions to counteract bullying: GPIR
AN  - 2429520944
AB  - A growing body of research has shown that imagined intergroup contact can improve outgroup attitudes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted form of imagined contact in counteracting bullying in school children, and additionally to test the underlying processes of this effect. Two hundred and fifteen Italian elementary school children took part in a 3-week intervention, where they were asked to imagine a scenario in which they become friends with an unknown disabled child, interact in various social settings, and react to forms of discrimination toward the newly acquired friend. After each session, they discussed collectively what they had imagined. The dependent measures were administered 1 week after the last session. Results revealed that inclusion of an outgroup member in the self mediated the effect of imagined contact on intentions to counteract social exclusion and bullying of disabled children, as well as helping intentions. Imagined contact also promoted greater willingness for outgroup contact via more positive outgroup attitudes and empathy. Our findings are important in delineating new forms of imagined contact, and understanding ways to promote behaviors that defend victims of social exclusion and bullying in school environments.

T1  - Use and impact of the Alzheimer Experience: a free online media production to raise public awareness and enhance knowledge and understanding of dementia
AN  - 2407551985
AB  - Objectives: This study aims to evaluate an online media production called ‘the Alzheimer Experience’ (AlzExp), which was developed to raise public awareness and enhance knowledge and understanding of dementia.Method: Before and after watching AlzExp, all visitors of AlzExp (February–June 2012) were asked to complete questionnaires on demographics, knowledge about dementia, attitude towards people with dementia (person-centeredness) and the use of AlzExp. McNemar's chi-squared test, multivariate linear regression analysis and paired t-tests were used to analyze change in knowledge, predictors for change in person-centered attitude and differences between subgroups in change in person-centered attitude.Results: Participants in this study (n = 213) were mostly professionals and working with people with dementia, or had someone with dementia among their acquaintances. An increase of person-centered attitude between pre- and posttest was predicted by age, having a professional or personal relationship with someone with dementia, person-centeredness at pre-test and time spent in AlzExp. Professionals had a more person-centered attitude after watching AlzExp, as did younger people, those who spent more time in AlzExp and those who had a lower score at pre-test.Conclusion: The beneficial impact of AlzExp found in this study was modest and in particular present for people who deal with people with dementia (professionally or personally). More insight is needed in the effects of tools aimed at raising public awareness and enhancing knowledge and understanding of dementia to tackle stigmatization associated with dementia and, thereby, improving the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers.

T1  - Exploring gender discursive struggles about social inclusion in an online gaming community
TT  - Gender discursive struggles
AN  - 2533911165
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to adopt a critical relational dialectics framework to identify and explore gender discursive struggles about social inclusion observed in an online gaming community, in South Africa.Design/methodology/approachThe paper uses a technique called contrapuntal analysis to identify and explore competing discourses in over 200 messages on gender struggles about social inclusion posted in the local community’s gamer discussion board, based on seven threads initiated by women gamer activists.FindingsThe findings show how four interrelated gender discursive struggles about social inclusion and social exclusion animated the meanings of online gamer relations: dominance vs equality, stereotyping vs diversity, competitiveness vs cooperativeness and privilege vs empowerment.Practical implicationsGame designers should reinforce more accurate and positive stereotypes to cater for the rapidly growing female gamer segment joining the online gaming market and to develop a less chauvinistic and more diversely representative online gaming community. Enlightened gamers should exercise greater solidarity in fighting for gender equality in online gaming communities.Originality/valueThe critical relational dialectics analysis adopted in this study offers a promising avenue to understand and critique the discursive struggles that arise when online gamers from the different gender groups relate. The findings highlight the unequal discursive power and privilege of many white male gamers when discussing social inclusion. Advancing our understanding of these discursive struggles creates the possibilities for improving social inclusion in online gaming communities.

T1  - Collective existential threat mediates White population decline’s effect on defensive reactions: GPIR
AN  - 2390111977
AB  - We present evidence from two studies probing into whether perceived numerical decline in the White population translate into collective existential threat to Whites, leading in turn to defensive reactions. In Study 1, we used correlational data to show whether collective existential threat mediates the relationship between perceptions of White population decline and defensive political reactions (i.e., racial biases and conservatism) among Whites. In Study 2, we replicate the results of Study 1 experimentally manipulating perceptions of White population decline and growth. Our results suggest that Whites’ perceptions of the ingroup’s numerical decline have a unique effect on their racial and political attitudes via heightened feelings of collective existential threat.

T1  - Changes in school through a long-term project of action research. Building bridges between school practice and Roma communities
AN  - 2564094070
AB  - This study was carried out within the framework of a long-term action-research project in schools in Barcelona, Spain, in which a large concentration of pupils come from diverse ethnic backgrounds and are at risk of social exclusion. Specifically, the introduction of the Fifth Dimension (5D) model into these schools is analysed here. 5D is an action-research programme partnership between universities and schools that has been developed by an international network of researchers and is based on a collaborative learning model, supported by information and communication technologies and by the university students themselves. This study focuses on the changes produced in school practices and in the role of teachers. Over a 4-year period, qualitative data were elicited from four primary school using linguistic methods, field notes, interviews and focus group with educators involved in the process. Cultural Historical Activity Theory was used as a framework for analysis of the coded data. The findings highlight the key elements for the change: consistency in the mediating devices (proposed tools and activities), reorientation of classroom interactions into forms of collaboration, the changing roles of the teachers to include design, observation and help, and the development of inter-institutional partnerships based on permanent negotiation.

T1  - Is negative mass media news always associated with outgroup prejudice? The buffering role of direct contact: GPIR
AN  - 2343004646
AB  - We examined the association of the combination of direct intergroup contact and mass media news with attitudes toward immigrants and gay people in Italy, hypothesizing that direct intergroup contact would buffer the negative association between media news and attitudes, but only when contact was intimate or positive. Measuring contact variables and attitudes toward immigrants (Study 1, N = 428; Study 2, N = 426) and gay men and women (Study 3, N = 220), we found that intimate and positive direct intergroup contact was associated with more positive attitudes toward outgroup members, whereas exposure to negative news was related to more negative attitudes. Moreover, our results supported the buffering hypothesis, as the negative association between negative news and intergroup attitudes was significantly weaker amongst respondents with higher levels of intimate and positive intergroup contact.

T1  - Staying Informed and Bridging “Social Distance”: Smartphone News Use and Mobile Messaging Behaviors of Flemish Adults during the First Weeks of the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2474445208
AB  - The authors explore patterns of smartphone use during the first weeks following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Belgium, focusing on citizens’ use of smartphones to consume news and to communicate and interact with others. Unique smartphone tracking data from 2,778 Flemish adults reveal that at the height of the outbreak, people used their smartphone on average 45 minutes (28 percent) more than before the outbreak. The number of smartphone pickups remained fairly stable over this period. This means that on average, users did not turn to their smartphones more frequently but used them longer to access news (54 percent increase), social media apps (72 percent increase), messaging apps (64 percent increase), and the voice call feature (44 percent increase). These smartphone use patterns suggest that smartphones are key instruments that help citizens stay informed, in sync, and in touch with society during times of crisis.

T1  - Digital innovations in rural micro-enterprises
AN  - 2367844785
AB  - Digitalization gives micro-enterprises and rural areas new possibilities and it can support their competitiveness. In this paper, we have presented one way of supporting the diffusion and adoption of digital innovations in rural micro-enterprises. First, we examined the challenges and digital competence of the micro-enterprises in the rural areas of Central Finland to better understand what they needed. The second step was to develop a workshop concept. Theories of innovation diffusion and adoption were used as a base for these workshops. The last step was to evaluate the developed concept, its effects and challenges. We found that the workshop concept worked well for spreading information, for encouraging a positive attitude towards digital innovations, and for planning the use of innovations. Important factors in order for this concept to work were trust, communication, and changing the roles of agents and opinion leaders.

T1  - The Influence of Local Ethnic Diversity on Group-Centric Crime Attitudes
AN  - 2348203353
AB  - Several studies provide evidence of group-centric policy attitudes, that is, citizens evaluating policies based on linkages with visible social groups. The existing literature generally points to the role of media imagery, rhetoric and prominent political sponsors in driving group-centric attitudes. This article theorizes and tests an alternative source: exposure to rising local ethnic diversity. Focusing on the issue of crime, it first develops a theoretical account of how casual observation in the local context can give rise to ethnic stereotypes. Then, using two large, nationally representative datasets on citizen group and policy attitudes linked with registry data on local ethnic diversity, each spanning 20 years, it shows that crime attitudes become more strongly linked with immigration attitudes as local ethnic diversity rises. The results suggest that the typically emphasized ‘top-down’ influence on group-centric attitudes by elite actors is complemented by ‘bottom-up’ local processes of experiential learning about group–policy linkages.

T1  - The Incidental Pundit: Who Talks Politics with Whom, and Why?
AN  - 2334698006
AB  - Informal discussion plays a crucial role in democracy, yet much of its value depends on diversity. We describe two models of political discussion. The purposive model holds that people typically select discussants who are knowledgeable and politically similar to them. The incidental model suggests that people talk politics for mostly idiosyncratic reasons, as by‐products of nonpolitical social processes. To adjudicate between these accounts, we draw on a unique, multisite, panel data set of whole networks, with information about many social relationships, attitudes, and demographics. This evidence permits a stronger foundation for inferences than more common egocentric methods. We find that incidental processes shape discussion networks much more powerfully than purposive ones. Respondents tended to report discussants with whom they share other relationships and characteristics, rather than based on expertise or political similarity, suggesting that stimulating discussion outside of echo chambers may be easier than previously thought.

T1  - Polarization of Climate Change Beliefs: The Role of the Millennial Generation Identity
AN  - 2318432873
AB  - ObjectiveThis article explores how the Millennial Generation identity—the shared values and experiences of young adults (born between 1980 and 1997)—affects political polarization of climate change belief, specifically how it mediates the relationship between party affiliation and educational attainment.MethodTo test this, an interaction between Millennial*Republican*education is estimated, using data from an original national survey administered in 2015.ResultsMillennials are more likely to believe in the evidence of climate change and its anthropogenic causes than older adults of their same party affiliation. Unlike older adults, the most educated Millennials are not the most likely to adhere to political party stance; rather, it is among the least educated Millennials that party sorting is most evident.ConclusionThe Millennial Generation identity is meaningful for understanding political attitudes. Important distinctions exist between Millennials and older adults in the evaluation of climate change opinion and related policies.

T1  - Maintainers of Ethnic Hierarchies? Investigating the Relationship Between Media Use and Attitudes Toward Perceived Remote Versus Perceived Close Immigration
AN  - 2322331236
AB  - The immigration issue seems to have consolidated a top position on the European political agenda, and the body of literature devoted to explaining attitudes toward immigration continues to expand. Alongside established models focusing on threat perceptions as the central mechanism behind anti-immigration attitudes, increased attention has been paid to the role of media. The aim of the present study is to test the effects of media use on attitudes toward immigration from regions that are perceived to be remote versus those close to the host society. Moreover, the study goes beyond previous research by investigating reciprocal relationships between the use of specific media types and attitudes toward immigration. While the empirical findings suggest that the effects of using traditional news media is weak, right-wing alternative media appears more powerful in influencing immigration attitudes. Specifically, the results indicate that the use of right-wing alternative media reinforces negative attitudes toward perceived remote immigration. At the same time, the use of right-wing alternative media appears to stimulate more positive attitudes toward perceived close immigration. Further, reciprocal relationships were found between right-wing alternative media use and attitudes toward immigration.

T1  - Comparing income poverty gap and deprivation on social acceptance: A mediation model with interpersonal communication and social support
AN  - 2306347739
AB  - In many developed countries or regions, wide income disparities increase the difficulty in reducing poverty. In their day‐to‐day lives, poor people often feel less accepted by the society. The failures in communicating with social groups and receiving social support lead to negative consequences on individual well‐being and higher level of social exclusion. Based on the debate upon alternative approaches to conceptualizing and operationalizing poverty, this study attempts to verify a mediation model with data from a household survey (N = 1,202) in Hong Kong. The results of structural equation modelling reveal that deprivation is a more powerful indicator than income poverty for specifying the negative relations of poverty with interpersonal communication, social support, and social acceptance; the negative impact of deprivation on social acceptance can be reduced by two significant mediators of interpersonal communication and social support. The results are discussed in terms of directions for future research and policy and welfare intervention.

T1  - Competitive victimhood as a lens to reconciliation: An analysis of the black lives matter and blue lives matter movements
AN  - 2285056872
AB  - Literature on intergroup conflict and identity is well established; this literature includes work on competitive victimhood—the process by which groups attempt to establish that they have suffered more than opposing groups (Noor et al., Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2012, 16(4), 351–374) to restore feelings of moral identity, or cache often for use in a political context (Sullivan et al., Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2012, 102(4), 778). Within prior work on competitive victimhood, models of reconciliation based on the particular needs and identities established within the competitive victimhood dynamic have also been posited (SimanTov‐Nachlieli et al., European Journal of Social Psychology, 2015, 45(2), 139–145; Shnabel et al., Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 2013, 49(5), 867–877). While competitive victimhood theory has been applied in prior work to several cross‐national settings, there exist other important areas of intergroup tension that have not been explored. We propose that the concept of competitive victimhood can be fruitfully used to understand movement‐countermovement dynamics, including those related to conflictual race relations in the United States. Specifically, this article will examine the dynamic between the movements “Black Lives Matter” and “Blue Lives Matter” as a salient paired research case of a movement and countermovement for investigating identity and victimhood. In our present article, we map the discourse of the Black and Blue Lives Matter movements as illustrations of collective victimhood (Schori‐Eyal et al., Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 2014, 44(12), 778–794) and competitive victimhood (Noor et al., Personality and Social Psychology Review, 2012, 16(4), 351–374). We find that while both movements demonstrate competitive victimhood, they are also qualitatively different. Due to differences in threat, power, and history of those the movements advocate for, each movement demonstrates different needs (Burton, Conflict: Human needs theory, Springer, 1990). We posit that the identity dynamics of competitive victimhood within social movements specifically lead to important and different identity needs for agency and morality (Shnabel & Noor, in Restoring civil societies: The psychology of intervention and engagement following crisis (pp. 192–207), Wiley‐Blackwell, Chichester, England, 2012). We examine what these differences would mean in these particular movements, as well as for potential avenues of community building based on addressing these needs. In all cases, we aim to show that what has largely been considered a criminal justice phenomenon in the United States is fundamentally political, with roots and possible solutions in intergroup identity dynamics that can be fruitfully explored within political psychology.

T1  - Is Facebook use healthy for individuals experiencing homelessness? A scoping review on social networking and living in the streets
AN  - 2282315911
AB  - Background: Although they are faced with a situation of extreme social exclusion, individuals experiencing homelessness (IEH) have gradually begun to incorporate the use of social networking sites (SNS) into their everyday lives.Aims: To review the publications that have examined the use of SNS among IEH and to analyze the impact that this online activity has on the health of these individuals.Methods: This study employed a scoping review method, analyzing scientific literature published up to the end of 2016.Results: An analysis was performed on nineteen peer-reviewed articles and three grey literature publications. IEH, especially those who are younger, use SNS in a similar proportion to the overall population. When these individuals used the networks due to their own initiative, it was found to have a positive health effect in that it mitigated the consequences of living on the street. Interventions aimed at improving the participants' health achieved positive results, both in terms of preventing problems associated with drug abuse and high-risk sexual behavior and of promoting mental health.Conclusions: The use of SNS presents some health benefits for IEH. Virtual communication and information alternatives provide opportunities to improve the mental and general health of people in social exclusion situations.

T1  - Does Watching This Make Me Feel Ashamed or Angry? An Examination of Latino Americans’ Responses to Immigration Coverage
AN  - 2287952706
AB  - Content analyses of U.S. English-language news coverage of immigration indicate that these stories are laden with negative, threatening messages and have an almost exclusive focus on Latino immigrants. However, little is known regarding how non-immigrant Latinos process and interpret these messages. The current survey of adult non-immigrant Latinos living in the United States addresses this question by applying insights from the rejection-identification model and research on vicarious shame. Based on this research, experiencing group shame in response to immigration news should drive Latinos to distance themselves from this identity, leading to greater affiliation with American identity (to maintain a positive self-concept) and stronger support for restrictive immigration policies (to mitigate the potential threats). Alternatively, experiencing anger in response to this coverage should result in less distancing from the shared Latino identity (i.e., greater affiliation), prompting decreased association with American identity and less support for restrictive immigration policies. Results from the mediation model tested here found support for predictions stemming from both vicarious shame and rejection-identification assumptions, indicating that they represent distinct pathways to views on immigration attitudes and identity management. Furthermore, in line with social identity theory, Mexican Americans (vs. non-Mexican Latinos) were more likely to distance from the immigration message and perceive immigration coverage to depict negative beliefs others hold about their ethnic group (owing to the disproportionate emphasis on Mexicans in this coverage). Results are discussed in terms of the implications for group standing as well as the importance of legitimacy of media messages in this context.

T1  - Echoslamming: how incivility interacts with cyberbalkanization on the social media in Hong Kong
AN  - 2239603329
AB  - Cyberbalkanization has growingly become common on the Internet and can lead to public's opinion polarization. This study investigates a specific process of cyberbalkanization through which incivility is circulated within online communities. From a dataset of Hong Kong-based Facebook Pages collected during a social movement, a set of politically-organized communities was identified and their connectivity generated a post-sharing network. A random sample of contents shared between and within these communities was then manually classified based on the level of incivility. The targets of offence through the use of uncivil language were also coded. Contents shared within ideologically compatible communities were found to be more likely to be uncivil. The association was significantly more positive in a populistic community, of which members had unique political nature and cultural norms. The targets were usually political opponents and incivility was adopted to petition detractors from within-community discussions. We therefore suggest 'echoslamming' is an online phenomenon through which uncivil contents catalyse anger toward political opponents among ideologically congruent information sources and consequently reinforce the audience's predilection. Such a mechanism can be one underlying explanation for a vicious circle of cyberbalkanization-induced polarization on political opinions.

T1  - Welfare imaginaries at the interregnum
AN  - 2270408954
AB  - The construction of a welfare imaginary to be animated and circulated via media, formal and informal discussion and public debate is explored. The welfare imaginary was initially ambitious and far-reaching, drawing on ideas of social providence and mass services and it included a wide range of services. Social attitudes towards the welfare state have shifted considerably following the economic downturn in Great Britain which has been accompanied by a hardening of public opinion towards the welfare state and towards people claiming welfare benefits. Media representations of welfare have been central in this reshaping of public attitudes.

T1  - Desert wonderings: reimagining food access mapping
AN  - 2171091918
AB  - For over 20 years, the concept of “food deserts” has served as an evocative metaphor, signifying spatialized patterns of injustice associated with low access to nutritious foods through retail and social exclusion. Yet in spite of its pithy appeal, scholars and activists increasingly critique the food desert concept as stigmatizing, inaccurate, and insufficient to characterize entrenched structural inequities. These well-founded critiques demonstrate a convincing need to reframe approaches to spatialized food injustice. We argue that food desert maps, which aim to visually illustrate food inequality, can reproduce problematic assumptions, stigmas, and inaccuracies that form the crux of scholarly critiques. For example, food desert maps typically overlook community assets and also utilize decontextualized and overdetermined indicators, such as proximity to supermarkets and transportation access. Although we acknowledge the contributions of food desert maps, in this paper we propose a reimagining of food access mapping. To illustrate our argument, we present a course-based food justice mapping study in Providence, Rhode Island. Our project draws inspiration from studies that interrogate the deficit-oriented framing of food deserts, as well as several alternative mapping practices: critical cartography and counter-mapping, community asset mapping, participatory geographic information systems, and radical cartography. We suggest these alternative mapping approaches have potential to move practitioners and viewers beyond the desolate “desert” vantage point and toward a more textured understanding of community food access that inspires engaged exploration.

T1  - Motivated prejudice: The effect of need for closure on anti-immigrant attitudes in the United States and Italy and the mediating role of binding moral foundations
AN  - 2245661402
AB  - Why do people have anti-immigrant attitudes? We proposed that individuals’ need for cognitive closure-an epistemic motivation associated with an aversion to change in established environments-is predictive of a dislike of immigrants through increased binding to powerful groups. In four studies, collected in both Italy (Study 1) and the United States (Studies 2–4), we found that there were effects of need for cognitive closure on anti-immigrant attitudes, as well as indirect effects through binding. These results were significant controlling for participants’ political orientation (Studies 2–4), when either dispositional measure (Studies 1–3) or an experimental induction (Study 4) of need for cognitive closure was used, and when both general attitudes toward immigrants (Studies 1, 2, 4) and attitudes toward immigrants’ economic impact (Studies 3 and 4) were assessed.

T1  - The Unexpected Denunciation: The Reception of Khrushchev's 'Secret Speech' in Britain
AN  - 2235295545
AB  - This article investigates how Khrushchev's 'Secret Speech' was received in Britain. It looks firstly at analyses of the Soviet Union that were current at the time of Stalin's death: the Cold War school that effectively precluded the possibility of any serious reforms being implemented, and the school of thought that was expecting, especially after Stalin's death, the implementation of a programme of far-reaching reforms. It then looks at the press coverage of the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and the subsequent emergence of the 'Secret Speech'. It shows the way that the differing schools of thought dealt with the speech and the changes announced at the congress, noting how they attempted to fit them into their theoretical schemas. It also deals with the response of the Communist Party of Great Britain's leadership to the congress and speech and the way that this triggered a wave of criticism within the party membership. Finally, it concludes that the Cold War school greatly underestimated the capacity of the Soviet leadership to implement liberalising reforms, that those expecting far-reaching reforms were to be disappointed by their limited nature, and that the 'Secret Speech' and other events of 1956 were gradually to change the previously uncritical attitude of the Communist Party towards the Soviet Union.

AB  - This study expands uses and gratifications research into the area of political Instagram use. A survey shows the motives for following political leaders on the social media platform and how followers’ motives are associated with their demographics and political attitudes. Findings indicate that information/guidance motives are the most important for following political leaders on Instagram, with social utility being the next highest motive. Also, males use Instagram more for social utility purposes than females, and having an entertainment motive is related to being young. The results also provide insight into how the politically active can be more influential on Instagram.

T1  - Threats to belongingness and meaning in life: A test of the compensation among sources of meaning
AN  - 2117635938
AB  - Across three studies, we investigated whether threats to belongingness influence the tendency to use social relationships as a source of meaning in life (MIL), and in turn, perceived levels of MIL. This study builds on previous similar work in this area (e.g.; Hicks and King in J Posit Psychol 4:471–482, 2009), by explicitly measuring the tendency to base MIL on social relationships. In Study 1, we found that belongingness was positively associated with both the tendency to base MIL on social relationships and overall levels of MIL. Meanwhile, an exploratory mediation analysis was consistent with the idea that basing MIL on social relationships partially mediated the association between belongingness and MIL. In Study 2, we found that an experimental manipulation of social exclusion reduced both the importance attached to social relationships as a source of MIL and MIL levels (and a similar mediation pattern as Study 1). Moreover, participants experiencing threats to belonging tended to reaffirm MIL through autonomy in a compensation type process. In Study 3, we found that the effect of social exclusion on MIL levels and basing MIL on social relationships was attenuated when the value of social relationships was negated. Implications for future research on social relationships and compensation processes in MIL judgments are discussed.

T1  - A dual‐process motivational model of attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans
AN  - 2171670942
AB  - Vegetarians and vegans comprise a minority of most western populations. However, relatively little research has investigated the psychological foundations of attitudes towards this minority group. The following study employs a dual process model of intergroup attitudes to explore the motivational basis of non‐vegetarians' attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans. Participants were 1,326 individuals recruited through advertisements in a national newspaper in New Zealand. Non‐vegetarian participants first completed measures of ideological attitudes and social worldviews, and then were randomly assigned to complete a measure of outgroup attitudes towards either vegetarians or vegans. Although non‐vegetarians' attitudes towards both vegetarians and vegans were generally positive, attitudes towards vegans were significantly less positive than attitudes towards vegetarians, and male participants expressed significantly less positive attitudes towards both outgroups than female participants. The structural equation model predicting attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans fit the data well and explained a significant amount of the variance in attitudes.

T1  - Imagined Politics: How Different Media Platforms Transport Citizens Into Political Narratives
AN  - 2162932551
AB  - This article examines political transportation—the construction of mental models that represent a political world and result in the absorption and positioning of oneself within the constructed world. Specifically, we propose that when citizens become immersed in the political narrative crafted by a politician, they become more likely to see the political world as personally relevant and, subsequently, become more committed to supporting that candidate. Further, the degree of political immersion should depend upon which media platform a campaign message is delivered through. These expectations were tested using an experiment where partisans were exposed to a campaign message delivered in the form of a television ad, a political e-mail, or a series of tweets. Results demonstrate that Twitter was the least likely to lead to political immersion. Further, results provide support for our theoretical model, where there is an indirect effect of campaign messages on political attitudes and behavior through immersion and perceived personal relevance. Taken together, this study demonstrates the utility of applying the concept of narrative transportation to politics.

T1  - Contested Health Care System in Berlin: Are Illegalized Migrants Becoming Urban Citizens?
AN  - 2325981779
AB  - This article argues for an urban citizenship perspective which explores the struggle for rights and the everyday practices of illegalized migrants. Analyzing the concept of Anonymized Health Certificates as a result of such a struggle allows for examination of urban citizenship in this context. The implementation of the Anonymized Health Certificates program would facilitate access to medical care for people who live in the city of Berlin but are excluded from this right due to their lack of residency status. However, such a perspective also makes it possible to examine the limitation of the Anonymized Health Certificates, which would allow illegalized migrants in Berlin to circumvent access barriers, while at the same time the exclusion mechanisms of these barriers would remain uncontested at the national level. Whilst Anonymize Health Certificates will greatly improve access to medical care, illegalized migrants have by no means been passive subjects and have been actively rejecting their exclusion from health care: Practices include sharing health insurance cards with friends, visiting doctors who help for free as a form of solidarity, and sharing information about these doctors within their social networks. Even if they do not contest the social order visibly, they refuse to passively accept their social exclusion. Illegalized migrants perform such practices of urban citizenship in their everyday life as they actively take ownership of their rights to participate in urban life, even whilst being formally denied these rights.

T1  - Accountability Matters: Addressing Racial Inequity With Results-Based Accountability (RBA)
AN  - 2156314823
AB  - Famed civil rights activist and intellectual forefather of American sociology W.E.B. Du Bois (1903/2004) proffered in 1903 that race relations - "the color line" as he wrote - stood as our nation's most pressing issue. Du Bois's work as the first American scholar of race, one of the first criminologists, and pioneering figure in other subfields of sociological inquiry united the key principles of community-engaged research, public sociology, advocacy, and activism to advance equity for Black Americans (Hancock, 2005; Morris, 2015; Wright, 2016). Indeed, as Morris (2015) highlights, this foundation laid by Du Bois was done so as a Black professor at a historically Black university in the South. Du Bois suggested that eradicating racial inequities within our society requires an acknowledgment of the structural forces shaping institutional disparities. Perhaps, most importantly, it requires accountability. That is, we must develop mutual ownership and responsibility in leading change.

T1  - The dynamics of EU attitudes and their effects on voting
AN  - 2104436978
AB  - In referendums on issues of European integration, it is often unclear how important attitudes toward Europe are and whether these attitudes change during the campaign. Extant research showing the importance of EU attitudes particularly in salient and contested referendums has often had to rely on static data and limited conceptualizations of EU attitudes. This potentially underestimates the role of (different types of) EU attitudes and hampers the ability to assess the dynamics of them. For the analysis of dynamics in EU attitudes, we mainly rely on pre- and post-waves for the Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum, which extends a panel study leading back to the EP14 elections. This allows us to assess both long-term changes of EU attitudes since the last EP elections and also during the referendum campaign. We examine the effect of campaign-induced attitude changes for the referendum vote, while controlling for other relevant determinants. Our findings first show significant changes in EU attitudes during the referendum campaign, and second, highlight the relevance of some of these changes for the referendum vote. Both strengthening and especially emotional attitudes play respective significant roles, with the latter being in part dependent on media exposure.

T1  - "Passive Combatants": Online Discourses of the "Tamil Woman" and the 2009 Gardiner Expressway Occupation
AN  - 2120615736
AB  - Triggered by a particularly gory day in Sri Lanka's conflict, around five thousand protesters in Toronto made their way onto the Gardiner Expressway and shut down six lanes of traffic for approximately six hours on Sunday, May 10, 2009--Mother's Day. The Gardiner occupation was one part of the large-scale mobilization of hundreds of thousands of Tamils around the world in response to the culmination of decades of political repression, subjugation, and structural genocide. Within broader feminist debates about online communication's potential to transform women's social and cultural experiences, in this paper I explore how the virtual organizes, alters, confronts, and is shaped by gender and race relations. Discourses of the Gardiner protest that highlight the racial divide constructing women's resistance in real space parallel representations of women's resistance in virtual space. The sociopolitical space of activism within real and virtual realities are still grounded in race politics that are mediated by the nation- state.

T1  - The influence of affective behavior on impression formation in interactions between black cancer patients and their oncologists
AN  - 2113784448
AB  - Objective: Black patients and their physicians tend to form relatively negative impressions of each other, and these may contribute to racial disparities in health outcomes. The current research tested the hypothesis that the interaction between positive and negative affective behavior predicts the most positive impressions in clinic visits between Black patients and their oncologists. Method: Naïve coders rated patients' and oncologists' positive and negative affective behavior in thin slices from 74 video recorded clinic visits. We examined whether (a) physician positive affect, negative affect, or their interaction predicted patients' perceptions of patient-centeredness, trustworthiness, and confidence in recommended treatments and (b) patient positive affect, negative affect, or their interaction predicted physicians' perceptions of patient cognitive ability, likelihood of treatment adherence, and likelihood of treatment tolerance. We also tested whether affective behavior mediated relationships between race-related attitudes and post-visit impressions or influenced post-visit impressions independently of attitudes. Results: When oncologists displayed relatively high levels of both positive and negative affect, patients were more confident in recommended treatments but did not rate physicians higher in patient centeredness or trustworthiness. When patients expressed relatively high levels of positive and negative affect, oncologists perceived patients to be higher in cognitive ability and more likely to adhere to treatment recommendations, but no more likely to tolerate treatments. Affective behavior influenced impressions independently of race-related attitudes. Conclusions: Positive and negative affective behaviors jointly contribute to impression formation in clinic visits between Black patients and oncologists, and may have implications for patient treatment and outcomes in this underserved patient population.

T1  - Challenges for social flows
AN  - 2089195668
AB  - Social and interpersonal connections are attached to the built environment: people require physical infrastructure to meet and telecommunicate, and then populate these infrastructures with movement and information dynamics. In GIS analysis, actions are often represented as a unit of spatial information called the social flow–a linear geographic feature that evidences an individual's decision to connect places through travel, telecommunications and/or declaring personal relationships. These flows differ from traditional spatial networks (roads, etc.) because they are often non-planar, and unlike networks in operations systems (such as flight networks), provide evidence of personal intentionality to interact with the built environment and/or to perpetuate relationships with others. En masse, these flows sum to illustrate how humans, information and thoughts spread between and within places. Amid a growing abundance and usage of social flow data, we extend formal definitions of this data type, create new typologies, address new problems, and redefine social distance as the manifestation of social flows. Next, we outline challenges to fully leveraging these data with commercial GISystems by providing examples and potential solutions for representing, visualizing, manipulating, statistically analyzing and ascribing meaning to social flows. The goal of this discussion is to improve the dexterity of social flow data for geographic, environmental and social research questions.

T1  - Campaign dynamics of cognitive accessibility of political judgments: measuring the impact of campaigns and campaign events using response latencies in two German rolling cross section studies
AN  - 2052771231
AB  - Do campaigns matter? Based on two rolling cross-section computer-assisted telephone surveys conducted in the run-up to the 2009 and 2013 German Federal Election, we test whether we can detect campaign effects on the accessibility of voters’ judgments: how do response latencies of political judgments evolve over the course of campaigns? The study uses response latencies, i.e. the standardized time it takes respondents to answer a survey question, as a proxy measurement of cognitive accessibility of political judgments. If campaigns do help voters to make up their minds, we should be able to observe changes at the implicit level of response latencies. Do people answer questions about their voting behavior and political attitudes faster as Election Day comes closer? Our results suggest that attitudes towards candidates and voting intentions become more cognitively accessible during campaigns whereas the accessibility of party identification is conditional on the contextual features of campaigns. In addition we find specific short-term effects of TV debates.

T1  - Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model to Explain to Whom "#Black Lives Matter" ... And to Whom it Does Not
AN  - 2015019939
AB  - Officer-involved shootings have become an unfortunate regular part of news coverage. After such events, the media often select expert sources to explain the news to the public. Social media has changed this media-source dynamic. Today, laypeople-often African Americans-can go online and provide information that counters the media's narrative. This analysis examines the effect people's perception of sources has on their opinion of the Black Lives Matter Movement (#BLM). It also tests what other factors shape audiences' beliefs about this issue. It finds that people who oppose #BLM have a strong orientation toward social dominance, are less likely to view America as the land of opportunity, and have ideas akin to those of modern racists, in that they oppose Affirmative Action and other race-based programs. This analysis also proposes a change to the Elaboration Likelihood Model, which serves as its theoretical basis. On racially charged issues, the personal relevance of an issue does not appear to matter; people will evaluate such topics via central processing.

T1  - What is the Minimum Budget for an Adequate Social Participation in Spain? An Estimate Through the Reference Budgets Approach
AN  - 2002746354
AB  - In Spain, the percentage of population living in poverty or social exclusion has consistently increased since 2007. This trend makes it unlikely to reach the Spanish National Europe 2020 target, which is to reduce in 1.400.000 the people at risk of poverty or exclusion. At the same time, the Spanish Minimum Income Protection Schemes are complex, fragmented and inefficient. In the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy, reference budgets are regarded as a tool to improve poverty measurement and assess income adequacy. This paper describes the development of the Spanish Reference Budgets: priced baskets containing the minimum goods and services necessary for well-described types of families to have an adequate social participation. The study here presented combines various sources of information: national guidelines, expert opinion, scientific literature, survey data on cultural habits and focus group discussions using a cross-country comparable approach. Based on a needs-based perspective, we have estimated a minimum budget threshold that ranges from 427€ to 1569€/month depending on the type of family. Without considering housing and car costs, the healthy food budget is the one that represents a higher share of the total budget in all family types. The weight of the other baskets depends on the household composition, mainly on the presence of children. The aim of our approach is to assess family and children needs, as well as to orient policies designed to guarantee social rights and reduce children poverty and social exclusion.

T1  - Mainstreaming tribals through financial literacy - a review of literature
AN  - 1992302057
AB  - Purpose
The present paper is an attempt to understand the various concepts related to financial literacy. For the development of this paper, secondary data have been considered by visiting various sources of information. The reviews are made on four parameters, which include social exclusion among tribes, government initiatives for tribal development, socio-economic condition of tribes and impact of financial literacy on the lives of tribes. The purpose of this paper is to identify the variables and to undertake an empirical research on this topic. It is found that excluded from income-generating activities, formal education, political system are not getting adequate exposure for maintaining the standard of living. Mostly, the changing economic scenario of consumers, discrimination of wage and employment, lack of capital and financial literacy leads to the mismanagement of money. The financial products are the various causes of financial exclusion and need to be addressed through adequate financial literacy. Moreover, the study attempts to understand the various reasons of financial exclusion and to comprehend the empirical research on the topic as well.
Design/methodology/approach
The present paper is based on the secondary data. In this regard, various sources of information have been visited to collect the data.
Findings
The study finds that owing to exclusion from income-generating activities, lack of formal education, absence of patronage political in adequate means for maintaining an acceptable standard of living, caste discriminations, poverty and migration, exploitation in the hands of money lenders, marginal increase in income, absence of infrastructure, unemployment, lack of financial literacy and its resultant mismanagement of money among the tribal community has pushed them to the utter stage of poverty universally.
Originality/value
The paper can help administrators and the policymakers of different regions across the world to take appropriate measures to focus on educating the people on different financial products and to increase the accessibility. Moreover, the paper can help research scholars to build platform of their research banking upon the data presented in this study.

T1  - “Everywhere We Go, People Seem to Know”: Mad Students and Knowledge Construction of Mental Illness in Higher Education
AN  - 2300716252
AB  - Psychological wellbeing has received attention from academics and policymakers worldwide. Initiatives to improve psychoeducation, campaigns to raise awareness, and charity projects have been established as part of efforts to change public attitudes and behaviors toward mental health problems. The common goal of these initiatives is the prevention of mental health problems in order to reduce the global burden of mental health disease. Some target groups have benefited from such initiatives. However, little attention has been paid to side effects—including harm—of widespread knowledge sharing that is not accompanied by appropriate action. Young adults may be less afraid than older adults to disclose mental health illness and share their lived experiences of mental health. Like older adults, students try to protect their autonomy and privacy in disclosing mental health problems and associated diagnoses. However, many young adults view self-disclosure as a request for help. Confronted with rising demand to support students’ psychological well-being, many higher education providers have launched initiatives to improve students’ knowledge about mental illness. Instead of making assumptions about what students need to know in order to improve their overall psychological wellbeing, we asked ‘Mad students’ (that is, students who identify as mentally ill) about their knowledge construction and management of mental illness. Analyzing this process highlights that mental health promotion is more complicated than sharing appropriate information or applying effective strategies. Knowledge sharing has improved public knowledge of mental illness. However, mental health promotion that omits simple communication about expectations and needs around mental health, to co-produce a shared knowledge base, may lead to misunderstanding and failure in meeting the needs of target groups.

T1  - Ethno-nationalist populism and the mobilization of collective resentment
AN  - 1961335173
AB  - Scholarly and journalistic accounts of the recent successes of radical-right politics in Europe and the United States, including the Brexit referendum and the Trump campaign, tend to conflate three phenomena: populism, ethno-nationalism and authoritarianism. While all three are important elements of the radical right, they are neither coterminous nor limited to the right. The resulting lack of analytical clarity has hindered accounts of the causes and consequences of ethno-nationalist populism. To address this problem, I bring together existing research on nationalism, populism and authoritarianism in contemporary democracies to precisely define these concepts and examine temporal patterns in their supply and demand, that is, politicians' discursive strategies and the corresponding public attitudes. Based on the available evidence, I conclude that both the supply and demand sides of radical politics have been relatively stable over time, which suggests that in order to understand public support for radical politics, scholars should instead focus on the increased resonance between pre-existing attitudes and discursive frames. Drawing on recent research in cultural sociology, I argue that resonance is not only a function of the congruence between a frame and the beliefs of its audience, but also of shifting context. In the case of radical-right politics, a variety of social changes have engendered a sense of collective status threat among national ethnocultural majorities. Political and media discourse has channelled such threats into resentments toward elites, immigrants, and ethnic, racial and religious minorities, thereby activating previously latent attitudes and lending legitimacy to radical political campaigns that promise to return power and status to their aggrieved supporters. Not only does this form of politics threaten democratic institutions and inter-group relations, but it also has the potential to alter the contours of mainstream public discourse, thereby creating the conditions of possibility for future successes of populist, nationalist, and authoritarian politics.

T1  - WHOSE LIVES MATTER?: THE NATIONAL NEWSWORTHINESS OF POLICE KILLING UNARMED BLACKS
AN  - 2027572143
AB  - This study investigates the characteristics of cases of police killing unarmed Blacks that receive national news coverage. I analyze an original quantitative dataset measuring the parameters of 111 cases occurring between 2013 and 2015, and the amount of coverage they received in six national news outlets. Multivariate models indicate that cases' national newsworthiness is positively associated with Blacks' share of the population where the fatal encounter occurred, and the presence of video evidence, peaceful demonstrations, or civil lawsuits. National newsworthiness is negatively associated with encounters that were initiated by a call to police, and those involving decedents who resisted arrest, suffered electroshock injuries, or were impaired by drugs or alcohol. The findings strongly suggest that the most newsworthy cases are those that align with an injustice frame. I discuss the results using theories of newsworthiness, describing how patterns of story availability and story suitability might shape which cases rise to the top of the national agenda. Using the social construction of reality approach, I discuss the implications of the results for how the public understands the empirical nature of police killing unarmed Blacks, and the symbolic meaning of these events.

T1  - The supportive network: rural disadvantaged older people and ICT
AN  - 2162685000
AB  - The rapid development of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) is profoundly transforming the social order, into what Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells calls the network society. Mobile technologies, such as smartphones and tablet computers, are perhaps the definitive tools of the network society; however, cultural and economic barriers exist that restrict access to these transformative tools and to the information networks in which they operate. One group that is particularly at risk is rural older people from disadvantaged backgrounds. This paper reports on one aspect of a larger action research project that involved working with a small group of rural, socially isolated older people with histories of homelessness and complex needs (N = 7) and their social workers. This paper focuses on the older participants who, having been provided tablet computers, were then supported to use the device in their homes over the course of eight months. Despite most participants having never used a computing device of any kind prior to the research project, findings suggested that participants gained confidence, independence and social engagement as a result of their ICT use. Results also highlighted that they experienced challenges in utilising ICT, specifically technical, economic and social barriers. Findings highlight the individual and structural issues that must be addressed to enable all citizens to participate fully in the network society.

T1  - National Identity and Public Attitudes Toward Multiculturalism in Canada: Testing the Indirect Effect via Perceived Collective Threat
AN  - 1931598730
AB  - This article integrates research on national identity and collective threat to examine how these 2 factors jointly contribute to the formation of multicultural ideology in Canada. Specifically, this article argues that ethnic and civic forms of national identity are associated with levels of perceived collective threat, thereby indirectly affecting multicultural attitudes (national identity ¡ collective threat ¡ multicultural attitudes). Results of structural equation modeling analyses indicated that (a) ethnic national identity is positively, and civic national identity is negatively, associated with collective threat; (b) the direct effect of ethnic national identity on multicultural attitudes disappears when collective threat is taken into account; and (c) the relationship between ethnic-civic national identity and multicultural attitudes is significantly mediated by collective threat. These findings imply that a shift from an ethnic to a civic (or ethnoculturally thinner) conception of nationhood reduces levels of outgroup threat and thereby indirectly generates positive multicultural ideology.

T1  - Peer Victimization, Self-Concept, and Grades: The Mediating Role of Self-Concept
AN  - 1884887177
AB  - This study examined the relations between specific forms of peer victimization, math self-concept, and math grades of 740 students. Results showed that, in boys, all forms of victimization did not affect grades, while in girls, a highly perceived social exclusion impacted grades. In boys, a highly perceived humiliation negatively affected self-concept, whereas a highly perceived social exclusion positively affected self-concept. Boys' self-concept mediated the relations between social exclusion and grades as well as between humiliation and grades. In girls, a highly perceived happy slapping positively affected self-concept, and self-concept mediated the relation between a highly perceived happy slapping and grades.

T1  - TV, CELL PHONES AND SOCIAL JUSTICE: A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF HOW VIDEO CREATES SOCIAL CHANGE
AN  - 2119846729
AB  - During a 1987 symposium on the media's coverage of the civil rights movement, House of Representatives member John Lewis noted "the civil rights movement would have been like a bird without wings if it hadn't been for the news media" (Treadwell, 1987). Lewis continued by characterizing the media as "sympathetic referees" in the battle against racism and segregation (Treadwell, 1987). Lewis's Congressional website posted an editorial published in Newsweek that noted that "it took members of the press who dared to use their cameras, their pads and their pens to tell the story" of the murder, church bombings, lynching, and countless numbers of brutal attacks against African-Americans in the struggle for civil rights (Lewis, 2009). Over the past sixty years, video has been an important tool in the fight for civil rights and social justice. This paper highlights key moments in history where video played a significant role in documenting institutional racism and civil rights violations. Additionally, this essay will discuss how video has mobilized efforts for civil rights and social justice. As the struggle for social justice and equal protection under the law continues in the 21st century, new media tools are serving as referees against unlawful arrests and violence used against people of color and disadvantaged populations. Cell phones and social media in the hands of citizen journalists have replaced the "cameras, pads, and pens" used by professional reporters to document civil rights violations. Bystanders used cell phones to capture the choking of Eric Garner and the shooting of Walter Scott, among other incidents, across the country. Video of these incidents were critical in providing a visual record of confrontations with law enforcement and sparking debate over issues associated with policing and race relations. At the same time, video posted on social media and broadcast on national television has been instrumental in mobilizing efforts to fight for equal protection under the law, holding law enforcement officials accountable for their actions, and raising public awareness about injustice in America.

T1  - INTERNET USAGE BY THE ELDERLY IN SERBIA
AN  - 2081762557
AB  - In the last decades, the problems of the elderly have attracted the attention of the scientific and wider public, thus imposing themselves as issues of public policies. The growth of interest in the elderly is conditioned by: the increasing share of the elderly in the overall population, the change of their social status as well as the development of new conceptual frames (social exclusion, marginalization, ageism). Today the elderly live in a society which is characterized by the expansion of information-communication technologies (ICT). The Internet is a means of more efficient and faster completion of various activities, satisfaction of different needs and access to social resources. On the other hand, the adoption of new technologies has taken on a different pace when it comes to the generation affiliation. That is why it is important to examine the degree to which older citizens successfully use these opportunities. The subject matter of the paper is Internet usage by the elderly. It points to the benefits the elderly are getting from Internet usage as well as the barriers they come across. Starting from the concept of the digital divide, Internet usage by the older Serbian population is analyzed. Finally, the measures to be taken to create favorable conditions for Internet usage by elderly are pointed out

T1  - Positive attitude toward life, emotional expression, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms among centenarians and near-centenarians
AN  - 1798002622
AB  - Objectives: Favorable attitudes, emotions, personality characteristics, and self-rated health have been associated with successful aging in late life. However, less is known regarding these constructs and their relationships to mental health outcomes in the oldest old persons. This study examined cross-sectional relationships of these psychological factors to depressive symptoms in centenarians and near-centenarians.
Methods: A selected sample of Ashkenazi Jewish older adults aged 98-107 (n = 54, 78% female) without significant cognitive impairment participated. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental Status Examination, positive attitude toward life and emotional expression by the Personality Outlook Profile Scale (POPS), self-rated health by participants' subjective rating of their present health, and depressive symptoms by the Geriatric Depression Scale.
Results: Results demonstrated inverse associations of the positive attitude toward life domain of the POPS and self-rated health with participants' levels of depressive symptoms even after adjusting for the effects of history of medical illnesses, cognitive function, and demographic variables. Additionally, participants with high levels of care showed higher levels of depressive symptoms. Path analysis supported the partially mediating role of positive attitude toward life in the relationship between self-rated health and depressive symptoms.
Conclusion: These findings emphasized the important roles of positive attitudes and emotions as well as self-rated health in mental health outcomes in the oldest old. Although, limited by its cross-sectional design, findings suggest these psychological factors may exert protective effects on mental health outcomes in advanced age.

T1  - The Personality Divide: Do Personality Traits Differentially Predict Online Political Engagement?
AN  - 1796298018
AB  - Personality traits are considered efficient predictors of off-line political participation. However, the effects of personality traits on online political engagement have been largely understudied. The main goal of this cross-sectional research (N = 1,134, sample of young adults) was to investigate the relationships between personality traits, as measured by the Big Five Inventory, and online political engagement. As dependent variables, we took three dimensions of online political engagement: e-targeted, e-expressive, and e-news. A latent variables structural equation model showed that personality traits directly and indirectly predict modes of online political engagement via the mediation of political attitudes and the proneness to use Internet. On the whole, we found that people open to experience and extraverts take part in online political actions, whereas agreeable and conscientious people tend to avoid them. The findings provide insights on the differences between traditional form (i.e., off-line) and the new online modes of political engagement by showing that, to some extent, the latter appeal to different personality profiles. In sum, online engagement seems to be marked by a personality divide.

T1  - Unearthing the "Green" Personality: Core Traits Predict Environmentally Friendly Behavior
AN  - 1789222425
AB  - Pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors show substantial individual differences, and exploring their predictors can help reveal the origins of pro-environmental behavior. Basic personality traits may provide a partial explanation, but it is unclear which personality traits are reliably associated with pro-environmental behaviors. This article uses a specific type of environmental behavior, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to clarify which personality correlates are most robustly associated with behavior, and to test mediation of those effects through attitudes. A large (N = 345) sample of United States adults representative in age, gender, and ethnicity completed the 100-item HEXACO personality inventory, a novel self-report measure of behaviors that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and scales of environmental and political attitudes. Accounting for demographics, emissions-reducing behaviors were most strongly predicted by Openness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion, and these effects of personality were mediated by attitudes toward the natural environment. These observations broaden the understanding of the etiology of environmental attitudes and behavior. [web URL: http://eab.sagepub.com/content/48/5/635.abstract]

Interviews with 72 low-income US residents from both a large metropolitan city and a medium-sized Midwestern town, however, reveal that many people still struggle to maintain physical access, supporting technology maintenance theory. Technology maintenance theory argues that although most of the US poor now use digital technology, access is unstable and characterized by frequent periods of disconnection. As a result, low-income users must work to maintain access, often experiencing cycles of dependable instability. In these interviews, nearly all used the Internet, but technology maintenance practices were widespread, including negotiation of temporarily disconnected service, broken hardware, and logistic limitations on public access. As a result, participants had limited access to health information and employment, and biased attitudes toward technology. That is, in some cases, negative attitudes toward Internet adoption reflected a rational response to disconnection rather than cultural norms or fears of the Internet, as suggested by previous research. Findings support and extend the theory of technology maintenance by emphasizing a shift in the US digital divide from issues of ownership to issues of sustainability; they also provide insight into the interrelated nature of access and attitudes toward technology. This new theoretical approach complements other theoretical approaches to the digital divide that foreground a contextualized understanding of digital disparities as embedded within a history of broad social disparities.

T1  - Changing Attitudes Toward Homosexuality in Taiwan, 1995-2012
AN  - 1824284296
AB  - Most of what we know about attitudes toward homosexuality comes from research focused on Europe and the Americas. Much less is known about attitudinal change in East Asia, even though some nations have begun to propose liberal laws and policies regarding homosexuality. Focusing on Taiwan, a more liberal and economically developed society, this study examines key characteristics associated with changes in attitudes about homosexuality. Data from three waves of the World Values Survey collected in 1995, 2006, and 2012 are used. The findings show that overall social tolerance has increased, which is mainly due to cohort succession and partly to intra-cohort changes in attitudes. Improvement in education and liberal values related to divorce, prostitution, and gender roles act as mediators for the cohort differences in tolerance. In addition, women and the college-educated hold more liberal attitudes toward homosexuals than men or the least educated in recent years. Christians were not especially intolerant toward homosexuality in 1995, but became significantly less tolerant than other religions by 2012, which is likely due to a resistance to attitudinal changes for the Christian community.

T1  - Party Polarization, Media Choice, and Mass Partisan-Ideological Sorting
AN  - 1786556858
AB  - What is the relationship between party polarization, media fragmentation, and partisan-ideological sorting? The growth and availability of partisan media -- afforded through the expansion of cable, satellite, and Internet penetration -- is often linked to the consistency and extremity of individuals' political attitudes and partisan identities. At the same time, the literature on mass audiences and media choice suggests that the effects of choice and partisan media should be differential according to levels of political interest. This debate has yet to fully articulate a role for elite party polarization, which has been identified as a primary cue to facilitate mass partisanship and sorting. Synthesizing these bodies of scholarship, we utilize a variety of data to assess the influence of elite polarization, media fragmentation, and political interest on partisan-ideological sorting. We find that sorting is consistently connected to perceptions of polarization and qualified evidence that media fragmentation is related to partisan-ideological sorting. The expansion of cable and satellite programming is positively related to sorting, but this effect is isolated to individuals highly interested in news and politics.

T1  - Beyond Guilt and Stigma: Changing Attitudes among Israeli Migrants in Canada
AN  - 1755986822
AB  - Over 60 years ago, the Jewish nationalist movement known as Zionism culminated in the creation of the State of Israel. Millions of Jews immigrated to Israel over the twentieth century, a process known as aliya (literally, "going up"). Yet over the years, thousands of Israelis have also chosen to leave Israel in a movement termed yerida ("going down"). As the term suggests, this reverse migration has been highly stigmatized. During the 1960s and 1970s, emigrants were publicly disparaged in the Israeli media for having abandoned a struggling state. Consequently, Israeli migrants suffered strong feelings of guilt that often, hampered their integration process abroad, a phenomenon observed as late as the 1990s. This paper, however, reveals that feelings of stigmatization have greatly decreased among Israeli migrants in recent years. The study is based on research that I conducted in 2008-2009, involving nine months of participant observation in Vancouver's Israeli community and 34 in-depth interviews. Unlike in previous studies, most of my informants expressed no feelings of guilt over having left Israel. Of those who did, most framed their guilt as a longing for family and friends rather than the patriotic longing for the land as expressed by previous generations. Previous studies have also found that Israelis harbour a "myth of return"- a continuously expressed desire to return to Israel and a reluctance to accept their stay abroad as permanent. However, I have not found that the myth of return is still strong today, despite the continued prevalence of a strong sense of Israeli identity among Israelis abroad. I suggest that these changing attitudes are the product of shifting ideals in Israeli society that have developed as the state of Israel has matured. This paper thus serves to update the outdated image of Israeli migrants as it exists in the prevailing literature.

T1  - Relative Deprivation and Relative Wealth Enhances Anti-Immigrant Sentiments: The V-Curve Re-Examined
AN  - 1721911191
AB  - Previous research has shown that negative attitudes towards immigrants and support for anti-immigrant parties are observed both among those experiencing relative deprivation and those experiencing relative gratification (so called v-curve). Whereas the effect of relative deprivation is intuitive, the effect of relative gratification is more difficult to explain. Why would economic prosperity provoke negative attitudes towards immigrants? We first present correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) support for the v-curve. In Study 1, in a national Swiss referendum, a higher percentage anti-immigrant voting was found in cantons with relatively lower and relatively higher relative disposable income. In Study 2, in a hypothetical society, more opposition to ‘newcomers’ joining society was found among poor or above average wealth group members than among those in a moderate wealth group condition. In Study 3, we replicate this finding and also show that opposition to immigration is higher for all wealth groups when societal inequality is growing rather than declining. In a final study, we examine different forms of relative gratification and mediators of the relationship between relative gratification and opposition to immigration (i.e., identification, collective self-definition as competent and cold, and fear about future wealth). Only fear about future wealth mediates this relationship. We conclude that, paradoxically, relative gratification effects are partly due to the fear of future deprivation.

T1  - When collective memories of victimhood fade: Generational evolution of intergroup attitudes and political aspirations in Belgium
AN  - 1728660405; 201533978
AB  - Collective memory theories propose that groups' remembrances of their past depend upon their current social situation. In Belgium, a significant proportion of Dutch speakers share a collective memory of past victimisation by French speakers and fight for an ever-larger autonomy of their region. Yet, as the respective economic, political and social situations of the linguistic regions of Belgium recently evolved with a reversal of fortunes, the current experience of younger Dutch speakers does not fit the traditional memory anymore. We thus predicted that the collective memories of victimhood would decline amongst them, thus bringing changes in intergroup attitudes and political aspirations. Three generations were compared in a survey of 1226 French-speaking and 1457 Dutch-speaking individuals. For both groups, younger generations evidenced less regionalist and more integrative positions than older ones. However, these effects were stronger for Dutch-speaking respondents, and for them, collective memory of victimhood mediated the relation linking age and identification with Belgium, intergroup attitudes and political aspirations. We concluded that the current social context has decisive consequences for collective remembrances, which, in turn, impact intergroup relations and political attitudes and choices.

T1  - Relationship Between the Public's Belief in Recovery, Level of Mental Illness Stigma, and Previous Contact
AN  - 1680155091; 201514630
AB  - Disbelief exits that individuals who have a mental health condition are able to recover and fully function in life. This study analyzed 1,437 adults from the 2006 General Social Survey. Structural equation modeling (1) examined the relationship between respondents' level of prejudicial attitudes and social distance (i.e., stigma) toward individuals who have a mental health condition and their belief in the potential of recovery (2) tested whether previous contact with an individual who received treatment was a mediator. Findings indicated that the belief in recovery led to lower levels of social distance. Prejudicial attitudes were found to be a predictor of one's level of social distance. Previous contact was not a mediator however; males, minorities and those with less education were less likely to have had previous contact. Results indicated a need to emphasize the probability of recovering from a mental health condition when developing target-specific stigma reducing strategies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Americans' Attitudes Toward Premarital Sex and Pornography Consumption: A National Panel Analysis
AN  - 1680155082; 201514648
AB  - National panel data gathered in 2008 (T1) and 2010 (T2) from 420 Black and White US adults aged 18-89 years (M = 45.37, SD = 15.85) were employed to assess prospective associations between pornography consumption and premarital sex attitudes. Premarital sex attitudes were indexed via a composite measure of perceptions of the appropriateness of adults and teenagers having premarital sex. Wright's (2011) sexual script acquisition, activation, application model (3AM) of media sexual socialization was used as the guiding theoretical framework. The 3AM maintains that sexual media may be used by consumers to inform their sexual scripts but that attitude change from exposure to sexual media is less likely when media scripts are incongruent with consumers' preexisting scripts. Consistent with these postulates, the association between pornography consumption at T1 and more positive attitudes toward premarital sex at T2 was strongest for younger adults, who are less oppositional to premarital sex than older adults. Contrary to the position that associations between pornography consumption and premarital sex attitudes are due to individuals who already have positive attitudes toward premarital sex selecting content congruent with their attitudes, premarital sex attitudes at T1 did not predict pornography consumption at T2. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Despite drawing on a common pool of data, observers of the 2012 presidential campaign came to different conclusions about whether, how, and to what extent 'October surprise' Hurricane Sandy influenced the election. The present study used a mixed correlational and experimental design to assess the relation between, and effect of, the salience of Hurricane Sandy on attitudes and voting intentions regarding President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in a large sample of voting-aged adults. Results suggest that immediately following positive news coverage of Obama's handling of the storm's aftermath, Sandy's salience positively influenced attitudes toward Obama, but that by election day, reminders of the hurricane became a drag instead of a boon for the President. In addition to theoretical implications, this study provides an example of how to combine methodological approaches to help answer questions about the impact of unpredictable, large-scale events as they unfold.

T1  - Humiliation in the Daily Routine of Domestic Workers
AN  - 1684423934; 201519547
AB  - This article discusses situations of humiliation as intrinsic events in the daily routine of domestic workers in Greater Metropolitan Sao Paulo. It particularly focuses on the daily interactions between female employers and female domestic workers, taking place within what could be classified as domestic employment doing everything (in other words, lacking any limit to the tasks performed by female domestic workers). The author argues that situations of humiliation engendered by this occupation are primarily linked to the social distance acting on the meeting between the contractor and the contracted. In short, the preponderant daily routine of domestic work is the humiliation of social distance. The article is based primarily on ten interviews with female domestic workers living in Greater Sao Paulo, also analyzing newspaper articles on conflictive situations in the day-to-day context of domestic work.

T1  - When Political Comedy Turns Personal: Humor Types, Audience Evaluations, and Attitudes
AN  - 1531930997; 201424029
AB  - This study examines the impact of diverse comedy types on relevant political attitudes and what happens when the comedy content moves beyond the political to focus on personal attributes that are beyond a politician's control. Using a real political case study of David Paterson, New York's first blind and African American governor, the research measured the differential impact of exposure to self-directed and other-directed hostile humor on evaluations of comedy content, favorability ratings, perceptions of media portrayals of disability, and attitudes toward blindness. The results suggest that differential exposure to the comedy clips had an impact on attitudes toward blindness with those exposed to Paterson's humor exhibiting more positive attitudes toward blindness than those who were exposed to Saturday Night Live's other-directed hostile humor.

T1  - THE EFFECTS OF TELEVISION VIEWING, CULTURAL PROXIMITY, AND ETHNOCENTRISM ON COUNTRY IMAGE
AN  - 1504722610
AB  - We explored the effect of viewing Korean drama miniseries television programs, along with cultural proximity and ethnocentrism, on Japanese and Chinese television watchers' perceptions of Korea. By conducting a survey in Beijing and China with 621 valid samples, we confirmed the effect of viewing Korean drama miniseries television programs in shaping a positive attitude toward Korea. Furthermore, this positive attitude yielded higher levels of behavioral intentions such as visiting Korea or buying Korean products. Cultural proximity was also found to be a significant variable in predicting positive attitudes toward Korea. However, contrary to the findings in previous studies, in this study the effect of ethnocentrism was not significant. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - What stimulates teachers to integrate ICT in their pedagogical practices? The use of digital learning materials in education
AN  - 1364702905; 201325696
AB  - The question 'What stimulates teachers to integrate Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in their pedagogical practices?' was addressed in the context of teachers' usage of digital learning materials (DLMs). We adopted Fishbein's Integrative Model of Behavior Prediction (IMBP), to investigate the various relationships between distal and proximal variables and intention. Mediation analysis revealed that the proximal variables attitude, subjective norm, and self-efficacy towards DLMs were significant predictors of teachers' intention to use DLMs. The contribution of subjective norm, however, was modest. Attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy mediated the effects of the following three distal variables on intention: previous use of DLMs, perceived knowledge and skills to use DLMs, and colleagues' usage of DLMs. Persuasive communication and skills based training seem, therefore, appropriate interventions to promote a positive attitude towards DLMs and improve self-efficacy in using DLMs. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - How the Media Frames the Immigration Debate: The Critical Role of Location and Politics
AN  - 1347781647; 201322135
AB  - The media plays an important role in how the American public understands controversial social and political issues, such as immigration. The purpose of this article is to examine how key features of the media, such as location (Arizona vs. National) and political ideology (Liberal vs. Conservative), affect the framing of arguments supporting and opposing the anti-immigration bill (Arizona SB 1070). A content analysis was conducted using 3 weeks of newspaper articles from two Arizona newspapers (one Conservative, one Liberal) and five national newspapers (three Conservative, two Liberal). Analyses revealed that both location and political ideology influenced the framing. Specifically, the national newspapers were more likely than Arizona newspapers to frame arguments supporting the bill in terms of threats (e.g., threats to economic and public safety) and to frame arguments against the bill in terms of civil rights issues (e.g., racial profiling). In terms of political ideology, Conservative newspapers were more likely than Liberal newspapers to frame the bill in terms of economic and public safety threats, but did not differ in mentions of civil rights issues. The implications for attitudes toward immigrants and legal ethnic minorities and for defining the boundaries of the American national identity are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Devil Knows Best: Experimental Effects of a Televised Soap Opera on Latino Attitudes Toward Government and Support for the 2010 U.S. Census
AN  - 1347781478; 201322199
AB  - Can a soap opera influence political attitudes and engagement among U.S. Latinos, particularly those perceiving a threat from immigration legislation? The extended contact hypothesis predicts that ingroup fictional characters can encourage positive affect and attitudes toward real-world groups and issues with which they are associated. We tested the impact of a Telemundo soap opera, Mas Sabe El Diablo,which portrayed a Latino character's involvement with the 2010 Census. During the census-collection period and directly following the passage of Arizona's Senate Bill 1070 immigration act, we randomly assigned Latino participants in Arizona, Texas, and New Jersey to view (1) pro-census scenes or (2) control scenes featuring the character but not the census. Compared to control viewers, census viewers expressed more positive attitudes and less negative affect toward the U.S. government and more behavioral support for the census (wearing pro-census stickers and taking informational flyers). Affinity for the character was associated with stronger effects. The soap opera did not positively influence Arizona participants who were directly affected by SB 1070.

T1  - Increased longevity from viewing retirement positively
AN  - 1157755832
AB  - Studies of the relationship between retirement and subsequent health, including longevity, have produced mixed findings. One reason may be that these studies have not taken attitudes toward retirement into account. In the current study we examined whether attitudes toward retirement can impact longevity. The cohort consisted of 394 participants who were followed for 23 years. As predicted, participants with positive attitudes toward retirement at the start of the study lived significantly longer than those with negative attitudes toward retirement. The positive attitudes-toward-retirement group had a median survival advantage of 4.9 years. This survival advantage remained after controlling for relevant covariates, including age, functional health, socio-economic status, and whether employed or retired. Our findings suggest that psychological planning for retirement is as important as the more traditional forms of planning. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Organizational factors and the attitude toward health promotion in German ICT-companies
AN  - 1081869494; 201235740
AB  - This study takes a first step toward examining the relationship between organizational characteristics and the perceived attitude toward health promotion in companies from the perspective of chief executive officers (CEOs). Data for the cross-sectional study were collected through telephone interviews with one CEO from randomly selected companies within the German information and communication technology (ICT) sector. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (LRA) was performed, and further LRA was conducted after stratifying on company size. LRA of data from a total of n = 522 interviews found significant associations between the attitude toward health promotion and the company's market position, its number of hierarchical levels, the percentage of permanent positions and the percentage of employees with an academic education. After stratification on company size, the association between the attitude toward health promotion and both market position and the percentage of employees with an academic education was still present in small companies. There were no significant relationships between the attitude toward health promotion and the structural characteristics of medium-sized and large companies. The preliminary results of the study indicate that a perceived attitude toward health promotion in companies can be explained, to a certain degree, by the intraorganizational characteristics analyzed. Our key findings highlight that efforts toward establishing a positive attitude toward health promotion should focus on small companies with a lower market position and a greater number of employees with a lower education level.

T1  - Immigrant Struggles in New Orleans Post-Katrina
AN  - 1037875478; 201232258
AB  - Race relations in New Orleans have often been narrowed to Black and white, especially pre-Katrina. According to the 2000 census, the city was about 67% African American, 27% white, 2% Asian, and 3% "Hispanic." In a city with a deep history of racial tensions between Black and white, other people of color-and especially recent immigrants-often went unmentioned in discussions of city demographics. The city's world famous culture-whether in the traditions of Mardi Gras Indians and secondline parades, or in music like jazz and bounce-is also famously rooted in specifically African cultures. Even in media coverage of the city post-Katrina, the story of immigrant experiences has remained mostly invisible. When these stories have been told, they have often fit into the old stereotypes of "model minorities" (as in the case of the Vietnamese recovery) or of low-wage workers stealing jobs (as in the case of news reports on the city's new Latino population). However, the stories of these other New Orleanians offer an important lens through which to view the overall struggle over the city's recovery. And the work of grassroots activists from these communities, who strived to not only work for justice for their friends and neighbors, but also to build broad multi-racial alliances, provides an inspiring example for people in other cities who are waging similar fights.

T1  - The role of media in the process of socialization to American politics among international students: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1928755819
AB  - Mass media have been considered a powerful agent of political socialization, affecting political attitudes and behaviors of voters and non-voters. This study employed a survey of international students in the US to investigate the effects of print, television and online news on political socialization during the 2008 US presidential race. Results indicated that newspaper and television news use significantly predicted internal political efficacy and intentions to participate in American politics. Media 'nationality', motivation to apply for permanent residence and duration of stay in the US were explored for possible moderation of media effects on political socialization. The findings are discussed within the framework of media effects on political socialization in host and home countries.

T1  - I Feel Like I Know You: Sharing Negative Attitudes of Others Promotes Feelings of Familiarity
AN  - 1928276005
AB  - Holding similar negative--versus positive--attitudes toward a third party has been shown to predict increased closeness to a stranger. Here, the authors examined whether this effect is mediated by the heightened feelings of familiarity engendered by shared negative attitudes. In Study 1, participants who shared with a (bogus) stranger a negative attitude of a professor subsequently reported knowing more about the stranger than those who shared a positive attitude, but only when they did not feel strongly about the attitude. In Study 2, a familiarity manipulation produced high levels of closeness among participants who believed they had a lot of information about a stranger. Among those who believed they knew little about the stranger, closeness was facilitated by sharing a weakly held, negative attitude of a professor. Discussion considers the relevance of these findings to the interpersonal attraction literature.

T1  - Secondary transfer effects from imagined contact: Group similarity affects the generalization gradient
AN  - 875716804; 201115251
AB  - An experiment examined the effects of imagining contact with an illegal immigrant on attitudes towards illegal immigrants and subsequent effects of that attitude change on feelings about other groups (secondary transfer). Compared to a condition in which participants imagined negative contact with an illegal immigrant, participants who imagined positive contact reported more positive attitudes concerning illegal immigrants. Using bootstrapped mediation models, effects of positive imagined contact on attitudes towards illegal immigrants were shown to generalize to other groups that were independently ranked as similar to illegal immigrants, but not to dissimilar groups. This generalization gradient effect was relatively large. Implications for theory and practical applications to prejudice reduction are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-Choice Paradigm
AN  - 764417112; 201064621
AB  - After making a choice between 2 objects, people reevaluate their chosen item more positively and their rejected item more negatively (i.e., they spread the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm and, perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Weaving Networks: An Educational Project for Digital Inclusion
AN  - 743044489; 201027395
AB  - In this article, the authors describe the development of a digital training project aimed at groups at risk of social exclusion in the community of Cantabria, Spain. This project is in keeping with national and international policies--especially those designed by the European Union--that seek to develop an information society accessible for all citizens. They describe the results of two-and-one-half years of training activities that aim to bring certain social groups into closer contact with information and communication technology (ICT). Although the training program is based on the notion that access to technologies, as well as certain uses that can be made of them, is linked to digital and social inclusion, the authors try to avoid what some have called myths and mistaken beliefs surrounding ICT, especially the idea that more and better technology necessarily produces a society that is more in touch, more socially committed, more just, and more democratic. They believe that the ideas and dilemmas that have arisen as a result of the design, development, and assessment of the digital training project can cast light on the meaning of teaching 'with,' 'from,' and 'based on' ICT.
