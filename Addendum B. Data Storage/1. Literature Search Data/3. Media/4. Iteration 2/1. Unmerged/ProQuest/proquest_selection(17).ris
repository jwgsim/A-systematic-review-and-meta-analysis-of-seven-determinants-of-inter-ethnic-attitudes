T1  - National identity exploration attenuates the identification–prejudice link: GPIR
AN  - 2669413287
AB  - Social identity exploration is a process whereby individuals actively seek information about their group membership and show efforts to understand its meaning. Developmental theory argues that exploration-based ingroup commitment is the basis for outgroup positivity. We tested this notion in relation to national identity and attitudes towards immigrants. The results of five experimental studies among German adolescents and early adults (N = 1,146; 16–25 years) and one internal meta-analysis suggest that the positive identification–prejudice link is weaker when participants are instructed to explore the meaning of their identity (Study 1). This is not mediated via self-uncertainty (Study 2), but via a reduction in intergroup threat (Study 3) and an increase in deprovincialization (Study 4). In addition, identity exploration enabled strong identifiers to oppose descriptive ingroup norms (Study 5). We conclude that identity exploration can contribute to a further understanding of the identification–prejudice link.

T1  - The American racial divide in fear of the police
AN  - 2652811428
AB  - The mission of policing is “to protect and serve,” but recent events suggest that many Americans, and especially Black Americans, do not feel protected from the police. Understanding police‐related fear is important because it may impact civilians’ health, daily lives, and policy attitudes. To examine the prevalence, sources, and consequences of both personal and altruistic fear of the police, we surveyed a nationwide sample (N = 1,150), which included comparable numbers of Black (N = 517) and White (N = 492) respondents. Most White respondents felt safe, but most Black respondents lived in fear of the police killing them and hurting their family members. Approximately half of Black respondents preferred to be robbed or burglarized than to have unprovoked contact with officers. The racial divide in fear was mediated by past experiences with police mistreatment. In turn, fear mediated the effects of race and past mistreatment on support for defunding the police and intentions to have “the talk” with family youths about the need to distrust and avoid officers. The deep American racial divide in police‐related fear represents a racially disparate health crisis and a primary obstacle to law enforcement's capacity to serve all communities equitably.

AN  - 2656326588
AB  - This study examined the public health measures adopted by the Jordanian government that contributed to stemming the spread of the pandemic and the impact of these measures on the behavior patterns of families. Content analysis was used with 117 news briefs, and interviews were conducted with 20 families identified through snowball sampling. Ecological systems theory and a public health model are used to frame our understanding of the results. We found themes from interviews that included a shift to online education, use of social media, changes in consumer behavior, and social initiatives.

T1  - Frequency of exposure to the media is associated with levels of HIV-related knowledge and stigmatising attitudes among adults in Ghana
AN  - 2646092136
AB  - Studies show that increased knowledge of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is achieved through exposure to mass media, which then contributes to positive attitudes and behaviours towards people living with HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This study examined the relationship between the frequency of exposure to the media and the level of HIV-related knowledge and stigmatising attitudes towards HIV and AIDS among adults in Ghana. A weighted sample of 13 484 men and women 15 to 59 years old took part in the study. The main outcome variable was the HIV-related knowledge score, calculated based on responses to eight questions about general HIV concepts and HIV transmission modes. The frequency of exposure to the media was the primary explanatory variable. The relationship between the frequency of media exposure and the level of HIV-related knowledge was investigated using Poisson regression methods in Stata 13.0. Of the 13 484 respondents analysed, 25%, 88.2% and 79.7% reported reading print media, listening to the radio and watching TV at least once a week respectively. The average HIV-related knowledge score was 4.9 (SD 1.6), with 22.9% of respondents correctly answering five questions and about 2.0% correctly answering all eight questions. The frequency of exposure to the media, particularly print media and television, was associated with an increase in the level of HIV-related knowledge. When compared to having a low level of HIV-related knowledge, having a moderate and high level of HIV-related knowledge reduced the score of stigmatising attitude by 0.065 and 0.277 points, respectively. The adult population in Ghana has a very low level of HIV or AIDS knowledge, as well as a significant level of stigma associated with HIV or AIDS, which could stymie HIV prevention efforts. The media, on the other hand, provide a platform for these issues to be addressed.

T1  - Religion, Politics, and Public Funding for Abortion
AN  - 2637652276
AB  - An abundance of research examines Americans’ attitudes toward abortion legality and morality with particular attention to polarization around this issue and the influence of social movements, religious organizations, the media, and political leaders. There is a relative dearth, however, of research focusing on attitudes toward the public funding of abortion services. Using three national, random samples of American adults, we address this gap in the literature. We find that the oft‐cited “bipartisan consensus” around opposition to public funding of abortion is a myth. In fact, there is more bipartisan consensus around abortion legality than abortion funding, across religious traditions. As national debates about abortion funding intensify, these findings underscore the importance of future surveys consistently measuring Americans’ attitudes toward public funding of abortion, above and beyond abortion legality or morality.

T1  - COVID-19 in a collectivist culture: social isolation and maintenance of social relations
AN  - 2646104566
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the way people in a collectivist culture, particularly Egyptians, define social isolation and to understand the effect of social isolation on maintaining traditional networks of social relations.Design/methodology/approach>To do this, online ethnographic semi-structured interviews were carried out with a purposeful sample of non-infected Egyptians who have access to social media networks.Findings>Although collectivism may be perceived as a risk factor in developing countries, it has positive effects on reducing the spread of COVID-19 among Egyptians through the preventive measures it entails. Increased fear, worries and anxiety about the family and in-group members is a limiting factor against the prevalence of the disease, despite the emotional hardships experienced by individuals.Research limitations/implications>The sample interviewed does not refer to the entire Egyptian population, since the number of social media users represents 43.5% of Egyptians. Therefore, generalization of research data may be problematic.Practical implications>The paper aims to raise awareness of the important of stressing collectivist character traits since they can help develop more preventive measures against the spread of the disease. Research findings also indicate that there is a need to coexist with the disease under controlled conditions to lessen the psychological risks of social isolation.Originality/value>In light of the paucity of research carried out on COVID-19, the present research provides a pioneering insight into the meaning of social isolation in a collectivist culture and the distinctive local methods adopted by people to maintain their networks of social relations.

T1  - Does perceived cultural distance mediate the relationship between intergroup contact and support for refugee rights? A preliminary investigation
AN  - 2620810485
AB  - Despite the importance of cultural difference perceptions in intergroup relations, prior work has paid insufficient attention to the intersection between intergroup contact, perceived cultural distance, and policy support. Using cross‐sectional data from a community sample of 210 Turkish citizens, this study examined whether perceived cultural distance would mediate the link between intergroup contact and support for Syrian refugee rights. The results showed that perceived cultural distance mediated the relationship between contact quality, but not contact quantity, and support for refugee rights. This mediated relationship was further moderated by political orientation, such that perceived cultural distance mediated the role of contact quality in support for refugee rights only among participants with a leftist (vs. rightist) orientation. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings were discussed, along with a reflection on future research directions. Please refer to the Supplementary Material section to find this article's Community and Social Impact Statement.

T1  - Les Enfants Perdus: Asylum Reform, Parents’ Groups, and Disability Rights in France, 1968–1975
AN  - 2624173344
AB  - Following the deaths of fourteen children at a children’s residential facility in Froissy in November 1968, a moment of national interest in France in the challenges facing disabled children led parents’ associations to press for systemic reform. Concomitantly, social critiques following the protests of May 1968 focused on poor institutional conditions as evidence of society’s failures. Though government inquiry into the incident placed the blame on the proprietors, media reports and advocates asserted the failure of the French government to protect the disabled. This viewpoint aligned with the rhetoric of reformers seeking to dismantle institutions to instigate social change. However, an alliance of reformers and parents’ groups did not materialize, even after the important reforms of the law of 30 June 1975. That law articulated the government’s commitment to the equality of disabled citizens, but it had limited impact due to its failure to address conditions for the mentally disabled.

Drawing on existing accounts of visual influence, this analysis explores how (un)sympathetic refugee portrayals in news accounts affect distant viewers’ compassion responses and refugee policy attitudes. The study reports the results of three survey experiments, in Sweden, the United States, and the UK, involving 25 unique images and over 4,500 combined respondents. Building on previous work on Moral Foundations Theory, we find the manifest vulnerability of depicted refugees to be an important influence on how visual portrayals evoke sympathy and impact conservatives’ (but not liberals’) compassion responses. Once activated, compassion is found to mediate the effect of refugee portrayals on right-wing support for refugee aid.

T1  - When cultures clash: Links between perceived cultural distance in values and attitudes towards migrants
AN  - 2578689090
AB  - Migration elicits mixed reactions from the host‐society. Negative responses towards migrants seem to emerge when migrants are perceived as culturally different. We investigated when and why perceived cultural distance (PCD) is associated with negative migrant attitudes by focussing on differences in cultural values. We expected that PCD in social values (focus on relationships and society) should be more strongly associated with attitudes towards migrants than personal values (individual needs and gains) and should be mediated by symbolic threat. In two quasi‐experimental studies (N = 200, N = 668) with Dutch participants (host‐society), we simultaneously tested effects of respondents’ perception of Dutch values, their perceptions of migrant values (of Moroccan, Syrian, Polish ethnic origin), and PCD between Dutch‐migrant value on attitudes. For all migrant groups, PCD in social values was associated with more negative attitudes, less tolerance, and less policy support regarding migrants; this was mediated by symbolic threat. These links were weaker for personal values.

T1  - Collateral Consequences of School Suspension: Examining the ‘Knifing off’ Hypothesis
AN  - 2571047179
AB  - School exclusionary practices are routinely used in response to undesired behaviors in the school environment and have been shown to have resulted in unintentional or collateral consequences for youth, including increased risk of arrest, offending behavior, and incarceration. Little research has been done on how school exclusion impacts interaction with prosocial peers and involvement in prosocial opportunities. This study applies the labeling perspective’s knifing off concept to examine whether prosocial exposures and deviant peer associations mediate the relationship between school suspension, arrest, and offending behavior. Using data from the LONGSCAN study, we examined whether suspension led to changes in prosocial peer association and activity involvement, increases in deviant peer association, and ultimately arrest and offending behavior. Results provided support for the labeling perspective’s hypotheses, finding school suspension was indirectly associated with both arrest and offending behavior via decreases in prosocial exposures and increases in deviant peer associations. Findings suggest policy makers should consider alternatives to school suspension where possible to avoid collateral consequences like reductions in prosocial exposures and deviant peer associations and should consider applying restorative approaches following a suspension experience to reintegrate youth into prosocial communities.

T1  - The Affective Foundation of Political Opinion Expression on Social Media: A Panel Analysis
AN  - 2518670685
AB  - Social media (SM) allow citizens to not only read news but also express their political opinions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal and affective intelligence theory, this study investigated the affective foundation of political opinion expression on social media (POESM) using two-wave panel data. The results indicate that enthusiasm and anger stimulated POESM but only for individuals with a minimum threshold motivation to use SM for political purposes. Among the politically motivated, anxiety increased POESM for individuals with low political knowledge but lessened POESM for ones with high political knowledge. Thus, emotional states can be powerful drivers of POESM. In contexts with low levels of POESM, emotions may stimulate online discussion as well as contribute to the further emotionalization of political debates.

T1  - Employment incongruity and gender among Middle Eastern and North African skilled migrants in Australia
AN  - 2520067268
AB  - We investigate ‘employment incongruity’ among skilled migrants from Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries – that is, whether the jobs they achieve in Australia match the jobs they expect to be doing after they arrive or not – along with the factors that shape outcomes and the gendered dimensions of these outcomes. We analyse data collected from qualitative interviews with 15 females and eight male skilled MENA migrants, a median of seven years after arrival and apply an intersectionality lens and consider influences at the macro, meso and micro level that affect the power of female MENA migrants and shape their employment outcomes. We identify that what appears to shape employment incongruity are: organisational practices regarding recognition of overseas qualifications and demands for ‘local experience’; norms supporting discriminatory behaviour; the difficulties skilled MENA migrants have with accessing networks; and intra-family cultural norms. These findings are significant for current and future skilled MENA migrants, with the employment outcomes of most of the participants in this study revealing a mismatch between government immigration policies and organisational practices.

T1  - Protestors’ Emotional Work in Contexts of Marginalisation: The Emancipation of “Forced Migrants” in Germany
AN  - 2498140389
AB  - This article explores the relation between migrants’ political subjectivity and the emotional dimension of protest. Although a vast literature analyses these dimensions, few studies have explored how social movements aim to trigger processes of political subjectivity formation and emotional transformations in contexts in which activists face marginalisation. I propose to analyse the effects of such a context through the focus on a movement mobilising against the exclusion of migrants in Germany. I show how activists strategically construct a political subjectivity based on the “forced migration” and “resistance” framework and aim to trigger feelings of emancipation among participants. At a more general level, I explore the transformative dimension of protest through the analysis of how activists strategically aim to transform negative and deactivating emotions (isolation, humiliation, and fear) into positive and activating emotions (loyalty, determination, and pride) in the course of collective action.

T1  - THE PERPETUATION OF STEREOTYPES IN CROATIAN PUBLIC DISCOURSE: "AUTISTIC" AS A PEJORATIVE
AN  - 2620030953
AB  - The way people are spoken or written about has a critical role in how they are perceived, and this in turn influences how they are positioned within a society – belonging to its core, the majority, or being relegated to the margins, the minor[1]ity. Various authors have reflected on the role of language in dehumanizing, oppressing, and discriminating certain groups, be it the Jewish citizens during the Nazi regime in Germany, the Tutsi in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, black people in the United States since 1619, women throughout history, or gay and disabled people today, to name a few marginalized groups. In these and other cases, language was the first step in the othering and, consequently, the marginalization of a certain group. The aim of this paper is to explore the language of marginalization in Croatian public discourse, looking at how media workers and public figures contribute to stereotyping people with autism by using the words "autistic" and "autistically" as pejoratives. For this purpose, I analyzed one of the most visited newspaper websites in Croatia in relation to how these words are used. I found that journalists, writers, and politicians use "autistic" and "autistically" as pejora[1]tives when they want to say that an individual, an institution, or a state is "out of touch with reality", "self-centered", "unresponsive". In addition, "autistic" and "autistically" are often used with the intent to insult, thus further imbuing these words with negative connotations. I conclude that raising awareness is needed among media workers and public figures so that they recognize the danger of stereotyping people with autism through the pejorative use of the words "au[1]tistic" and "autistically".

T1  - Performing Hybridity or Deflecting Islamophobia? Adaptable Identity Management amongst Young British Pakistani Muslims
AN  - 2612834823
AB  - This article engages with issues of identity construction and maintenance as expressed by a group of young British Pakistanis living in the North-West of England. Drawing on primary data from a qualitative study, we examine the ways in which Muslim identities are maintained, negotiated, and protected in relation to everyday situated cultural experiences. Nested within a context in which Islamophobia is pervasive, we discuss four salient processes of identity management articulated by participants: cherry picking; strategic adaption; ambassadorship and active resistance. Whilst these processes are to be considered as porous rather than mutually exclusive, our analysis elucidates evidence of both nimble and creative individual identity management and also an entrenchment of collective pride. We posit that, for the participants in this study, such practices constitute a grounded, pragmatic response to living in an environment in which their religious beliefs, political values and cultural commitments are frequently questioned within public life, the media and the political sphere.

T1  - Constructed Attitudes toward the Roma: A French Case
AN  - 2492561893
AB  - Forty per cent of Europeans refuse to have Roma as their neighbours, while 80 per cent of these do not even have direct contact with them. Using these statistics as a point of departure, this study analyzes how attitudes toward Roma are constructed. It proposes to investigate this process in two similar environments but where local integration policies directed toward Roma differ, resulting in disparate forms of intergroup contact. The analysis is premised on two theoretical assumptions: that the integration of migrants is a local public policy issue and that intergroup contact frames attitudes between majority and minority groups. From semi-structured interviews in the French municipalities of La Courneuve and Ivry-sur-Seine, four theories are empirically tested: the contact theory, the halo effect, the impact of local immigrant integration policies and media influence. This study demonstrates that the implementation of municipal policies in favour of Roma integration can improve their living conditions and thus deconstruct prejudices attributable to their precarious situation. In addition, it illustrates how the media activate, maintain or solidify the way Roma are perceived.

T1  - Snowballing or wilting? What affects public support for varying models of basic income?
AN  - 2592964484
AB  - Recently, the idea of a universal basic income has received unprecedented attention from policymakers, the media and the wider public. This has inspired a plethora of surveys that seek to measure the extent of public support for the policy, many of which suggest basic income is surprisingly popular. However, in a review of past surveys, with a focus on the UK and Finland, we find that overall levels of support for basic income can vary considerably. We highlight the importance of survey design and, by employing new survey data in each country, compare the levels and determinants of support for varied models of basic income. Our results point to the importance of the multi-dimensionality of basic income and the fragility of public support for the idea. The findings suggest that the ability of political actors to mobilise the public in favour of basic income will eventually depend on the precise model they wish to implement.

T1  - Confidence in political leaders can slant risk perceptions of COVID–19 in a highly polarized environment
AN  - 2476854782
AB  - The COVID-19 virus poses an unprecedented level of risk to the health and well-being of the entire global population. As of the writing of this article (June 2020), the United States has the largest number of confirmed cases with more than 2 million and there are over 120,000 deaths (Johns Hopkins University). This public health crisis has since led to cascading effects such as a rapidly rising unemployment rate, deteriorating mental health (Ammerman et al., 2020), and disturbed stock market (Baker et al., 2020) among others. By several accounts, the U.S. government's response to this pandemic is judged to be inadequate (Science, 2020). Because this coronavirus is novel, its full impact on the human population remains unknown. It represents a classic case of an unknown and dreadful risk that can generate heightened societal risk perceptions (Slovic, 1987). Under a great number of uncertainties surrounding this novel coronavirus, the American public has to rely on various authorities such as political leaders, governments, the media, and scientists for information about this disease. President Trump, to his credit, frequently communicates with the public about the evolving situation through the White House daily briefings. Key members of the coronavirus task force including its chair Vice President Mike Pence often appear on the side of the President. The public indeed shows a substantial level of confidence in officials at the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), and state and local elected officials (Pew Research Center, 2020 a). The public evaluations for President Trump and the news media handling the coronavirus outbreak tend to be divided along a party-line (Pew Research Center, 2020 a). The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have become a politicized issue in this highly polarized political environment, along with a long list of issues such as immigration, abortions, and climate change. Confronted with the historical challenges posed by COVID-19, how the American public perceives such risks warrants close investigation. Our overarching question is how does confidence in political leaders shape American public risk perceptions of COVID-19? Numerous studies have shown the link between risk perception and risk mitigation behaviors (Huang et al., 2012; Shao et al., 2017a, 2017b). Heightened risk perceptions are conducive to the adoption of risk mitigation behaviors. In this study, we aim to examine how confidence in national political leaders, attitudes towards the media, along with socio-demographic characteristics and political predisposition influence American public risk perceptions of COVID-19. Further, we attempt to examine how confidence in national political leaders can slant risk perceptions of COVID-19 among different segments of the population, especially people with different political ideologies. We analyze a national sample of respondents to a survey conducted in early March, approximately two months after the first reported COVID-19 case in the U.S. on January 21. Results of this study can shed light on the formation of risk perceptions of this ongoing public health crisis. Furthermore, the results are believed to provide useful insights to policymakers.

T1  - The segregated gun as an indicator of racism and representations in film
AN  - 2489910508
AB  - Film emphasizes an ironic history of racism in gun control and ownership and a justification for seeking justice among the Black community, but film also perpetuates structural racism and bias, segregating Black from White, and failing to promote equality, solidarity, and progress. The gun is both a symbol of structural racism, and an expression through which critical attitudes and political statements can carry greater meaning and lead to positive action, empowerment, and desegregation. The symbolic meaning of guns in the hands of Blacks as violent, exceptional or some other stereotypical character trope is illustrated using three selected films including: Django Unchained, John Q., and Proud Mary. This paper is divided into three acts: Act I: The gun as symbol of structural racism in film; Act II: Stereotypical characters and their guns; Act III: Desegregation of the gun in film. These sections illustrate the meaning and representation of the gun as a theatrical object in film, and when in the hands of stereotypical character tropes, has perpetuated racist beliefs and attitudes that have not been adequately addressed in the film industry. To desegregate the gun in film, filmmakers need to critically examine the overt and hidden film texts and how the gun, and the characters wielding it, are perceived among audiences.

T1  - Relative deprivation: A mechanism for the ostracism–aggression link
AN  - 2369760354
AB  - In five studies, we tested whether ostracism triggers feelings of relative deprivation and whether relative deprivation accounts for the impact of ostracism on aggression. Relative to participants who recalled either inclusive or neutral experiences, participants who recalled ostracism experiences reported higher levels of relative deprivation (Study 1). Furthermore, the feeling of relative deprivation mediated the effect of ostracism on aggression (Studies 2, 3a, and 3b). Framing ostracism as an experience of nondeprivation weakened the connection between ostracism and aggression (Study 4), which suggests an effective way of reducing aggression following an ostracism experience. Together, these findings highlight the significance of relative deprivation in shaping people's responses toward ostracism.

T1  - Surveillance in Practice: Operators' Collective Interpretation of CCTV Images
AN  - 2454694731
AB  - CCTV surveillance is a cultural practice and collective effort. CCTV not only involves a technical assemblage that is used to discipline the surveilled, it is also a social assemblage in which the informal practices of operators play a major role in the multiple interpretations of images. This paper provides insights into the daily work practices and discourses of CCTV operators and their supervisors through observations of and interviews in the control room of public CCTV surveillance in Rotterdam. By providing a better understanding of the role of people in socio-technical assemblages, this paper contributes to the discussion on human mediation in computerized networks. The paper contributes to the expanding literature on surveillance as a cultural practice by combining insights on social sorting with insights on collective evaluation of unfolding situations-i.e., how group dynamics within the control room influence how people are "judged." Building on Goffman's frame analysis, the paper reveals the crucial role of talk and humor in re-performing what happens on the streets as well as evaluating situations and the people watched. Moreover, it discusses how these collective re-performances of what is being watched both reproduce and reshape "othering" practices within the control room. The paper shows how humorous utterances play an important part in overcoming hierarchy and collectively managing emotions, and explores how this humor influences profiling on the basis of bodily appearance.

T1  - Marginalized Identity Invocation Online: The Case of President Donald Trump on Twitter
AN  - 2385917961
AB  - Political communication about marginalized groups takes many forms, but none are more influential in the present moment than those that circulate via social media. This article takes two steps to better understand this important form of communication. First, it offers a four-part conceptual framework for studying marginalized identity invocation. It then pairs quantitative content analysis with critical/cultural analysis to examine the census of Donald Trump’s tweets during his first two years as president. Focusing especially on tonal variation in Trump’s tweets about different marginalized groups, we situate our findings in relation to the noteworthy power dynamics inherent in this variety of communication.

T1  - Economic conditions, group relative deprivation and ethnic threat perceptions: a cross-national perspective
AN  - 2376776340
AB  - Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.

T1  - Varieties of Neoliberalism in Brazil (2003–2019)
AN  - 2335988069
AB  - The main feature of capital accumulation in Brazil during the administrations led by Luís Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (Workers’ Party—PT) was the continuity of neoliberalism of two varieties: inclusive (2003–2006) and developmental (2006–2013). The PT’s attachment to neoliberalism was mitigated by the party’s (shifting) commitment to (mild) developmental outcomes, redistribution of income (at the margin), social inclusion (within narrow limits), and democratization of the state (bounded by the 1988 Constitution). Achievements in these areas were further constrained by the inability or unwillingness of the PT to confront the institutionalization of neoliberalism in the fields of economics, politics, ideology, the media, and class relations. The political crisis unfolding in Brazil since 2013 and the imposition of authoritarian neoliberalism after Rousseff’s impeachment can be examined from the perspective of the contradictions in the dominant varieties of neoliberalism under the PT and the limitations of the party’s political ambitions.Alternate abstract:A principal característica da acumulação de capital no Brasil durante os governos ûiderados por Luís Inácio Lula da Silva e Dilma Rousseff do Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) foi a continuidade do neoliberalismo de duas variedades: inclusiva (2003–2006) e desenvolvimentista (2006–2013). O apego do PT ao neoliberalismo foi mitigado pelo compromisso (inconstante) do partido com resultados de desenvolvimento (moderados), redistribuição de renda (na margem), inclusão social (dentro de limites estreitos) e democratização do estado (limitado pela Constituição de 1988). As realizações nessas áreas foram ainda mais limitadas pela incapacidade ou falta de vontade do PT em enfrentar a institucionalização do neoliberalismo nos campos da economia, política, ideologia, mídia e relações de classe. A crise política que se desenrola no Brasil desde 2013 e a imposição do neoliberalismo autoritário após o impeachment de Dilma podem ser examinadas sob a perspectiva das contradições nas variedades dominantes de neoliberalismo sob o PT e as limitações das ambições políticas do partido.

T1  - #(Me)too much? The role of sexualizing online media in adolescents' resistance towards the metoo-movement and acceptance of rape myths
AN  - 2358484178
AB  - Introduction The current study addresses how sexualizing online media practices, i.e., exposure to sexually explicit internet material and receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, relate to the acceptance of sexist attitudes among adolescents. Specifically, it extends previous research on the acceptance of rape myths by exploring a construct related to these beliefs, i.e., resistance towards the metoo-movement. Methods The study is based on a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey among 568 Flemish adolescents (15–18 years old, Mage = 16.4, SD = .98, 58.3% girls) that measured adolescents' sexualizing online media use, sexist attitudes and objectification processes. Results The results showed that exposure to sexually explicit internet material, but not receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, was related to more resistance towards the metoo-movement and the acceptance of rape myths through notions of women as sex objects. Self-objectification did not function as a valid mediator in the examined relations. Gender and self-esteem did not moderate the proposed relations. Conclusions The findings underline the role of media use in how adolescents develop sexist beliefs and, more precisely, beliefs about contemporary actions to combat sexism, i.e., the metoo-movement. The present study showed that sexual objectification fueled by sexually explicit internet material may result in less positive attitudes and, thus, more resistance towards this movement.

T1  - Dehumanization of dirty workers and attitudes toward social support
AN  - 2319730213
AB  - In lay perception, dirty work is a type of labor that degrades human dignity. Work can be perceived as dirty on three bases: social (related to the subordinate position or associated with contact with stigmatized people), physical (related to direct contact with garbage and waste), and moral (related to jobs considered sinful, dubious, or defying social norms). “Dirty” stigma makes workers objects of dehumanization and discrimination, in particular, people distance themselves from dirty workers and are not ready to help and support them. In the experimental study (N = 340), we investigated how certain types of dirty workers are dehumanized compared to nondirty workers and the indirect effect of the type of dirty work on attitudes toward the social support of dirty workers via animalistic (attribution of uniquely human traits) and the mechanistic (attribution of human nature traits) dehumanization. The results show that individuals are willing to offer more social support to a low status but not dirty worker rather than to social or moral dirty workers. At the same time, less social support is provided to nondirty than to physical dirty worker. Animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization mediates the relationship between the types of dirty work and the attitudes toward social support. In particular, less dehumanization leads to more positive attitudes toward social support. The limitations and future directions of the obtained results are discussed.

T1  - Inspecting Mental Health: Depression, Surveillance and Care in Kerala, South India
AN  - 2315324189
AB  - Depression has become a major public health concern in Kerala, South India. Media and mental health professionals often attribute the rise of depression and suicide to a discontent around modern transformations and the flipside of the “Kerala model of development”. Kerala’s primary health care system of health governance, surveillance and care with its backbone of community and multi-purpose health workers is currently being expanded to target inner feelings, emotional suffering and existential despair, as a result of complex global, national and local processes of making visible and stabilizing depression as a public health category. Rather than relying on NGOs and foreign funding, mental health policy planners in Kerala engage the state of Kerala. Using the case of a junior health inspector’s counseling, I argue that the reconfiguration of suffering from an existential part of life and symptom of adversity into a medical condition can also lead to mobilization of (gendered) care in a context of familial marginalization and neglect. In this context, individual bodies are healed by restoring social bodies. Medicalization does not necessarily silence social inequalities and marginalization but can become productive in providing an idiom to critique a family’s moral economy.

T1  - The Supermodel Astronaut Challenge: traversing frames of mind
TT  - The SMA Challenge
AN  - 2305721701
AB  - PurposeThe Supermodel Astronaut (SMA) Challenge began with a group of women in a graduate class who joined together to take the pledge “I Am Enough.” The goals of the pledge are to practice positive affirmative actions of self-acceptance, self-grace, self-improvement and positive encouragement of oneself and others. The paper aims to discuss this issue.Design/methodology/approachThe SMA Challenge involves an online video pledge to encourage women and girls to demonstrate their opposition to the promotion of singular ideals of body perpetuated through media. Various individuals and groups have created music videos titled SMA to the soundtrack created by Ellen Tift (the originator of the project).FindingsHere, framed by Daignault’s (1983) theories on curriculum construction, the authors critically reflect on their support of the idea of the video, but also their apprehension and insecurities in participating in the video production.Originality/valueFrom reflections, writings and dialogic discussions, they determined five embodied frames of mind that supported them in traversing the liminal space of new learning: imagining the possible, learning in doing, settling in vulnerability, journeying through empowerment and heightening self-reflection.

T1  - Politics, concern for future generations, and the environment: Generativity mediates political conservatism and environmental attitudes
AN  - 2303012466
AB  - Climate change and pollution impact those alive today as well as future generations, suggesting that attitudes toward future generations may be linked with environmental attitudes. Despite the widespread impact of the environmental on human lives, there is considerable partisan divide in the United States with regards to environmental issues. We investigated relationships between political conservatism, generativity, and environmental attitudes in two studies (N = 429 and N = 618). Political conservatism was associated with lower pro‐environmental attitudes; however, political conservatism was also associated with higher generativity and had a positive indirect effect on pro‐environmental attitudes through higher generativity. More politically conservative individuals may have greater concern for future life and thereby have more pro‐environmental attitudes even while having lower pro‐environmental attitudes overall. These results likely reflect partisan polarization with regard to environmental issues. Pro‐environmental messages may be more persuasive for conservatives if they are linked to concerns about future generations.

T1  - A Crisis of Competence: Benevolent Sexism Affects Evaluations of Women’s Competence
AN  - 2174080475
AB  - People higher in benevolent sexism often outwardly endorse gender equality, but support men over women for challenging positions and experiences. Reflecting shifting standards (a tendency to evaluate stereotyped group members against within-category judgment standards), people higher in sexism may evaluate prominent women’s competence against a lower competency standard for women (who are stereotyped as less competent than men are), and not against a standard for men. Thus prominent women could be perceived as especially competent (versus other women), yet men might still garner ultimate support. Study 1 tested for this possibility using an ecologically valid example: the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Study 1 showed that benevolent (and not hostile) sexism predicted less opposition to Donald Trump’s candidacy and more positive attitudes toward the election outcome among 57 mostly female U.S. college students. Study 1 also showed that benevolent sexism positively predicted competence perceived in Hillary Clinton. To determine if this positive relationship reflected shifting standards, we manipulated the gender to which a prominent woman would be compared in Study 2 with 189 U.S. adults. Reflecting shifting standards, benevolent sexism related to evaluating women as more competent when they were evaluated against other women versus other men. Shifting standards also mediated a relationship between benevolent sexism and expecting lower female success. Using shifting standards may be one way that people higher in benevolent sexism might evaluate prominent women as especially competent, yet ultimately support men.

T1  - Extremists on the Left and Right Use Angry, Negative Language
AN  - 2249480460
AB  - We propose that political extremists use more negative language than moderates. Previous research found that conservatives report feeling happier than liberals and yet liberals “display greater happiness” in their language than do conservatives. However, some of the previous studies relied on questionable measures of political orientation and affective language, and no studies have examined whether political orientation and affective language are nonlinearly related. Revisiting the same contexts (Twitter, U.S. Congress), and adding three new ones (political organizations, news media, crowdsourced Americans), we found that the language of liberal and conservative extremists was more negative and angry in its emotional tone than that of moderates. Contrary to previous research, we found that liberal extremists’ language was more negative than that of conservative extremists. Additional analyses supported the explanation that extremists feel threatened by the activities of political rivals, and their angry, negative language represents efforts to communicate as much to others.

AB  - Although invisibility has historically provided a degree of protection, Lesbian, Gay, Bi-, Trans-, Queer and Intersexuals need to materialize publicly as a group to successfully advocate for their rights. Decades of systematic exclusion of the community from traditional discourse-producing sites, such as media and physical spaces, could potentially render self-controlled digital spaces an attractive alternative for human rights advocacy and self-representation. The following article explores to what degree the Ugandan sexual minority community utilizes the microblogging platform Twitter’s inbuilt affordance of self-controlled visibility to counter and challenge pervasive homophobic discourses. Through a qualitative content analysis of a purposeful sample of tweets generated by the main sexual minority network (Sexual Minorities Uganda [SMUG]), during the latest general election, the study finds that the affordance of controlled visibility is not consistently exploited for disseminating alternative narratives to external audiences, but rather chooses to highlight the agency of SMUG and its network members.

T1  - Post-trauma: healthcare practitioners use social media during times of political tension
AN  - 2213063644
AB  - The approach of context collapse and the notion of unintentional context collisions are of importance to scholars of social media. Israeli public hospitals are a particularly suitable venue for studying these topics, as they employ both Jewish and Arab practitioners, who care for both Jewish and Arab patients amid an ongoing violent conflict. In-depth interviews were conducted with 50 managers and healthcare practitioners (physicians and nurses), both Jewish and Arab, employed at 11 public hospitals in Israel. We found that despite hospitals managements' instructions to avoid political discourse, it erupts nonetheless whenever the conflict escalates. Fearing damage to professional relations and care of patients, political discourse spills over into social media, where political opinions are expressed mostly by Arab practitioners and stereotypical attitudes against Arabs are expressed mostly by Jewish ones. Our study exemplifies the usefulness of the context collapse approach-and specifically unintentional context collisions-to work organizations and all the more so to healthcare organizations.

T1  - Screened Anxieties: Affect and Temporality in <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>
AN  - 2577067988
AB  - This essay examines attitudes toward the future in D. W. Griffith's film  The Birth of a Nation , focusing in particular on the opposed emotions hope and fear. In doing so, it establishes critical connections between the film's aesthetic philosophy – which is marked by an attempt to control its characters, its audience, and even history itself – and the film's troubling and much-discussed racial politics. Griffith's stated beliefs in the ability of cinema to fully capture the past and in turn to dictate to its audience the terms of the future, manifest themselves everywhere in  The Birth of a Nation not only thematically but formally. However, the film sets an impossible task for itself, and where it falls short, its own hopes and fears become dramatically visible. This failure indicates that  The Birth of a Nation is ultimately imbricated in the modernist episteme of uncertainty it works to deny and disavow.

T1  - Was There a “Simple Soviet” Person? Debating the Politics and Sociology of “Homo Sovieticus”
AN  - 2297900617
AB  - Intellectual efforts to understand post-Crimean Russian society have brought to prominence explanations that emphasize psychological and attitudinal legacies of Soviet society. The recent revival of the term homo sovieticus (or Soviet man) in the media and intellectual discourse is a good illustration of this trend. Yurii Levada's late-Soviet sociological research project on the “simple Soviet man” serves as a frequent reference point in these discussions. In this article, I explore the ideological and analytical foundations of the Levada project and juxtapose the sociological construct developed by Levada and his team with the interpretative approach developed by Natalya Kozlova, another Soviet scholar who dedicated her life to studying Soviet society. I argue that essentialist and deterministic views of individual personality underpinning the Levada project that guide the current use of the Soviet man category are more politically and ideologically driven rather than being based on the state of the art in social psychology.

T1  - Everyday practices and the (un)making of ‘Fortress Europe’: Introduction to the special issue
AN  - 2205315222
AB  - The borders of Europe are erected and guarded through cultural practices as much as through border control and security technologies. Cultural Studies have been crucial in revealing how everyday, particularly media-oriented practices, make and unmake this ‘Fortress’. Yet, until now, the focus has been mostly on how migrants use or are represented through media discourses and technologies. This introduction essay argues that the signifier ‘Fortress Europe’—and its central premise of restraining mobility for some in order to enable freedom for others—also gains meaning in and through socio-cultural practices that we may not (as) immediately associate with the physical crossing of European borders. Particular practices that are discussed in this introduction and examined in the seven original articles of the special issue are: public opinion research, the public mobilization of emotions, negotiating identity in an ‘ancestral homeland’, the consumption of (sports) media, the production of a radio talk show and film archives, as well as the activist use of social media. Broadening scholarly attention to these kinds of sociocultural practices provides an important addition to understanding how power operates across social spheres and discursive orders. In addition, their identification also offers valuable opportunities to understand how and why some practices are particularly pertinent or effective in cementing or destabilizing Fortress Europe. This line of inquiry is visible throughout this special issue, despite the diversity of theoretical frameworks and empirical sites used in the contributing articles.

T1  - Inclusion and exclusion in the digital economy: disability and mental health as a live streamer on Twitch.tv
AN  - 2166489185
AB  - In this paper I explore economic and inclusion opportunities for people with disabilities and mental health issues afforded by 'live streaming' - the live broadcast of one's activities over the internet to a globally dispersed audience. In both 2016 and 2017, the leading live streaming platform Twitch.tv broadcast over 500,000 years of video, which were produced by over two million regular broadcasters ('streamers'), and consumed by an audience of several hundred million viewers. Streamers can profit, up to and including a full-time living 'wage' for those at the highest levels. Numerous successful streamers with chronic health issues have discussed the personal and professional benefits streaming brings them. Utilising data from a research project with 100 interviews, alongside approximately 500 hours of ethnographic observation, this paper examines the experiences of live streaming for broadcasters with disabilities, mental health issues, or physical health issues. Firstly, I explore the positive elements of streaming for these broadcasters, focusing on the many conditions represented in this demographic, and the benefits streaming gives for inclusion and community. Secondly, I consider the negative experiences of these streamers, focused on entanglements of health and technology that make their streaming lives potentially more challenging than their colleagues. Thirdly, I focus on the economic opportunities, and the potential for entrepreneurial activity, the platform affords. I conclude the analysis by exploring how these aspects make live streaming a potentially exemplary emancipatory and entrepreneurial space for these individuals, but not one without challenges.

T1  - Attitudes toward Same-Sex Marriage and Parenting, Ideologies, and Social Contacts: the Mediation Role of Sexual Prejudice Moderated by Gender
AN  - 2033531692
AB  - Recognition of same-sex marriage and parenting has increased in the last two decades but remains a controversial issue in which public opinion plays a role, as it can influence political leaders but also determine the immediate environment of same-sex families. The literature highlights the effect of religiosity, political orientation, beliefs about etiology of homosexuality, and social contacts with gay men and lesbians on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and parenting (ASSMP). The aim of this study was to explore the under-studied mediation role of sexual prejudice in this process and how participants’ gender moderated the mediation effects. Data were collected from 1416 heterosexual French students and analyzed with moderated mediation models in accordance with recent recommendations from Hayes (2013). Sexual prejudice mediated the effects of religiosity, political orientation, and etiological beliefs on ASSMP more strongly in men than in women. It also mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons and same-sex couples on ASSMP in men but not in women. The results highlight the need to explicitly deconstruct negative beliefs about homosexuality during debates about same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting, even when prejudice against homosexuality itself is not explicit in opponents’ discourse.

T1  - Socioeconomic inequalities in survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia insured by social security in Mexico: a study of the 2007–2009 cohorts
AN  - 2193663307
AB  - Background 
Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 5 years survival in minors has reached 90%, socioeconomic differences have been reported among and within countries. Within countries, the difference has been related to the socioeconomic status of the parents, even in the context of public health services with universal coverage. In Mexico, differences in the mortality of children with cancer have been reported among sociodemographic zones. The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), the country’s main social security institution, has reported socioeconomic differences in life expectancy within its affiliated population. Here, the socioeconomic inequalities in the survival of children (< 15 years old) enrolled in the IMSS were analyzed.
 Methods 
Five-year survival data were analyzed in cohorts of patients diagnosed with ALL during the period 2007–2009 in the two IMSS networks of medical services that serve 7 states of the central region of Mexico. A Cox proportional risk model was developed and adjusted for the socioeconomic characteristics of family, community of residence and for the clinical characteristics of the children. The slope of socioeconomic inequality of the probability of dying within five years after the diagnosis of ALL was estimated.
 Results 
For the 294 patients studied, the 5 years survival rate was 53.7%; the median survival was 4.06 years (4.9 years for standard-risk diagnosis; 2.5 years for high-risk diagnosis). The attrition rate was 12%. The Cox model showed that children who had been IMSS-insured for less than half their lives had more than double the risk of dying than those who had been insured for their entire lives.
 Conclusions 
We did not find evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in the survival of children with ALL associated with family income, educational and occupational level of parents. However, we found a relevant gradient related social security protection: the longer children’s life insured by social security, the higher their probability of surviving ALL was. These results add evidence of the effectiveness of social security, as a mechanism of wealth redistribution and a promoter of social mobility. Extending these social security benefits to the entire Mexican population could promote better health outcomes.

T1  - National identity and distrust in the police: The case of North West Wales
AN  - 2165984454
AB  - Trust in the police, as defined by perceived procedural fairness, just decisions and effectivity, may be impacted by deep political divisions among the population, especially where citizens adopt opposing national identities. In Europe, North West Wales is one such area. Nationalism is intensified by language issues (Welsh vs. English) and historical experiences of UK institutions. A sample of 207 residents living within the local authority of Gwynedd were asked to take part in the study. A questionnaire survey addressed how much trust in the police ultimately depends upon national identity as expressed by preference for the Welsh language, trust in UK institutions and attitudes towards political symbols. Other factors tested included personal experience of the police, the influence of news reports and police TV series, as well as the perceived effectiveness of the police in addressing crime. Trust in UK institutions, preference for the Welsh language and news reporting were found to have most influence on trust in the police.

T1  - Neodevelopmentalism and Dependency in Twenty-first-Century Argentina: Insights from the Work of Ruy Mauro Marini
AN  - 2154581470
AB  - For Ruy Mauro Marini, writing in the mid-1990s, neodevelopmentalism in Latin America ended with the moratoria on debt repayment in Mexico and Brazil in the early 1980s, which ushered in an era of International Monetary Fund control. For him this demonstrated the inability of the Latin American bourgeoisie to achieve autonomy at the international level. Neodevelopmentalism returned in early-twenty-first-century Argentina in the local context of a new class politics and a wider context marked by the emergence of China in the world economy and the influence of Chavismo. It consisted of an economic policy that consolidated the new hegemonic groups led by transnational capital through the superexploitation of labor and nature and the revival of the myth of development expressed by the notion of “growth with social inclusion.” For a time the project was characterized by high rates of profit and high levels of (albeit precarious) employment, but, as the global crisis of 2008 revealed its limitations and the “fine-tuning” of economic policy produced a decline of real incomes and consumption, it led to fragmentation of the political spectrum and a realignment of its principal actors. Mauricio Macri’s election to the presidency in 2015 represented a counterrevolution that, as Marini predicted decades ago, would involve more violent superexploitation and stronger imperialist influence.Alternate abstract:Para Ruy Mauro Marini, escribiendo a mediados de la década de 1990, el neodesarrollismo en América Latina terminó con la moratoria sobre el pago de la deuda en México y Brasil a principios de la década de 1980, lo que marcó el comienzo de una era de control del Fondo Monetario Internacional. Para él, esto demostró la incapacidad de la burguesía latinoamericana para lograr la autonomía a nivel internacional. El neodesarrollismo regresó en la Argentina de principios del siglo XXI en el contexto local de una nueva política de clase y un contexto más amplio marcado por el surgimiento de China en la economía mundial y la influencia del chavismo. Consistió en una política económica que consolidó los nuevos grupos hegemónicos liderados por el capital transnacional a través de la superexplotación del trabajo y la naturaleza y el renacimiento del mito del desarrollo expresado por la noción de “crecimiento con inclusión social.” Durante un tiempo el proyecto fue caracterizado por altas tasas de ganancia y altos niveles de empleo (aunque precario), pero, como la crisis global de 2008 reveló sus limitaciones y el “ajuste” de la política económica produjo una disminución de los ingresos reales y el consumo, condujo a la fragmentación del espectro político y una realineación de sus principales actores. La elección de Mauricio Macri a la presidencia en 2015 representó una contrarrevolución que, como predijo Marini décadas atrás, implicaría una superexplotación más violenta y una influencia imperialista más fuerte.

T1  - South Auckland Sikhs and Punjab Issues: Justice, Identity Work and Development
AN  - 2260418046
AB  - In South Auckland, New Zealand, we surveyed under three hundred Sikhs on how they used their internet-connected mobile phones to gather and share news on the 2019 Punjab elections. Survey participants identified "Punjab issues" as the main topic they communicated messages about on social media. Our paper explores the notion of "Punjab issues" in the context of Sikh social identity and habitus, or the circumstances and conditions of dayto- day existence for this migrant group. We examine how this habitus is underpinned by an interest in justice, which is based in deep historical memory and has persisted over time, as seen in the experiences of events such as the Partition of India in 1947 and the attack on the Golden Temple in 1984, and across space, as more Sikhs migrate from Punjab. Interwoven in the discussion is how the Sikh emphasis on justice fits with the United Nations' 16th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG16), which underlines that justice and strong institutions determine how well a state practices the social inclusion of minorities by recognising their rights to peace, security, and prosperity.

T1  - Silver screen sorting: Social identity and selective exposure in popular film viewing
AN  - 2178951653
AB  - While research in media and politics has long stressed the importance of television, the political impact of movies has largely been ignored. However, a small body of literature suggests that both political docudramas and popular films may have the capacity to change the issue attitudes of viewers. Building on that work, this paper examines the potential for selective exposure in movie viewership. We develop a theory that there is large-scale sorting into popular movies rooted in social identity theory. We argue that sorting is a result of two processes: film studios marketing films towards particular social groups and individuals sorting into films based on social group characteristics. We test this theory using a unique dataset in which undergraduate students were asked to rate trailers for a variety of political docudramas and popular films. Our results indicate that there is indeed widespread sorting into popular films on the basis of social identities rooted in socio-demographic traits.

T1  - Staying Tuned: LGBTQIA Politics in the Trump Era
AN  - 2138652444
AB  - Since Donald Trump took office in 2017, the White House has issued several clear anti-LGBTQIA signals and initiatives. Reflecting on Trump's election as U.S. president, many political scientists have analyzed his rise in the context of the literature on American political development (e.g., Skowronek 2017) and comparative governments (e.g., Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018). Some of this work has received significant media attention and attained a popular readership. The American political development analyses have often focused on the lens of political time and potential party realignment, exploring the possibility of a “disjunctive presidency,” which foretells the demise of the coalition that has enabled the Republican Party to dominate U.S. politics since the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. Comparative work in the discipline argues that Trump initiatives are threatening to democratic principles, portending a turn toward authoritarianism that parallels the rise of right-wing authoritarian leaders across the globe.

T1  - Cultural discourses and practices of institutionalised diversity in the UK film sector: ‘Just get something black made’
AN  - 2126710891
AB  - ‘Diversity’ is an evolving dimension of discursive debates within publicly funded parts of the UK media. This article considers how representations of racial diversity in cinema were articulated in a particular moment in recent history. It traces the relationship between the broader New Labour neoliberal agenda of the late 1990s and the UK Film Council’s (UKFC) New Cinema Fund, the key funding mechanism for supporting black British cinema at the time. The authors suggest that the New Cinema Fund’s ‘institutional diversity’ agenda represented a symbolic effort by both the UKFC and UK public service broadcasters to redevelop black British film vis-a-vis a plethora of cultural imperatives oriented around the notion of ‘social inclusion’. The nature of this intervention, it is argued, was strongly influenced by the 1999 Macpherson Report, which identified ‘institutional racism’ within the fabric of the UK’s organisations. The article examines how such an ‘institutional diversity’ agenda emerged within the production context of a BBC Film/UKFC production, Bullet Boy (2005), thus generating a rearticulated black British cinema that was deeply imbricated in the highly politicised contexts outlined.

T1  - Resisting dehumanization: citizen voices and acts of solidarity
AN  - 2099586905
AB  - Recent years have seen an increase in the influx of asylum-seekers in Scandinavia, and in Denmark this has led to ever-tighter immigration control. This article discusses emerging practices of refugee solidarity and resistance to migration policy in Danish civil society in the wake of what has been referred to as the European refugee crisis. To accomplish this purpose, I analyse how participants in Facebook discussions construe topoi and attitudes when facing the ethical dilemma of respecting the law versus showing concern for humans in need, in line with what Foucault (1983. The subject and Power. In H. Dreyfus & P. Rabinow (Eds.), Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics (pp. 208-226). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press) has referred to as 'ethical self-formation'. This is illustrated through a case study of an incident from September 2015, when a member of a Danish City Council offered private shelter to immigrants on their way to Norway. The incident led to legal proceedings in August 2016 for what the defendant referred to as 'the offense of helping fellow human beings in need'. The study is informed by Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, N. (2003). Analysing Discourse. Textual analysis for social research. London and New York: Routledge; Wodak, R. (2015). The politics of fear. London and New York: Sage) and governmentality theory (Foucault, M. (1983). The subject and Power. In H. Dreyfus & P. Rabinow (Eds.), Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics (pp. 208-226). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; Foucault, M. (2007). Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977-78. (G. Burchell, Trans.). New York: Palgrave Macmillan; McIlvenny, P., Klausen, J. Z., & Lindegaard, L. B. (2016). Studies of Discourse and Governmentality. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: Benjamins). Data include media representations and facebook comments published during 2016. The analytical approach combines topos analysis (Wodak, R., & Meyer, M. (Eds.). (2010). Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis. London: Sage; Wodak, R. (2015). The politics of fear. London and New York: Sage) and appraisal analysis to tease out evaluative meaning.

T1  - Fear of Missing Out as a Predictor of Problematic Social Media Use and Phubbing Behavior among Flemish Adolescents
AN  - 2126307754
AB  - Fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) refers to feelings of anxiety that arise from the realization that you may be missing out on rewarding experiences that others are having. FOMO can be identified as an intra-personal trait that drives people to stay up to date of what other people are doing, among others on social media platforms. Drawing from the findings of a large-scale survey study among 2663 Flemish teenagers, this study explores the relationships between FOMO, social media use, problematic social media use (PSMU) and phubbing behavior. In line with our expectations, FOMO was a positive predictor of both how frequently teenagers use several social media platforms and of how many platforms they actively use. FOMO was a stronger predictor of the use of social media platforms that are more private (e.g., Facebook, Snapchat) than platforms that are more public in nature (e.g., Twitter, Youtube). FOMO predicted phubbing behavior both directly and indirectly via its relationship with PSMU. These findings support extant research that points towards FOMO as a factor explaining teenagers’ social media use.

T1  - The role of group size in reactions to ostracism and inclusion: GPIR
AN  - 2109035393
AB  - Three experiments examined the effects of group size on reactions to ostracism and inclusion. Participants engaged in an online introduction activity with 2 or 6 other people and received likes from everyone (inclusion) or no one (ostracism). In Studies 1 and 2, group size had a significant effect on need satisfaction only when participants were ostracized, with larger groups threatening needs to a greater extent. These effects were evident during and immediately after the task, but not after a reflection period and delay. In Study 3, being ostracized by a larger group increased sadness and anger only when ostracism was public. Together, these results indicate that people react more negatively to ostracism by larger groups, but do not reap greater benefits in terms of need satisfaction or affect when included by larger groups. Implications for the ostracism literature and social media use are discussed.

T1  - Manufacturing marginality. (Un-)governing the night in Berlin
AN  - 2110231448
AB  - As the night-time economy gains relevance in discourses on Berlin's urban development, ‘the night' has become a contested term. Night-time use of public space is the object of growing public dissatisfaction, especially in certain areas of the borough Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. This paper looks at the governance arrangement that evolves in response to this problematization through the lens of one specific project. The so-called fair.kiez project gathered a broad coalition of state and non-state actors, local and citywide organizations to mediate use-conflicts regarding night-time noise, littering and unruly behavior in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Having evaluated the conception and implementation of this project, we suggest that this project is exemplary for a specific un-governing of recent conflicts between residents and economic interests in an entertainment and consumption-oriented city economy. The fair.kiez project reveals interlocking patterns of this (un-)governing, such as the manufacturing of a specific consent, the marginalization of the problem and a shift to symbolic policies. A horizontal governance arrangement is formed and public demands are answered, but ultimately the issue is rendered un-governable. In analyzing the un-governing of the night as an example for the process of de-politicization this paper contributes to debates on post-political urban governance.

T1  - Ostracized but why? Effects of attributions and empathy on connecting with the socially excluded
AN  - 2082632393
AB  - The present research examined people’s responses towards others’ exclusion experience. The authors predicted that both causal attributions and empathy would mediate whether people affiliate with a victim of an ambiguous exclusion experience. Perceivers observing another’s exclusion (relative to inclusion) without clearly announced reasons chose to affiliate with the target and this was mediated by increased external attributions for the exclusion (Studies 1a, 1b, 2). When the attributions people made for the exclusion of a target was experimentally manipulated, internal attributions decreased desire for affiliation relative to external or ambiguous attributions, and this was mediated by differences in empathy for the target (Study 3). Further, external attributions arisen from perceiving a causally unclear exclusion leads to an empathetic response which results in an increased desire to affiliate with the target (Study 4). Future directions on perceptions of those who have been excluded are discussed.

T1  - Toxic Talk: How Online Incivility Can Undermine Perceptions of Media
AN  - 2430088579
AB  - Scholars are increasingly concerned with the potential for uncivil discourse to enhance political polarization in society (Mutz, 2006; Stryker, 2011). Political elites and partisans boost levels of incivility in news media (Muddiman, 2013), and people perceive higher levels of incivility in politics when individuals rather than issues are attacked (Stryker, Conway, & Danielson, 2014). The concerns over incivility extend to the online information environment, where nasty comments can harm healthy back-and-forth dialogue central to democracy that often happens in spaces such as newspapers (Coe, Kenski, & Rains, 2014; Meltzer, 2015). Early research shows that incivility in online comments can be a polarizing factor in how people perceive issues in media, particularly for individuals who hold stronger opinions before seeing the comments (Anderson, Brossard, Scheufele, Xenos, & Ladwig, 2014). In particular, incivility has been found to affect people’s perceptions of the content covered in news articles, a phenomenon dubbed the “nasty effect” (Anderson et al., 2014). It can also increase the perception that individuals in society hold polarized attitudes (Hwang, Kim, & Huh, 2014). Yet, we still do not fully understand how incivility in comments affects perceptions of the news stories themselves or the effect it can have on lines of political polarity in society. Here, we explore the effects of uncivil comments proximate to a blog post containing hard news content on individuals’ perceptions of media. We examine these effects across two controversial scientific issues—nuclear energy and nanotechnology—on perceptions of bias of the news blog post. We also examine how political ideologies are related to how people interpret incivility in online comments as it relates to perceptions of bias. In doing so, this study contributes to understanding of the polarizing nature of incivility. While this is a common concern in the literature, few have empirically tested whether online incivility heightens existing divisions in society. We find that perceptions of bias are greatest after seeing online incivility among politically conservative ideologues, providing evidence for the polarity of incivility in online comments.

T1  - An Examination of the Psychology of Working Theory With Racially and Ethnically Diverse Employed Adults
AN  - 2090265067
AB  - The present study tested key tenets of the Psychology of Working Theory (PWT) in a sample of 526 racially and ethnically diverse employed adults. The authors investigated how economic resources and marginalization predicted decent work through experiences of work volition and career adaptability. Support for the hypotheses was mixed. There was a direct, negative relation between marginalization and decent work; a direct, positive relation between economic resources and work volition; and a direct, negative relation between marginalization and work volition. There was a positive relation between work volition and career adaptability as well as with decent work. Work volition was also found to significantly mediate the relations between marginalization and economic resources to decent work. These results suggest that the primary reason why greater economic resources and lower experiences of marginalization predict engaging in decent work is attributable to an increased sense of choice in one’s career decision making. Results suggest the need for further investigation using the PWT to understand how racially and ethnically diverse employed adults secure decent work. Practical implications are discussed.

T1  - The social organization of workplace mental health: local and translocal ruling relations
AN  - 2036422901
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to make visible the ways in which peoples’ experiences of mental ill health are coordinated and produced in the workplace setting.Design/methodology/approachThis institutional ethnography draws from data collected from 16 informants in one Canadian industrial manufacturing plant to explicate how texts organize activities and align worker consciousness and actions with company expectations of a “bona fide” illness.FindingsThe findings demonstrate how a “bona fide” illness is textually mediated by biomedical and physical work restrictions, thus creating a significant disjuncture between an experiential and ruling perspective of mental ill health.Research limitations/implicationsThe work of employees living with self-reported depression becomes organized locally and translocally around the discourse of “mental illness is an illness like any other.” This presents a profound disjuncture between the embodied experience of being too unwell to mentally perform work duties, and the textually coordinated practices of what it means to access sick time for a “bona fide illness” within a biomedical-based attendance management protocol.Originality/valueThe current study adds to the literature by shedding light on the disjuncture created between the embodied experience of mental health issues and the ruling perspective of what constitutes a bona fide illness, adding a unique focus on how people’s use of attendance management-related supports in the workplace.

T1  - The ironic impact of intergroup apologies on intergroup attitudes: Understanding the role of perceived power for post‐apology outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2084437556
AB  - The present research investigates how intergroup apologies, defined as apologies between two groups, affect perceived remorse and outgroup attitudes (e.g., explicit and implicit), in the context of power asymmetries. We recruited participants from two countries that differ in perceived power: South Korea and the United States. Participants read a vignette describing a violent act committed by an outgroup member (Korean or American), with or without an intergroup apology. Participants answered questions assessing perceived remorse and explicit attitudes toward the outgroup, followed by the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Results revealed that Koreans perceived less remorse following an intergroup apology from the United States, compared to when they did not read an intergroup apology. Further, a mediated moderation analysis indicated that perceived remorse mediated the relationship between apology and explicit attitudes towards the United States. However, an analogous effect for implicit attitudes was only marginally significant. In contrast, among American participants, no effect of the apology on perceived remorse, explicit attitudes, or implicit attitudes and no evidence for a mediation was found. We discuss the implications of these effects on understanding the effectiveness of intergroup apologies between countries that differ in perceived power.

T1  - Self-interest and public opinion in health policy: smoking behavior and support for tobacco control
AN  - 1992156664
AB  - This study examines the influence of self-interest on attitudes about public health policy, specifically the influence of smoking on opposition to tobacco control measures. We analyze the relationships between being a current smoker, former smoker, or nonsmoker and support for cigarette taxes and anti-tobacco health education campaigns in order to reveal the extent to which the direct “pocketbook” self-interest of health-related behaviors, versus general sociotropic values, influence public health policy opinions. Using a sample of 442 adult participants in a statewide survey, binary logistic regression and proportional odds models compare respondents’ support for varying amounts and allocation levels of cigarette taxes, as well as anti-tobacco health education campaigns, controlling for smoking status and demographic variables. Results indicate that the connection between being a current smoker and being less supportive of cigarette taxes (a policy that directly affects self-interest) is not mediated when controlling for attitudes about anti-tobacco education campaigns (a policy that does not as directly affect self-interest). However, while former smokers do not support cigarette taxes as much as do nonsmokers, their support for taxes becomes indistinguishable from that of nonsmokers when their attitudes about anti-tobacco education campaigns are considered. We conclude that both direct self-interest and broader social values influence tobacco control policy attitudes. Smokers appear to consider their pocketbooks, but simultaneously both current and former smokers are ideologically motivated to oppose health initiatives. Thus, public health policymakers should highlight the importance of public education and social norms in garnering support for tobacco control policies.

T1  - Going to the dogs? Police, donations, and K9s
TT  - Going to the dogs
AN  - 2120775422
AB  - PurposeMost existing literature on K9 units has focused on the relationship between police handler and canine, or questions about use of force. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between private donations to public police departments, an increasingly accepted institutional practice in the policing world, and K9 units. Specifically, the authors examine rationales for sponsoring and financially supporting K9 units in Canada and the USA.Design/methodology/approachThe authors focus on four main themes that emerged in analysis of media articles, interview transcripts, and the results of freedom of information requests.FindingsThese four rationales or repertoires of discourse are: police dogs as heroes; dogs as crime fighters; cute K9s; and police dogs as uncontroversial donation recipients.Originality/valueAfter drawing attention to the expanding role of police foundations in these funding endeavors, the authors reflect on what these findings mean for understanding private sponsorship of public police as well as K9 units in North America and elsewhere. The authors draw attention to the possibility of perceived and actual corruption when private, corporate monies become the main channel through which K9 and other police units are funded.

T1  - "Ain't Nobody Got Time for That!": Framing and Stereotyping in Legacy and Social Media
AN  - 2108802019
AB  - Social media can be powerful tools for rallying support for a social cause, political mobilization, and social commentary. They can also greatly contribute to incendiary discourses and social stereotypes-often through memes. This article explores the case of one American, known by the moniker of "Sweet Brown," whose interview about a local fire made her an overnight celebrity in 2012. A frame analysis of her portrayals in legacy and social media is conducted, and reveals that social media platforms facilitate and even encourage a reductionist approach to messaging. Sweet Brown's appearance, which conjures gender, race, and socio-economic class, became a powerful tool for circulating stereotypes. The interplay between legacy and social media can serve to reproduce stereotypes and marginalization, as is evident in the case of Sweet Brown.Alternate abstract:Les médias sociaux peuvent étre un outil puissant servant a gagner des appuis pour des causes sociales, la mobilisation politique et des commentaires sociaux.

L'article comporte une analyse de cadre sur la maniere dont les médias traditionnels et sociaux ont dépeint Sweet Brown. Cette analyse suggere que les médias sociaux facilitent et méme encouragent une approche réductionniste. L'apparence de Sweet Brown, qui evoque le genre, la race et la classe socioéconomique, est devenue un outil puissant pour faire circuler des stéréotypes. Son cas montre que l'interaction entre médias traditionnels et médias sociaux peut contribuer a la reproduction de stéréotypes et a la marginalisation.

T1  - WHEN OLD MEETS NEW: AN ANALYSIS OF KOREAN TRADITIONAL NARRATIVE IN THE CONTEMPORARY REALITY TV SHOW INFINITE CHALLENGE
AN  - 1986318863
AB  - In an attempt to explore how local traditional narrative manifests in a globalized media format, we analyzed five aesthetic elements of Korean traditional performances in Infinite Challenge (Muhan tojon) in terms of the sinmyong narrative. In the Infinite Challenge show, the personae release pent-up energy through endless challenges, sustain positive attitudes towards life by wiping away tears through laughter, have fun with playful deception games or word play, act like childish fools (pabo) and pranksters (kondal) who indulge their unbound desires, and interact with participatory audiences in an open structure. Coupled with previous research confirming that traditional communication styles shape modes of expression in contemporary media content, we believe this study can provide empirical evidence to substantiate the creative potential of local traditional narrative in indigenizing global media programs.

T1  - The role of online social networks for divorced Saudi women in the face of social, psychological, economic, and legal challenges
AN  - 2009173824
AB  - This research examines the supporting role social networks provide to divorced Saudi women in the face of social, economic, psychological, and legal challenges. An online survey with open and closed ended questions was created to address the following research question: What support do online social networks provide to divorced Saudi women in contemporary Saudi Arabian society in the face of social, economic, psychological, and legal challenges?" The survey was completed online by 248 divorced Saudi women. Quantitative analysis of closed-ended survey responses was applied to the dataset followed by a qualitative thematic analysis of respondents' responses to open-ended questions. Survey findings identified the following areas of medium to high social network support experienced by divorced Saudi women: social outcast avoidance, relationship management with former husband, income assistance, emotional support, confidence building, and depression management. Findings also revealed areas where social networks provided only low levels of support with respect to social, economic, psychological, and legal challenges. The research contributes new insights into the supporting role of social networks for divorced Saudi women and their potential to leverage personal life and identity development in the face of social stigmatization and societal marginalization. This work advances research relevant to media studies, woman's studies, and cultural studies.

Thus, the paper concludes that with the advancement in the technology, one would wonder why Internet access cannot be free or as cheap as it is in other parts of the developing world.

AN  - 1980479285
AB  - Social protection is an essential condition for social and economic development for all, but particularly for those who experience poverty and social exclusion. Social protection programmes can play a crucial role in alleviating and preventing poverty and vulnerability to secure people's well-being. They can also enhance the productivity, employability and economic development of people by creating better income-earning opportunities for them. Moreover, social protection can foster social inclusion and participation by ensuring effective access to food, health care, education and support services. Thus, well-designed social protection programmes have the potential to directly improve the enjoyment of rights of persons with disabilities. Regrettably, traditional disability-welfare approaches have promoted the opposite, building and spreading charity and medical perspectives in social protection responses. As a result, for too long, many national social protection systems resulted in furthering paternalism, dependence, segregation and institutionalization of persons with disabilities, limiting their opportunities to live independently in their communities. The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities challenges these views, promoting social protection systems that are inclusive of persons with disabilities and which facilitate active citizenship, social inclusion and community participation. The Convention calls on States parties to ensure that persons with disabilities receive equal access to mainstream social protection programmes and services as well as access to specific programmes and services for disability-related needs and expenses such as support services. Against this background, this article aims to discuss why and how States and other stakeholders should ensure the establishment of disability-inclusive social protection systems, in conformity with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Alternate abstract:La protection sociale est indispensable pour que le développement social et économique profite à tous, en particulier aux populations confrontées à la pauvreté et à l’exclusion sociale. Les programmes de protection sociale peuvent jouer un rôle déterminant dans la réduction et la prévention de la pauvreté et de la précarité et favoriser ainsi le bien-être des populations. Ils peuvent également accroître la productivité et l’employabilité des individus et améliorer leur situation économique en leur offrant davantage de possibilités de se procurer un revenu. De surcroît, la protection sociale peut favoriser la participation et l’inclusion sociale en garantissant un accès effectif à l’alimentation, aux soins de santé, à l’éducation et à des services d’accompagnement. En conséquence, des programmes de protection sociale bien conçus sont susceptibles d’aider directement les personnes handicapées à mieux exercer leurs droits. Malheureusement, dans leur conception traditionnelle, les dispositifs de protection sociale en faveur des personnes handicapées suivent jusqu’à présent une orientation inverse, parce qu’ils privilégient les dimensions caritative et médicale. De ce fait, pendant trop longtemps, beaucoup de systèmes nationaux de protection sociale ont promu un traitement des personnes handicapées fondé sur le paternalisme, la dépendance, la ségrégation et l’institutionnalisation, limitant les possibilités qu’avaient ces personnes de mener une vie indépendante dans leur propre environnement. La Convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits des personnes handicapées remet cette vision en cause et cherche à promouvoir des systèmes de protection sociale qui favorisent l’intégration des personnes handicapées, promeuvent la citoyenneté active, l’inclusion sociale et la participation à la vie de la collectivité. La Convention appelle les Etats parties à garantir aux personnes handicapées l’égalité d’accès aux programmes et services de protection sociale destinés à l’ensemble de la population, ainsi qu’un accès à des programmes et services spécifiquement conçus en fonction des besoins et dépenses liés au handicap, par exemple des services d’accompagnement. Dans ce contexte, l’article examine pourquoi et comment les Etats et autres parties prenantes doivent veiller à la mise en place de systèmes de protection sociale favorisant l’intégration des personnes handicapées, conformément à la Convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits des personnes handicapées.Alternate abstract:La protección social es un requisito esencial para el desarrollo social y económico de todos, en particular para quienes padecen pobreza y exclusión social. Los programas de protección social pueden desempeñar un papel crucial en el alivio y la prevención de la pobreza y la vulnerabilidad de manera a garantizar el bienestar de las personas. Asimismo, pueden mejorar la productividad, la empleabilidad y el desarrollo económico de las personas mediante la creación de mejores oportunidades para obtener ingresos. Además, la protección social puede fomentar la inclusión y la participación social al garantizar un acceso efectivo a los alimentos, la atención de salud, la educación y los servicios de apoyo. Por lo tanto, los programas de protección social bien diseñados son capaces de mejorar directamente el ejercicio de los derechos de las personas con discapacidad. Lamentablemente, los enfoques tradicionales de bienestar y discapacidad promueven lo contrario, puesto que construyen y difunden caridad y perspectivas médicas en las respuestas de protección social. En consecuencia, durante demasiado tiempo, muchos sistemas nacionales de protección social promovieron el paternalismo, la dependencia, la segregación y la institucionalización de las personas con discapacidad, lo cual limitó las oportunidades de estas personas de vivir con independencia en sus comunidades. La Convención sobre los Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad de las Naciones Unidas cuestiona estos puntos de vista y promueve sistemas de protección social a favor de la inclusión de las personas con discapacidad que facilitan la ciudadanía activa, la inclusión social y la participación comunitaria. La Convención insta a los Estados Partes a garantizar que las personas con discapacidad tengan acceso a los programas y servicios de protección social convencionales y a programas y servicios específicos para satisfacer sus necesidades y cubrir los gastos relacionados con la discapacidad, como por ejemplo los servicios de apoyo. Dentro de este contexto, el artículo se propone examinar por qué y cómo los Estados y otras partes interesadas deberían garantizar el establecimiento de sistemas de protección social que incluyan a las personas con discapacidad, de conformidad con la Convención sobre los Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad de las Naciones Unidas.Alternate abstract:Sozialschutz ist eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für die soziale und wirtschaftliche Entwicklung für alle, aber insbesondere für jene, die Armut und soziale Ausgrenzung erfahren. Sozialschutzprogrammen kann eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Linderung und Verhinderung von Armut und Bedürftigkeit zukommen, um das Wohlergehen der Menschen zu gewährleisten. Sie können auch die Produktivität, Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten und wirtschaftliche Entwicklung der Menschen verbessern, indem sie Gelegenheiten für höhere Einkommen schaffen. Außerdem kann Sozialschutz die soziale Integration und Beteiligung fördern, indem er den wirksamen Zugang zu Lebensmitteln, Gesundheitsversorgung und unterstützenden Dienstleistungen sichert. So können gut ausgestaltete Sozialschutzprogramme direkt die Inanspruchnahme von Rechten durch Behinderte verbessern. Bedauerlicherweise haben die traditionellen Ansätze der Behindertenhilfe das Gegenteil gefördert, indem sie im Sozialschutz Wohltätigkeits- und medizinische Lösungen aufbauten und förderten. Daher begünstigten viele nationale Sozialschutzsysteme viel zu lange Paternalismus, Abhängigkeit, Abtrennung und Institutionalisierung von Personen mit Behinderungen und begrenzten so deren Möglichkeiten, unabhängig in ihren Gemeinwesen zu leben. Das Übereinkommen der Vereinten Nationen über die Rechte von Menschen mit Behinderungen stellt sich diesen Ansichten entgegen. Es fördert stattdessen Sozialschutzsysteme, die Behinderte integrieren und aktives Bürgerengagement, soziale Integration und Beteiligung am Gemeinwesen erleichtern. Das Übereinkommen fordert die Unterzeichnerstaaten auf, sicherzustellen, dass Personen mit Behinderungen den gleichen Zugang zu den üblichen Sozialschutzprogrammen und -diensten sowie zu besonderen Programmen und Dienstleistungen für behinderungsbezogene Bedürfnisse und für Ausgaben wie unterstützende Dienstleistungen erhalten. Vor diesem Hintergrund will der vorliegende Artikel diskutieren, warum und wie Staaten und andere Beteiligte in Einklang mit der UN-Behindertenrechtskonvention die Errichtung von Sozialschutzsystemen mit Integration Behinderter gewährleisten sollten.Alternate abstract:Социальная защита является важным условием социального и экономического развития всех, особенно тех, кто страдает от бедности и социального отчуждения. Программы социальной защиты могут играть определяющую роль в снижении и предотвращении бедности и уязвимости, тем самым обеспечивая благополучие населения. Они также могут способствовать повышению производительности, расширению возможностей трудоустройства и экономическому развитию путём создания лучших возможностей для получения доходов. Социальная защита также может содействовать социальной интеграции и участию в жизни общества, обеспечивая реальный доступ к питанию, здравоохранению, образованию и услугам поддержки. Поэтому детально разработанные и продуманные программы социальной защиты могут напрямую укреплять возможности лиц с ограниченными возможностями для реализации своих прав. К сожалению, традиционные подходы к назначению пенсии по инвалидности содействовали укоренению и распространению прямо противоположной точки зрения, основанной на медицинских и благотворительных показаниях, принятых в системах социального обеспечения. В результате многие национальные системы социальной защиты слишком долго потворствовали патернализму, иждивенчеству, сегрегации и бюрократизации подхода к лицам с ограниченными возможностями, что ограничивало их возможности жить независимо в своей среде. Этим взглядам противостоит Конвенция Организации Объединённых Наций о правах инвалидов, в которой предусматривается создание систем социального обеспечения, инклюзивных в отношении лиц с ограниченными возможностями и поддерживающих их активную гражданскую позицию, социальную интеграцию и участие в жизни общества. Конвенция призывает государства-члены гарантировать получение лицами с ограниченными возможностями равноправного доступа к основным программам и услугам социального обеспечения, а также к специальным программам и услугам, направленным на удовлетворение нужд и покрытие расходов, связанных с инвалидностью, таким как услуги поддержки. С учётом этого цель статьи заключается в поиске ответов на вопросы о том, как и почему государства-члены и другие заинтересованные стороны должны создавать системы социальной защиты, которые в соответствии с Конвенцией ООН о правах инвалидов будут распространяться на лиц с ограниченными возможностями.Alternate abstract:对于所有人而言,尤其是对经历贫困和遭受社会排斥的群体而言,社会保护是社会和经济发展的重要条件。社会保护计划可在减轻和预防贫困和脆弱性、保障人民福祉方面发挥重要作用。它还可通过为人们创造更好的创收机会来提高人们的生产力、就业能力和经济发展。此外,社会保护可通过确保有效获得粮食、健康护理、教育和支持性服务来促进社会融合与参与。因此,精心设计的社会保护计划有潜力直接改善残疾人享有权利的状况。遗憾的是,传统的残疾福利方法促进的却是反面,建立和传播了社会保护对策中的慈善和医疗观点。结果长久以来,许多国家的社会保护制度进一步导致了残疾人家长式作风、依赖性、隔离和体制化,限制了他们在社区中独立生活的机会。联合国《残疾人权利公约》对这些观点提出质疑,促进包容残疾人和推进积极公民身份、社会包容和社区参与的社会保护制度。《公约》呼吁缔约国确保残疾人平等获得主流社会保护计划和服务,同时可获得针对残疾需求和开支的专门计划和服务作为支持性服务。在此背景下,本文旨在讨论会员国和其它利益攸关方为何并应如何确保所建立的包容残疾人的社会保护制度符合《联合国残疾人权利公约》。Alternate abstract:تعد الحماية الاجتماعية شرطًا أساسياًّ لتحقيق التنمية الاجتماعية والاقتصادية للجميع، لا سيما الأشخاص الذين يعانون الفقر والإقصاء الاجتماعي. ويمكن لبرامج الحماية الاجتماعية أن تضطلع بدورٍ هاماًّ في التخفيف من حدة الفقر والضعف والقضاء عليهما لتأمين رفاه الإنسان. كما يمكن لهذه البرامج أن تعزز من الإنتاجية وقابلية التوظيف والتنمية الاقتصادية للأشخاص من خلال خلق فرص أفضل لهم لكسب العيش. وعلاوة على ذلك، يمكن للحماية الاجتماعية أن تدعم الإدماج والمشاركة الاجتماعيين وذلك من خلال ضمان الحصول الفعال على خدمات الغذاء والتأمين الصحي والتعليم والدعم. وبالتالي تتمتع برامج الحماية الاجتماعية المصممة بشكل جيد بالقدرة على تحسين فرصة الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة في التمتع بحقوقهم بصورة مباشرة. ولكن مع الأسف دعمت المناهج التقليدية الخاصة برفاهية ذوي الإعاقة اتجاهًا معاكساً، حيث خلقت ونشرت وجهات نظر خيرية وطبية في استجابات الحماية الاجتماعية. ونتيجة لذلك، خلُصت العديد من نظم الحماية الاجتماعية الوطنية، لوقتٍ طويل، إلى مواصلة انتهاج النزعة الأبوية والتبعية والتمييز ووضع إطار مؤسسي للأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة، وهو ما يحد من فرصهم في العيش باستقلالية في مجتمعاتهم. وتعارض اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة المعنية بحقوق الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة هذه الآراء، إذ تدعم نظم الحماية الاجتماعية التي تشمل الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة والتي تسهل المواطنة النشطة،والإدماج الاجتماعي والمشاركة في المجتمع. وتدعو الاتفاقية الدول الأطراف إلى ضمان حصول الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة، على قدم المساواة، على برامج وخدمات الحماية الاجتماعية السائدة، فضلاً عن حصولهم على البرامج والخدمات للاحتياجات والنفقات المتصلة بالإعاقة مثل خدمات الدعم. وفي ضوء ما تقدم، تصبو هذه المقالة إلى مناقشة كيف ولماذا ينبغي أن تضمن الدول وأصحاب المصلحة الآخرين إرساء نظم حماية اجتماعية تشمل الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة تماشياً مع اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة المعنية بحقوق الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة.Alternate abstract:A proteção social é uma condição essencial para o desenvolvimento socioeconômico de todos, mas particularmente para pessoas que vivem em situação de pobreza e exclusão social. Os programas de proteção social podem exercer um papel vital no sentido de aliviar e prevenir a pobreza e a vulnerabilidade com objetivo de garantir o bem-estar da população. Eles também podem aumentar a produtividade, a empregabilidade e o desenvolvimento econômico das pessoas, proporcionando a elas melhores oportunidades de geração de renda. Além disso, a proteção social pode estimular a inclusão e a participação social garantindo o acesso real à alimentação, saúde, educação e a serviços assistenciais. Ademais, programas de proteção social bem estruturados têm o potencial de melhorar diretamente a justa satisfação dos direitos de portadores de deficiências. Infelizmente, os modelos tradicionais de assistência social para portadores de deficiências têm promovido o contrário, criando e disseminando uma visão assistencialista e perspectivas médicas nas ações de proteção social. Como resultado e por longo tempo, muitos sistemas nacionais de proteção social nutriram ainda mais o paternalismo, a dependência, a segregação e a institucionalização de portadores de deficiências, limitando suas oportunidades de viver de forma independente em suas comunidades. A Convenção sobre Direitos de Pessoas com Deficiência da ONU contesta esses pontos de vista, promovendo sistemas de proteção social inclusivos para pessoas portadoras de deficiências e que facilitam a cidadania ativa, a inclusão social e a participação na comunidade. A Convenção convoca os estados membros a garantir que pessoas com deficiência tenham o mesmo acesso aos programas e serviços gerais de proteção social, bem como acesso a programas e serviços específicos para as respectivas necessidades e despesas, tais como serviços assistenciais. Neste contexto, o artigo discute como e por que os estados membros e outras partes envolvidas deveriam garantir o estabelecimento de sistemas de proteção social inclusivos para portadores de deficiências, em conformidade com a Convenção dos Direitos das Pessoas com Deficiência da ONU.

T1  - Rejection sensitivity as a vulnerability marker for depressive symptom deterioration in men
AN  - 1953157561
AB  - Consistent across time and cultures, men and male adolescents older than 14 years of age appear underrepresented in mood disorders, and are far less likely than women to seek psychological help. The much higher rate of suicide amongst males suggests that depression in men might be underreported. One of the core human motives is to seek acceptance by others and avoid rejection. Rejection Sensitivity (RS) has been conceptualized as the cognitive-affective processing disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely respond to cues of rejection in the behavior of others. RS has been previously linked with the onset and course of depression, but—as yet—has not been investigated longitudinally in a clinical population. We investigated the predictive role of RS to symptom deterioration 6 months after end-of- treatment in 72 male inpatients with depressive spectrum disorder. The BDI was administered at intake, end-of-treatment and 6 month follow-up. RS scores were obtained at intake. Rejection Sensitivity had additional predictive power on BDI scores at 6 months follow-up controlling for BDI scores at end-of-treatment (ΔR2 = .095). The results are discussed in terms of the importance of targeting RS during treatment, and highlight the fact that therapeutic follow-up care is paramount. Future research should investigate possible mediators of the RS–relapse-to-depression association, such as self-blame, rumination, neuroticism, pessimism, emotion dysregulation, and low self-esteem.

T1  - Links among Familial Gender Ideology, Media Portrayal of Women, Dating, and Sexual Behaviors in African American, and Mexican American Adolescent Young Women: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 1938050077
AB  - Utilizing grounded theory methodology and drawing from sexual script theory as a research lens, we examined familial gender ideologies, media portrayals of Black and Latina women, dating attitudes, and sexual behaviors among 33 low-income early adolescent (aged 11–14) African American and Mexican American young women. Themes revealed divergent experiences for African American and Mexican American young women. In particular, African American participants reported egalitarian familial gender ideologies and sexual objectification of Black women, as well as more open and positive attitudes toward dating and sexuality. In contrast, Mexican American participants reported patriarchal familial gender ideologies and the portrayed mistreatment of Latinas in telenovelas and Spanish language songs, along with cautious attitudes towards dating and sexuality. Additionally, Mexican American participants reported that they censored their communication about sexual matters with their family. Overall, findings suggest that interventions should be tailored accordingly for African American and Mexican American youth. Interventions with African American young women should focus on providing accurate information on safer sexual practices, whereas interventions with Mexican American young women should focus on promoting constructive conceptualizations of gender roles, which could help foster self-efficacy around sexual communication with parents and potential partners.

T1  - Kalashnikov and Cooking-spoon: Neo-Nazism, Veganism and a Lifestyle Cooking Show on YouTube
AN  - 2562814953
AB  - Food consumption has always been a deeply symbolic, identity-related issue. But contrary to the intuitive assumption that links meat-free diets to peace-loving, left-leaning actors and ideologies, this article illustrates how a group of (German) neo-Nazis, Balaclava Küche (Balaclava Kitchen), appropriates vegan diet in its YouTube cooking videos. Analyzing these videos, supported by an interview with the group, the article inquires into the various ways in which cooking and food consumption are intertwined with their politics. It closes by putting the group’s attitude into a wider perspective, suggesting an ideal typical model of how links between culture, nature, and identity can be understood.

T1  - Does Educational Marginalization Mediate the Path from Childhood Cumulative Risk to Criminal Offending?
AN  - 2421244160
AB  - PurposeEarly exposure to multiple risk factors is known to predict involvement in criminal offending. The purpose of this study was to examine the processes responsible for this association. Specifically, the focus was on the capacity of adolescent educational experience to mediate the effect of childhood cumulative risk (CCR) on criminal offending, net of expected continuity in antisocial propensity, and behavior.MethodsData from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort Study 1986 (n = 5743) were used to estimate a structural equation model to examine the hypothesized pathways. The educational pathway was captured by a latent variable (educational marginalization) consisting of indicators of low academic performance, weak school attachment, and low educational aspirations.ResultsCCR had a strong positive relation with educational marginalization, which, in turn, emerged as a statistically significant predictor of having criminal record by age 19. Although continuity in antisocial behavior accounted for most of the total effect of CCR on criminal offending, one-third of it was mediated by educational marginalization.ConclusionsThe results highlight the adolescent educational experience as a promising target of intervention in efforts to curb criminal careers among children at risk.

T1  - Transforming welfare institutions through social innovation and action research in Denmark
TT  - Transformando instituciones de bienestar a través de la innovación social y la investigación-acción en Dinamarca
AN  - 1986541628
AB  - The article will present how action research may contribute to social innovation and empowerment in public welfare and cultural institutions (nursing homes and libraries) in a manner that supports the interests of marginalised citizens and local communities, and creates opportunities for positive change. First, we introduce the concepts of empowerment, action research and social innovation along with the roots of these concepts in critical social theory. Secondly, two case studies are presented to analyse two different methodological variants of action research in two different contexts. The first case is about action research in nursing homes, where the objective was to improve elder care through more autonomy and better quality of life for residents and employees. In this project (inspired by critical utopian action research), so called ‘future workshops’ were applied to create “free space” for reflection and creation of concrete suggestions of social innovation in elder care. The second case is about the transformation of a public library into a community centre. In this case, the aim was to break down barriers between citizens and public institutions in a deprived, multicultural urban area and thereby promote local community empowerment. In this project, ‘empowerment evaluation’ was used as an action research method. In the final part we compare the two approaches (utopian action research and empowerment facilitation), and discuss the danger of falling into the trap of localism, where successful social innovations: instead of being up-scaled and widely distributed, end up as oneoffs or simply die out at the very local level.Alternate abstract:El trabajo presentará cómo la investigación-acción puede contribuir para la innovación social y el empoderamiento en instituciones culturales y de bienestar público (hogares de ancianos y bibliotecas), de una forma que apoye los intereses de los ciudadanos marginados y las comunidades locales y crie oportunidades para un cambio positivo. En primer lugar, introducimos los conceptos críticos de ‘empoderamiento’, ‘investigación-acción’ e ‘innovación social’, junto con las raíces de estos conceptos en la teoría social crítica. En segundo lugar, se presentan dos casos de estudio para analizar dos variantes metodológicas diferentes de la investigación-acción en dos contextos diferentes. El primer caso es sobre la investigación-acción en hogares de ancianos, cuyo objetivo fue mejorar el cuidado de ancianos mediante una mayor autonomía y una mejor calidad de vida para los residentes y empleados. En este proyecto (inspirado por la investigación-acción utópica crítica) se aplicaron los llamados “futuros talleres” para crear un “espacio libre” para la reflexión y creación de sugerencias concretas de innovación social en el cuidado de ancianos. El segundo caso es sobre la transformación de una biblioteca pública en un centro comunitario. En este caso, el objetivo fue romper las barreras entre los ciudadanos y las instituciones públicas, en un área urbana multicultural privada, y así promover el empoderamiento de la comunidad local. En este proyecto se utilizó la “evaluación del empoderamiento“ como método de la investigación-acción. En la parte final, comparamos los dos enfoques (investigaciónacción utópica y facilitación del empoderamiento), y discutimos el peligro de caer en la trampa del localismo, donde las innovaciones sociales exitosas – en vez de ser en mayor escala y ampliamente difundidas – terminan en una sola aplicación o simplemente mueren en el nivel local.

T1  - We Are (Not) All Bulldogs: Minoritized Peer Socialization Agents' Meaning-Making About Collegiate Contexts
AN  - 2008062887
AB  - In this study I examined the ways minoritized students who serve as peer socialization agents made meaning of their collegiate contexts in relation to their identities and socialization positions. Using the framework of Critical Race Theory and the concept of a meaning-making filter, I explored the meaning-making of 13 minoritized peer socialization agents (MPSAs) at a predominantly White institution. MPSAs mobilized meaning-making filters developed by counterspaces and enacted counterstorytelling as an act of resistance to the dominant narrative of the institution.

T1  - Geographies of Exclusion: The Importance of Racial Legacies in Examining State-Level Immigration Laws: PROD
AN  - 1955239579
AB  - In this article, I examine the decisions of Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Utah, Indiana, and most recently, Texas to pass restrictive immigration omnibus bills and analyze the factors associated with the decision of a state to pass its own immigration law, sometimes without explicit warrant. I focus on state omnibus legislation for two main reasons. First, this type of legislation has been the focus of much media attention. Second, omnibus legislation mimics comprehensive immigration legislation over which the federal government has sole authority. Additionally, I focus on the regional proliferation of restrictive immigration laws, and then bring my attention to the seven states that passed similar legislation. Individually, I examine the roll call votes by each state's House of Representatives. By looking at immigration politics at a sub-national level, this article provides a more nuanced understanding of the political and ideological work of immigration policies. I argue that contemporary immigration politics at sub-national levels should not only be understood as a story about demographic changes and strictly partisan politics but also a story about the sociohistorical legacies of localities. The historical processes of race, and the differing ways in which places get racialized, influences, beyond partisanship, which representatives voted for and against restrictive immigration legislation. These differences, alongside state-level differences, I argue, continue to affect politics and policy today. Immigration policy has become a vessel through which to contest the politics of race, place, and power.

T1  - The effects of perceived phenotypic racial stereotypicality and social identity threat on racial minorities' attitudes about police
AN  - 1900995320
AB  - This study examines the role of perceived phenotypic racial stereotypicality and race-based social identity threat on racial minorities' trust and cooperation with police. We hypothesize that in police interactions, racial minorities' phenotypic racial stereotypicality may increase race-based social identity threat, which will lead to distrust and decreased participation with police. Racial minorities (Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans, and multi-racials) and Whites from a representative random sample of city residents were surveyed about policing attitudes. A serial multiple mediation model confirmed that racial minorities' self-rated phenotypic racial stereotypicality indirectly affected future cooperation through social identity threat and trust. Due to the lack of negative group stereotypes in policing, the model did not hold for Whites. This study provides evidence that phenotypic stereotypicality influences racial minorities' psychological experiences interacting with police.

T1  - Acculturation Strategies Among South Asian Immigrants: The Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) Study
AN  - 1873284392
AB  - In the past, epidemiologic research on acculturation and health has been criticized for its conceptual ambiguity and simplistic measurement approaches. This study applied a widely-used theoretical framework from cross-cultural psychology to identify acculturation strategies among South Asian immigrants in the US and to examine sociodemographic correlates of acculturation strategies. Data were from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America study. We used latent class analysis to identify groups of individuals that were similar based on cultural attitudes and behaviors. We used latent class regression analysis to examine sociodemographic correlates of acculturation strategies. We found that South Asian immigrants employed three acculturation strategies, including separation (characterized by a relatively high degree of preference for South Asian culture over US culture), assimilation (characterized by a relatively high degree of preference for US culture over South Asian culture), and integration (characterized by a similar level of preference for South Asian and US cultures). Respondents with no religious affiliation, those with higher levels of income, those who lived a greater percentage of their lives in the US, and those who spoke English well or very well were less likely to use the separation strategy than the assimilation or integration strategies. Using epidemiologic cohort data, this study illustrated a conceptual and methodological approach that addresses limitations of previous research on acculturation and health. More work is needed to understand how the acculturation strategies identified in this study affect the health of South Asian immigrants in the US.

T1  - Citizen Journalism at The Margins
AN  - 1923800641
AB  - Amidst burgeoning literature on citizen journalism, we still know relatively little about how and why genuinely marginalised groups seek to use this form of reporting to challenge their exclusion. In this article, we aim to address this gap by analysing two UK citizen journalism initiatives emanating from The Big Issue Foundation, a national homeless organisation, and Access Dorset, a regional charity for disabled and elderly people. These case studies are united by the authors' involvement in both instances, primarily through designing and delivering bespoke citizen journalism education and mentoring. Based on over 40 hours of interviews with participants of the workshops and 36 hours of participant observation, we analyse the challenges participants faced in their journey to become citizen journalists. This included: low self-esteem, physical health and mental wellbeing, the need for accessible and adaptable technology, and overcoming fear associated with assuming a public voice. We also analyse marginalised groups' attitudes to professional journalism and education, and its role in shaping journalistic identity and self-empowerment. Whilst demonstrably empowering and esteem building, our participants were acutely aware of societal power relations that were seemingly still beyond their ability to influence. Those who are marginalised are, nevertheless, in the best position to use citizen journalism as a conduit for social change, we argue-though challenges remain even at the grassroots level to foster and sustain participatory practices.

T1  - Personal control and service connection as paths to improved mental health and exiting homelessness among severely marginalized homeless youth
AN  - 2027231323
AB  - Objective: Non-service connected, continuously homeless youth are arguably one of the most vulnerable populations in the U.S. These youth reside at society's margins experiencing an accumulation of risks over time. Research concludes that as vulnerabilities increase so do poor long-term outcomes. This study tested the mediating effects of service connection and personal control as mediators of cumulative risk and housing, health and mental health outcomes. By understanding the processes associated with therapeutic change among those with the most vulnerabilities, service providers and researchers can target those factors to enhance positive outcomes. Method: Seventy-nine, non-service connected, substance using homeless youth were offered a strengths-based outreach and engagement intervention and were assessed at baseline 3,6 and 9 months post-baseline. Results: Personal control mediated the effects of cumulative risk on housing stability, and service utilization mediated the effects of cumulative risk on mental health. Conclusions: This study specifies important targets of intervention for a population at high risk for continuing homelessness. In particular, service providers should target youths' sense of personal control and link them to needed community-based services in order to help them exit street life and improve mental health outcomes.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the attitudes of the members of professional associations (PAMs) attitudes towards the Jordanian political mobility during the Arab Spring era via delineating its efficiency, future, and role in the political reform process. The study also attempted to pinpoint the PAMs' stance from such mobility and their potential future involvement in its activities. Besides, the study shed light on the extent of PAMs' participation in this sort of mobility, along with the common means of expression they used to this end. The study sample consisted of 661 members selected by a multi-phase sample. Using a three point Likert-scale, a structured questionnaire was specially designed by the researchers to fulfill the study objectives. Results showed that 86.7% of the PAMs participated in the political mobility; their participation took many forms, including writing and/or commenting on hard or soft copy newspapers. Findings also revealed that social networks were the most common means used by PAMs, accounting for 77% of the used media. Career and job demands formed the primary motivation behind PAMs' participation in the political mobility. Comprehensive economic reforms, on the other hand, came second as a major motivating factor for their participation in the activities of this mobility. Moreover, findings explicitly indicated that the efficiency of the political mobility in the future, its role in the political reform process, PAMs' stance from this mobility, along with their future potential participation in its activities are inclined to be passive. Additionally, the attitudes of the PAMs towards the continuity of the political mobility in Jordan indicated that it is inclined to backtrack.

T1  - Gender, urban space, and the right to everyday life
AN  - 2409198751
AB  - Gender remains a neglected focus for theory and practice in shaping cities. Given women’s continuing economic and social marginalization and the prevalence of violence against women, how can this be the case? Despite several decades of feminist scholarship, dominant perspectives within the “the right to the city” literature pay little attention to how “rights” are gendered. In contrast, feminist and queer scholarship concerned with everyday life and the multiple spatial tactics of marginalized city dwellers reveal a more complex urban arena in which rights are negotiated or practiced. This article suggests that a fuller recognition of the contested publics that coexist within the contemporary city and the gendered mediation of everyday experiences could enable planners and policy makers to undertake more inclusive forms of intervention in urban space.

T1  - РОССИЙСКАЯ ИНТЕЛЛИГЕНЦИЯ И ИНСТИТУТЫ: ДОВЕРИЕ ИЛИ ОТЧУЖДЕНИЕ?
TT  - RUSSIAN INTELLIGENTSIA AND INSTITUTIONS: TRUST OR ALIENATION?
AN  - 2007968971
AB  - В статье рассмотрены особенности и структура институционального доверия гуманитарной интеллигенции; раскрыты сущность и предпосылки его возник- новения, охарактеризована структура институционального доверия, последователь- но рассмотрены элементы этой структуры. Высший уровень доверия интеллигенция демонстрирует президенту, однако доверяющие значительно отличаются по установ- кам и мотивам выражения доверия (истинные сторонники и пассивные наблюдате- ли). Декларируемое доверие к армии отражает признание ее заслуг и обеспечения безопасности государства. Проявление полного доверия к церкви свидетельствует об идентификации с ценностями и целями этой организации. Низкий уровень доверия к политическим институтам, демонстрируемый интеллигенцией, является современной международной тенденцией – распространение чувства несправедливости, отсутствие надежды на улучшение и уверенности в будущем, подрывающих доверие к государ- ству как таковому. Доверие полиции и судам на низком уровне во многом обуслов- лено распространенными предрассудками, низкой осведомленностью о деятельности этих учреждений и редкой практикой взаимодействия с ними. Доверие к телевидению и прессе среди интеллигенции весьма ограниченно, хотя телевидение остается основ- ным источником новостей; важной альтернативой ему становится Интернет. Низкий уровень институционального доверия в среде гуманитарной интеллигенции сочетает- ся с консервативными, патерналистскими установками, гражданской и политической пассивностью и свидетельствует скорее о разочаровании и отчуждении, чем о выра- жении критического настроя и активизации конструктивного потенциала недоверия.Alternate abstract:The article examines features and structure by institutional trust of the humanitarian intelligentsia. The highest level of trust is demonstrated to the President, but those two groups, who express “full” and “partial” trust, differ significantly in their motivations for trust (true supporters/passive observers). The declared trust to the army reflects recognition of its responsible function in ensuring security of the state, protecting the country, past merits. The manifestation of the full trust to the church testifies to the identification with the values and goals of this institution. A low level of trust in political institutions (excluding the President) is demonstrated by intelligentsia and it is a modern international trend, conditioned by the spread of a set of attitudes (feelings of injustice, lack of hope for improvement and confidence in the future, the desire for change), undermining confidence to the state system as a whole. The trust to the police and the court is at a low level, which can be largely due to widespread prejudices, low awareness of the activities of these institutions and rare practices of interaction with them. The declaration of trust to media (TV and the press) among the intelligentsia is not widespread. Despite the fact that television remains the main source of news, the Internet becomes an important alternative. The low level of institutional trust among the humanitarian intelligentsia is combined with paternalistic attitudes, civil and political passivity, and indicates disappointment and exclusion rather than activation of the constructive potential of mistrust.

T1  - Doing It Write: Representation and Responsibility in Writing Up Participatory Research Involving Young People
AN  - 2002254098
AB  - This article adopts a reflexive stance as the authors look back on their doctoral research projects; the first author exploring young people’s relationships with community radio, and the second author studying young people’s alcohol consumption practices and experiences, both in the North West of England, UK. The authors discuss the methods of data collection they employed, which enabled young people the opportunity to participate in meaningful ways. However, drawing on snapshots from their PhD theses, the authors question whether decisions made when writing up related to protecting anonymity, (re)presenting speech characteristics, and editing, independently of participants, potentially undid some of the hard work exerted in creating an equitable space for young people’s contributions, resultantly perpetuating the regulation of young people and keeping them ‘in their place’. The authors propose some recommendations for facilitating the inclusion of young people in the writing up of participatory research.

AN  - 2539303784
AB  - Im Seen but Seldom Heard-Projekt, in der performativen Sozialwissenschaft (PSS) angesiedelt, wurde performative Dichtung genutzt zum Nachvollzug der Erfahrungen junger Menschen mit körperlichen Beeinträchtigungen. Zwei Dichter, eine Gruppe Jugendlicher und Wissenschaftler/innen aus den Sozial- sowie Medien- und Kommunikationswissenschaften suchten in der gemeinsamen Arbeit nach einem besseren Verstehen von Identität, Stereotypen, Stigma und Repräsentation. In diesem Beitrag geben wir einen Überblick über die Projektarbeit und zeigen, wie PSS angewendet werden kann, um sonst schwer zugängliche Stimmen hörbar zu machen. Wir veranschaulichen dies an zwei Gedichten, die Einblick in das Leben mit körperlichen Beeinträchtigungen gewähren und die den Jugendlichen halfen, das eigene Verständnis von Behinderung und Diskriminierung zu reflektieren.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1602118Alternate abstract:The Seen but Seldom Heard project was a performative social science (PSS) project which used performance poetry to illuminate the experiences of young people with physical impairments. Two performance poets, a group of young people with physical impairments, and academics from social science and media/communication backgrounds worked together to explore various aspects of the lived experience of disability exploring issues associated with identity, stereotypes, stigma and representation. In this article, we will present an overview of the project and consider how PSS offers a method to engage seldom heard voices, and illustrate this through two poems which shed light on the lived experience of disability. The article will consider the impact of these poems as PSS, and how this method allows the audience to develop a deeper understanding of the "lived" experience of disability and to reflect upon their own understandings of disability and discrimination.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1602118Alternate abstract:El proyecto "Visto pero rara vez oído" [Seen but Seldom Heard] fue un proyecto de ciencia social performativa (CSP) que utilizó la poesía performativa para clarificar las experiencias de jóvenes con impedimentos físicos.

T1  - The Effects of Civil Hate Speech Laws: Lessons from Australia
AN  - 1704123551
AB  - This article examines the effects of hate speech laws in Australia. Triangulating data from primary and secondary sources, we examine five hypothesized effects: whether the laws provide a remedy to targets of hate speech, encourage more respectful speech, have an educative or symbolic effect, have a chilling effect, or create "martyrs." We find the laws provide a limited remedy in the complaints mechanisms, provide a framework for direct community advocacy, and that knowledge of the laws exists in public discourse. However, the complaints mechanism imposes a significant enforcement burden on targeted communities, who still regularly experience hate speech. We find a reduction in the expression of prejudice in mediated outlets, but not on the street. We find no evidence of a chilling effect and we find the risk of free speech martyrs to be marginal. We draw out the implications of these findings for other countries.

T1  - Davabirzhaot! Conflicting claims on public space in Tbilisi between transparency and opaqueness
AN  - 1690964937
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the form of young male socialisation referred to as birzha, in its relation to public space in Georgia. Birzha defines a group of young men who meet regularly in urban open spaces in Tbilisi's neighbourhoods. Partly considered as the initial step of a criminal career, belonging to birzha is a mark of identification with one's local group. The contested nature of public space is illustrated by the conflicting relation between birzha's bottom-up use of public space and top-down projects of urban renovation sought by Saakashvili's government. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing upon literary and media sources, and analysing fieldwork data collected in 2008-2009 and 2014, this study explores how the announced (re)construction of public space under Saakashvili resulted in institutional interventions from above which curtailed public space's accessibility. Findings - The present analysis points out contradictions in Saakashvili's government's political narrative on public space. In the institutional focus on a future of order, transparency, and democracy, birzha is an insistent reminder of an informal and corrupted past. Banned from futuristic projections of the public space, in the present birzha is annihilated by state repression, enforced in opaque zones out of public sight. Originality/value - Focusing on a largely overlooked phenomenon in social science research, the paper highlights the ways in which conflicting approaches to public space affect the relation between political institutions and citizens. Delving into ambivalent public/private divides in post-socialist societies, the study of Georgian birzha offers an original angle for investigating the contestation of urban public space in relation to political legitimacy and transparency.

T1  - Media-Induced Elevation as a Means of Enhancing Feelings of Intergroup Connectedness
AN  - 1662632631
AB  - The majority of research on media counter-stereotyping of race/ethnicity has tended to employ positive portrayals or counter-stereotypical exemplars as a primary strategy in eliciting positive attitudes among White participants. In contrast, this article reports the results of an experiment on the unique role of affective responses to media messages as a mechanism in inducing greater feelings of connectedness with a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. Our focus is on the affective response of elevation specifically, which refers to feelings of being moved, touched, and inspired by images of people engaged in morally beautiful acts such as love, generosity, and kindness. Results show that the experience of elevation in response to inspiring videos was associated with heightened feelings of overlap between the self and humanity, with this overlap associated with greater feelings of connectedness with those from a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. This connection was also associated with more favorable attitudes.

T1  - Beliefs about group malleability and out-group attitudes: The mediating role of perceived threat in interactions with out-group members
AN  - 1700674930; 201525085
AB  - Recent research suggests that inducing fixed (rather than malleable) beliefs about groups leads to more negative attitudes toward out-groups. The present paper identifies the underlying mechanism of this effect. We show that individuals with a fixed belief about groups tend to construe intergroup settings as threatening situations that might reveal shortcomings of their in-group (perceived threat). In the present research, we measured (Study 1) and manipulated (Study 2) participants' lay theories about group malleability. We found that the extent to which individuals had an entity (versus an incremental) group theory influenced the level of threat they felt when interacting with out-group members, and that perceived threat in turn affected their level of ethnocentrism and prejudice. These findings shed new light on the role of lay theories in intergroup attitudes and suggest new ways to reduce prejudice. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Talk on the Media'S Role in Creating Otherness and Exclusion: Discursive Identifications and Public (dis)Connections
AN  - 1697972975
AB  - In this article, we examine how media coverage of migration issues and portrayal of migrants are reflected upon and talked about among families with migrant backgrounds living in Sweden. To date, most Nordic media research on migration has focused on studying media texts, such as representations of migrant and minority issues, rather than on media uses and practices. However, the present study is based on a discursive and contextual approach to media reception, implying in-depth informant interviews, mainly in people's homes, supported by observations and field notes. Attention is directed towards the informants' readings of certain media texts, with particular emphasis on their views concerning the media's role in the creation of otherness and exclusion. Key issues like "truth" and media objectivity, cultural imperialism, non-ethical Western journalism exemplify how symbolic exclusion operates, which in the long run may have profound implications on people's connections to a shared public world.

T1  - Victorious justifications and criticism of defeated: Involvement of nations in world wars, social development, cultural values, social representations of war, and willingness to fight
AN  - 1767330329; 201606258
AB  - Social representations of the historical past, anchored in historical experience and cultural values, play a motivational role for justifying collective behaviour. The First and Second World Wars (WWI and WWII) are the most remembered historical events around the world. The aim of the current study is to investigate, based on country-level data, the relationship between the country's role during the war, social development, cultural values and willingness to fight in a future war, and how social representations of WWII mediate these processes. The data from the World History Survey were collected from a total of 6628 university students from 36 countries. The results showed that ascribing WWII a progressive (UN creation, democracy) or technological-scientific explanation, but also perceiving WWII as a social catastrophe, prevailed more than beliefs justifying WWII (just and necessary war). Directly or indirectly victorious nations endorse legitimizing and positive representations of world wars more than defeated ones. The effects of hierarchical and collectivistic values and low social development on willingness to fight in a war are mediated by legitimizing social representations of WWII. Importantly, when controlled for socio-structural differences (human development index), the indirect effect of being a victorious nation in a war on willingness to fight through legitimizing representations of WWII was also significant. These findings suggest that social representations of WWII serve as anchors for determining the role of a nation in collective violence. Social representations legitimizing past collective violence seem to facilitate more positive attitudes towards potential future collective violence in victorious nations. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - COPS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF WHITE MASCULINE DECLINE
AN  - 1751968672
AB  - Examining the interconnection of gender, race, and social class in the representation of white female domestic violence complainants on the popular television series Cops, this analysis illustrates how roles in the performance of the criminal justice system can be used to address the crisis in white masculinity. Central to this examination is the crisis in white masculinity and the felt social, cultural and political marginalization of white men brought about by radical social and cultural changes since the civil rights movement. In this article, I examine Cops as the manifestation of this crisis-as a place where individuals manage and exorcise their anxieties and fears in relation to this crisis in identity. Utilizing thirty-five domestic violence vignettes from the series, I argue that the series portrays white male police officers as 'victims' of marginalized others, in this case lower class white women, in order to mark and exorcise the transition of white masculinity in the modern US.

T1  - Social media for learning: A mixed methods study on high school students' technology affordances and perspectives
AN  - 1641424275; 201501157
AB  - Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, the study investigated high school students' affordances for social media, their attitudes and beliefs about these new technologies, and related obstacles and issues. The affordance findings indicate that students depend on social media in their daily lives for leisure and social connections. Educational uses by teachers for classroom teaching and learning are sporadic, while uses by students on their own for learning purposes seem to be abundant but also incidental and informal. Quantitative results suggest that in general, students show positive attitudes and beliefs about social media use in education. Exploratory factor analysis revealed three components that explained a total of 65.4% of the variance: (a) benefits of social media use, (b) disadvantages of social media use, and (c) current social media use in education. Three issues emerged from the interview data: Conceptual understanding of social media for learning; close-minded, acquired uses versus open-minded, innate uses of social media; and changed concepts of learning. The study results suggest that for social media to be used as effective learning tools and to adjust students' prior affordances with these tools, complicated efforts in designing, scaffolding, and interacting with students during the process are necessary.

T1  - Psychological Processes Mediate the Impact of Familial Risk, Social Circumstances and Life Events on Mental Health
AN  - 1442465690
AB  - Background 
Despite widespread acceptance of the ‘biopsychosocial model’, the aetiology of mental health problems has provoked debate amongst researchers and practitioners for decades. The role of psychological factors in the development of mental health problems remains particularly contentious, and to date there has not been a large enough dataset to conduct the necessary multivariate analysis of whether psychological factors influence, or are influenced by, mental health. This study reports on the first empirical, multivariate, test of the relationships between the key elements of the biospychosocial model of mental ill-health.
 Methods and Findings 
Participants were 32,827 (age 18–85 years) self-selected respondents from the general population who completed an open-access online battery of questionnaires hosted by the BBC. An initial confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the adequacy of the proposed factor structure and the relationships between latent and measured variables. The predictive path model was then tested whereby the latent variables of psychological processes were positioned as mediating between the causal latent variables (biological, social and circumstantial) and the outcome latent variables of mental health problems and well-being. This revealed an excellent fit to the data, S-B χ2 (3199, N = 23,397) = 126654·8, p<·001; RCFI = ·97; RMSEA = ·04 (·038–·039). As hypothesised, a family history of mental health difficulties, social deprivation, and traumatic or abusive life-experiences all strongly predicted higher levels of anxiety and depression. However, these relationships were strongly mediated by psychological processes; specifically lack of adaptive coping, rumination and self-blame.
 Conclusion 
These results support a significant revision of the biopsychosocial model, as psychological processes determine the causal impact of biological, social, and circumstantial risk factors on mental health. This has clear implications for policy, education and clinical practice as psychological processes such as rumination and self-blame are amenable to evidence-based psychological therapies.

T1  - Consensus, compromise, justice and legitimacy
AN  - 1463012041; 201347451
AB  - Could the notion of compromise help us overcoming -- or at least negotiating -- the frequent tension, in normative political theory, between the realistic desideratum of peaceful coexistence and the idealistic desideratum of justice? That is to say, an analysis of compromise may help us move beyond the contrast between two widespread contrasting attitudes in contemporary political philosophy: 'fiat iustitia, pereat mundus', on the one side, and 'salus populi suprema lex', on the other side. More specifically, compromise may provide the backbone of a conception of legitimacy that mediates between idealistic (or moralistic) and realistic (or pragmatic) desiderata of political theory, i.e. between the aspiration to peace and the aspiration to justice. In other words, this paper considers whether an account of compromise could feature in a viable realistic conception of political legitimacy, in much the same way in which consensus features in more idealistic conceptions of legitimacy (a move that may be attributed to some realist theorists, especially Bernard Williams). My conclusions, however, are largely sceptical: I argue that grounding legitimacy in any kind of normatively salient agreement does require the trappings of idealistic political philosophy, for better or -- in my view -- worse.

T1  - The Weight of a Guilty Conscience: Subjective Body Weight as an Embodiment of Guilt
AN  - 1440992723
AB  - Guilt is an important social and moral emotion. In addition to feeling unpleasant, guilt is metaphorically described as a “weight on one's conscience.” Evidence from the field of embodied cognition suggests that abstract metaphors may be grounded in bodily experiences, but no prior research has examined the embodiment of guilt. Across four studies we examine whether i) unethical acts increase subjective experiences of weight, ii) feelings of guilt explain this effect, and iii) whether there are consequences of the weight of guilt. Studies 1–3 demonstrated that unethical acts led to more subjective body weight compared to control conditions. Studies 2 and 3 indicated that heightened feelings of guilt mediated the effect, whereas other negative emotions did not. Study 4 demonstrated a perceptual consequence. Specifically, an induction of guilt affected the perceived effort necessary to complete tasks that were physical in nature, compared to minimally physical tasks.

T1  - Understanding dignity and care: an exploratory qualitative study on the views of older people of African and African‐Caribbean descent
AN  - 2439039695
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to report on a qualitative exploratory study conducted in Wales to explore what dignity and care mean from the perspectives of men and women aged 50 years and older who self‐identified as being either African‐Caribbean/West Indian, or Black Welsh (third‐ or fourth‐generation, with links to Africa or the Caribbean).Design/methodology/approach – Twenty‐one semi‐structured interviews were undertaken, allowing for the collection of data on the participants' understanding of dignity (what it is, and what it “looks and feels like”) and of care.Findings – Dignity and respect for older people are revealed to be key aspects of the participants' personal value systems. The notion of care is understood as “caring about” and is seen to be a key indicator of dignity. Moreover, both care and dignity were understood and, for many of the participants, were both conceptualised on a personal basis and shaped by a sense of identity that was, in part and to varying extents, communally mediated and rooted in a cultural collectivistic value orientation. The findings also reveal the intersections of care and minority ethnicity, and how – to varying extents – these intersections shape the participants' perceptions of how they are recognised and acknowledged in encounters where dignity is especially important, such as in the receiving of care. With these perceptions come various levels of engagement, avoidance or acceptance of the need for extra care or support.Originality/value – Exploratory in nature, this study investigates the importance of paying attention to the impact that cultural and ethnic identity (and accompanying belief systems) may have on how notions of dignity and of care (both personal and communally mediated) are understood. It seeks to contribute to the body of evidence on ways of working with “seldom‐heard” groups and the importance of building trust and establishing long‐term, community‐based research networks.

T1  - Don't ask don't tell: examining attitudes about black homosexuality and the media in an online forum
AN  - 1792349912
AB  - On 8 November 2005, a posting appeared on the BET.COM Bulletin Board under the heading Noah's Arc. It read: 'Has anyone caught the new show called Noah's Arc? It comes on a gay/lesbian channel called LOGO and the show is really good. It is about four gay men living and loving in Los Angeles ... it gives us a glimpse into a world of gay men and the struggles that they endure in life. I suggest that all of you watch it.' Using textual analysis, this study examines the responses of forum users addressing the following research question: Thematically, what attitudes and opinions emerged from the postings surrounding the question 'Has anyone caught the new show Noah's Arc?' Eight themes emerged from the postings submitted by 84 respondents as BET.COM visitors engaged in a four-month discussion about sexual orientation and identity, race, religion and spirituality. The analysis reveals that while many respondents were homophobic and heterosexist, others had a more sophisticated and enlightened understanding of sexuality, media images and stereotypes, religion, and identity politics. Results suggest that an inevitable consequence of discussions of homosexuality is a discussion of morality and religion.

T1  - Gender and Ethnicity Differences in HIV-related Stigma Experienced by People Living with HIV in Ontario, Canada
AN  - 1327218351
AB  - This study aimed to understand gender and ethnicity differences in HIV-related stigma experienced by 1026 HIV-positive individuals living in Ontario, Canada that were enrolled in the OHTN Cohort Study. Total and subscale HIV-related stigma scores were measured using the revised HIV-related Stigma Scale. Correlates of total stigma scores were assessed in univariate and multivariate linear regression. Women had significantly higher total and subscale stigma scores than men (total, median = 56.0 vs. 48.0, p<0.0001). Among men and women, Black individuals had the highest, Aboriginal and Asian/Latin-American/Unspecified people intermediate, and White individuals the lowest total stigma scores. The gender-ethnicity interaction term was significant in multivariate analysis: Black women and Asian/Latin-American/Unspecified men reported the highest HIV-related stigma scores. Gender and ethnicity differences in HIV-related stigma were identified in our cohort. Findings suggest differing approaches may be required to address HIV-related stigma based on gender and ethnicity; and such strategies should challenge racist and sexist stereotypes.

T1  - Consuming Ourselves to Dearth: Escalating Inequality and Public Opinion
AN  - 1221408915; 201244629
AB  - This article proposes an agenda for research on the relation of structural inequality to the study of politics and consumption in the field of communication. The authors review evidence for increasing inequality in the United States and argue that (1) consumption choices and desires are strongly constrained by structural location; (2) political beliefs and attitudes are shaped by location in the income or class structure; and (3) consumption as a form of political self-expression or civic identity, for example, boycotting or "buycotting," is also constrained by economic structural location. Given these propositions, it becomes critical to analytically situate notions of personalization of politics within the context of increasing economic inequality.

T1  - Beauty, Ethnicity, and Age: Does Internalization of Mainstream Media Ideals Influence Attitudes Towards Older Adults?
AN  - 958727213
AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n=115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n=74), Hispanic/Latina (n=52), and African American (n=42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - IT IS THE EYES AND NOT THE SIZE THAT MATTER
AN  - 925713063; 201204225
AB  - The number of immigrants to Western Europe has been increasing, with immigration the subject of much controversy in contemporary Europe. In this article, we investigate the relationship between the size of the immigrant population, how natives perceive this size, and their anti-immigrant attitudes. We use data from the 2002/2003 European Social Survey covering 17 Western European countries, and we find that as a rule Western Europeans think that the immigrant population in their country is much larger than it actually is. The perceived size of an immigrant population has an impact on anti-immigrant prejudices, but the real size does not. Like many authors before us, we find that education reduces prejudice. However, we also find that around 10 percent of the total effect of education is a result of educated individuals' more accurate views about size of immigrant populations. In other words, the effect of education on prejudice is in part mediated by size perceptions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Job attitudes and well-being among public vs. private physicians: organizational justice and job control as mediators
AN  - 919903159; 201202490
AB  - Background: The present study examined whether there are differences in job-related attitudes and well-being among physicians working in private sector and public sector. In addition, we examined whether psychosocial factors (organizational justice and job control) could mediate these possible differences in different sectors. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data from the Finnish Health Professional Study was used. A random sample of Finnish physicians included 1522 women and 1047 men aged 25-65 years. Outcome variables were job satisfaction, organizational commitment, psychological distress, work ability and sleeping problems. Job control and organizational justice were measured using established questionnaires. Series of regression analyses were performed and the mediational effects were tested following the procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny. Results: Physicians working in private sector had higher levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment and lower levels of psychological distress and sleeping problems when compared with physicians working in public sector. Private physicians also had higher levels of organizational justice, which acted as a mediator behind more positive attitudes and better well-being in private sector. Private physicians had higher levels of job control but it did not act as a mediator. Conclusions: Private physicians feel better than public physicians and this is partly due to higher organizational justice in private sector. Public health care organizations should invest effort to increase the fairness in their organizations and management and pay more attention in improving the well-being of their employees, which could possibly increase the attractiveness of public sector as a career option.

T1  - The Impact of Stereotypical Versus Counterstereotypical Media Exemplars on Racial Attitudes, Causal Attributions, and Support for Affirmative Action
AN  - 896187025; 201120636
AB  - This study examines how exposure to media characters of color shapes viewers' opinions of race-targeted policies. Exemplar-based information processing, attribution theory, and heuristic policy decision-making formed the theoretical foundation for the study. A 2 * 2 factorial experiment (N = 363) exposed participants to stereotypical or counterstereotypical exemplars representing the in-group (Whites) and the out-group (Blacks). The experiment revealed that exposure to stereotypical African American media characters compared to exposure to counter-stereotypical ones influenced real-world beliefs of African American stereotypes, internal attributions for perceived failures of this out-group, prejudicial feelings toward this out-group, and lack of support for pro-minority affirmative action policies. A structural model established "internal attributions for out-group failures" as a crucial mediator. Implications for entertainment studies and political communication are discussed.

T1  - Attacks on Indian students: the commerce of denial in Australia
AN  - 1928305719
AB  - The issue of racist violence appeared in the Australian media and politics in mid-2009 following a spate of attacks on international students in Melbourne and Sydney. The racist aspect of these attacks was downplayed, authorities describing them as 'opportunistic' and a 'regrettable fact of urban life'. The denial of racism is a familiar hallmark of contemporary racism; for some scholars, it is a defining criterion of what has been called the 'new racism'. But the denial of racism around the attacks on Indian international students also had an economic imperative. Negative media coverage within India posed a substantial threat to the AUS$18.6 billion international education export market, with potential students and sponsors becoming concerned about their security should they elect to study in Australia. Data from the Challenging Racism project provide compelling evidence on the racist context of the attacks. The Indian media and politicians maintained an outraged position on the attacks, affecting student interest in Australia. And as the substantial economic costs became clearer, Australian governments came to more openly acknowledge a racist element to the attacks, also hinting at structural issues regarding community relations and attitudes which required policy attention.

T1  - Political bias in TV interviews
AN  - 870432886; 201114659
AB  - The study aims to provide empirical data on the alleged political bias of Dutch media. It also aims to contribute to the development of an instrument for the measurement of partiality in TV interviews. Its main question is: are TV interviewers biased in putting adversarial questions to politicians with different political backgrounds? The data collection encompasses 12 interviews taken from the late-night talk show Pauw & Witteman during the run-up to the parliamentary elections of 2006. The analysis focuses on five measures of adversarial questioning that were developed by Clayman et al. (2007): initiative, directness, assertiveness, opposition and accountability, as well as on a sixth measure that was developed in the context of this study, persistence. The results show that left-wing politicians are approached less adversarially than right-wing politicians and politicians in the political centre, even when various factors that might offer an alternative explanation are included in the analysis. The conclusion is that interviewers are partial in shaping the way in which politicians can present themselves to the public. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Reporting Conventions: Journalists, Activists, and the Thorny Struggle for Political Visibility
AN  - 759094533
AB  - This article draws upon 134 in-depth interviews with activists and journalists in an effort to reconcile the extensive activism taking place in the shadows of presidential campaigns with its near invisibility in the news. In his classic work, Todd Gitlin (1980) demonstrated that activists become newsworthy only by submitting to the "implicit rules of news making" (p. 3). This research supports his finding, but demonstrates that unbeknownst to activists, coverage of political outsiders is governed by a set of rules quite different from (and often diametrically opposed to) those employed in routine news-gathering. Taking cues from news creation practices that go on daily between journalists, parajournalists, and subjects, activist groups work assiduously to prepare members to fit the needs of political reporters. They bend over backwards to be media-friendly, which they perceive as professional, quotable, and credible, but ironically these studied attempts to conform to the norms of routine political reporting make them less  appealing to journalists. While journalists may attend eagerly to elected officials' press conferences and official statements, they demand authenticity , particularly in the form of emotion and spontaneity, from outsiders--the very attributes activists work to erase in their media trainings. In the end, the activist groups fail to obtain coverage, not because they can't conform to the rules of news making, but because they are following the wrong rules. This article maps the contradictory sets of norms at play in the negotiation over news, and shows how they work together to create nearly insurmountable cultural boundaries for political outsiders.
