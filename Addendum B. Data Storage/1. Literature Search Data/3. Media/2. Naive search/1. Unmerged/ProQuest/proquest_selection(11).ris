T1  - The segregated gun as an indicator of racism and representations in film
AN  - 2489910508
AB  - Film emphasizes an ironic history of racism in gun control and ownership and a justification for seeking justice among the Black community, but film also perpetuates structural racism and bias, segregating Black from White, and failing to promote equality, solidarity, and progress. The gun is both a symbol of structural racism, and an expression through which critical attitudes and political statements can carry greater meaning and lead to positive action, empowerment, and desegregation. The symbolic meaning of guns in the hands of Blacks as violent, exceptional or some other stereotypical character trope is illustrated using three selected films including: Django Unchained, John Q., and Proud Mary. This paper is divided into three acts: Act I: The gun as symbol of structural racism in film; Act II: Stereotypical characters and their guns; Act III: Desegregation of the gun in film. These sections illustrate the meaning and representation of the gun as a theatrical object in film, and when in the hands of stereotypical character tropes, has perpetuated racist beliefs and attitudes that have not been adequately addressed in the film industry. To desegregate the gun in film, filmmakers need to critically examine the overt and hidden film texts and how the gun, and the characters wielding it, are perceived among audiences.

T1  - The academic Trumpists: American professors who support the Trump presidency
AN  - 2420336201
AB  - The Trump presidency has been remarkable in its attacks on many mainstream institutions. It has tapped populist sentiment that reflects little confidence in the key decision-making centers in American society. Higher education has not escaped this attack. Indeed, criticism of the academy has gone well beyond the debated policies of affirmative action and political correctness to the very status of expert knowledge itself, questioning what is legitimate knowledge. Claims of “false data” and “alternative facts” parade in the public arena without the benefit of reasoned scholarship that might separate fact from fiction. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the attack on science, particularly scientific research focusing on environmental issues and climate change. Nonetheless, a small number of academicians—supposed arbiters of truth—advocate for Trump. How does one explain this apparent anomaly? Why would scholars support a president and populist movement that attack the very foundations of their professional life: knowledge and expertise? I have identified 103 such professors who offer their public support of Trump through blogs, essays, op-ed pieces, public lectures, tweets, YouTube videos, and even a couple of trade books. These are public intellectuals who intervene beyond the classroom and laboratory to promote a political agenda that is supportive of Trump. They are public advocates for Trump: academic Trumpists. Who are these individuals? Where do they teach? What do they teach? What kinds of connections external to the academy do they cultivate? How do they justify their support of Trump? This article offers some answers to these questions. It draws inspiration from Bourdieu’s field analysis of the politics of higher education and the sociology of conservative intellectuals.

T1  - Chapter 7: "I had to get tougher": An African Immigrant's (Counter)narrative of Language, Race, and Resistance
AN  - 2507952304
AB  - Background/Context: With the incessant wave of anti-Black and anti-immigrant sentiments, the extant political situation in the contemporary United States presents an ideal space, place, and time to investigate Black immigrant students' experiences and examine the ways in which dominant racial and linguistic ideologies shape their literate identities and position them in schools and society. While the Black immigrant population overall continues to increase, the Black immigrant student population in United States K–12 schools has experienced a steady upward trend. This student population shares some of the racialized experiences of Black American students but also reflects distinctive cultural, linguistic, and literate identities, and experiences that we, as educators, must acknowledge and embrace if we are to help them effectively navigate the educational and social terrain of the U.S. Purpose/Research Questions: The purpose of this article is to amplify (counter)narratives that highlight one adolescent African immigrant's (Noemi) identities and languages within and beyond school spaces, to exemplify the ways in which she utilizes alternative literacies to accommodate, and/or resist racial and immigration status-based microaggressions. The study was guided by the following questions: 1) What are Noemi's literacy, language, and identity practices in and beyond school spaces? 2) What are the ways in which she utilizes these practices to resist stereotypes and other forms of marginalization? Research Design: Utilizing a narrative case study approach, the article highlights the lived experiences of a single participant - Noemi. Narrative case study allowed me to intentionally give life to Noemi's stories regarding her home and school experiences, the ways in which she has been positioned due to her unique identity, language, and literacy practices, and her methods of resistance. Data Collection and Analysis: Data sources included two semistructured interviews and a Venn diagram that consisted of a comparison of the focal participant's home and school literacies. A relational content analysis was conducted using the information provided in the Venn diagram, and interview data were transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Critical race theory, a raciolinguistic perspective, and resistance theory were considered in the analysis and framing of the resulting counternarratives. Findings/Results: Noemi's counternarratives were characterized by three emergent themes: (a) being raised African in America, (b) racial literacies, music, and social media, and (c) race, language, and the sociopolitical climate. Each of the themes and their corresponding subthemes were supported by elements of critical race theory and a raciolinguistic perspective. In addition, Noemi's counternarratives consisted of numerous "clapbacks" (effective responses to criticisms, stereotypes, and dominant ideologies) that served as indicators of resistance. Conclusions/Recommendations: Noemi's counternarratives suggest three acknowledgments to be made. First, educators must acknowledge identity practices beyond those seen in academic spaces and tap into the vast metaknowledge of their immigrant populations. Second, we must not lose sight that dominant, hegemonic messages with regard to languages, literacies, and cultures are not only produced by the dominant group, but that they are also (re)produced by the media and nonwhite people to marginalize and maintain structural hierarchies. Therefore, critical conversations are needed with native nonwhite groups to prevent discriminatory practices and maltreatment of immigrant students. Finally, if we are to create equitable and socially just academic environments, educators must acknowledge manifestations of resistance (in its many forms) and use this knowledge to help transform schooling environments in which immigrants, like Noemi, are expected to thrive. They must also identify the ways in which they function as part of institutional norms, to create situations that require students to leverage "clapbacks" in schools.

T1  - Under siege?: Assessing public perceptions of the "War on Police"
AN  - 2355954193
AB  - Purpose A number of high-profile killings of police officers has occurred throughout the United States since 2014. These killings have led some police executives, politicians, and political commentators to suggest that a "war on police" is taking place. This narrative persists to the present day, although little is known regarding how the public perceives this phenomenon. The current study draws from theoretical perspectives on media consumption, institutional trust, and political orientations to understand these perceptions. Methods Using a national sample of American adults, a series of OLS regressions are used to examine correlates of public perceptions of the "war on police." Results Perceptions of the "war on police" are fairly pervasive. Political conservatism and trust in the police are both significantly, positively associated with these perceptions, while media consumption has inconsistent effects on perceptions. Findings from sensitivity analyses are consistent with those from the OLS models. Conclusions Findings highlight the relevance of multiple theoretical perspectives for understanding public perceptions of criminal justice-related political narratives. Further exploring linkages between perceptions of these contemporary narratives and policy preferences is necessary.

T1  - The Incidental Pundit: Who Talks Politics with Whom, and Why?
AN  - 2334698006
AB  - Informal discussion plays a crucial role in democracy, yet much of its value depends on diversity. We describe two models of political discussion. The purposive model holds that people typically select discussants who are knowledgeable and politically similar to them. The incidental model suggests that people talk politics for mostly idiosyncratic reasons, as by‐products of nonpolitical social processes. To adjudicate between these accounts, we draw on a unique, multisite, panel data set of whole networks, with information about many social relationships, attitudes, and demographics. This evidence permits a stronger foundation for inferences than more common egocentric methods. We find that incidental processes shape discussion networks much more powerfully than purposive ones. Respondents tended to report discussants with whom they share other relationships and characteristics, rather than based on expertise or political similarity, suggesting that stimulating discussion outside of echo chambers may be easier than previously thought.

T1  - The Internet and Its Potentials for Networking and Identity Seeking: A Study on ISIS
AN  - 2306222141
AB  - With the accelerating process of globalization and the development of its technological dimension, more and more opportunities and channels are available to the terrorist groups in the world to mobilize resources and advocates. “Islamic State of Iraq and Sham” (ISIS), as the most modern terrorist-excommunicative group (Takfiry), has been able to utilize the Internet and social networks highly adeptly. While ignoring the function of long-term structural and essential factors underlying the formation of ISIS, and also combining the networked society theory and triple forms of identities proposed by Manuel Castells with theoretical discussions on identity making, networking, and mobilization of media, the current article seeks to analyze the role of cyberspace and social networks as accelerating and opportunistic agents in mobilizing resources and disseminating ISIS. Using an explanatory analytical research method, the current article mainly intends to find a reply to the question: What has been the role of online social networks in connection with ISIS as an excommunicative and terrorist group? According to the research hypothesis, due to ISIS’s subtle, prevocational-emotional and targeted utilization of online social networks, the networks have played the role of an accelerator and opportunity maker in some areas including network building, guidance of public opinion, identity making, and the promotion of project identity of this terrorist group. The general conclusion obtained from the article is that ISIS, as the most terrifying and the most modern group equipped with cyber media, has been able to attract many forces out of fanatical religious groups, unemployed people, criminals, etc., worldwide. Additionally, with the recruitment of fanatics, ISIS has been able to accomplish identity making and network building. As a result, regional security and even security in Western countries is also highly endangered.

T1  - Polarization and Ideological Weaving in Twitter Discourse of Politicians
AN  - 2331596060
AB  - The form and functions of political discourse have considerably taken a new orientation with the evolving ways of communication. Twitter is a platform that is increasingly preferred by the political elites for the purpose of gaining public acclaim and propagating political ideologies. The political discourse on Twitter requires a critical attention toward linguistic structures and strategies to uncover the relationship between language and social practices. For this purpose, tweets of two eminent Pakistani political figures are chosen for unmasking a variety of discourse strategies at work from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (CDA) through the socio-cognitive model of ideological square. The analysis uncovers the hidden ideological structures and strategies realized through a number of rhetorical moves in the selected tweets. The cognitive binary of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation help achieving political domination and legitimization of political actions by controlling the public opinion. The underlying motives vary and are context bound such as the aims to topple a government or to restore public faith in the governance. This research is significant for political discourse analysts as well as the general public, as a means for analytical activism propagated by any CDA inquiry, and paves way for further research in the use of social media platforms for political purposes.

AB  - The rise in anti-migrant xenophobia, Islamophobia, and so-called populist nationalism in recent years has demonstrated the consequential effects of colonialism, nationalism, and globalisation in our contemporary world. Through the increasing interdependence and accelerating interconnection afforded by global media – especially social media – daily reports of violent conflicts reveal how entire communities and populations continue to be disenfranchised and excluded from the security and belonging that have conventionally been tied to citizenship and territoriality (Razack 2008 Razack, S., 2008.

T1  - Seeker Are You Protected? Social Media and Protection Granted to Women in Sri Lanka
AN  - 2292913231
AB  - Facebook, which revolutionized social networking, offers solid platforms for women freely to express and give life to their opinions on any subject they desire, from fashion to human rights, feminism to politics. As a result, a number of issues have arisen regarding the safety of social exposure, chief amongst them being the preservation of privacy. This study examines privacy concerns of female Facebook users in Sri Lanka (age group of 20-30) and the possible judicious measures that can be taken by government organizations regarding this matter. During the course of this research, a mixed methodology was adopted in data collection, which included 118 surveys and interviews. The general concern of Facebook privacy, attitudes and expectations was evaluated through the survey. Interviews were conducted with the goal of bringing attention to and evaluating the existing privacy protection mechanisms provided for Facebook users. The willingness displayed by many females to disclose personal views and information on Facebook has become a phenomenon which demonstrates breaking the silence and absolute freedom of expression. The survey revealed that a majority of the survey participants were pessimistic about Facebook security, even after the application of strict privacy settings. This paper concludes with a discussion of the proposed privacy protection, through amendments and reforms, which is viewed as part of the government's legal responsibility to uphold Facebook privacy and affirms the matriarchal cultural values of Sri Lanka, where the general expectation of young females is to raise a family that upholds virtue and family values. In turn, female mental and social security and the prevalence of freedom of expression ensure gender equality in Sri Lanka.

T1  - Extremists on the Left and Right Use Angry, Negative Language
AN  - 2249480460
AB  - We propose that political extremists use more negative language than moderates. Previous research found that conservatives report feeling happier than liberals and yet liberals “display greater happiness” in their language than do conservatives. However, some of the previous studies relied on questionable measures of political orientation and affective language, and no studies have examined whether political orientation and affective language are nonlinearly related. Revisiting the same contexts (Twitter, U.S. Congress), and adding three new ones (political organizations, news media, crowdsourced Americans), we found that the language of liberal and conservative extremists was more negative and angry in its emotional tone than that of moderates. Contrary to previous research, we found that liberal extremists’ language was more negative than that of conservative extremists. Additional analyses supported the explanation that extremists feel threatened by the activities of political rivals, and their angry, negative language represents efforts to communicate as much to others.

T1  - Empathy and social closeness toward refugees from Syria: The mediating role of cultural intelligence
AN  - 2241792013
AB  - The predictors of social closeness toward refugees are rarely examined. In this study (N = 337), higher cultural intelligence (CQ) and higher empathy were defined as predictors of higher social closeness (lower social distance [the Social Distance Scale] and warmer feelings [the Feeling Thermometer]) toward refugees from Syria. This is the target group of prejudice and intensive coverage in the European mass media. The obtained results indicated that other‐oriented empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) and the motivational CQ predicted higher social closeness and warmer feelings toward refugees from Syria. Empathic personal distress predicted lower social closeness and colder feelings toward this group. Motivational CQ consistently served as the mediator of the relationship between empathy dimensions and social closeness toward Syrian refugees. Our findings reveal the previously unexplored correlations between empathy dimensions and cultural intelligence factors, including the mediational effects in predicting social closeness toward Syrian refugees.

T1  - Boy With Toy or Black Male With Gun: An Analysis of Online News Articles Covering the Shooting of Tamir Rice
AN  - 2240119019
AB  - The current study explores how online media framed the police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, OH. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of a large sample of online news articles published in the first 48 hours following the event. In doing so, we consider how online media outlets used headlines, narrative, quotes, and images to frame this emerging story. We find that the online news media framed the shooting of Rice in ways that largely supported the official police narrative of the event. Rice was projected as a noncompliant and threatening subject and the police as reacting out of concerns for public safety. Unlike international sources, relatively few domestic news sources linked this incident to the larger issues of race and police use of force in the United States. The dominant frame promotes a moral evaluation of the event that downplays police responsibility and promotes localized, nonsystemic solutions as opposed to wide-spread policing reform.

T1  - Social Control Meets New Public Management: Examining the Diffusion of State Prison Privatization, 1979‐2010
AN  - 2236093123
AB  - While the merits and perils of privatization have remained a contentious and often polarizing debate, privatization of public services remains commonplace throughout the world. For instance, over the last several decades, U.S. governments at all levels have routinely pursued contracting arrangements for corrections management, known popularly as prison privatization. In this article, state prison privatization (SPP) is examined in three ways. First, we use an externally focused policy diffusion framework to help explain the adoption of SPP‐enabling legislation across U.S. states. Second, we explore the extent to which the American Legislative Exchange Council has influenced the adoption of prison privatization legislation. Third, we explore the role of state wealth inequality in determining a state's propensity to adopt prison privatization policies. Examining state‐level data from 1979 to 2010, this article finds empirical support for each of these key theoretical assertions. Furthermore, we find evidence that the external diffusion effect may vary depending on the political orientation of the state.Related ArticlesButz, Adam M., Michael P. Fix, and Joshua L.

Por ejemplo, durante las últimas décadas, los gobiernos de los EE. UU., en todos los niveles, han seguido de manera rutinaria los acuerdos de contratación para la gestión de correcciones, conocidos popularmente como privatización de prisiones. En este artículo, la privatización de prisiones estatales (SPP) se examina de tres maneras. Primero, usamos un marco de difusión de políticas con enfoque externo para ayudar a explicar la adopción de la legislación habilitada para SPP en todos los estados de EE. UU. En segundo lugar, exploramos hasta qué punto el Consejo de Intercambio Legislativo de los Estados Unidos ha influido en la adopción de la legislación sobre privatización de prisiones. En tercer lugar, exploramos el papel de la desigualdad de riqueza estatal en la determinación de la propensión de un estado a adoptar políticas de privatización de prisiones. Al examinar los datos a nivel estatal de 1979 a 2010, este estudio encuentra apoyo empírico para cada una de estas afirmaciones teóricas clave. Además, encontramos evidencia de que el efecto de difusión externa puede variar según la orientación política del estado.Alternate abstract:社会控制遇上新公共管理：检验1979‐2010年间各州监狱私有化扩散尽管私有化的优缺点仍然充满争议，且时常出现极化，但公共服务的私有化依然在全球都很普遍。例如，过去几十年来，美国各级政府都例行公事地为惩戒管理，即被广为知晓的监狱私有化，安排了外包。本文中，国家监狱私有化（SPP）经过了三种方式的检验。首先，笔者使用聚焦于外部的政策扩散框架，以帮助解释SPP立法在美国各州的广泛采纳。其次，笔者探索了美国立法交流委员会在何种程度上影响了监狱私有化立法的采纳。再次，笔者探索了财富不平等在确定各州采纳监狱私有化政策时的倾向一事上所产生的作用。通过检验1979‐2010年间的州级数据，笔者发现，外部扩散效果可能会因该州的政治倾向而产生差异。

T1  - Public Opposition to Sanctuary Cities in Texas: Criminal Threat or Immigration Threat?
AN  - 2230245585
AB  - ObjectivesTo assess predictors of sanctuary city attitudes in Texas. Specifically, to assess whether a criminal threat or immigration threat hypothesis better explains attitudes toward sanctuary cities.MethodsPooled representative sample surveys of Texas respondents conducted during the first half of 2017, combined with county‐level Census and crime data. Regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulations.ResultsCompared to the criminal threat hypothesis (as measured by county change in crime rates), the immigration threat hypothesis (as measured by Latino growth and Latino population) better explains Texans' attitudes toward sanctuary cities.ConclusionsDespite elite and media narratives linking sanctuary cities to crime, respondents' attitudes toward sanctuary cities are unrelated to physical crime threat and are structured by localized experience with immigration—specifically—Latino growth.

T1  - Screened Anxieties: Affect and Temporality in <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>
AN  - 2577067988
AB  - This essay examines attitudes toward the future in D. W. Griffith's film  The Birth of a Nation , focusing in particular on the opposed emotions hope and fear. In doing so, it establishes critical connections between the film's aesthetic philosophy – which is marked by an attempt to control its characters, its audience, and even history itself – and the film's troubling and much-discussed racial politics. Griffith's stated beliefs in the ability of cinema to fully capture the past and in turn to dictate to its audience the terms of the future, manifest themselves everywhere in  The Birth of a Nation not only thematically but formally. However, the film sets an impossible task for itself, and where it falls short, its own hopes and fears become dramatically visible. This failure indicates that  The Birth of a Nation is ultimately imbricated in the modernist episteme of uncertainty it works to deny and disavow.

T1  - The #Rhetoric of Waleed Aly's "Send Forgiveness Viral": Is Rogerian argumentation an appropriate response to racism?
AN  - 2221132262
AB  - In 2016, Waleed Aly, a prominent Muslim Australian academic and media personality, made an argument using the Twitter hashtag "Send Forgiveness Viral" that asked for empathy in the face of Islamophobia. While initially appealing, deeper consideration of his use of and appeal to his audience to use Rogerian strategies to combat racism presents problems. Can Rogerian argumentation strategies be utilized to combat racism? Using Aly's #SendForgivenessViral argument as a case study, this article evaluates Rogerian argumentation and empathic response in therapeutic situations compared to arguments about discrimination, particularly those taking place through social media. While scholarly writing by Lassner (1990) and Ede (1984) is dated, they provide pertinent and influential ideas to consider. More recent scholarship used to evaluate #SendForgivenessViral includes arguments on race, rhetoric, and Twitter revolutions by Brock (2012), D'Cruz (2017), Gerbaudo (2012), Margolin (2017), and Roose (2016). Other sources will be drawn from contemporary social media responses to Aly's segment. This article concludes that Aly's use of Rogerian argumentation is flawed because it places the onus of combatting racism onto victims. Furthermore, Rogerian argumentation models have underlying problems with power relations.

T1  - Insta-Politicos: Motivations for Following Political Leaders on Instagram
AN  - 2313791055
AB  - This study expands uses and gratifications research into the area of political Instagram use. A survey shows the motives for following political leaders on the social media platform and how followers’ motives are associated with their demographics and political attitudes. Findings indicate that information/guidance motives are the most important for following political leaders on Instagram, with social utility being the next highest motive. Also, males use Instagram more for social utility purposes than females, and having an entertainment motive is related to being young. The results also provide insight into how the politically active can be more influential on Instagram.

T1  - Was There a “Simple Soviet” Person? Debating the Politics and Sociology of “Homo Sovieticus”
AN  - 2297900617
AB  - Intellectual efforts to understand post-Crimean Russian society have brought to prominence explanations that emphasize psychological and attitudinal legacies of Soviet society. The recent revival of the term homo sovieticus (or Soviet man) in the media and intellectual discourse is a good illustration of this trend. Yurii Levada's late-Soviet sociological research project on the “simple Soviet man” serves as a frequent reference point in these discussions. In this article, I explore the ideological and analytical foundations of the Levada project and juxtapose the sociological construct developed by Levada and his team with the interpretative approach developed by Natalya Kozlova, another Soviet scholar who dedicated her life to studying Soviet society. I argue that essentialist and deterministic views of individual personality underpinning the Levada project that guide the current use of the Soviet man category are more politically and ideologically driven rather than being based on the state of the art in social psychology.

T1  - Postcolonial migrations in Russia: the racism, informality and discrimination nexus
TT  - Postcolonial migrations in Russia
AN  - 2184352528
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to contribute to the challenges of bringing postcolonial, racism and migration research into a meaningful dialogue. Based on the research examining migration from Central Asia into Russia, the paper analyses migration policy and the everyday experiences of migrants.Design/methodology/approachThe paper is based on mixed methodologies, including narrative, semi-structured and in-depth interviews with migrants from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in Russian cities and those who returned to their country of origin (over 300 people), interviews with representatives of NGOs, state officials and journalists in 2013–2016 and an analysis of the legislation and mass-media regarding migration from Central Asia.FindingsThe paper demonstrates that experiencing racism is a part of everyday life for migrants from Central Asia living in Russia. Whether this is in interactions with the state, fear of persecution on the street by the police or in the workplace, it is a constant factor. It argues that the political and everyday xenophobia and racism demonstrates deeply rooted imperial views in Russia’s inner politics and shapes attitudes toward migrants.Social implicationsThe paper contributes to broader debates on the linkages between migration and racism in Europe, in particularly questioning the positionality of migrants from “not-European” countries.Originality/valueMbembe’s approach to “let die” is pertinent in understanding postcolonial migration. Racism continually plays a role in “normalization” of abuse toward migrants and restrictive migration policy. Blaming “the migrant” for acting informally, draining healthcare resources and for posing a security risk provides a much-needed scapegoat for the state.

T1  - Poland: A Case of Top-Down Polarization
AN  - 2159538458
AB  - Poland represents a surprising case of democratic backsliding since the return to power of the PiS party in 2015, given that positive conditions associated with democracy are present—consistent strong per capita economic growth since 1989, moderate inequality, rising wages, strong preference for democracy, high levels of happiness, and a parliamentary system with proportional representation. The lack of strong underlying cleavages indicates the polarization was not bottom up. Instead, this article argues that polarization was driven from the top down by a segment of the political class that donned the cloak of radical populist anti-establishmentarianism to gain popular support, win an election, and rewrite the constitutional rules of the game to its own benefit. The Polish case points to the importance of elite cues, and especially the pernicious consequences of system-delegitimizing rhetoric, creating distrust in the media and institutions.

T1  - The Reception of Immigrants and Refugees in Western Countries: The Challenges of Our Time
AN  - 2151163790
AB  - In a rapidly changing world, the challenges of migration, as well as its potential benefits, are hotly debated. Recent years have seen new challenges as a result of unprecedented levels of migration, instability following the Global Financial Crisis, economic and security concerns surrounding immigration, and negative portrayals of immigrants by some Western leaders. These developments make it all the more important to understand the psychological processes underpinning attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, support for particular immigration policies and responses to changing policies, the role of portrayals of immigrants in the media, and the consequences of immigration attitudes and policies. This special issue brings together researchers interested in the topic of immigration from a psychological perspective, with a focus on understanding the reception of immigrants and refugees in Western countries. In this introductory article, we outline the background to this special issue and briefly describe each article included.

T1  - Towards a pragmatics of sexual media/networking devices
AN  - 2133338447
AB  - For a long time, the disciplinary organization of knowledge within the humanities and social sciences relied upon a distinction between representation and practice, generating analytic techniques that hive off textual analysis and literary criticism from the empirical study of sociocultural practices and behaviour. While exceptions to this division of expertise abound, especially in the context of recent work on affect, materiality and objects within interdisciplinary fields such as science and technology studies, media and communications, and cultural studies, the distinction continues to provide a basis for discriminating between different strands of sexuality research. For example, pornography scholarship has largely emanated from departments of film studies, literature and media, at least in the USA, while the empirical analysis of sex 'itself' has conventionally been the province of sociology, anthropology and related social and behavioural disciplines. The permeation of digital media and networking devices into all manner of everyday life pushes at the limits of these analytic silos, revealing their inadequacies, while the immense popularity and sexual social impacts of social media and geo-locative apps creates friction and problems for different analytic commitments - their preferences, prejudices and blind-spots - this, my contribution aims to think through and reformulate.

T1  - Trafficking in Human Beings: Made and Cut to Measure? Anti-trafficking Docufictions and the Production of Anti-trafficking Truths
AN  - 2133224972
AB  - This article responds to Gozdziak’s (2015: 30) call to explore how the knowledge that informs public debates about human trafficking is generated. Media imagery and narratives play a significant role in constructing both knowledge and ignorance. This article reflects on the construction of such knowledge by analysing how anti-trafficking docufiction videos from the Unchosen competition dramatize trafficking. We draw on Goffman’s (1974) work on frames to analyse how these videos present a simplified interpretation of reality, where certain constructed aspects of trafficking and exploitation are represented by video-makers as illustrating the general. In doing so, we highlight how anti-trafficking docufictions help efface everyday exploitation. The article contributes both to the empirical research on the construction of knowledge about trafficking, and to critical conceptual work on (anti)trafficking, exploitation and ignorance. It is part of a broader project to challenge exceptionalizing and individualizing representations of human trafficking – aiming to engage better with everyday exploitation.

AB  - The implicit association test (IAT) and concept of implicit bias have significantly influenced the scientific, institutional, and public discourse on racial prejudice. In spite of this, there has been little investigation of how ordinary people make sense of the IAT and the bias it claims to measure. This article examines the public understanding of this research through a discourse analysis of reactions to the IAT and implicit bias in the news media. It demonstrates the ways in which readers interpreted, related to, and negotiated the claims of IAT science in relation to socially shared and historically embedded concerns and identities. IAT science was discredited in accounts that evoked discourses about the marginality of academic preoccupations, and helped to position test‐takers as targets of an oppressive political correctness and psychologists as liberally biased. Alternatively, the IAT was understood to have revealed widely and deeply held biases towards racialized others, eliciting accounts that took the form of psychomoral confessionals. Such admissions of bias helped to constitute moral identities for readers that were firmly positioned against racial bias. Our findings are discussed in terms of their implications for using the IAT in prejudice reduction interventions, and communicating to the public about implicit bias.

T1  - Europe and refugees: 1938 and 2015-16
AN  - 2031358274
AB  - Ahonen attempts to provide some historical contextualization for the refugee crisis that has dominated much of European public and political debate since 2015. He draws comparisons between the crisis-ridden present and the decade of the previous century that was particularly laden with anticipation of disaster and doom: the 1930s. More specifically, his article explores parallels in public discussions of refugees by European political leaders and media commentators in 1938, on the one hand, and 2015-16, on the other. The coverage of 1938 focuses on the Evian Conference, organized to discuss the problem of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, while the analysis of 2015-16 concerns the period from the rapid acceleration of the refugee influx into Europe in the late summer of 2015 to the Brexit referendum of June 2016. Ahonen contends that, despite obvious and significant structural and contextual differences between the late 1930s and the mid-2010s, recent public discussions of the refugee crisis in Europe have closely resembled those conducted around the time of the Evian Conference. Fear and a sense of threat have been the dominant sentiments in the mid-2010s, as they were in the late 1930s, with many similarities in the language and analytical categories in which those sentiments have been publicly expressed. He also provides observations about the potential benefits and pitfalls of diachronic historical comparison, suggesting that an analysis of the failings of refugee policy during the 1930s can provide lessons for better practice today. Aggressive, racialist language about refugees of the kind that was common in the 1930s should have no place in today's public discourses in Europe. Awareness of the continuities that exist in this area can provide important historical perspective, highlighting the persistence of prejudice and the urgency of the need to reject and resist it.

T1  - The Migration-Crime Nexus and the Press in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom
AN  - 2148529957
AB  - This article explores the link between migrants and crime as portrayed in the European press. Examining conservative newspapers from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2016, the study situates the press coverage in each individual country within a comparative perspective that contrasts the frequency of the crime narrative to that of other prominent narratives, as well as to that in the other countries. The article also charts the prevalence of this narrative over time, followed by a discussion of which particular aspects of crime are most commonly referenced in each country. The findings suggest that while there has been no steady increase in the coverage of crime and migration, the press securitizes migration by focusing on crime through a shared emphasis on human trafficking and the non-European background of the perpetrators. However, other frames advanced in these newspapers, such as fraud or organized crime, comprise nationally distinctive characteristics.

T1  - Hopes and Fears: Community Cohesion and the ‘White Working Class’ in One of the ‘Failed Spaces’ of Multiculturalism
AN  - 2016183896
AB  - Since 2001, community cohesion has been an English policy concern, with accompanying media discourse portraying a supposed failure by Muslims to integrate. Latterly, academia has foregrounded White majority attitudes towards ethnic diversity, particularly those of the ‘White working class’. While questioning this categorisation, we present data on attitudes towards diversity from low income, mainly White areas within Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, a town portrayed in media discourse as one of the ‘failed spaces’ of multiculturalism. Drawing on mixed methods research, we present and discuss data that provide a complex message, seemingly confirming pessimistic analyses around ethnic diversity and predominantly White neighbourhoods but also highlighting an appetite within the same communities for greater and more productive inter-ethnic contact. Furthermore, anxieties about diversity and integration have largely failed to coalesce into broad support for organised anti-minority politics manifest in groups such as the English Defence League.

AN  - 2061876870
AB  - This article provides an overview on some of the key issues related to the Bleiburg commemoration and more broadly the cultural memory of Partisan crimes at the end of the Second World War. Drawing upon four years of fieldwork, media analysis, and recent historiographical debates, the authors take a transnational approach in examining why Bleiburg remains one of the most controversial commemorations not just in Croatia but in the region. The article focuses on historical narratives in the commemorative speeches, the role of space in shaping memory politics, symbols and monuments present at Bleiburg Field, and the broader context of how Austrian politics affects the commemoration and its public perception.

T1  - In-Group and Out-Group in Russian Political Cartoons: Research of the Latent Meanings of Narrative Conflict between Russia and the West: Politicheskie Issledovanii︠a︡
AN  - 2099450135
AB  - The article examines the invariant contents of Russian political cartoons, the representation of actual political processes in it and, most significantly, the implicit or masked aspects of sociopolitical life identified via content analysis of the caricature image. The author claims that the virtualization of politics has given humor an additional significance for contemporary political discourse. Despite the emergence of new genres, professional cartoons in the media are still the static-visual humor direction most in demand. Plots of political cartoons as well as of political humor in general often reflect conflict episodes of the relationship between in-group (for the artist and audience) and out-group. This is also true for the Russian cartoons, given the relatively high importance of state, cultural and national identity for Russian collective identity. As shown by the comparative-historical analysis, the representation of conflicts between Russians as in-group and the West / representatives of Western societies as out-group is typical for Russian cartoons. The profound meanings of the reflection of Russian cartoonists over this antagonism and the dynamics of the concentration on it are studied by the method of content analysis. This study revealed that since the “perestroika” time the interest to represent Western political actors in cartoons has decreased – the domestic events and processes became a priority. The attractiveness of the in-group representation declines over time, which indicates a more critical attitude to the Russian internal problems. With a greater overall attractiveness of Russian in-group, it is important to note that, as a result of content analysis, out-group representatives are shown as more impressive and presentable. The transfer of the in-group and the out-group antagonism from the foreign policy field to the internal policy field which is characteristic of the last decades, coupled with the polar ideological orientation of contemporary Russian cartoonists (including the attitude toward the West), indicates a low consolidation of Russian society.

AB  - The mass arrivals of political and economic migrants in Slovenia started when Hungary closed its border with Croatia. In this article, we analyze the reactions of parliamentary parties in Slovenia, focusing on the media statements of their leaders and members on the significant events since the beginning of mass arrivals of migrants to date: first arrivals of migrants to Slovenia, erection of fences on Slovenian-Croatian border, November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, protests against accommodation of minor migrants unaccompanied by adults in Student dorm in Kranj, proposal for consultative referendum on the acceptance of migrants in Slovenia and Act on amendments to the Aliens Act. We point out some of the most defining statements to show the political opinions of individual parties and compare the responses of these parties in the light of the political division between left-wing and right-wing politics as well as political division based on the urban-rural cleavage.Alternate abstract:Masovni prihodi političnih in ekonomskih migrantov v Slovenijo so se začeli, ko je Madžarska zaprla svojo mejo s Hrvaško.

T1  - East-west trans-mediatisation of terrorism and Islamophobia: Sydney siege and Peshawar massacre: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1979942594
AB  - This article interrogates the notions of terrorism and Islamophobia in two cultural sites. Deploying case study, the article examines the 15 December 2014 Lindt Café siege in Australia and the 16 December 2014 Army Public School massacre in Pakistan. These sites were selected for comparative analysis due to their concurrence and as concerns surrounding terrorism have been mostly West-centric. Findings show that despite socio-political differences, terror attacks in both states ignited activist movements such as 'Reclaim Pakistan' and 'Reclaim Australia', with both aiming to eradicate extremism. However, while the former focused on the need to reclaim the country from militants, the latter engaged in hate narratives about Islam and Muslims. Islamophobia was identified in Australia, with Taliban-phobia and rejection of Islamo-fascism in Pakistan, as Pakistanis negotiated their identities in a pluralistic Muslim world. The article suggests the need for both local and global processes that are culturally appropriate to mitigate terrorism.

AB  - This historical case study of violence in Canadian hockey examines media coverage of two manslaughter trials: the 1905 trial of Allan Loney and the 1907 trial of Charles Masson. Both players stood accused of killing opposing players by striking them in the head with their hockey sticks. In each case, the offending player was acquitted in the courts, mainly because such violence was deemed intrinsic to the sport. Injuries that resulted from violent acts were downplayed or ignored; even death from a deliberate stick attack could be rationalized as an unfortunate accident. Newspaper accounts of the deaths, trials, and subsequent acquittals offer valuable insight into the cultural narratives surrounding hockey violence and notions of masculinity in early twentieth-century Canada. These cases generated considerable debate around the issue of what constituted "clean" and "rough" hockey. The game reports, trial coverage, and public opinion examined in this case study suggest that stick-swinging incidents and aggressive play have been regarded as ordinary and "proper" aspects of "strenuous hockey" for more than a century. The historical examination of such cases is important because the justifications for violence that were articulated in the context of the deaths continue to be voiced in contemporary discussions of hockey violence. As long as fighting and aggression remain markers of masculinity - and hockey continues to be seen as a training ground for manhood - it will be difficult to remove such forms of violence from the sport.

T1  - Representations of East Asian students in the UK media
AN  - 2076977402
AB  - While several studies have explored the ways in which Asian young people have been represented in the UK media over recent years, the majority of these have focussed on those of Indian and Pakistani descent, and often in relation to the rise of Islamophobia in the aftermath of 9/11 and the bombings in London in July 2005. To date, there have been few studies that have focussed on East Asian young people in general or East Asian students in particular, despite the increasing importance of educational migration to the UK from China and neighbouring countries, and the growing number of East Asian pupils in UK schools and colleges. To start to redress this gap, this article explores the ways in which East Asian pupils and students were represented in the UK press between 2010 and 2015. It outlines the neo-colonial and neo-liberal narrative that is constructed about East Asian education and students; demonstrates that a clear distinction is drawn between British East Asians and their non-British counterparts, reflecting the differing economic status of the two groups; and argues that the media does not always 'manufacture consent' for government policy.

T1  - Sentiment analysis of political communication: combining a dictionary approach with crowdcoding
AN  - 1949496879
AB  - Sentiment is important in studies of news values, public opinion, negative campaigning or political polarization and an explosive expansion of digital textual data and fast progress in automated text analysis provide vast opportunities for innovative social science research. Unfortunately, tools currently available for automated sentiment analysis are mostly restricted to English texts and require considerable contextual adaption to produce valid results. We present a procedure for collecting fine-grained sentiment scores through crowdcoding to build a negative sentiment dictionary in a language and for a domain of choice. The dictionary enables the analysis of large text corpora that resource-intensive hand-coding struggles to cope with. We calculate the tonality of sentences from dictionary words and we validate these estimates with results from manual coding. The results show that the crowdbased dictionary provides efficient and valid measurement of sentiment. Empirical examples illustrate its use by analyzing the tonality of party statements and media reports.

T1  - WHOSE LIVES MATTER?: THE NATIONAL NEWSWORTHINESS OF POLICE KILLING UNARMED BLACKS
AN  - 2027572143
AB  - This study investigates the characteristics of cases of police killing unarmed Blacks that receive national news coverage. I analyze an original quantitative dataset measuring the parameters of 111 cases occurring between 2013 and 2015, and the amount of coverage they received in six national news outlets. Multivariate models indicate that cases' national newsworthiness is positively associated with Blacks' share of the population where the fatal encounter occurred, and the presence of video evidence, peaceful demonstrations, or civil lawsuits. National newsworthiness is negatively associated with encounters that were initiated by a call to police, and those involving decedents who resisted arrest, suffered electroshock injuries, or were impaired by drugs or alcohol. The findings strongly suggest that the most newsworthy cases are those that align with an injustice frame. I discuss the results using theories of newsworthiness, describing how patterns of story availability and story suitability might shape which cases rise to the top of the national agenda. Using the social construction of reality approach, I discuss the implications of the results for how the public understands the empirical nature of police killing unarmed Blacks, and the symbolic meaning of these events.

T1  - Body Image and Race on Gay Male-Targeted Blogs
AN  - 1952107265
AB  - The authors conducted a content analysis of 1,159 images of male models published on high-traffic gay male-oriented blogs. They focused on a range of body image-related variables, as well as the race of models. Results showed that most models were White and, almost uniformly, models had low levels of body fat. Models' level of muscularity varied significantly by race: Black models had the highest levels of muscularity, Asian models had the lowest levels of muscularity, and White and Latino models had moderate levels of muscularity. Drawing on existing research about race and body image, implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Hillary Clinton and the Media: From Expected Roles to the Critique of Feminism
AN  - 1949457041
AB  - In this paper, we analysed Hillary Clinton's relationship with the media starting from her first appointment at a US First Lady to her being the Democratic nominee for the US presidential elections in 2016. Thus, we analysed academic literature demonstrating Clinton's problems with the media bias, and then added our own discourse analysis of articles on Clinton and feminism in two main national newspapers that have consistently demonstrated the power of setting the agenda and forming public opinion in the U.S. - The Washington Post and The New York Times. Discourse analysis has been used to analyse 20 selected articles that discussed Clinton's feminist views in a period from September 2015 until September 2016, which was also a campaign period for 2016 U.S. elections. The findings add to the current research on the topic and show that the media undermined liberal feminism and its goals to undermine Hillary Clinton, whereas in the past Hillary was a subject of media criticism because of her refusal to fit into expected roles and be a supportive wife only. The discourse of criticism of Hillary Clinton has changed over time but every time with the same results, undermining the image and career advancement.

T1  - Readers' Comments as Popular Texts: Public Opinions of Paid Duty Policing in Canada
AN  - 2011217763
AB  - Despite paid-duty policing and associated public opinions being an increasingly controversial topic in Canadian news media, there has been limited research about them. This article combines discourse and content analyses to examine the public opinions towards paid-duty policing in Canada expressed in the online readers' comment sections of news articles. Conceptualizing comments as popular texts, the article discerns several themes, including police impartiality, reputation, expertise, and performance. Most comments centered on the economics of paid duty. The article concludes by considering why economics prevailed over other themes and reflects on core concepts in the literature on online comment boards, including interactivity and counter-publics.Alternate abstract:Il y a eu peu de recherches sur les services rémunérés de la police ou sur l'opinion publique envers ceux-ci, meme s'ils deviennent un sujet de plus en plus controversé dans les médias canadiens. Nous effectuons des analyses de discours et de contenu pour examiner les sections de commentaires en ligne accompagnant certains articles sur l'actualité. En envisageant ces commentaires comme textes populaires, nous discernons divers themes relatifs a la police, y compris son impartialité, sa reputation, sa competence et sa performance. La plupart des commentaires font mention de l'économie des services rémunérés. Nous terminons notre article en considérant pourquoi l'économie a prévalu sur d'autres themes dans les commentaires en ligne et en nous interrogeant sur des concepts centraux dans la recherche sur ce sujet tels que l'interactivité et les contre-publics.

T1  - Media Use, Democratic Values, and Political Participation: Empirical Evidence from Taiwan
AN  - 1925773882
AB  - This paper extends understanding of the relationship between media use and attitudes toward democratic values. We employ the two-step estimation approach to examine the relationship between media use and attitudes toward democratic values as well as consequential association with political participation. The empirical results show that media use to obtain news information is positively related to attitudes toward democratic values. The findings also note that attitudes toward democratic values are positively associated with engagement in politics. The results support the argument that media use is significant for shaping citizens' attitudes toward democratic values by providing information about public affairs and expanding citizens' understanding about democratic politics. As such, media use facilitates democratic socialization and leads to more involvement in political behaviors.

T1  - Negotiating meaning through costume and social media in Bulgarian Muslims’ communities of practice
AN  - 2697560355
AB  - This paper shows how contemporary believers are negotiating a new identity of Islamic piety in Bulgarian Muslim communities. Driven by communal memory of repression and contemporary Islamophobia, Bulgarian Muslims have created communities of practice (Wenger 1998), participatory groups that share a common interest in learning more about their faith. Communities function on multiple levels: there are small pockets of Islamic activity at the local level, and at a broader level, an imagined community of Bulgarian-speaking Muslims connected to an imagined global Islamic community, the ummah. The practices examined here include face-to-face activities, such as learning to read the Qur'an and prayers in Arabic, learning Islamic principles and practice, and talking about faith in mosques and homes in Bulgaria. This paper also examines virtual practices, such as discussing faith on social media. The article focuses on women's and girls’ Qur'an reading groups and discussions about wearing hijab, and it examines an online mixed-gender discussion of daily prayers. Such grassroots practice of Islam fosters a newly articulate and participatory version of religion, embracing and encouraging believers’ literacy and knowledge, activism, and agency. The mutual goals, repertoires, and activities of this community of practice create a sense of commonality and cohesiveness, while leaving room for some diversity of focus.

T1  - Building authentic power: a study of the campaign to repeal Connecticut's death penalty
AN  - 2571079015
AB  - Persistent public support for capital punishment and constraints on political elites in the US breed skepticism over grassroots campaigns’ ability to have much impact on this policy. Andrew Hammel advances this point in his study of successful efforts in Europe to repeal the death penalty and the lack of success in the US, where opportunities for repeal seem minimal. We challenge this view by offering the 2012 campaign to repeal Connecticut's death penalty as a counterexample. Drawing on legislative, campaign, and media source documents, we provide a case study of this campaign. Particularly important in the Connecticut campaign was the participation of murder victims’ families and communities of color, who exercised what we term authentic power: the extent that a group harmed by a policy can get policy-makers and other government officials to acknowledge this harm and, ultimately, to change the policy to the group's benefit. Elites face limits in their ability to end the death penalty and enact criminal justice reforms, but the Connecticut example suggests a greater role than previously imagined for authentic power in overcoming these limits.

T1  - Media Portrayal of the Nursing Homes Sector: A Longitudinal Analysis of 51 U.S. Newspapers
AN  - 1943623368
AB  - Purpose: Most Americans' low opinion of the nursing home (NH) sector could derive, in part, from the way in which it is portrayed in the media. This study furthers understanding of media portrayal of the NH sector by identifying how NHs were depicted in 51U.S. newspapers from 1999 to 2008. Design and methods: Keyword searches of the LexisNexis database were performed to identify 16,280 NH-related articles. Article content was analyzed, and tone, themes, prominence, and central actor were assessed. Basic frequencies and descriptive statistics were used to examine article content across regions, market type, and over time. Results: Findings reveal considerably less NH coverage in the Western United States and a steady decline in NH coverage nationally over time. Most articles were news stories; more than one third were located on the front page of the newspaper or section. Most articles focused on NH industry and government interests, very few on residents/family and community concerns. Most articles were neutral or negative in tone; very few were positive or mixed. Common themes included quality, financing, and legal concerns. Tone, themes, and other article attributes varied across region, market type, and over time. Implications: Overall, findings reveal changes in how newspapers framed NH coverage, not only with respect to tone but also with respect to what dimensions of this complex issue have been emphasized during the time period analyzed. Variation in media coverage may contribute to differences in government and public views toward the NH sector across regions and over time.

T1  - Media Representations of Racism and Spatial Mobility: Young Muslim (Un)belonging in a Post-Cronulla Riot Sutherland
AN  - 1923055625
AB  - Young Australian Muslims living in Sydney have been influenced by the Cronulla riot. Online surveys (n: 76) and interviews (n: 10) reveal the impact on their engagement with the Sutherland region around Cronulla, detectable a decade after this event. The exclusionary intent of the rioters and their sympathisers was a racist form of spatial management that had both specific and general aims. The Australian news media contribute to the ethnic purification that was originally intended by the Cronulla riots. This reduces mobility among an 'ethnic other' in accessing spaces that have been portrayed as 'racist' - or, in the case of young Muslims, 'Islamophobic'. Findings demonstrate the ongoing consequences of a wide-scale racist attack, like the Cronulla riot, on urban citizenship. Representations of the Cronulla riot are a repertoire of learning for young Sydney Muslims that rehearse what has been conceptualised as pedagogies of (un)belonging by Noble and Poynting [(2010). White Lines: The Intercultural Politics of Everyday Movement in Social Spaces. Journal of Intercultural Studies, 31, 489-505]. We have extended the application of this concept to a specific space and point to the means by which constructions of unbelonging are reinforced and made material. Processes of repetition and accumulations identified by Butler and Essed highlight how this enduring pedagogy of spatial unbelonging is maintained by media representations of places as Islamophobic.

T1  - Demonstrating Power: How Protest Persuades Political Representatives
AN  - 1891767860
AB  - How do public opinion signals affect political representatives' opinion formation? To date, we have only limited knowledge about this essential representative process. In this article, we theorize and examine the signaling strength of one type of societal signal: protest. We do so by means of an innovative experiment conducted among Belgian national and regional politicians. Elected officials were exposed to manipulated television news items covering a protest demonstration. Following Tilly's previously untested WUNC claim, four features of the event were manipulated: the demonstrators' worthiness, unity, numerical strength, and commitment. We argue that these protest features present elected officials with useful cues about what (a segment of) the public wants. We find that these cues affect elected officials' beliefs. The salience they attach to the protest issue, the position they take, and their intended actions all change as a consequence of exposure. The size of a protest event (numbers) and whether the protesters agree among themselves (unity) are the most persuasive protest factors. The effects of the protest signals come on top of strong receiver effects. We find no evidence that elected officials' predispositions moderate the effects of the protest features.

T1  - The long shadows of the difficult past? How young people in Denmark, Finland and Germany remember WWII
AN  - 1856694612
AB  - This paper focuses on the question of how young people today evaluate the Second World War today and how this 'difficult past' determines their political attitudes. Furthermore, the channels through which the current young generation in Europe is informed about the events dating back to the first half of the twentieth century (e.g. parents and grandparents, schools, the media) are examined. The theoretical basis chosen for addressing these questions is the work of Mannheim (1928) on the formation of successive generations, and the theories of collective memories and identities of Eisenstadt and his followers. Our empirical evidence comes from a transnational comparison of young people's memories of this difficult past in Denmark, Finland and Germany. From a historical perspective a comparison of the three countries is particularly interesting as they played different roles during the Second World War. The evidence highlights the different perceptions of history among youth and points to the absence of a common European understanding of what happened between 1939 and 1945. The empirical evidence comes from a research project (2011-2015) funded by the European Commission and covering 14 European countries. Its main focus has been on present-day young people's perceptions of history and politics (MYPLACE = Memory, Youth, Political Legacy and Civic Engagement).

T1  - Swearing Effects on Citizen-to-Citizen Commenting Online: A Large-Scale Exploration of Political Versus Nonpolitical Online News Sites
AN  - 1856537091
AB  - Swearing, the use of taboo languages tagged with a high level of emotional arousal, has become commonplace in contemporary political culture. The current study attempts to understand the ways in which swearing influences citizen-to-citizen news commenting online. Based on a large corpus of the 2-month user comments from 26 news websites in South Korea, the study examines swearing effects as well as its interplay with anonymity on garnering public attention and shaping other users' perceptions of the comments. Findings suggest that swearing generally has a positive effect on increasing user attention to comments as well as gaining other users' approvals. Comparisons between political and nonpolitical topics further suggest that swearing effect on gaining public attention is particularly prominent for political discussions. In contrast, the magnitude of change toward positive valence in public perception to comments is much greater for nonpolitical topics than for politics. From the findings, we conclude that an acceptable degree of swearing norms in online discussions vary across news topical arenas. The results also lead to discussions about the possibility of like-minded exposure to political comments as a default condition for online discussions. Finally, the study highlights the role of high-arousal emotions in shaping discursive participation in contemporary networked sociodigital environment.

T1  - Getting the mob angry: The satire of Masa Enfurecida as political incorrectness in social networking
AN  - 1920093676
AB  - Since Ancient Greece satirists are feared figures in any group articulation. Often protected by anonymity, authors have defied political and social order with a harsh and unpleasant sense of humour, which pushes the limits of political correction. This form based in breaking news and everyday life has a particularly suitable space in new media. Twitter, by means of its promptness and need for concision, could be considered a perfect ground for this kind of humour. Provocation and censorship of political attitudes are the objectives of many twitter accounts whose followers echo by commenting and retweeting. Interactivity allows the production of a text without closure which interweaves a myriad of positions, different from the voice of the satirist. My case study is the Twitter account Masa Enfurecida, which targeted for five years the Spanish political and social everyday life by quoting and reversing public messages. With close to 124.000 followers, @masaenfurecida, an anonymous account, impacts political debate and influences popular communication as some repeated expressions become part of the talk of the day. The tweets of Masa Enfurecida are brief pieces that can be considered a pure form of satire, which is transformed in the chains of answers and retweets of the followers.

T1  - The Komagata Through a Media Lens: Racial, Economic, and Political Threat in Newspaper Coverage of the 1914 Komagata Maru Affair
AN  - 1897672802
AB  - As part of its 'white Canada' policy, Canadian officials denied entry to 376 Indian immigrants who arrived aboard the Komagata Maru in 1914. Although the Komagata Maru affair was among the first Canadian immigration controversies to generate international media coverage, little is known about the nature of this coverage. In this paper, we examine the extent to which media coverage of the event reflected a range of racial (Orientalism; Canada's white destiny), political (the British Empire and Indian nationalism), and economic threat (economic depression, wage competition) ideologies. Our analysis of 193 newspaper articles published between May 5th and July 30th, 1914 finds that most articles emphasize the political implications, followed by race, and then by economic competition. By portraying the passengers not only as radicals but also as threats to the very fabric of the British Empire, the media delegitimized the migrants' claims to move freely within it. Alternate abstract:Dans le cadre de sa politique sur le ''Canada Blanc'', les fonctionnaires canadiens ont refusé l'entrée de 376 immigrants indiens arrivés à bord de Komagata Maru en 1914. Bien que l'affaire Komagata Maru fût l'une des premières controverses de l'immigration canadienne à susciter la couverture médiatique internationale, on connait peu dans la nature de cette couverture. Dans cet article, nous examinons comment la couverture médiatique d'un évènement peut avoir des retombées idéologiques d'ordre raciale (orientalisme, destinée du Canada blanc) ; politique (l'empire britannique et nationalisme indien) ; et menaces économiques (dépression économique, compétition salariale). Notre analyse de 193 articles de journaux publiés entre le 5 mai et le 30 juillet 1914, démontre que la majorité des articles insiste sur les implications politiques, suivies par la race et puis par la compétition économique. En représentant les passagers non seulement comme des radicaux, mais aussi comme des menaces pour le très construit empire britannique, les media délégitiment les revendications des migrants de circuler librement dans le pays.

T1  - Ideological Heterogeneity and the Rise of Donald Trump
AN  - 1871674423
AB  - In the days after the 2016 election, a variety of explanations has been offered to explain Donald Trump’s unique ascendancy in American politics. Scholars have discussed Trump’s appeal to rural voters, his hybrid media campaign strategy, shifts in voter turnout, Hillary Clinton’s campaign advertising strategy, economic anxiety, differences in sexist and racist attitudes among Trump voters and so forth. Here, we add another key factor to the conversation: Trump’s appeal to a smaller, often ignored, segment of the electorate: populist voters. Building upon our previous work - demonstrating that while American political elites compete across a single dimension of conflict, the American people organize their attitudes around two distinct dimensions, one economic and one social - we use 2008 American National Elections Study (ANES) data and 2016 ANES primary election data to show that populist support for Trump, and nationalist policies themselves, help us to understand how Trump captured the Republican nomination and the White House.

T1  - The Catalan Independence Process and Cold Repression (2003-2016): Treatises and Documents : Journal of Ethnic Studies
TT  - Katalonski proces osamosvajanja in hladna represija (2003-2016)
AN  - 1866457367
AB  - The recent Catalan independence process has already attracted a great deal of scholarly attention, quite apart from the media coverage. Some good chronologies are available, making it superfluous to present another, albeit more updated one. Opinion polls and surveys, as well as election results, have been analysed, as have the upheavals suffered by most political parties. The paper highlights and documents some apparently lesser-disseminated aspects of the process. Special attention is devoted to the cold repression, or deactivating mechanisms, that the Spanish authorities have put in place, with varying degrees of success. The paper asks to what extent these strategies are likely to solve the current conflict with Catalonia, and whether they are all admissible in a modern (western) democracy. In the conclusion the long-term effectiveness of such mechanisms, in practice, will be discussed, in the face of the clash between democratic legitimacy and the legal constraints of a Constitution written shortly after the end of a 36-year-long dictatorship.Alternate abstract:Ceprav se ni dolgo aktualno, je vprasanje katalonske neodvisnosti vzbudiloprecejsnjopozornost strokovnjakov v nasprotju z mediji, ki o tem niso veliko porocali.

T1  - The Dragon Shapes Its Image: A Study of Chinese Media Influence Strategies in Africa
AN  - 1863563283
AB  - As China continues its human, cultural and commercial expansion into Africa it has a clear strategic interest in managing its image on the continent. The leadership in both its government and private sectors know China must find ways to counteract negative reports that accuse China and some African leaders and their regimes of being complicit in China's accelerating exploitation of African labor and resources, undermining and weakening regulatory controls, and illegal profiteering in their countries. In addition, there are continuing attempts by Western media to portray China as the new colonizer in Africa, creating a perception that China is the new bully on the block, and positioning it as a country that should be watched and monitored with suspicion regarding its Africa intentions. It would appear that the continued expansion of Chinese trade and investment in Africa will depend on China's success in developing and deploying a vigorous "soft" and "smart power" strategy that counters such allegations and media representations. This paper examines the extant research on Chinese government media-related strategies in Africa, suggesting directions future research on this topic might take.

T1  - Nonverbal Communication in Politics: PROD
AN  - 1851014228
AB  - This article reviews research contributions in political science and communication to the topic of nonverbal communication and politics from 2005 to 2015. The review opens with research on the content of nonverbal communication, then considers studies examining what moderates the impact of nonverbal aspects of political messages on attitudes and behavior and the mechanisms that underpin these effects. Over the period reviewed here, research shows that the nonverbal channel is rich in political information and is consequential for political decision making, particularly under certain circumstances, such as in low-information conditions. Visuals affect political decisions through cognitive and emotional routes. This review article also identifies several directions where further research is required, particularly with regard to social media, nonvisual aspects of nonverbal communication, the interplay of visual and verbal arguments, and the mechanisms behind the effects of nonverbal communication.

T1  - Risk and resilience in British Muslim communities
AN  - 1827655849
AB  - This article presents findings from a survey of British Muslims communities. It employs the research frameworks of risk, hate crime and grounded theory to examine 'everyday' experiences of victimization and discrimination and the perceived complicity of the British media in creating adverse social conditions for Muslim communities. The article also examines the rather surprising descriptions of agency, personal strength and coping offered by the research participants when discussing their reactions to experiences of hate crime and prejudice. An examination of these reactions was informed by emerging psychological and sociological literatures concerning the concept of resilience.

T1  - What's the Score?: A Content Analysis of Mature Adults in Super Bowl Commercials
AN  - 1827659972
AB  - Based on the rising mature adult population (those aged 65+), the importance of advertisers recognizing this consumer group is imperative to businesses and consumers alike. Thus, this content analysis of 272 Super Bowl commercials, from the last 5 years (2010-2014), applied framing theory to examine how mature audiences are represented in one of the most expensive and highly viewed advertising venues. Previous research suggests that older adults are typically underrepresented in all media and often stereotyped. This study shows the opposite is true for recent Super Bowl commercials. Mature adults are prominently featured in nearly one-third (31.99%) of all ads analyzed-more than double their proportion in the general population and Super Bowl audience-and are framed most often in a positive light (80.49%). This indicates a promising shift from depictions that alienate to a more inclusive culture where mature adults are part of the media landscape and recognized as a key consumer base. Results do show, however, that women and minorities (especially Hispanics/Latinos) continue to be significantly under-represented.

T1  - Examining Characteristics of Opinion Leaders in Social Media: A Motivational Approach
AN  - 2342305610
AB  - Social networking sites offer various opportunities to express opinions on politics and public affairs and to disseminate information to a large circle of acquaintances. The present research aims to identify the characteristics of people who consider themselves as opinion leaders on these new channels, the features they use in order to influence others, and the psychological motives they pursue. A survey (N = 527) among Facebook users identified political interest and personality strength as significant predictors of perceived Facebook opinion leadership, while the influence of extraversion was not significant. Those who write private messages on political debates do this in order to raise awareness of specific topics, while opinion expression in public status updates is also strongly connected to self-presentational goals (impression motivation). Moreover, the motives of presenting oneself positively and convincing others are particularly important for people with high personality strength. The present findings extend previous knowledge by redefining the concept of opinion leadership in new media environments and describing motivational links between individuals’ predispositions and their activities to influence others’ opinions. On a practical level, the pronounced role of self-presentational motives is likely to have important implications for the dynamics of public debates in social media.

T1  - Breaking Out of the Lab: Measuring Real-Time Responses to Televised Political Content in Real-World Settings
AN  - 1795915639
AB  - Real-time response (RTR) measurement is an important technique for analyzing human processing of electronic media stimuli. Although it has been demonstrated that RTR data are reliable and internally valid, some argue that they lack external validity. The reason for this is that RTR measurement is restricted to a laboratory environment due to its technical requirements. This paper introduces a smartphone app that 1) captures real-time responses using the dial technique and 2) provides a solution for one of the most important problems in RTR measurement, the (automatic) synchronization of RTR data. In addition, it explores the reliability and validity of mobile RTR measurement by comparing the realtime reactions of two samples of young and well-educated voters to the 2013 German televised debate. Whereas the first sample participated in a classical laboratory study, the second sample was equipped with our mobile RTR system and watched the debate at home. Results indicate that the mobile RTR system yields similar results to the lab-based RTR measurement, providing evidence that laboratory studies using RTR are externally valid. In particular, the argument that the artificial reception situation creates artificial results has to be questioned. In addition, we conclude that RTR measurement outside the lab is possible. Hence, mobile RTR opens the door for large-scale studies to better understand the processing and impact of electronic media content. [web URL: http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/2/542.abstract]

T1  - Muslim neighbors or an Islamic threat? A constructionist framing analysis of newspaper coverage of mosque controversies
AN  - 1791353920
AB  - In recent years, growing communities of Muslim-Americans have faced tension in a series of debates over the construction of Islamic prayer spaces in American cities. Islamic community members have found themselves fighting for representation within the political process and for their philosophical right to exist within American society. This study presents a framing analysis of the debate in five US newspapers between 2010 and 2013 as a way of examining the position of Muslims within contemporary American society. The study examines five frames: Local Regulation, Legal Authority, Political Debate, Muslim Neighbors, and Islamic Threat. The first three were episodic frames, while the other two were thematic. Some of the discourse showed evidence of Islamophobia, or indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims. Other stories showed evidence of Islamophilia, which is the stereotypical presentation of 'good Muslims' who are model citizens in contrast to the 'bad Muslims' who serve as rhetorical enemies.

T1  - From "brute" to "thug:" The demonization and criminalization of unarmed Black male victims in America
AN  - 1768022922
AB  - The synonymy of Blackness with criminality is not a new phenomenon in America. Documented historical accounts have shown how myths, stereotypes, and racist ideologies led to discriminatory policies and court rulings that fueled racial violence in the post-Reconstruction era and have culminated in the exponential increase of Black male incarceration today. Misconceptions and prejudices manufactured and disseminated through various channels such as the media included references to a "brute" image of Black males. In the 21st century, this negative imagery of Black males has frequently utilized the negative connotation of the terminology "thug." In recent years, law enforcement agencies have unreasonably used deadly force on Black males allegedly considered to be "suspects" or "persons of interest." The exploitation of these often-targeted victims' criminal records, physical appearances, or misperceived attributes has been used to justify their unlawful deaths. Despite the connection between disproportionate criminality and Black masculinity, little research has been done on how unarmed Black male victims, particularly but not exclusively at the hands of law enforcement, have been posthumously criminalized. This article investigates the historical criminalization of Black males and its connection to contemporary unarmed victims of law enforcement. Action research methodology in the data collection process is utilized to interpret how Black male victims are portrayed by traditional mass media, particularly through the use of language, in ways that marginalize and devictimize these individuals. This study also aims to elucidate a contemporary understanding of race relations, racism, and the plight of the Black male in a 21-century "postracial" America.

T1  - The quest for balanced reporting on China in the EU media: Forces and influences: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2039037442
AB  - Local media in any country that is the target of soft power actions is usually the most influential force in shaping public opinion and perceptions of the other country, its culture and its people. Therefore countries should pay particular attention to foreign journalists working within their borders. This study begins by looking at the Chinese point of view and then examines some of the forces and influences at work behind the scenes that affect the coverage of China in European media, such as conditions for EU journalists working in China, lack of transparency and access to information, pressures from the audience, editors and owners at home, as well as the diverging views on the role of journalists in Europe and China. Finally, it presents some insights on how what appears to be a deteriorating relationship can be improved for the benefit of all concerned.

T1  - Fair and Balanced? Quantifying Media Bias through Crowdsourced Content Analysis
AN  - 1786556770
AB  - It is widely thought that news organizations exhibit ideological bias, but rigorously quantifying such slant has proven methodologically challenging. Through a combination of machine-learning and crowdsourcing techniques, we investigate the selection and framing of political issues in fifteen major US news outlets. Starting with 803,146 news stories published over twelve months, we first used supervised learning algorithms to identify the 14 percent of articles pertaining to political events. We then recruited 749 online human judges to classify a random subset of 10,502 of these political articles according to topic and ideological position. Our analysis yields an ideological ordering of outlets consistent with prior work. However, news outlets are considerably more similar than generally believed. Specifically, with the exception of political scandals, major news organizations present topics in a largely nonpartisan manner, casting neither Democrats nor Republicans in a particularly favorable or unfavorable light. Moreover, again with the exception of political scandals, little evidence exists of systematic differences in story selection, with all major news outlets covering a wide variety of topics with frequency largely unrelated to the outlet's ideological position. Finally, news organizations express their ideological bias not by directly advocating for a preferred political party, but rather by disproportionately criticizing one side, a convention that further moderates overall differences.

T1  - Masking fears: SARS and the politics of public health in China
AN  - 1733940856
AB  - This paper examines shifts in attitudes to mask-wearing during and in the aftermath of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 2002-2003. In the PRC, as throughout East Asia, face masks were widely adopted as a practical preventative measure. However, the ubiquitous image of the masked Chinese citizen in both the Chinese and international media also acquired a political resonance. Masks were equated with the Party's attempts to censure dissent and 'cover up' the epidemic. A perceived lack of government transparency, at least in the initial phase of SARS, recalled earlier public health incidents and episodes of public dissension, notably the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Drawing on samples of qualitative data from a broad range of Chinese and English language sources, the paper shows how debates about mask-wearing in China during SARS became intertwined with political concerns, reflecting a tension between the Party's liberalizing policy -- epitomized by the country's admission to membership of the World Trade Organization in December 2001 -- and real anxieties about the consequential 'fall-out' of this new openness. The paper concludes by arguing for an approach to public health which incorporates a critical capacity, particularly in relation to the ways in which political contexts may determine responses to epidemic episodes.

T1  - Japan Addresses the Global HIV/AIDS Crisis: The Roles of Media and Civil Society in Shaping Perceptions and Aid
AN  - 1752994726; 201600573
AB  - Japan's response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s was lukewarm, due mainly to the absence of a domestic perception of AIDS as an immediate threat. The key determinants of that perception were rare cases of AIDS infections in Japan, a detrimental media role, and weak civil society. Japanese media contributed to shaping a flawed image of AIDS as a foreign disease or a disease of homosexuality and promiscuity. Moreover, civil society organizations were not strong enough to create momentum for reformulating the distorted perception or catalyzing specific policies. Not until the early 1990s did Japan's global AIDS funding increase. The policy shift was in tandem with the rising influence of newly emerged civil activist groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Moving up. Applying aggregate level time series analysis in the study of media coverage
AN  - 1550070871
AB  - In this article the advantages of aggregate level time series analysis for the study of media coverage are discussed. This type of analysis offers the opportunity to answer questions relating to causes and effects of media attention for issues and all kind of other content characteristics. Data that ask for a time series approach have become widely available during the past years, due to the rise of digital archives and social media such as Twitter and Facebook. This type of analysis allows for answering a set of interesting research questions and strong inferences about causal processes. Common challenges in time series analysis, relating to stationarity, accounting for a series' past and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity are discussed. Two useful approaches, ARIMA and VAR, are introduced stepwise. An empirical example, dealing with intermedia agenda-setting between different newspapers in the Netherlands, demonstrates how both techniques can be applied and how they provide insightful answers to interesting research problems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Presumed Online Media Influence and Support for Censorship: Results from a Survey among German Parliamentarians
AN  - 1792390681
AB  - The consequences of perceived media influences have been examined in numerous studies on the third-person effect and the influence of presumed media influence approach. One consequence, namely the support for media censorship, is viewed as the "gold standard": Individuals demand to limit the power of the media because they perceive a strong and negative media impact on other people. Finally, previous research concerning the support for censorship as a result of presumed influences was focused on content that was perceived to have explicitly harmful effects.

T1  - Promoting Civil Discourse Through Search Engine Diversity
AN  - 1531934075; 201422706
AB  - The ability of modern web services such as news aggregators and search engines to tailor their results to the tastes of individuals, together with people's preference for reading opinions which reinforce their own viewpoints, have raised concerns that people are nowadays exposed to a narrow range of view-points, a phenomenon referred to as the 'filter bubble'. In this paper we focus on increasing exposure to varied political opinions with a goal of improving civil discourse. We develop a method to algorithmically encourage people to read diverse political opinions and test it when people actively seek information. First, analyzing data from a popular search engine we show that people are indeed more likely to read opinions consistent with their own. Interestingly, they are more likely to read news from opposing sites when the language model of a particular news item is close to the language model of their own political leaning. Based on this finding, we describe a method for assisting people to read divergent opinions by choosing documents of opposing viewpoints that have a language model closer to their own language model. We test our method on a number of web searchers and show that pages of the opposing side which were more similar than the average persons' own language model tended to be clicked 38% more than those below. We also describe the long-term effects of our method, showing that people who were shown more diverse results continued reading more diverse results and overall became more interested in news.

T1  - Beliefs About the Strauss-Kahn Case in France and Germany: Political Orientation and Sexual Aggression Myths as Local Versus Global Predictors
AN  - 1767327714; 201610759
AB  - In May 2011, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund and a prominent member of the French Socialist Party, was charged with attempted rape. Extensive media coverage led people across the globe to speculate about intentions and responsibilities. While the case was pending, we conducted two parallel Internet surveys, with French and German participants (N = 1,314). We examined how strongly exoneration of the alleged perpetrator depended on acceptance of modern myths about sexual aggression (AMMSA) and identity attributes that are temporarily salient as a function of local context (gender, political left-right orientation, nationality). AMMSA was a global predictor of exonerating the alleged perpetrator across national sub-samples, whereas the predictive power of gender and left-right orientation varied locally: For French respondents, left-wing political attitudes predicted exoneration of the alleged perpetrator, whereas only for German respondents, being male predicted exoneration. We conclude that the interplay of global (sexual aggression myths) and local (social identification) factors affects the lay assessment of ambiguous cases of sexual violence.

T1  - When Political Comedy Turns Personal: Humor Types, Audience Evaluations, and Attitudes
AN  - 1531930997; 201424029
AB  - This study examines the impact of diverse comedy types on relevant political attitudes and what happens when the comedy content moves beyond the political to focus on personal attributes that are beyond a politician's control. Using a real political case study of David Paterson, New York's first blind and African American governor, the research measured the differential impact of exposure to self-directed and other-directed hostile humor on evaluations of comedy content, favorability ratings, perceptions of media portrayals of disability, and attitudes toward blindness. The results suggest that differential exposure to the comedy clips had an impact on attitudes toward blindness with those exposed to Paterson's humor exhibiting more positive attitudes toward blindness than those who were exposed to Saturday Night Live's other-directed hostile humor.

T1  - Supervising Rioters: The Role of Probation
AN  - 1504423777; 201407683
AB  - This article aims to investigate the current response to the riots in the UK in August 2011 by comparing and contrasting the political and institutional factors with the reaction to the riots that occurred in Brixton and Toxteth 1981 and those in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham in 2001. The article focuses on the changes which have occurred within the probation service over that period and by interviewing twelve frontline practitioners, seeks to gain an insight into the ways these transformations reflect wider differences within the role of probation, the community, political and government attitudes and the ways this is communicated within the media.

T1  - Missing religion: Second level agenda setting and Islam in American newspapers
AN  - 1494748631; 201402841
AB  - Second level agenda setting offers a way of demonstrating the effects of news content by providing evidence that the attributes emphasized in news coverage become more salient in the minds of media consumers and more influential in terms of actual effects on opinions and attitudes. This exploratory study examines the substantive and affective attributes of the religion of Islam in coverage of 18 US newspapers and compares those attributes with results of a Gallup Center for Muslim Studies poll to determine whether a relationship exists between the coverage of Islam and public perception, as the second level of agenda setting suggests. Two hypotheses were tested. The results showed that attributes related to Islam were overwhelmingly covered in negative terms. However, the analysis of media coverage of attributes linked to the 'object' of Islam and public perceptions of Islam suggested little support for attribute agenda setting.

T1  - Stimulating the Quasi-statistical Organ: Fear of Social Isolation Motivates the Quest for Knowledge of the Opinion Climate
AN  - 1463012721; 201346376
AB  - We test an uninvestigated proposition from spiral of silence theory that fear of social isolation (FSI) prompts people to seek out information about the climate of public opinion. Taking a trait-based individual difference perspective, the authors develop and validate a measure of FSI that is less likely to produce the interpretational problems that plague existing measures. Then, using data from eight countries spread across four continents, the authors examine whether those who fear social isolation to a greater extent are more likely to attend to a particular source of information in the social environment about public opinion -- mass media reports of public opinion polls. Study results support spiral of silence theory's prediction -- FSI does appear to motivate people to ascertain what the public thinks. However, there may be some cultural boundaries to this process.

T1  - Sweden: when hate becomes the norm
AN  - 1448992484; 201342848
AB  - The author, who worked at the Swedish Vallentuna centre for unaccompanied minors, was shocked by the anti-foreigner climate she encountered. In order to examine the parameters of this hostility, she researched representations of unaccompanied minors online. Working within the framework of netnography, she uncovered a potent mix of Islamophobia and anti-foreigner hate, with unaccompanied minors depicted within a Eurabian mindset. The article reflects on the relationship between offline and online worlds and suggests that extremist sites provide echo chambers for far-right opinion. By normalising extreme views, they serve to deliver more votes to the Sweden Democrats an extreme-right parliamentary party which is setting the national terms of debate on restricting immigration.

T1  - Perceptions of Cable News Credibility
AN  - 1667949732; 201510531
AB  - By analyzing variability in credibility assessments of news outlets CNN and FOX, this study extends prior research focusing on perceptions of credibility for a single media source. Using national survey data from 2006 and 2008, we find that demographic and political characteristics help to explain different patterns of perceived credibility. Those detecting larger differences between CNN and FOX are more politically knowledgeable and hold more polarized political attitudes. Some findings coincide with research on overall news media trust. Yet other findings demonstrate the importance of considering different patterns. Liberal Democrats were more likely than conservative Republicans to find neither network particularly credible, for example. We also examine the connection between selective exposure and credibility. We find evidence that credibility perceptions for both networks mediate the relationship between political predispositions and cable news use. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The representation of migrants in the Italian press: A study on the Corriere della Sera (1992-2009)
AN  - 1492599423; 201400209
AB  - The research analyses media discourse on migration in Italy, regarded as a means of reproducing and maintaining a racist interpretation of inter-group relations. The theoretical framework is the Critical Discourse Analysis approach. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on data consisting of headlines and articles from the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, published between 1992 and 2009. Overall, it emerged that discourse is built according to themes and discursive strategies already identified by similar research based on European media, indicating how this system of representations defines a common sense of cultural belonging and a shared construction of ethnic relations. The rather long time span considered in the study allowed us to focus on how the discourse on migration in Italy might have evolved over time, but also to identify any elements that may have remained unchanged.

T1  - "The Littlest Science" Revisited
AN  - 1125224100; 201240036
AB  - I revisit Allan Mazur's 1968 claim that sociology is "The Littlest Science." In doing so, I review four decades of disciplinary battles on how sociology might raise its scientific profile. I examine data on public attitudes toward sociology as a science and how sociology is perceived by the larger scientific community. I conclude that taking a more interdisciplinary perspective will improve the scientific status of sociology. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beauty, Ethnicity, and Age: Does Internalization of Mainstream Media Ideals Influence Attitudes Towards Older Adults?
AN  - 958727213
AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n=115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n=74), Hispanic/Latina (n=52), and African American (n=42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Race and the Fragility of the Legal Distinction between Juveniles and Adults
AN  - 1325012576
AB  - Legal precedent establishes juvenile offenders as inherently less culpable than adult offenders and thus protects juveniles from the most severe of punishments. But how fragile might these protections be? In the present study, simply bringing to mind a Black (vs. White) juvenile offender led participants to view juveniles in general as significantly more similar to adults in their inherent culpability and to express more support for severe sentencing. Indeed, these differences in participants’ perceptions of this foundational legal precedent distinguishing between juveniles and adults accounted for their greater support for severe punishment. These results highlight the fragility of protections for juveniles when race is in play. Furthermore, we suggest that this fragility may have broad implications for how juveniles are seen and treated in the criminal justice system.

T1  - Forty Years Of Environmental Risk Perceptions: Evidence From The Slovenian Public Opinion Survey
AN  - 1266144935; 201302431
AB  - This paper examines a forty-year dynamic of concern for the environment among Slovenian respondents. It first makes an inventory of the variables that are presumed to influence perceptions of environmental risk, then proceeds to analyse twelve Slovenia Public Opinion datasets to observe the trends. The longitudinal evidence reveals considerable shifts in the perception of environmental concern, particularly in response to dramatic outside events (such as Chernobyl). The trends reveal a cyclic pattern, with 2011 levels of concern having returned to the levels observed in the early 1970s, following a peak in the early 1990s. No distinctive patterns for the different types of environmental risk can be observed, which suggests that respondents fail to make a distinction between the different types. Finally, the data reveals that previous differences of opinion that correlated with levels of education and age have gradually been disappearing. The observed trends in environmental concern are best explained by macro factors, in particular the challenge-response model, the agenda-setting model, and the issue-entrepreneurship model.

T1  - Prejudice Against Muslim Australians: The Role of Values, Gender and Consensus
AN  - 1023026675; 201223735
AB  - Data from an Australian community survey (n = 189) examining the predictors of prejudice against Muslim Australians were analysed. Using thematic analysis, we investigated the specific values our participants reported regarding their perceptions of Muslim Australians and Islam. We then investigated the relationship between prejudice against Muslim Australians, the most important value priorities given by our participants, and other prejudice-related variables. After entry into a regression analysis, the participants high in prejudice were found to be significantly more likely to have lower educational levels and more right-wing views. They were also significantly more likely to report high levels of national attitudes (i.e. stronger identification with Australian identity), concern about gender equality within the Muslim community, less concern about equality generally and report that Muslims were not conforming to Australian values. High prejudiced participants also scored higher in the reporting of negative media-related beliefs, were more likely to perceive higher support in the community for their views than was the case and were more negative towards Muslim men than Muslim women. The implications for anti-prejudice interventions are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Masbirim Israel: Israel's PR Campaign as Glocalized and Grobalized Political Prosumption: PROD
AN  - 939162274
AB  - In 2010, Israel's Ministry of Information and Diaspora Affairs launched a new campaign: Masbirim Israel. Its purpose was to "recruit" Israeli citizens to the task of improving the nation's public image in the world. It was the first time a well-organized campaign was launched, systematically employing new-media tools and calling on Israeli citizens to independently take part in improving their country's international image -- all at the behest of a government ministry. The executive authority in effect delivered some of its responsibilities and obligations to private hands. This article discusses prosumption in the political sphere and expands the idea of prosumption to a domain in which the state itself is the producer and its citizens are the consumers. Prosumption is perceived as acts conducted by citizens who operate to fulfill aims (i.e., produce products) that traditionally have been in the purview of the state. The article presents two arguments: First, the campaign is an expression of the idea of prosumption in the political sphere. By integrating Israel's citizens in the process of public relations (PR), they become prosumers in the sense that they participate in the production of a public good that traditionally has been supplied by the state. Second, the Masbirim Israel campaign is an expression of a glocalized and grobalized condition in Israeli reality, as it reflects trends of neoliberal values and practices of privatization and expresses the political opinions of (extreme) nationalism and particularism to nonformally "recruit" its citizens to the national PR effort.

T1  - Assessing the British Public Value Test: Benefits, limitations and challenges ahead
AN  - 1040792054
AB  - This article provides a critical assessment of the practical implementation of the Public Value Test (PVT) in Britain, the first European country to introduce it in 2007. Britain therefore has substantial experience with this regulatory tool from which other countries could benefit. The intention of the PVT has been to allow the BBC to assume new media activities only if their public value outweighs their potential adverse market impact. The article argues that the BBC's experience with the PVT points to practical problems not originally foreseen. These problems coupled with new challenges for the BBC call for a refinement of the process. Still, the evidence suggests that overall the PVT has worked well. It has allowed the expansion, though conditional, of the BBC into new media whilst the greater degree of economic and evidence-based regulation that the BBC is now subject to has made it a credible scrutiny process in the eyes of industry stakeholders. The article maintains that the PVT has served primarily to articulate industry concerns rather than the public interest. Indeed, the emphasis on outcomes and impact together with the piecemeal approach of the PVT present a threat to the PSB ethos. It is finally argued that the main advantage of the PVT has been enhanced regulatory certainty and the establishment of delineated spheres of activity for public and commercial media organizations.

T1  - Transactional Politics
AN  - 1994216958
AB  - In spring 2009, revelations over the expense claims of British MPs led to one of the most damaging scandals affecting the legitimacy of parliamentary democracy in recent history. This article explores how this incident reveals the capacity of Web 2.0 devices and transactional data to transform politics. It reflects, graphically, the political power of identifying and knowing people on the basis of their transactions, on what they do rather than what they say. It also shows in practice how Web 2.0 devices such as Crowdsourcing, Google Docs, mash-ups and visualization software can be used to mobilize data for collective and popular projects. Basic analytic tools freely available on the Web enable people to access, digitize and analyse data and do their own analyses and representations of phenomena. We examine media and popular mobilizations of transactional data using the specific example of the MPs' expenses scandal and relate this to larger currents in online government data and devices for public scrutiny which give rise to a new politics of measurement. We argue that this politics of measurement involves the introduction of new visual devices based on the manipulation of huge databases into simplified visual arrays; the reorientation of accounts of the social from elicited attitudes and views to transactions and practices; and, the inspection of individuals arrayed in relation to other individuals within whole (sub) populations. It is also a politics that mobilizes new informational gatekeepers and organizers in the making and analysis of transactional data and challenges dominant or expert forms of analysis and representation.

T1  - People's perceptions of HIV/AIDS as portrayed by their labels of the disease: the case of Botswana
TT  - Les perceptions que les gens ont du VIH/Sida, telles que décrites par les étiquettes qu'ils collent sur la maladie: le cas du Botswana
AN  - 1971745130
AB  - It is typical of societies to come up with their own labels or names to any phenomenon that may befall them in the course of their life time. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has been no exception to this practice. In Botswana most of these labels are either in Setswana or English whereby an Eglish expression is simply adopted and used to refer to HIV/ AIDS. This study looks at the different labels or names that have been used to refer to HIV/AIDS in Botswana. It is an attempt to provide insights into perceptions of HIV/AIDS by the local communities portrayed through the naming of this disease. The study demonstrates how, through the different labels, the local communities started in denial distancing themselves from this disease and in some cases associating AIDS with ailments already known to them, cultural practices and taboos. Some of these labels further demonstrate the negative attitudes that may have fuelled HIV-related stigma in the country. Based on the informants' responses, the paper further attempts a categorisation of these labels influenced by different attitudes to HIV/AIDS, some of which are self-perpetuating and may continue to be a hindrance to the fight against the disease.

T1  - Journalism, advocacy and the social construction of consensus
AN  - 1914619800
AB  - Scholarship examining media coverage of social problems largely examines coverage of contentious issues. In this study, I contribute to our understanding of journalist practices by examining coverage of an issue over which there is a US consensus: female genital cutting (FGC). With an analysis of newspaper coverage supplemented by interviews and primary documents, I find that, in contrast to existing literature that shows that reporters must refrain from issue advocacy, when consensus is widespread reporters can and do collaborate with advocates, harmonize with opinion writers, and use their physical presence and access to newsprint to pressure the state. Journalists, however, do not simply respond to consensus. Instead, I find that they can actively construct consensus by offering unique frames that depoliticize advocacy. These findings contribute to our understanding of media coverage of social problems by illustrating how consensus is both shaped by and shapes journalist practices.

T1  - Patterns of Relationships between Issues: An Analysis of German Prestige Newspapers
AN  - 964189254; 201208167
AB  - News waves attracting a lot of media attention may distract the mass media-and the public-from other, more important and pressing problems. This study assumes that killer issues and leader issues may distract or attract attention towards victim or follower issues, respectively. Furthermore, it is assumed that key events and corresponding news waves induce and drive issue relationship processes. To investigate the impact of news waves on the issue composition in print media, content analysis data about 101 news waves and 20 issue areas were utilized. Key findings are (a) some issues characteristically interact with each other (i.e., stable relationships were found); (b) issues differ in the dominant kind of role they play in issue relationships (e.g., "budget" is a follower issue, "EU affairs" a victim issue); (c) news waves within competing or related issues significantly influence the emphasis of issues over time.

T1  - ?El Campeon de Los Hispanos? Comparing the coverage of Latino/a collective action in Spanish- and English-language newspapers
AN  - 887747538
AB  - Newspaper coverage of Latino collective action events is critical because it can shape how issues and problems are understood by policymakers and the larger public. There is an assumption that English- and Spanish-language newspapers will report on these events in different ways, but few studies have systematically explored these differences. In this article, we document and compare the coverage of Latino protest and civic engagement in English- and Spanish-language newspapers. Focusing on four metropolitan areas in 2000, we find that both types of newspapers cover nearly the same number of Latino collective action events, and although Spanish-language newspapers provide more thorough and in-depth coverage than English-language newspapers, the difference is slight. In fact, in some metropolitan areas, general-market English-language newspapers report on more events and provide more extensive coverage than Spanish-language newspapers, as evidenced by the inclusion of contextual information about the larger structural conditions that contribute to Latino organizers' concerns or motivations. Our results show that Latino collective action events are visible within English-language newspapers, which signifies that the American mainstream is expanding its borders to include Latinos.

T1  - Missing in Action: The Portrayal of Women in Sport in the Print Media
AN  - 1037881241; 201232029
AB  - Women have made great strides in sport in recent years in South Africa. The way in which the media portrays these sporting achievements is critically important to dislodging negative stereotypes and overcoming discrimination of women in sport. The unfair coverage of women's sport displays gender-based attitudes which systematically disadvantage women's position in society. Women's participation in sport has grown dramatically but, despite this growth, coverage of women in sport remains inferior to that given to male sport across all media. Newspaper reports are seldom challenged for not being accurate or truthful. But readers have a right to truthful information and reporting, and being trustworthy to the reader is the basis of good journalism. The media need to collectively reflect a diversity of content to ensure public access to a variety of viewpoints and they should expect societal intervention if the media fail to meet professional standards. The print media has a fundamental role to play in shaping public opinion and undoubtedly has an influence in portraying women in sport in South Africa. Based on this role, this study sets out to explore the influence of the print media in portraying women in sport. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Conflict and the Media: An Experimental Study of Greek Students after the 2008 Riots
AN  - 1023453581
AB  - We report a laboratory experiment in the context of the December 2008 riots in Greece, after the killing of a 15-year-old student by a policeman. Our sample comprised 266 students from the University of Thessaloniki.We tested whether media reports can affect people's willingness to harm those in opposing groups by examining the way students allocated money between themselves and others of various professions, including police, in modified dictator games. Exposure to media reports decreased giving to police, but only when choices were private. Laboratory behaviour was correlated with self-reported participation in demonstrations, supporting the external validity of our measure. Media exposure appears to have affected behaviour by different pathways than those proposed in the existing literature, including "spiral of silence" and "frame alignment" theories.

T1  - Face-to-face versus telephone surveys on political attitudes: a comparative analysis
AN  - 896185954; 201119928
AB  - Several researchers declared that the telephone survey reaches more accurate voting tendencies than the face-to-face surveys. Telephone survey shows numerous advantages compared to a face-to-face one but, however, the telephone survey also has some inconveniences. Among these it is important to highlight the scant quality of the sampling frame; absence of a telephone in some homes and the wide expansion of the mobile phone; low response rate of certain collectives and the overrepresentation of others. There are also some new barriers which make access more difficult (e.g. the automatic answering phone) and the saturation of the telephone medium because of the large amount of publicity activities which generate a large number of 'unsuccessful' calls and interrupted interviews. The objective of this paper is evaluating the adaptation of the telephone surveys in the electoral forecasts; in an attempt to see if it shows substantial improvements when they are compared to face-to-face interviews.

T1  - Towards understanding what Australia's Muslims really think
AN  - 887496956; 201118180
AB  - Over the past decade, issues concerning Islam and Muslims have featured prominently in public and media discourse. Much of this discourse is stereotypical, anecdotal and often unsubstantiated. Indeed, relative to the extent of comment on Islam and Muslims, few factual data exist on what Muslims really think. This article presents the views and opinions of the Queensland Muslim community based on the findings of a survey conducted at the 2009 Muslim Eid Festival in Brisbane. The findings of this research contradict many of the assumptions made about Australia's Muslims concerning their views and opinions on a range of social and political issues. The research shows that Muslims highly value Australia's key social and political institutions, including its democracy, judiciary, education and health-care systems. However, Muslims do express a lack of trust in certain institutions, namely the mass media. Also, consistent with the views of people globally, Muslims are deeply concerned about conflicts in the Middle East as well as the environmental crisis. This article suggests the need for a shift in public discourse to more accurately reflect the commonality, rather than incongruity, between Muslim views, opinions and concerns and those of the wider society.

T1  - COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS AND TREATMENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR REGARDING REPRODUCTIVE TRACT INFECTIONS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IN LAO PDR: A QUALITATIVE STUDY
AN  - 857656859; 21211093
AB  - Summary              Creating community awareness of reproductive tract infections (RTI), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and how to prevent them is essential to minimize their spread. Data on people's views about RTI/STI are entirely lacking in Laos. The aim of this study was thus to explore people's perceptions, treatment-seeking behaviour and understanding of information about RTI/STI, in urban and rural communities in two provinces in Laos. Fourteen focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with 76 women and 56 men, selected purposively to provide diversity of socio-demographic backgrounds. Qualitative content analysis was employed for the data analysis. The major finding was that both male and female participants had a variety of misconceptions about the causes and symptoms of RTI/STI and their cure, and a reluctance to seek health care, which could cause delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The most common treatment-seeking behaviour was self-medication through private pharmacies, following advice mostly given by friends and drug sellers. The main reasons for not going to health facilities were fear of social discrimination or shyness of genital examination. Complaints were also made about clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'. Although condom use was mentioned as a way to prevent RTI/STI, an unwillingness to use condoms was commonly expressed. The main media sources of RTI/STI information were radio and television, and access to health information was more difficult in rural areas. The health messages provided were mostly  understood, except for some technical terms. The findings indicate that strengthening health education and promotion through interventions at the community level is recommended to improve quality of RTI/STI management. Health education messages should be more accessible in rural areas. There is also an urgent need to improve communication between RTI/STI patients and clinicians. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Culture, Rap Music, 'Bitch,' and the Development of the Censorship Frame
AN  - 852898462; 201104094
AB  - Drawing theoretically both from cultural studies and cultural criminology, this exploratory project suggests that negative public perceptions associated with rap music are in large part informed through both formal and informal censorship agendas and campaigns, what the author terms the censorship frame. The censorship frame consists of mass media reports that proclaim the cultural association between music and collectively shared and culturally agreed-upon perceptions of deviance. The focus of this project concerns rap music and the term bitch, a relatively recent common feature of everyday language use. This article (a) investigates the increased use and acceptance of 'bitch' in popular culture; (b) examines this process in relation to the demonization of rap music; and (c) demonstrates the role of both mass media and claims-makers in shaping public opinion of rap music as deviant, even while other similar messages continue to remain virtually unchallenged throughout the popular cultural milieu. Implications for future research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Voices of Convergence or Conflict? A Path Analysis Investigation of Selective Exposure to Political Websites
AN  - 1018356600; 201212550
AB  - This research used a path analysis model to explore the degree to which reliance on off-line and online media, off-line and online discussion of political issues, as well as political attitudes predict whether an individual will engage in selective exposure to political websites. The study also looked at selective avoidance of contradictory information on websites. The results indicate that respondents did indeed practice selective exposure when accessing information on political websites, especially among those who are politically active online and those who rely heavily on websites and blogs for political information. However, the results showed that selective avoidance did not occur, with those exhibiting increased political interest and online participation significantly less likely to avoid information that challenges their views.

T1  - "Corrective" Actions in the Public Sphere: How Perceptions of Media and Media Effects Shape Political Behaviors
AN  - 764423628; 201065637
AB  - This study examines whether perceptions of media influence and perceptions of media hostility towards one's views predict taking "corrective" actions to ensure that one's views are "heard" in the public sphere. Controlling for demographics, political interest, efficacy, knowledge, ideological extremity, and Internet use, this study provides evidence that both third-person perceptions and hostile media perceptions are consistently related to a series of offline and online behaviors that seek to enrich public debate and "correct" what are seen as potential biases in the public sphere. Based on a national probability sample collected in Colombia, these results offer a strong case of behavioral consequences for third-person perceptions outside the realm of willingness to censor.

T1  - When 'good' conflicts go bad: Testing a frame-building model on embeds' attitudes toward government news management in the Iraq War: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1928762829
AB  - Scholars have debated how successful the government was in managing coverage of the ground war in Iraq through the embed system, but few have surveyed the embedded journalists themselves to discover the degree they believe their press freedom was restricted. This study compares results from a survey conducted of embedded journalists in late 2005 and early 2006 to one conducted in early 2004 to examine whether embeds' opinions toward press freedom have changed over time and whether they believe government news management has increased as criticism of the Iraq War has increased and public support has declined. It also tests the hierarchy-of-influences model by examining the degree to which individual, journalism routines, external and cultural factors significantly predict attitudes toward press freedom and perceptions of censorship after controlling for demographics and political ideology.

T1  - Building social support for restorative justice through the media: is taking the victim perspective the most appropriate strategy?
AN  - 754044344; 201054113
AB  - Despite the encouraging results of public opinion assessments on restorative justice, people are not likely to spontaneously suggest restorative measures after a crime. Restorative justice thus seems in need of a public relations strategy. This paper discusses the strategy labeling victims as the universal remedy to promote restorative justice, and the proposal of promoting restorative justice through the media by foregrounding crime victims in media reports on crime. This strategy stems from a belief that the most appealing aspect of restorative justice to the public is its thoughtfulness to victims. However, I will argue that there are three problems with this approach. These concern: (1) the victim's position in both restorative justice theory and practice; (2) the characteristics of media reporting on crime in general and victims in particular; and (3) the risk of attaining a result opposite to the initial objective (i.e. increasing punitive attitudes instead of promoting restorative justice).

T1  - Getting Citizens Involved: How Controversial Policy Debates Stimulate Issue Participation during a Political Campaign
AN  - 754040098; 201050379
AB  - This study tests the relative mobilizing effects of predispositional factors and attention to media content during a gubernatorial race that focused heavily on stem cell research as a salient campaign issue. Our analyses are based on a statewide telephone survey (N = 508 in June-July 2006) conducted prior to the midterm and gubernatorial elections in the U.S. State of Wisconsin. Results show that ideological predispositions and attention to both newspaper and online media best explain issue participation. In contrast with prior research, our findings show that religiosity did not influence issue participation on the stem cell controversy in Wisconsin. Implications of these findings and the importance of research on issue participation for the field of public opinion research and the future of political campaigns are discussed.

T1  - Population Ratios and Prejudice: Modelling Both Contact and Threat Effects
AN  - 743049576; 201031772
AB  - Are small or large outgroup populations more closely related to an ingroup's prejudice? This paper addresses this question with national probability survey data from Germany focused on resident foreigners. Two interlocking processes underlie the complex relationship between population proportions and prejudice. Typically, larger outgroup population proportions simultaneously increase both threat and intergroup contact. The first process increases prejudice, the second decreases it. Using structural equation modelling, our analysis reveals that these two processes can be effectively combined into one complex model. Threat is perceptual; it involves what people think is the outgroup proportion and thus can be easily manipulated by political leaders and the mass media. Contact is experiential; it can reduce individual and collective threat as well as prejudice. The intricate relationship between threat and contact can be substantially altered by numerous moderators. Hence, rigid group segregation can limit contact, while unemployment can amplify threat. The paper provides evidence that reductions in prejudice have important consequences for intergroup relations. Adapted from the source document.
