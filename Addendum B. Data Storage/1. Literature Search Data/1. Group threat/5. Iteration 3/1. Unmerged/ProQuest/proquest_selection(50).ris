T1  - Modeling racial disparities in physical health via close relationship functioning: A life course approach
AN  - 2078152946
AB  - Objective The aim of the present study was to test a life course model in which racial disparities in physical health between Caucasian and African Americans are driven by disparities in close relationship functioning. This model also examined relative evidence for intergenerational transmission of relationship functioning and ongoing exposure to prejudice and discrimination as two pathways that might shape adult relationship functioning. Method A sample of 523 Caucasian and African American men and women were prospectively tracked from a birth cohort initiated in the 1960s. Reports of parental relationship functioning were obtained from participants and their mothers in adolescence. In midlife, participants completed measures of perceived discrimination (lifetime and everyday discrimination), close relationship functioning (relationship strain and support) and physical health (self-rated health, resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure). ResultsAs hypothesized, close relationship functioning was a strong predictor of physical health in adulthood. Furthermore, we observed that perceived discrimination over the life course was linked to impaired relationship functioning. Evidence for intergenerational transmission of relationship functioning was more equivocal.ConclusionRacial disparities in physical health may be maintained via social factors throughout the life course. Although such factors have sometimes been considered outside the purview of the medical field, it is vital that researchers and clinicians begin to more fully address the implications of social forces in order to remediate racial health disparities.

T1  - Ideology and the maintenance of group inequality: GPIR
AN  - 1932685600
AB  - This article discusses the role that ideology plays in justifying and perpetuating group-based inequality. We begin by defining and describing status ideologies and their characteristics. We then review research illustrating how endorsing or rejecting status-legitimizing ideologies influences group stereotyping, group differences in perceived entitlement, and perceptions of discrimination. We next discuss how people respond to threats to their status ideology, affectively, cognitively, physiologically, and behaviorally. We close by considering the role of ideology in how high status groups respond to changes in the status hierarchy.

T1  - The just world hypothesis as an argumentative resource in debates about unemployment benefits
AN  - 1929732644
AB  - The concept of the "just world" is established as a key explanation for how people make sense of inequality so that those deemed to score high in belief in a just world are more likely to hold prejudicial beliefs and to blame people in poverty for their situations. However, this is an inadequate explanation for such complicated and controversial issues. To better understand talk about the just world and the controversial issue of the distribution of unemployment benefits (an issue of inequality), a discursive psychological approach to the just world is used. Therefore, a discourse analysis focusses on 2 feature length British televised discussions about benefit claimants called "The Big Benefit Row: Live" (Channel 5 3/2/2014) and "Benefits Britain: the Debate" (Channel 4 17/2/2014). The analysis demonstrates that people draw on both just and unjust world arguments simultaneously and also topicalise what counts as just so as to support their positions on unemployment benefits, rather than in the consistent way that just world theory would predict. It is therefore argued that the just world should be recast as a cultural value that facilitates arguments about benefits, rather than an internally held belief.

T1  - Surfing the third wave of whiteness studies: reflections on Twine and Gallagher
AN  - 1906151772
AB  - The influential special issue and overview essay co-edited and co-authored respectively, by Winddance Twine and Charles Gallagher, set out their interpretation of whiteness studies' genealogy, development and future. In this essay I identify their arguments and critique them in the light of a further eight years' work on the racialization of white identities produced by the global academy. Particular attention is paid to the proliferation of micro studies about an ever-increasing array of sites, both in thematic and international terms, and to the corpus' addressing of power relations. Moreover, I underscore Twine and Gallagher's prescience on the strand of the work they review that bears on the racial project of recuperating white supremacy in a variety of ways, a project that is enjoying heightened visibility in 2016.

T1  - "What are you?": Mixed race responses to the racial gaze
AN  - 1900462149
AB  - Mixed race scholarship considers the deployment of the term "mixed race" as an identification and theorizes that the operation of the external racial gaze is signaled through the "what are you?" question that mixed race people face in their everyday lives. In interviews conducted with mixed race, young adults in a Western Canadian urban context, it was evident that the "what are you?" question is the verbal form of the external racial gaze's production of ambivalence on mixed race bodies. However, this study also found that mixed race people have "ready" identity narratives in response to the "what are you?" question. This paper shows the importance of these narratives (the very existence of the "ready" narratives, as well as the content of the "ready" narrative) for fleshing out the operation of the external racial gaze in the Canadian context. Respondents draw on two closely related modes of narrating origin when responding to the "what are you?" question: they respond through a kinship narrative that is heteronormative and they narrate that they inherit "national origin" "through blood." I argue that these responses point to how the gaze produces the multiracialized body through the desire to imagine and "know" its originary point of racial mixing. Yet, the "ready" narratives are also agential: while at times they narrate to the expectations of the gaze, they also "play on" the gaze.

T1  - Ethnicity, belonging and identity among the Eastern Gurage of Ethiopia
AN  - 1900462108
AB  - In this paper, I will analyse a case of ethnic transformation in post-1991 Ethiopia based on an ethnographic study of the Eastern Gurage. The case represents an ethnic setting where the conventional conceptualization of ethnicity in terms of a notion of origin undermines the diversities expressed in various forms of category and boundary formations. The ethnic setting does not also fall into, but combines, the commonplace dichotomization of primordialist versus constructivist notion of ethnicity. Not only by taking Barth's (1969) formalist anthropological conception of ethnicity as boundary formation, but also suggesting my own analytical distinction, I will attempt to account for the various forms of ethnicities particularly those based on clanship, locality, Islam and state's categorization. In this regard, I have introduced a distinction between the concepts of identity and belonging in order to explain the different forms of social and political classifications, ideologies and power relationships that are often treated as implying a single phenomenon, i.e. identity formation.

T1  - Racial Authenticity and Familial Acceptance Among Transracial Adoptees: A Bothersome Bargain of Belonging
AN  - 1897282266
AB  - Transracial adoption in the United States has increased significantly in recent years. Crossing the color line within the intimate familial sphere has important implications for how institutions such as the family enable and constrain individuals' identity work. We explore how transracial family members utilize racial stereotypes and racialist understandings in everyday life, employing 30 in-depth, life-story interviews with both transracial adoptees and their white siblings. In attempts to accomplish a sense of belonging and authenticity, we argue that both transracial adoptees of color and their white siblings experience divergent and paradoxical expectations of familial and racial authenticity. We find that although they often utilized "color capital" in a quest for racial authenticity, in certain spaces and environments, they were expected to eschew their nonwhite identity and embrace "acting white" as purported by white family members and their "white debt" approach to racial socialization. This study adds nuance to the question of how families navigate the enduring power of the color line in relation to the reproduction of both material inequalities and racial discrimination.

T1  - Navigating Identities: Subtle and Public Agency of Bicultural Gay Youth
AN  - 1875136742
AB  - Young people who discover their sexual attraction to people of the same sex often go through a period of ambivalence or distress, especially when they grow up in an environment that condemns homosexuality. The Dutch sociopolitical context makes the expression of same-sex desires among those with non-Dutch roots even more complicated and risky, as prevailing schemes of interpretation render the two identities incompatible. This study explores the expressions of same-sex desires and identities as well as the different forms of agency of bicultural gay youth. In-depth interviews with 14 young adults reveal how young people negotiate bicultural identities in Dutch society that brings to the fore complexities in managing diverse sexual identities and strong religious and cultural affiliations in tandem. Their strategies have the effect of questioning dominant discourses and transcend the oppositional dichotomy between sexual and ethnic forms of sociocultural otherness.

T1  - Challenges in access to health care among involuntary migrants in Germany. A case study of migrants' experiences in Oldenburg, Lower Saxony
AN  - 1876465466
AB  - In asking asylum seekers and refugees about their experiences in the healthcare system in Oldenburg in 2015, and a healthcare worker about her experiences with involuntary migrant groups, this article seeks to provide insight into the effects of policies and practices on refugees' and asylum seekers' experiences in the healthcare system in Oldenburg, an important destination for newly arrived refugees and asylum seekers in Lower Saxony, Germany. Asylum seekers face a wide range of challenges in their country of destination. One of these challenges is to attent to their health needs, due to their partial or full exclusion, "from the system of health care promotion, protection and provision that appl[ies] to citizens and authorized residents" (Willen, Mulligan & Castañeda, 2011: 331). Health as a multidimensional and multilevel phenomenon can be determined by several factors, ranging from socioeconomic status to cultural differences, all of which produce health inequalities. Health care for involuntary migrants has become a central topic, particularly, albeit not exclusively, in terms of access to health services. Different patterns of access to health services for asylum seekers could have lasting consequences for the health and quality of life of this particular group. Furthermore, cultural differences may be perceived as de-facto barriers to receiving health care for both asylum seekers and refugees. Even within tailor-made clinics dealing with migrants in general or involuntary migrants in particular, cultural and socioeconomic differences ought to be accounted for in order to provide an optimal level of health care.

T1  - Essentialist beliefs: Understanding contact with and attitudes towards lesbian and gay individuals
AN  - 1877774170
AB  - Sexual prejudice remains a widespread problem worldwide. Past research demonstrates that cross-orientation contact (contact between heterosexuals and lesbian/gay individuals) reduces sexual prejudice among heterosexuals, especially when contact is high quality. This study extends the literature on the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice and the mediation of this relationship by intergroup anxiety by examining the role of a key ideology - essentialist beliefs about homosexuality (immutability, universality, and discreteness beliefs). Findings indicate that the mediation of the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice by intergroup anxiety differs by level of essentialist beliefs. Additionally, the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice appears to be mediated by essentialist beliefs as well as intergroup anxiety. These results suggest that individuals who endorse essentialist beliefs commonly associated with increased bias (high discreteness and low immutability and universality beliefs) may benefit the most from cross-orientation contact and resultant decreases in intergroup anxiety. Further, decreasing essentialist beliefs generally associated with increased bias may be a mechanism through which cross-orientation contact reduces sexual prejudice. Implications and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Imagining Shared Space
AN  - 1828417204
AB  - Murals have long been used in communities to express solidarity and voice political opinions. As neighborhoods become increasingly diverse, complex economic and political motivations emerge for making murals that reflect new claims and contests over space. Focusing on recently designated ethnic "-towns" in the Greater Los Angeles area, the study finds that murals reveal multiple narratives and motives, including negotiations over space, identity, place-branding, and border-making as well as interethnic competition and reconciliation. It is argued that understanding the evolving functions and multivalent potentials of murals is critical for the success of place making and community planning. In particular, we draw attention to the trend of businesses and local government agencies using murals to make statements on identity and intercultural relations.

T1  - Scottish clan identities in America: symbolic or real?
AN  - 1827657796
AB  - This paper explores Herbert Gans's notion of symbolic ethnicity and his recent assertions that it is effectively at an end and little more than a label. We use research into Scottish-American clan associations to question this assertion and we seek to demonstrate that symbolic ethnicity appears to be alive and well within such diaspora organizations. The paper reports on a series of interviews conducted in 2014 with office bearers and members of clan associations and we use our findings to argue, along with other writers such as Steinberg that, when considering hyphenated ethnicity, it is important not to underestimate the power of the hyphen.

T1  - Substantive signifiers? Ethnic and religious identifications among second-generation immigrants in the Netherlands
AN  - 1851120155
AB  - In the context of increasingly 'culturalised' discourses on immigrant integration in Europe, this article aims to contribute to a de-essentialised understanding of ethnic and religious identity. Based on the analysis of quantitative data, it reveals the multifarious relationship between identification and culture among second-generation Turkish and Moroccan Dutch in the Netherlands. Some instances of self-identification with nominal labels ('Turkish' and 'Muslim') appear to go hand in hand with stronger sociocultural orientations in daily life and are more substantive; others ('Moroccan') do not. These findings point to different social mechanisms at work in shaping identifications with certain identity labels and once more illustrate that ethnic and religious identifications do not necessarily reflect cultural 'otherness'.

T1  - More Islamic, no less Chinese: explorations into overseas Chinese Muslim identities in Malaysia
AN  - 1812458757
AB  - This paper explores the newly emerging overseas Chinese Muslim community in Malaysia. As China's interactions with the Muslim-majority countries deepen, there will be more Chinese Muslims staying in these countries. Questions can be asked how connection with, and exposure to, the wider Islamic world influence their identity as Chinese Muslim. Through examining the activities of the Overseas Chinese Muslim Association, elite interviews and survey data of the Chinese Muslim students in Malaysia, this paper argues that in general overseas Chinese Muslims remain comfortable with their identity as both Muslim and Chinese. Some contributing factors include the presence of a sizable ethnic Chinese minority in Malaysia and the ease of modern communications technology. They also utilize their different identity categories to maximize advantages to the community. Also, the Chinese Muslims' relations with official China and the Han majority are largely reproduced in Malaysia.

T1  - Towards understanding: antisemitism and the contested uses and meanings of 'Yid' in English football
AN  - 1807591249
AB  - This article addresses an omission in the currently brief body of work on antisemitism in football and contributes to and advances wider sociological debates in the sub-disciplines of race and ethnicity, religion, linguistics and sport. The article examines antisemitic discourse in English football and in doing so, explains the different uses and meanings of 'Yid' in the vernacular culture of fans. While many conceive of 'Yid' as an ethnic epithet, fans of Tottenham Hotspur - Gentiles and Jews - have appropriated and embraced the term, using it to deflect the antisemitic abuse they are targeted with due to their 'Jewish identity'. The study maps the contested uses of 'Yid' on a continuum to explain and demarcate between the nuanced forms of antisemitism in football. It makes central the cultural context in which 'Yid' is used, together with the intent underpinning its use, since epithets and slurs are not simply determined by their lexical form.

T1  - Looking forward into the past: Partido Nacionalista Vasco and the immigrant question in the Basque Country
AN  - 1792708383
AB  - This article examines the discursive and political response to immigrant-generated diversity by Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV) in the Basque Country of Spain. A much-ballyhooed fact about PNV is that its founder, Sabino Arana, articulated a racist nationalist doctrine in the late nineteenth century. Alarm bells were raised in the early 2000s when the Basque Country became a destination for foreign immigrants arriving in Spain from Latin America and North Africa: do foreign immigrants pose a threat to Basque national identity? The PNV's answer to this question has been a clear 'no'. Rather than distance itself from its past, however, party elites legitimate the inclusive and compassionate attitude towards foreign immigrants through selective discovery of the Basque national narrative. While sceptics of ideational variables are quick to suggest that nationalist elites manipulate the past to serve current purposes, this article suggests that such an interpretation does not do justice to the subtle ways in which symbols, myths, and images of the past have shaped the worldviews of PNV elites in the realm of immigration.

T1  - A new comparison of the East and West: National identity and attitudes toward immigration
AN  - 1907274426
AB  - This study attempted to reexamine the traditional East/ethnic-West/civic framework of national identity by extending the analysis to selected Asian countries. The previous literature has been Western oriented because the comparison and analysis focused on Western Europe and the United States of America (USA) as depicting West/civic societies and Eastern Europe as East/ethnic societies. There is a need to expand the analysis by including Asian countries. Utilizing the 2005-2007 rounds of the World Values Survey, the results of the data analysis support the ethnic-civic dichotomy. On average, respondents from Asian countries (China, Taiwan and South Korea) accorded more weight to the ethnic dimension of national identity and less to the civic, while those from Western countries (USA, Norway and Sweden) attached more importance to the civic dimension than the ethnic. Furthermore, both ethnic and civic identities were largely irrelevant in explaining attitudes toward immigrants in Asian countries but were strongly associated with immigration attitudes in Western countries.

T1  - From ethnic enclave to ghetto
AN  - 1794247257
AB  - This article is about the question of state power, violence and the identity predicaments of a marginalised Muslim community called Marakkayars, living in Beemapalli, a coastal hamlet located in the Thiruvananthapuram district of southern Kerala. Based on insights from judicial discourse and ethnography of an event of spectacle state violence that occurred in Beemapalli in the year 2009, the article shows how the contesting discourses that emerged after the violence are entangled with a larger transformation that has taken place in the recent history of this locality--the shift from an ethnic enclave to a ghetto. The judicial discourse which justifies the police violence in Beemapalli and the counter narratives from the locality that vehemently oppose it give interesting insight into the confrontations between the state and a ghettoised community prior to and after the violence. The article also demonstrates how the relationship between the state agencies and ghettoised Marakkayar Muslims is saturated with varied forms of violence: legitimate and illegitimate, physical and symbolic, spectacle and everyday in a complex way.

AB  - Patterson and Fosse's 2015 collection The Cultural Matrix: Understanding Black Youth represents a significant provocation to our understanding of persistent racial inequalities amongst African American youth, raising important questions around the relationship between culture, identities and racialized structures. This short article takes a comparative perspective, exploring race, culture and identity from a British standpoint, and highlights some of the dangers of privileging an overly cultural account of racialized inequality. It argues for the inextricability of structure and culture, and for the necessity of a deeper engagement with the historical, political and social dynamics through which culture comes to matter.

T1  - Redemptive politics: racial reasoning in contemporary France
AN  - 1786270426
AB  - The recent 'postcolonial turn' in France, and the concomitant concern for various forms of identity politics that accompany it, signal a shift of considerable importance within a social order that has historically been built on an ideal of transcending difference. Much of this movement is concentrated in and on the troubled French suburbs that, for the past two decades, have become both the focus and source of considerable anxiety about the state of French society generally and the republican social contract in particular. In this article, Epstein focuses on the paradigms of American racial history and multicultural approaches to difference that constitute a part of this debate. These rhetorical practices allow a discursive space from which to consider racial matters that are otherwise difficult to address in France, at the same time that they position race, in a marked departure from the French republican ideal, as a meaningful basis from which to think through problems of social justice. These phenomena need to be considered within the context of a rapidly shifting global economy that has diffused the potential for social integration promised by the republican social contract, and reflect efforts to locate readily identifiable sources of disenfranchisement when the far less visible reasons for lack of opportunity have moved off-shore.

T1  - China in Russia, Russia in China: ethnic aspect of migration between the two countries in the past and present
AN  - 1784139650
AB  - Mutual migrations between Russia and China have been going on for centuries and their intensity in the long-term scale is steadily increasing. Migration processes have a significant impact not only on bilateral political relations of Russia and China, but also on the internal ethnic structure of these complex nations. In his work, the author presents the main results of the empirical study of changes in the number and composition of Russian migrants in China and Chinese migrants in Russia, their organization, cultural features, and relations with the parent and the host nations for the past 400 years. Considering the communities of Russian and Chinese migrants in their present state, the author reveals their internal heterogeneity, the existence in them the components of the different ethno-social types. In conclusion, the article assesses the overall impact of migration processes on the ethnic composition and structure of the Russian and Chinese civil nations. According to the author, in spite of increased complexity of the ethnic composition of Russia and China, mutual migrations contributed rather to internal ethnic and cultural consolidation, strengthening the national identity of Russians and Chinese.

T1  - Back to the future: Recalibrating the myth of Korea's homogenous ethnicity
AN  - 1784139362
AB  - This article reviews Korea's multicultural past, while also tracing the evolution of the myth of ethnic Korean homogeneity via the Tan'gun myth, whose earliest extant record dates from the thirteenth century. It highlights how the myth was recalibrated in the twentieth century in the face of Japanese cultural imperialism, and used to promote a nationalist, homogenous Korean identity. By exploring past intercultural exchanges and developments, this article also illustrates how this modern 'homogenous' identity has been misconstructed by both North and South Korea. This is now especially anachronistic for contemporary South Korea, which is fast becoming multiracial and multicultural, but where biracial people are often discriminated against. Finally, I argue that by deconstructing the Tan'gun myth, one discovers that it already inherently possesses the potential to resolve the problematic nationalistic myth of ethnic homogeneity in a growing multiracial society, which still, in the twenty-first century, emphasises racial 'purity'.

T1  - The Dolezal affair: Race, gender, and the micropolitics of identity
AN  - 1759163725
AB  - This article treats the pairing of "transgender" and "transracial" in the intertwined discussion of Caitlyn Jenner and Rachel Dolezal as an intellectual opportunity rather than a political provocation. I situate the Dolezal affair in the context of the massive destabilization of long taken-for-granted categorical frameworks, which has significantly enlarged the scope for choice and self-fashioning in the domains of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, and sexuality. Anxieties about opportunistic, exploitative, or fraudulent identity claims have generated efforts to "police" unorthodox claims -- as well as efforts to defend such claims against policing -- in the name of authentic, objective, and unchosen identities. Instead of a shift from given to chosen identities, as posited by theories of reflexive modernity, we see a sharpened tension between idioms of choice, autonomy, subjectivity, and self-fashioning on the one hand and idioms of givenness, essence, objectivity, and nature on the other.

T1  - Miaoicization vis-à-vis sinicization: contrasting Miao subgroups in contemporary China
AN  - 1784139683
AB  - This article studies the Miao classification as an example to examine the minzu shibie project initiated by the Chinese Communist Party after 1949. The Miao classification that originates with the minzu shibie project can be defined as a process of miaoicization; however, it is not a unified Miao group (as projected by the classification team) that has emerged but rather one dominant Miao subgroup that defines the official Miao category in contemporary China. At the moment the most dominant Miao subgroup is the Hmu group in Southeast Guizhou. The overemphasis of Hmu sub-culture to represent all the Miao of China is related to the fact that over the last decades many important leaders in Guizhou have been Hmu. While all Hmu are sinicized to a certain extent, it seems that the Hmu at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale are most likely to be sinicized and to amalgamate with the Han majority.

T1  - Bounded openness: The effect of openness to experience on intolerance is moderated by target group conventionality
AN  - 1767327489; 201605401
AB  - Openness to experience is consistently associated with tolerance. We suggest that tests of the association between openness to experience and tolerance have heretofore been incomplete because they have primarily focused on prejudice toward unconventional target groups. We test (a) the individual difference perspective, which predicts that because people who are high in openness are more open to diverse and dissimilar people and ideas, they will express more tolerance than people who are low in openness and (b) the worldview conflict perspective, which predicts that people high and low in openness will both be intolerant toward those with different worldviews. Four studies, using both conventional and unconventional target groups, find support for an integrative perspective. People high in openness do appear more tolerant of diverse worldviews compared with people low in openness; however, at the same time, people both high and low in openness are more intolerant of groups whose worldviews conflict with their own. These findings highlight the need to consider how individual difference variables and features of the target groups may interact in important ways to influence the expression of prejudice.

T1  - What Does it Mean to Be a Kin Majority? Analyzing Romanian Identity in Moldova and Russian Identity in Crimea from Below
AN  - 1748866183; 201600246
AB  - Objective This article investigates what kin identification means from a bottom-up perspective in two kin majority cases: Moldova and Crimea. Methods The article is based on 50 fieldwork interviews conducted in both Moldova and Crimea with everyday social actors (2012-2013). Results Ethnic homogeneity for kin majorities is more fractured that previously considered. Respondents identified more in terms of assemblages of ethnic, cultural, political, linguistic, and territorial identities than in mutually exclusive census categories. Conclusions To understand fully the relations between kin majorities, their kin-state and home-state and the impact of growing kin engagement policies, like dual citizenship, it is necessary to analyze the complexities of the lived experience of kin identification for members of kin majorities and how this relates to kin-state identification and affiliation. Understanding these complexities helps to have a more nuanced understanding of the role of ethnicity in post-Communist societies, in terms of kin-state and intrastate relations.

T1  - Is Love (Color) Blind? The Economy of Race among Gay and Straight Daters
AN  - 1718065332; 201530740
AB  - A drawback to research on interracial couplings is that it almost exclusively studies heterosexual relationships. However, compelling new evidence from analyses using the Census shows that interracial relationships are significantly more common among the gay population. It is unclear how much of this reflects weaker racial preference or more limited dating markets. This paper examines the interactions of white gay and straight online daters who have access to a large market of potential partners by modeling dyadic messaging behaviors. Results show that racial preferences are highly gendered, and do not line up neatly by gay or straight identity. White lesbians and straight men show the weakest same-race preference, followed by gay men, while straight women show the strongest same-race preference. Put differently, minority men are discriminated to a greater degree than minority women in both same-sex and different-sex dating markets. These results suggest that white gay men's higher rates of interracial cohabitation are driven more by constrained dating markets, while lesbians' appear to be driven by more open racial preferences.

T1  - Race, Space, and Cumulative Disadvantage: A Case Study of the Subprime Lending Collapse
AN  - 1777916937
AB  - In this article, we describe how residential segregation and individual racial disparities generate racialized patterns of subprime lending and lead to financial loss among black borrowers in segregated cities. We conceptualize race as a cumulative disadvantage because of its direct and indirect effects on socioeconomic status at the individual and neighborhood levels, with consequences that reverberate across a borrower's life and between generations. Using Baltimore, Maryland as a case study setting, we combine data from reports filed under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act with additional loan-level data from mortgage-backed securities. We find that race and neighborhood racial segregation are critical factors explaining black disadvantage across successive stages in the process of lending and foreclosure, controlling for differences in borrower credit scores, income, occupancy status, and loan-to-value ratios. We analyze the cumulative cost of predatory lending to black borrowers in terms of reduced disposable income and lost wealth. We find the cost to be substantial. Black borrowers paid an estimated additional 5 to 11 percent in monthly payments and those that completed foreclosure in the sample lost an excess of $2 million in home equity. These costs were magnified in mostly black neighborhoods and in turn heavily concentrated in communities of color. By elucidating the mechanisms that link black segregation to discrimination we demonstrate how processes of cumulative disadvantage continue to undermine black socioeconomic status in the United States today.

T1  - The Stigma Complex
AN  - 1735657248; 201536819
AB  - Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, research on stigma has continued. Building on conceptual and empirical work, the recent period clarifies new types of stigmas, expansion of measures, identification of new directions, and increasingly complex levels. Standard beliefs have been challenged, the relationship between stigma research and public debates reconsidered, and new scientific foundations for policy and programs suggested. We begin with a summary of the most recent Annual Review articles on stigma, which reminded sociologists of conceptual tools, informed them of developments from academic neighbors, and claimed findings from the early period of 'resurgence.' Continued (even accelerated) progress has also revealed a central problem. Terms and measures are often used interchangeably, leading to confusion and decreasing accumulated knowledge. Drawing from this work but focusing on the past 14 years of stigma research (including mental illness, sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS, and race/ethnicity), we provide a theoretical architecture of concepts (e.g., prejudice, experienced/received discrimination), drawn together through a stigma process (i.e., stigmatization), based on four theoretical premises. Many characteristics of the mark (e.g., discredited, concealable) and variants (i.e., stigma types and targets) become the focus of increasingly specific and multidimensional definitions. Drawing from complex and systems science, we propose a stigma complex, a system of interrelated, heterogeneous parts bringing together insights across disciplines to provide a more realistic and complicated sense of the challenge facing research and change efforts. The Framework Integrating Normative Influences on Stigma (FINIS) offers a multilevel approach that can be tailored to stigmatized statuses. Finally, we outline challenges for the next phase of stigma research, with the goal of continuing scientific activity that enhances our understanding of stigma and builds the scientific foundation for efforts to reduce intolerance.

T1  - Using Eurocentric and Afro Centric Lenses to Examine, Explain and Understand the South Africans' Attitudes towards "Diversity and Foreignness" of Immigrants Residing in South Africa
AN  - 1788991166
AB  - This research paper is an outcome of the recent episodic waves of ill treatment, discrimination, exclusion and attacks directed to immigrant residing in South Africa. The aim of this paper is to invite attention through debates and discourse, examining the state of diversity and foreignness in South Africa using both Eurocentric and Afrocentric lenses. The paper has used dialogues and debates to understand the contribution of both Eurocentrism and Afrocentrism in explaining the current state of diversity and foreignness in contemporary South Africa. Results indicate that Eurocentric philosophies: suffer from serious epistemological and methodological flaws; largely contribute and explain the current state of attitudes towards African immigrants. Besides, they are responsible for imperialism that could be associated with xenophobia and racism; contribute to the homogenization of identity; and perpetuate differentiation and demarcation among the people. In addition, findings indicate that Afrocentrism: accentuates a common identity and humanity; promotes interconnectedness of humankind through the processes of transnationalization and territorialization. Besides, it offers a healing and an emancipatory environment. The researchers propose the world community to consider using both Eurocentrism and Afrocentrism in tandem and to advance research and scholarship that seeks endogenous explanations to attitudes against immigrants.

T1  - What We Can't See? Understanding the Representations and Meanings of UAI, Barebacking, and Semen Exchange in Gay Male Pornography
AN  - 1660024625; 201505729
AB  - Since the late 1990s, the use of condoms within gay male pornography has been on the wane. Moving from a niche category into more mainstream forms of commercial pornography, unprotected anal sex has become a dominant theme within this sphere of gay male sexual representation. However, while the definition of what constitutes bareback pornography may at first sight appear unproblematic, this article argues that meanings and understandings of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) are not constant across all genres of gay male pornography. Using textual analysis and focus group methods, the authors demonstrate how subcultural understandings of UAI are dependent on a variety of textual factors. These include the age, body type, and racial identities of the performers; the setting, context, and mise-en-scene of the pornographic scene; and the deployment of power relations between the insertive and receptive partners. The article concludes by suggesting that the recognition of the diverse representations of 'barebacking' found in contemporary gay male pornography should influence the ways in which health promotion strategies address discussions of UAI and bareback pornography.

T1  - Nuevos Ambientes, Historias Compartidas? Sexuality, Cultural and Sexual Identity and Practices among Gay-identified Latin American Migrants in Sydney
AN  - 1660022359; 201505701
AB  - This study analyses the results of a research project on gay-identified men of Latin American origin who have migrated to Sydney, Australia. The findings are the product of a year of collection and analysis of data from surveys and in-depth interviews carried out with those who answered the initial call for participation at the beginning of 2010, published in the gay and lesbian press in as well as Spanish-speaking periodicals in Sydney. The theoretical bases of the project find their inspiration in the newly emergent framework of so-called sexual migration studies and the work of sexual fields theory. The conclusions show the importance of ethnic and racial images in Latin American migrant interaction in gay spaces and the value that the study's participants gave to multiculturalism in their experiences of new socio-sexual sites and identity constructions post-migration.

AN  - 1551001980; 201429127
AB  - The entanglement of border control technologies and immigration policies and practices with discourses of race, national identity and belonging has long been a focus of scholarly interest. In this paper we discuss the Human Provenance Pilot Project (HPPP), the aim of which was to evaluate the utility of genetic and isotope testing to corroborate asylum seekers' accounts of their nationality. We subject the HPPP to a detailed socio-technical analysis, highlighting how technologies, practices and modes of thought travelled from the policing context to the asylum context, illuminating the unspoken prejudices that made that transfer possible, and reflecting on implications of the HPPP for academic research, policy advice and the asylum system.

T1  - Feeling at home in the 'Chocolate City': an exploration of place-making practices and structures of belonging amongst Africans in Guangzhou
AN  - 1660023970; 201505577
AB  - Over the last two decades, the shifts brought about by the emergence of Asia as a key player in global capitalism have led to countless Africans opting for Asian destinations as part of their trade and migration strategies. The implications of the constant ebb and flow of African entrepreneurs in Southern China and the transnational trajectories, connections, and practices they enable have been relatively understudied. This article focuses on place-making practices and structures of belonging surrounding those Africans living in (and circulating through) Guangzhou. Drawing on my fieldwork, I locate possibilities for place-making and belonging within transnational multiethnic microcommunities and highlight practices that have emerged from the assembling of transnational and translocal flows in residential clusters, community organisations, and religious congregations. I contend that the presence and intermingling of diverse transient subjects (both African and Chinese) nurtures 'alternative imaginations' of self, place, home, and belonging that alter extant notions of national and cultural identity, ethnicity, and race in twenty-first century Asia.

T1  - 'It's Only Other People Who Make Me Feel Black': Acculturation, Identity, and Agency in a Multicultural Community
AN  - 1520341356; 201413161
AB  - This article explores identity work and acculturation work in the lives of British mixed-heritage children and adults. Children, teenagers, and parents with mixed heritage participated in a community arts project that invited them to deliberate, construct, and reconstruct their cultural identities and cultural relations. We found that acculturation, cultural and raced identities, are constructed through a series of oppositional themes: cultural maintenance versus cultural contact; identity as inclusion versus identity as exclusion; institutionalized ideologies versus agency. The findings point towards an understanding of acculturation as a dynamic, situated, and multifaceted process: acculturation in movement. To investigate this, we argue that acculturation research needs to develop a more dynamic and situated approach to the study of identity, representation, and culture. The article concludes with a discussion on the need for political psychologists to develop methods attuned to the tensions and politics of acculturation that are capable of highlighting the possibilities for resistance and social change.

T1  - Racialised inequality, anti-racist strategies and the workings of the 'dialogical self': a case study in the shifting construction of migrant identity in Ireland
AN  - 1708525164; 201528612
AB  - The theory of the dialogical self understands that identity is constructed from a shifting pallet of 'I' voices, each created from the dialogic interaction that takes place between the individual subject 'I' and multiple 'others'. These positions are changeable and identity space is constructed in each context, out of the interaction that takes place between a situationally specific manifestation of the self and an 'other', who is deemed to be important and worthy of note. This article engages with this conceptualisation in an effort to illustrate how some recent immigrants to Ireland internalise the experience of life in a new cultural contact zone, against a background penetrated by experiences of racialised othering. This takes many forms, but after these experiences are extracted from research participants' narrative stories, individual immigrants are seen to harness a series of different positions in an effort to internalise the experience of this racialised discrimination and negotiate its place in their lives. Two particular strategies are adopted. Racialised discriminations are seen to be anchored in notions of human nature, broadly based. Immigrants use this conceptualisation to divorce the experience from their aspirations for their future life in Ireland. Equally, Immigrants are seen to switch 'I' positions laterally in order to deflect the experience of exclusion. In so doing, potentially new and intersectional migrant identity spaces are created.

T1  - Dehumanization and Social Class: Animality in the Stereotypes of 'White Trash,' 'Chavs,' and 'Bogans'
AN  - 1650147108; 201502036
AB  - Three studies examined whether animality is a component of low-SES stereotypes. In Study 1a-c, the content of 'white trash' (USA), 'chav' (UK), and 'bogan' (Australia) stereotypes was found to be highly consistent, and in every culture it correlated positively with the stereotype content of apes. In Studies 2a and 2b, a within-subjects approach replicated this effect and revealed that it did not rely on derogatory labels or was reducible to ingroup favoritism or system justification concerns. In Study 3, the 'bogan' stereotype was associated with ape, rat, and dog stereotypes independently of established stereotype content dimensions (warmth, competence, and morality). By implication, stereotypes of low-SES people picture them as primitive, bestial, and incompletely human. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Politics of Ethnography: Figures of Csangoness in fin-de-siecle and Twentieth-Century Hungary and Romania
AN  - 1494750777; 201402015
AB  - The Csangos are an ethnic/religious minority from Moldavia, Eastern Romania. They are defined as legitimate subjects by two antagonistically nationalizing projects: the Hungarian and the Romanian one. I am not trying to discover some 'authentic' or 'hybrid' identity that would explain away the ambiguities connected with this ethno-religious group. The Csangos appear, in this paper, as mutating historical forms and figures, made up through fateful events and part of 'historical ontologies'. Because of their specific position inside opposed nationalisms, they can provide theoretical insights into the constituting of nationalizing narratives, ethnography and social sciences in East and Central Europe.

T1  - American Indians without tribes in the twenty-first century
AN  - 1551000408; 201429038
AB  - Among American Indians and Alaska Natives, most aspects of ethnicity are tightly associated with the person's tribal origins. Language, history, foods, land and traditions differ among the hundreds of tribes indigenous to the USA. With this in mind, we ask why almost one million American Indians failed to respond to the tribal affiliation part of the Census 2000 race question. We investigate four hypotheses about why one-third of multiracial American Indians and one-sixth of single-race American Indians did not write any response to the tribal affiliation question: (1) survey item non-response that undermines all fill-in-the-blank questions; (2) a non-salient tribal identity; (3) a genealogy-based affiliation; and (4) a mestizo identity, which does not require a tribe. We use multivariate logistic regression models and high-density restricted-use Census 2000 data. We find support for the first two hypotheses and note that predictors differ substantially for single-race versus multiple-race American Indians. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Rescaling White Space in Post-apartheid Johannesburg
AN  - 1494300426; 201402010
AB  - This paper traces three political mobilizations in the wealthy suburbs of Johannesburg: a boycott of redistributive tax policies, the creation of gated communities and residents' associations, and the demand for residential city improvement districts (CIDs). I argue that state rescaling and networked governance are constituted through struggles over governmental power. I also argue for more attention to race in the political economy of scale. Struggles over the scalar, networked, and territorial dimensions of governance are constitutive moments in the shifting articulation of race, class, and space. An analysis of articulation highlights the role of territory, identity and imagination in the production of space, demonstrates that neoliberal forms of networked governance are products of struggle, and reiterates the feminist argument that governmental interventions are about more than just capital accumulation.

T1  - Status Homophily, Sexual Identity, and Lesbian Social Ties
AN  - 1567047532; 201435161
AB  - The literature on friendship and social networks finds that individuals form social ties with people who are like them-a much studied concept called homophily. However, few studies have explicitly examined sexual identity as a point of homophily. Scholars from multiple disciplines have long argued that sexuality influences the organization of our social worlds, yet most studies of friendship and social networks under-examine or overlook the influence of sexual identity. This study addresses that gap by looking at status homophily among lesbian social ties to examine the influence of sexual identity, as well as gender, race, class, and family, on their personal networks. Using survey data from 544 U.S. lesbian respondents, the findings make visible some of the factors and forces that shape social ties for lesbians. The results point to the importance of sexuality as an organizing element of social life, and suggest that studies that examine social networks or friendships more often make sexual identity, gender, and intersecting social locations a central focus.

T1  - Rethinking race, racism, identity and ideology in Latin America
AN  - 1512218485; 201408802
AB  - This special issue explores ideas of race and racial hierarchy in Latin America in the twenty-first century. By examining the intersection between racialization and processes of identity formation, political struggle, as well as intimate social and economic relations, these essays question how and to what extent traditional racial ideologies continue to hold true. In so doing, we consider the implications of such ideologies for anti-racism struggles. This collection of articles provides a unique insight into the everyday lived experiences of racism, how racial inequalities are reproduced, and the rise of ethnic-based social movements in Latin America. The qualitative nature of the projects allows the authors to advance our understanding of how racial ideologies operate on the ground level. The geographic diversity of the articles -- focusing on Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Costa Rica and Cuba -- enables a greater understanding of the distinct ways that racial ideologies play out across different settings.

T1  - 'AM I REALLY ASIAN?': Educational Experiences and Panethnic Identification among Second-Generation Filipino Americans
AN  - 1504422546; 201405509
AB  - Aaron a Filipino admitted that he thought little about the differences between Filipinos and other Asian Americans before entering the University of California (UC). A few months into his freshman year of college, he could no longer ignore them. Although Filipinos are the largest Asian American population in California, they are far outnumbered by East Asians within the larger UC system. Besides this gap in representation, Aaron noted that the respective stereotypes he heard about Filipinos and other Asians differed. Asians were stereotyped as studious science majors, while Filipinos were more inclined toward liberal arts fields and were seen as comparably less focused on their academics. This article examines how second-generation Filipino Americans' educational experiences and school racial context influence their sense of Asian American identity. Drawing on fifty in-depth interviews, the author will discuss how many Filipino Americans negotiate their individual and collective experiences in relationship to Asian American panethnicity, a process that shifts between high school and college.

T1  - An Examination of Color-Blind Racism and Race-Related Stress Among African American Undergraduate Students
AN  - 1448995576; 201342815
AB  - This study examined the role of color-blind racial ideology among a sample of 152 African American undergraduate students in relation to race-related stress. We hypothesized that those who endorsed relatively higher color-blind racial attitudes would experience greater race-related stress because experiences with racism would be interpreted as more taxing without an operating framework of extant racism in the United States. Contrary to our hypothesis, after controlling for overall well-being, trait-level positive and negative affect, and racial identity, we found color-blind racial attitudes to be a negative predictor of race-related stress. This finding indicates that moderate levels of color-blind attitudes may act as a buffer against race-related stress among undergraduate students who possess an overall sense of well-being. A detailed discussion of the findings and implications for future research is provided. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright The Association of Black Psychologists.]

T1  - Unpacking the Race Talk
AN  - 1551001285; 201429069
AB  - Race is one of the most contested topics. With the political victory of Barack Obama as the first African American president, discussions about racial issues in the United States have surfaced to the forefront of political debates. Yet, critics have argued that there is not much discussion about race given its significance in the history of this country. Informed by critical race theory, this paper examines the underlying reasons explaining the silence of many people about race. It goes on to examine race through a mosaic lens, pointing out various factors directly connected to it, such as racial identity politics, racism, multiracialism, and White hegemony. Finally, this paper analyzes the manner in which socially constructed racial stereotypes have contributed to and have been used to justify the poor socioeconomic situation and marginalization of People of Color, including linguistically and culturally diverse students.

T1  - Sexual Identity in the American Deep South: The Concordance and Discordance of Sexual Activity, Relationships, and Identities
AN  - 1494299950; 201401987
AB  - This research explores the association between sexual identity and sexual behavior and how that association varies across gender and race in the American Deep South. Multinomial logistic regression analysis is used to determine the likelihood of each sexual identity given past sexual behavior, sexual relationships, and other social characteristics. The more traditional cultural climate of the South appears to suppress identification as a sexual minority. Sexual identification in the Deep South is primarily a product of sexual activity and sexual relationships, although attitudes toward and contact with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community play a minor role. Although most participants' sexual behaviors and identities were in concordance, sexual discordance was highest for White women and lowest for White men. Discordance was also associated with traditional men's roles attitudes, negative homosexuality attitudes, and contact with the LGBT community. It is hoped that these results encourage scholarship that deconstructs the sexual behavior and identity of all groups, not just oppressed groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Managing multi-mobility and multi-layered identity in China: how ethnic Chinese-Venezuelan returnees cope with Chinese language, culture and identity
AN  - 1463011787; 201345873
AB  - An increasing number of ethnic Chinese students born in Venezuela return to mainland China each year to study the language of their ancestors, Mandarin. This article examines how they expose themselves to multiple discourses of 'identity', develop a reflexive strategy to cope with a multi-layered identity and act out their identity in China. In order to do so three core topics -- culture, language, and identity will be analyzed and elucidated. In today's world, different forms of mobility affect the negotiation of identity and belonging. Besides migration or the physical/corporeal mobility of people there are other forms of mobilities such as the mobility of commodities, the flows of information, ideas and beliefs, financial mobility as in the case of remittances, virtual travel through Internet. These mobilities intersect and affect different discourses of language, identity and culture. The identity and sense of belonging of this group will be elucidated in four interconnected realms of social life: (1) family, (2) school, (3) fashion and popular culture, (4) food practices.

T1  - Do Factors Other than SES Explain Differences in Child Outcomes Between Children of Teenage and Older Mothers for Off-Reserve First Nations Children?
AN  - 1629332068; 201440935
AB  - This study used data from the Aboriginal Children's Survey (ACS) to explore differences in behavioural outcomes for First Nations children born to teen and older mothers living off-reserve in Canada. Of particular interest was an examination of socio-economic and contextual influences, and their contributions to differences in child outcomes. Findings from this study demonstrate that off-reserve First Nations children born to teen mothers (aged 12 - 19 years when they started childbearing) had poorer behavioural outcomes compared to off-reserve First Nations children born to older mothers (aged 25 and over when they started childbearing). These differences were found for emotional symptoms, inattention and hyperactivity, and conduct disorder scores, but not for prosocial behaviours. Contextual factors differed for children born to teen mothers as compared to older mothers, but parenting behaviors and the number of people involved in raising the child was similar for both groups. While differences in the behaviour of children born to teen mothers are often attributed to poorer socio-economic conditions, this study demonstrates that other contextual factors (e.g., breastfeeding, social support, screen time, residential mobility) may be as important as socio-economic factors in their contribution to the behavioural outcomes of children of teen mothers.

T1  - The souls of white folk beyond formation and structure: bound to identity
AN  - 1438560928; 201340231
AB  - Omi and Winant's Racial Formations (1994) and Feagin's Systemic Racism (2006) and White Racial Frame (2010) provide robust analyses of race, racism and racial inequality. Yet, both models hold distinctive, even antagonistic, assumptions on how white racial identities are formed and their relationship to (anti-)racism. We point to a theoretical synthesis of the strengths of both paradigms that centres on 'hegemonic whiteness' (Hughey 2010, 2012a) -- namely the role that interactional accountabilities and expectations of racial identity performance have to play as both product and cause of the racialized social order. The ongoing pursuit of an idealized white racial self is thus illuminated as the point of suture between Feagin's focus on the relative uniformity of white privilege and Omi and Winant's attention to the political and ideological heterogeneity of whiteness.

T1  - Developing a White anti-racism identity: A psycho-educational group model
AN  - 1463010544; 201345754
AB  - This paper describes and assesses a seven session psycho-educational group on anti-racism identity development for White European-American undergraduate students at a midwestern U.S. university. It is predicated on the premise that Whiteness can simultaneously privilege and harm White people, and that White students have the potential to become personally invested in the challenging of systematic racism. It is also based on the idea that a group structure presents an ideal format for addressing this topic. Peer support, a safe environment, and information are requisites for facilitating personal exploration of this sensitive subject. A group model for addressing this topic is presented and assessed. Key considerations, essential elements, strengths and weaknesses, suggestions for replication and further research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Korean, Chinese, or what? Identity transformations of Chosonjok (Korean Chinese) migrant brides in South Korea
AN  - 1315603548; 201307582
AB  - Chosonjok migrant brides are Korean Chinese women who married South Korean men (hereafter Korean men). The number of Chosonjok migrant brides increased rapidly until recently due to the attempts of the central and local governments of Korea to resolve bride shortages in rural areas in the early 1990s and the Koreans' preference for ethnic Korean brides over non-Korean foreign brides. Currently there are more than 26,000 Chosonjok migrant brides in Korea. Due to the drastic changes to their post-migration lives in their ethnic homeland of Korea, most Chosonjok migrant brides experience changes in their ethno-national identity(ies). This paper investigates this process and the underlying reasons for these post-ethnic return migration identity changes. It also looks at the types of identity changes that occur through in-depth interviews with 22 Chosonjok migrant brides in Korea. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Revisiting the Salafi-jihadist Threat in Xinjiang
AN  - 1551000638; 201429027
AB  - The fear of a burgeoning Salafi-jihadism in Xinjiang has been a public driving factor in Chinese policies in the region. This menace is exaggerated. Though there may be Salafi-jihadist elements among the larger, discontented Uyghur population, it is not a mass movement posing an existential threat to the Chinese political order in Xinjiang. Nationalism fuels this Sino-Uyghur conflict while Islam functions as a pragmatic weapon. Uyghur Islam, Uyghur identity, and the history of Uyghur rebellions in the twentieth century, all undergird this conclusion. The form of Islam-Hanafi, Sufi, and indigenous customs-commonly practiced by Uyghurs is antithetical to Salafism and the state imposes constraints on religious praxis. A Muslim identity is only one among several competing identities that comprise the ethnic idea of a Uyghur. The character of Uyghur rebellions, even ones that blatantly declare jihad, demonstrates the primacy of nationalism, the absence of Salafi-jihadism, and the malleability of Uyghur identity. These three evidences bolster the case to revisit the question of Salafi-jihadism in Xinjiang and find a more complex socio-religious perspective. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Striking lives: Multiple narratives of South Asian women's employment, identity and protest in the UK
AN  - 1448996227; 201342784
AB  - This article draws on the narratives of the two groups of South Asian women (SAW) in the UK who took part in industrial disputes some 30 years apart, in order to examine the ways in which they have negotiated their way through their classed, racialized and gendered inclusion in the labour market. The comparison of the Grunwick and the Gate Gourmet disputes and the employment histories of the actors involved in these disputes enables us to explore the centrality of waged work to the social construction of a diasporic identity and the complexity of SAW's identities in the UK. This article utilizes an intersectional framework, based on life history interviews, to reinterpret historical events by examining women's experiences of industrial action in the context of their class backgrounds and changing class positions, and particular histories of migration and settlement.

T1  - Inventing racist roads not taken: The licensing effect of immoral counterfactual behaviors
AN  - 1347785818; 201318721
AB  - Six experiments examined how people strategically use thoughts of foregone misdeeds to regulate their moral behavior. We tested 2 hypotheses: 1st, that people will feel licensed to act in morally dubious ways when they can point to immoral alternatives to their prior behavior, and 2nd, that people made to feel insecure about their morality will exaggerate the extent to which such alternatives existed. Supporting the 1st hypothesis, when White participants could point to racist alternatives to their past actions, they felt they had obtained more evidence of their own virtue (Study 1), they expressed less racial sensitivity (Study 2), and they were more likely to express preferences about employment and allocating money that favored Whites at the expense of Blacks (Study 3). Supporting the 2nd hypothesis, White participants whose security in their identity as nonracists had been threatened remembered a prior task as having afforded more racist alternatives to their behavior than did those who were not threatened. This distortion of the past involved overestimating the number of Black individuals they had encountered on the prior task (Study 4) and exaggerating how stereotypically Black specific individuals had looked (Studies 5 and 6). We discuss implications for moral behavior, the motivated rewriting of one's moral history, and how the life unlived can liberate people to lead the life they want.

T1  - OTHER, UPPITY OBAMA
AN  - 1551000499; 201428948
AB  - Until 2008, only White candidates represented either of the two major parties as presidential nominees. Hence, little is known about how race appeals are framed by or against non-White presidential candidates. Barack Obama's election as the Democratic Party nominee allows us to investigate this issue. In this article, we conduct a content analysis of over 160 advertisements from the 2008 U.S. presidential election to examine how race appeals were framed (or countered) by each campaign. We find that the Republican campaign employed implicit racial appeals that played upon stereotypes of non-Whites as 'un-American' and 'other' and Blacks as 'dangerous,' 'criminal,' 'incompetent,' and 'uppity.' In contrast, the Democratic campaign de-emphasized race, portrayed 'other' as positive, reinforced American identity, and spoke out against negative advertisements. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity, violence, and the immigrant-guest metaphor in Kenya
AN  - 1494749096; 201400197
AB  - Kenya's enduring ethnic violence is frequently explained with reference to the mobilization of ethnicity from above, and relatively little attention has been paid to the participation of ordinary people. Focusing on the violence that followed the 2007 general elections, this article explores how bottom-up processes of identification and violence interacted with incitement from above. It argues that autochthonous discourses of belonging and exclusion engendered an understanding of ethnic others as 'immigrants' and 'guests', and these narratives of territorialized identity both reinforced elite manipulation and operated independently of it. Kenya's post-election violence can thus be understood as a bottom-up performance of narratives of ethnic territorial exclusion operating alongside more direct elite involvement, organization, and incitement. The durability of these narratives, as well as their inherent plasticity, has significant implications for the potential for further violence and the prospects for democratization.

T1  - Diverse unity: creole contributions to interethnic integration in Guinea-Bissau
AN  - 1221410018; 201244069
AB  - The paper explores how creole categories of people who have constituted a small but influential minority in Guinea-Bissau for centuries contributed to a countrywide, integrated national culture since the eve of independence in 1974. Since independence, several cultural representations previously exclusive to creole communities have been -- driven by the nationalist independence movement and the early postcolonial state -- transformed into representations of a new national culture, crossing ethnic and religious boundaries. The fact that creole identity and culture had been transethnic -- i.e. creole identity brings together individuals of heterogeneous cultural, ethnic and geographic descent -- during the colonial period, has fostered in postcolonial times the countrywide spread of previously exclusively creole cultural features. I argue that this 'transethnicisation' of creole cultural representations has unified Bissau-Guineans across ethnic lines, causing a strong commitment with their nation 'from below'.

T1  - Acculturation and Language Orientations of Turkish Immigrants in Australia, France, Germany, and the Netherlands
AN  - 1125223617; 201240538
AB  - The authors examined acculturation and language orientations among Turkish immigrants in Australia (n = 283), France (n = 266), Germany (n = 265), and the Netherlands (n = 271). They expected that the countries with the least pluralistic climate (France and Germany) would show the lowest level of sociocultural adjustment and the highest level of ethnic orientation and language use; the opposite was expected in Australia, as the country with the most pluralistic climate; and the Netherlands would have an intermediate position. The predictions were largely borne out. The language orientation measures yielded a (symbolic) language value factor and a (behavioral) language preference factor. In all countries Turkish identity was a positive predictor and mainstream identity a negative predictor of both the language value and preference factor. Mainstream and Turkish identity showed stronger negative correlations in the less pluralistic countries. It is concluded that immigrants showed the least maintenance and the most adjustment in Australia, which is the country with the least pressure to assimilate.

T1  - Come get these memories: gender, history and racial uplift in Bill Condon's Dreamgirls
AN  - 1792349945
AB  - On the release of the screen adaptation of Dreamgirls (2006), ex-Motown songwriter William 'Smokey' Robinson fielded speculations about corruption at America's most successful black-owned business. In the broader context of racial inequalities in media ownership and distribution, this article asks how spectacles of hard-won individual success, juxtaposed sharply against sexually and financially corrupt 'music moguls', continue to shape popular mythologies of the US music industry. In particular, the article focuses on the ways that sexual combat, corrupt masculinities and the politics of respectability inform Dreamgirls' dramatization of the shift from pre-integration to post-Civil Rights America. Finally, the notion of post-racial discourse is used to make sense of the competing historical interpretations at work in the film and its critical reception, especially with regard to the use of past entertainment icons to make sense of Beyoncé Knowles' and Jennifer Hudson's own success stories. Throughout, the article argues that myths of meritocracy cannot be separated from the racialized and gendered cultures of production that continue to shape the contemporary repackaging of popular histories and musical genres.

T1  - Discursive psychology and feminism
AN  - 1315598691; 201307424
AB  - This appraisal highlights the productive engagement between feminism and discursive psychology (DP). It discusses some of the confluence and tensions between DP and feminism. The two share critical perspectives on science and psychology, a concern with prejudice, and have ideas in common about the constructed nature of social categories, such as gender. One difficulty arises from the relativism associated with the post-structural theoretical underpinnings of DP, which can be understood as politically paralyzing. Another problem comes from an endorsement of a conversation analytic mentality, where identity categories such as gender can only be legitimately used in an analysis when participants' orient to their relevance. The high-profile debates and literature in DP shows it has made a notable contribution to social psychology and its influence can also be found in other areas. A particular influence of DP highlighted in the present appraisal is on gender and language research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The "New Mestiza," the Old Mestizos: Contrasting Discourses on Mestizaje
AN  - 1283640358; 201303237
AB  - This article analyzes varying, inconsistent, representations of "mestizaje" (generally construed as racial or cultural mixing in the Americas) deriving from different historical settings and ideological frameworks. It particularly focuses on what I here term "old mestizaje," summarized in the writings of Latin American intellectuals of the first quarter of the twentieth century, such as Mexican philosopher Jose Vasconcelos (The Cosmic Race); and "new mestizaje," articulated in the works of such contemporary thinkers as Chicana writer Gloria Anzaldua (Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza). The center piece of the article is the contradictions and fractures between old and new discourses in terms of their underlying views of race, identity, and "destiny." It examines the links of old mestizaje with essentialist, Social Darwinist, concepts, and the foundations of new mestizaje on a critical cultural studies paradigm. I propose that various aspects of old mestizaje infused hegemonic racial ideologies throughout Latin America and engendered a form of "color blindness" that obscured pervasive racial inequalities in the region.

T1  - Ethnicity, nationality, and the rights of indigeneity: the case of Rotumans in Fiji
AN  - 1792349825
AB  - On 13 July 2000, Interim Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase presented to the Great Council of Chiefs in Fiji a document titled 'Blueprint for the protection of Fijian & Rotuman rights and interests, and the advancement of their development,' a set of proposals that covered 'issues which have been of great concern to Fijians and Rotumans regarding the security of their rights and interests as the indigenous communities in Fiji, and also the advancement and acceleration of their development, so that they can participate on an equitable basis in the progress of our country' (Qarase, 2000b). This paper presents an analysis of a challenge to the grouping of Rotumans with Fijians as indigenes under the Blueprint, and Rotuman responses to arguments denying their indigeneity.

AN  - 1364700297; 201323380
AB  - What lies behind the sustained idea of "Pan African Unity", beginning with the early 1900s Diaspora Pan African congresses, through its emergence as state-centric Pan Africanism in an age of independence, and to its current dispensation as the "third stage" Pan Africanism manifest by Africa's African Union (Murithi)? The article examines the manner that the African Union is socioculturally sculpting and re-inventing the universality of the African identity and Pan African Nation. In it, we demonstrate how the African Union (AU) is re-appropriating the idea of Pan Africanism among African and African descendent peoples around the world, and using it creatively to mobilize a reconstruction of a global "African World View". This, perspective represents the more nuanced, subtle, invisible -- though ideational -- bases through which the AU exerts its political power and will to reverse its marginalized circumstance and engage geopolitically in a self-determined posture. Here, we see the role that culture plays in the AU's global governance objectives. We argue that AU cultural globalization rather than "essentialist", "purist", or "racialist" (Gilroy 1993, Appiah 1992) is in effect pluralist, hybrid, transformationalist, and premised on the sustained memory of a global, trans-generational shared set of experiences that have been drawn from as well as reformulated around the idea of Pan Africanism; but that its prospects for fostering political union and assigning citizenship rights to African and African descendent peoples is still an illusion.

T1  - Playing through differences: black-white racial logic and interrogating South Asian American identity
AN  - 1283642057; 201303476
AB  - This article examines how South Asian American communities ascribe meaning to the category of 'race' while adding their own sensibilities to racial categories of 'black' and 'white'. Drawing upon ethnographic methods, I analyse leisure spaces of basketball to demonstrate how racial formation in the US for non-white ethnic American subjects engages the black-white racial binary while simultaneously critiquing this racial logic. Racial categories provide a lexicon for comprehending South Asian American difference, while South Asian idioms perpetuate racializing discourses. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Self-reported discrimination and discriminatory behaviour: The role of attachment security
AN  - 1283641825; 201303115
AB  - Past research shows that attachment security is linked to low prejudice (Hofstra, Van Oudenhoven & Bunnk, 2005; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2001). We extend this research by examining the role of attachment security in discriminatory choices and discriminatory behaviour. The current study examines the influence of primed attachment security (vs. neutral prime) on self-reported discrimination and actual discriminatory behaviour towards Muslims. Results illustrate that primed attachment security (vs. a neutral prime) significantly predicts both the choice to discriminate against Muslims and subsequent behavioural discrimination towards a Muslim. Implications for increasing attachment security as a means of reducing prejudice and discrimination are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - School Belonging and School Misconduct: The Differing Role of Teacher and Peer Attachment
AN  - 927125444; 21567214
AB  - The schools-as-communities perspective provides a popular explanation for school-disruptive behavior, stating that interpersonal bonding at school and feelings of school belonging prevent misconduct. In this article, we build on this perspective in three ways. First, we test whether the preventive influence of school belonging acts at the individual or school level. Secondly, we test whether a distinction should be made between the different actors with whom students bond at school, by assessing whether perceived teacher support, school belonging, and peer attachment relate differently to school misconduct. Lastly, the present study investigates whether the associations of bonding with teachers, peers and the school with school misconduct differ by socio-ethnic school context. Multilevel analyses were performed on data from the Flemish Educational Assessment. The sample consisted of 11,872 students (51.4% female) in 85 schools, most of whom were natives (88.8%), with immigrants (11.2%) mostly having Turkish or Moroccan backgrounds (both about 30% of immigrants in the sample), and others Southern-European (16%), Eastern-European (8%), North-African (5%), or other (17%) backgrounds. Results showed that the students' individual feelings of bonding with peers, teachers and school associate with school misconduct, rather than the overall school cohesion. Results further showed that, while higher perceived teacher support and school belonging related to less school misconduct, higher peer attachment was associated with higher rates of school misconduct. No differences were found by socio-ethnic context. Implications are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - COLOR CAPITAL, WHITE DEBT, AND THE PARADOX OF STRONG WHITE RACIAL IDENTITIES
AN  - 1531930957; 201423297
AB  - This article examines how meaning is made of White racial identity by comparing two White racial projects assumed antithetical-White nationalists and White antiracists. While clear differences abound, they make meaning of Whiteness and racial 'others' in surprisingly similar ways. Racial identity formation is structured by understandings of Whiteness as dull, empty, lacking, and incomplete ('White debt') coupled with a search to alleviate those feelings through the appropriation of objects, discourses, and people coded as non-White ('Color capital'). Drawing from in-depth semi-structured interviews, fourteen months of ethnographic observations, and content analysis, this article demonstrates how the prevailing meanings of Whiteness, not their antithetical political projects or material resources, enable racial identity management. By examining seemingly antithetical White formations, the article illuminates not only striking differences but how divergent White actors similarly negotiate the dominant expectations of Whiteness.

T1  - Blacks may be second class, but they can't make them leave: Mexican racial formation and immigrant status in Winston-Salem
AN  - 1221412304; 201244061
AB  - In this article, I investigate how race is produced by looking at the reception experiences of Afro and Mestizo Mexican migrants to the new South. Despite the fact that Afro and Mestizo Mexicans are both phenotypically and culturally distinct from one another, they assert a shared racial identity as minorities and as Latinos. On the basis of ethnographic field work in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, I argue that their perceived similarities with African Americans and pervasive discrimination owing to status drives Afro-Mexicans to assert a race-based Latino identity that is shaped by their understanding of African American experiences.

T1  - Francophone Exceptionalism within Alpine Ethno-regionalism? The Cases of the Union Valdotaine and the Ligue Savoisienne
AN  - 1567049309; 201435165
AB  - In their book Challenges to Consensual Politics: Democracy, Identity, and Populist Protest in the Alpine Region, Daniele Caramani and Yves Meny argue that the Alpine region displays a political culture characterized, among other things, by marked conservatism, nativism and Euroscepticism. Such transnational political culture manifests itself throughout the Alpine arch by the presence of successful ethno-regionalist, right-wing populist and Eurosceptic parties. In the same book, however, Michael Keating proposes a more nuanced thesis. While the above-mentioned characteristics are, indeed, predominant in the Germanic-speaking area of the Alps (with some spill-over effects in the Italian-speaking area), the French-speaking area boasts a more progressive political culture. The paper aims to explore this alternative thesis by analysing the ideological identities of two ethno-regionalist parties operating in the Francophone Alpine area-the Union Valdotaine in Italy and the Ligue Savoisienne in France. The analysis substantiates Caramani and Meny's thesis, revealing how most ideological aspects present in other Alpine areas, such as localism, traditionalist conservatism, work ethics and reluctance to share wealth with others, are very strong in Savoy and Aosta valley too. However, the lack or weakness of crucial populist radical-right ideological elements, such as open xenophobia, racism and Euroscepticism, appears to support Keating's alternative thesis.

T1  - Between global racial and bounded identity: choice of destigmatization strategies among Ethiopian Jews in Israel
AN  - 1037876018; 201231142
AB  - Our research explores how Ethiopian Jews in Israel apply local and global cultural resources when forming their reactive strategies to stigmatization. Drawing on 40 in-depth interviews with adult men and women, we examine class variations in the destigmatization strategies of working-class and middle-class Ethiopian Jews. Working-class Ethiopian Jews rely on their local bounded identity, that of Jews, rather than identity politics, which stresses phenotype in formulating destigmatization strategies. The former provide is Ethiopians of all classes with the network of meaning necessary for active participation in the broader society, whereas the latter is primarily the province of a small number of highly educated middle-class individuals, those who had access to social networks of highly educated liberals and could mobilize valued global black cultural resources (e.g. music, art) to their advantage in the local context.

T1  - Perceived Racial Discrimination as a Barrier to College Enrollment for African Americans
AN  - 925713868; 201204194
AB  - African Americans trail European Americans in terms of academic achievement, even when accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. One cause of this gap may be racial discrimination. In the current article the authors hypothesized that early perceived racial discrimination (by 5th grade) would predict college enrollment, mediated by changes from 7th grade to 10th grade in academic orientation, college aspirations and expectations, and deviance tolerance. Participants were 750 African Americans from the Family and Community Health Study. A structural equation model that controlled for socioeconomic status and earlier academic performance supported the hypothesis, with the exception that discrimination did not influence aspirations. The effect of discrimination on expectations, however, was moderated: Participants with high future orientation maintained high expectations in spite of discrimination. These results suggest that discrimination discourages some African Americans from pursuing higher education and that increasing future orientation may promote African Americans' college enrollment.

T1  - "Is it Safe?" Risk Perception and Drinking Water in a Vulnerable Population
AN  - 1347785648; 201318914
AB  - Access to safe drinking water is a pressing social policy issue globally. Despite the milestones reached in this area of Canadian public health, marginalized and vulnerable populations, including those founded on racialized identity, such as First Nations, continue to be plagued by accessibility issues. This work sheds new perspective on the issue, arguing for a research and policy focus that is inclusive of risk perception. A model of risk perception of drinking water is developed and tested for First Nations on reserve in Canada using the 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey. It is shown that the analytical use of racialized identity advances understanding of risk perception and the environment (water). Moreover, a large degree of heterogeneity within the First Nation population across a number of social determinants of risk perception illustrates the shortcomings of framing the issue in a simplistic manner (First Nation population versus general population). Implications for risk research, including risk communication & management, and policy are provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Question of the Future of Indian Muslims in Malaysia: The Post-Mahathir Legacy Era
AN  - 1125218771; 201240514
AB  - The Malays, Chinese and Indian community in Malaysia have been homogenized since British colonialism. The existence of Indian Muslims' identity caused a new paradigm shift in Malaysia involving the racial discussion. This paper traces the difference in Indian Muslims' identities from Indian and the Hindus. I argued that Indian Muslims share Islam as their religion and faith, while maintaining a Malay way of life and custom in their daily practices. In Malaysia, the Indian Muslim community struggled to place their future in terms of social, economic allocation and political justification among the other communities. However, the strength of ethnic politics clearly charted out their involvement in the political base and moved them to fight for their cause and rights. Hence, today's Indian Muslim community has caused an Islamic resurgence, which has brought a new Indian dimension as a whole. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Role of Racial Identification, Social Acceptance/Rejection, Social Cognition, and Racial Socialization in Multiracial Youth's Positive Development
AN  - 964196861; 201207414
AB  - Deficit-based scholarship has suggested that multiracial youth are maladjusted due to racial identity confusion and social marginality. This paper proposes an integrative model of multiracial youth's positive development. This model highlights the important role of social cognition in understanding multiracial youth's development. Drawing on Spencer's PVEST, developmental research on monoracial and multiracial youth, and the racial socialization literature, I argue that multiracial youth's perceptions of how their racial identity choices are accepted in their social environment have implications for their adjustment. Serving as developmental resources, parents can attenuate their children's social perceptual biases or enhance their abilities to cope with actualized negative social experiences by engaging in cultural socialization, preparation for bias, and transmitting race-related messages that help multiracial children reframe their negative perceptions.

T1  - ARTISTIC SCRIPTS, NARRATIVES, AND THE THEATRE: IDENTITY CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES IN THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
AN  - 925713404; 201204217
AB  - Analysts in the subfield of social movements recognize the importance of culture, and by extension, artistic mediums to facilitating solidarity between members of a community that in turn spurs them to social or political action. This study uses both primary and secondary sources to examine theatrical works linked to the Chicano movement. In particular, we are interested in the ways dimensions of collective identity such as negotiation, boundaries, and consciousness surface in narratives or texts. Theatrical scripts, we argue, give clear indications of group mobilization efforts. Through a textual analysis of plays, we also observe that Chicano theater draws on group history, language, and folklore as it defines and reinforces identity. Analyzing works of theater from the 1960s Chicano movement, along with contemporary pieces, provides a look into the ways that collective identity is used in different time periods, in comparable and contrasting ways, and shows both the constancy and trajectory of the movement.

T1  - Filipinos in Nueva Espana: Filipino-Mexican Relations, Mestizaje, and Identity in Colonial and Contemporary Mexico
AN  - 1417526502; 201331922
AB  - This essay examines how the Manila-Acapulco galleon era (1565-1815) under Spanish colonialism forged the early mestizaje between Filipino Indio men and Mexican Indian and mixed race women, which produced children who became the first multiethnic Mexican-Filipinos in Nueva Espana (Mexico). This story is juxtaposed with current migrations of Filipinos to Mexico via the vacation cruise liners, which share a story of contemporary mixing between Filipinos and Mexicans. By acknowledging both their identities and looking to the past, these modern day multiethnic Mexipinos and Filipinos connect to a long historical web of interconnectedness which underpins the mestizaje that began in the sixteenth century. The Mexico-Philippines relationship created and managed by Spain from the 1500s to the 1800s was the first Pacific Rim association, especially to demonstrate that the cultural byproducts of the transcontinental ties deserve as much attention as their economic, political, and military counterparts.

T1  - When Ethnicity and Religion Meet: Kinship Ties and Cross-Border Dynamics in the Afghan-Pakistani Conflict Zone
AN  - 919904189; 201201687
AB  - This article offers a framework for understanding civil strife, synthesizing subnational and transnational dimensions of kinship ties. While existing research generally distinguishes between intrastate and interstate factors of civil war, this study posits that it is the combination of linked ethnic and religious identity traits of groups within the state, and the existence of cross-border affinity ties, that serve as a feeding mechanism of civil strife. Such a synthesized viewpoint is most applicable in the case of the Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border. Loosening the solid Pashtun affiliations and controlling border politics necessitate a nation-building process to "domesticate" the Pashtuns and integrate them into state politics, so that their tribal and national loyalties will correspond.

T1  - Drag Queens' Use of Language and the Performance of Blurred Gendered and Racial Identities
AN  - 907929207; 201124727
AB  - Building on Barrett (1998), this study provides a sociolinguistic analysis of the language used by Suzanne, a European-American drag queen, during her on-stage performance in the southeastern United States. Suzanne uses wigs and costumes to portray a female character on stage, but never hides the fact that she is biologically male. She is also a member of a predominantly African-American cast. Through her creative use of linguistic features such as stylemixing (i.e., the use of linguistic features shared across multiple language varieties) and expletives, Suzanne is able to perform an identity that frequently blurs gender and racial lines.

T1  - Community Cohesion and Social Inclusion: Unravelling a Complex Relationship
AN  - 896184937; 201120138
AB  - In a global context of an emphasis on identity politics and a 'cultural turn' in social analysis, deep concern has been expressed about multiethnic Britain becoming a broken society with many 'sleepwalking' into segregation and separatism. Given the close correspondence between areas of acute ethnic segregation and those of multiple deprivation, intercommunal tensions have included disputes about the equitable allocation of scarce urban resources across ethnicity. This creates the possibility that urban programmes may inadvertently accentuate intercommunal tension and confound efforts to synchronise cohesion and inclusion agendas. Following recent debates about the implications of increased diversity, influenced by arguments that multiculturalism has encouraged 'parallel lives', an emergent policy framework emphasises more proactive integration to promote 'common belonging'. Criticism of this agenda includes its confusion between community and social cohesion, and its disproportionate focus on cultural aspects such as identity formation and recognition, relative to structural issues of income and class. In exploring this contested terrain in Britain, the article suggests that the longer-term debate about segregation, deprivation and community differentials in Northern Ireland can offer useful insight for Britain's policy discourse.

T1  - Identity Politics and Cultural Asymmetries: Singaporean Transmigrants 'Fashioning' Cosmopolitanism
AN  - 896180425; 201120145
AB  - The politics of identity and difference are often intensely experienced and negotiated in everyday encounters. By examining the experiences of highly skilled Singaporean transmigrants in London and their projects of cosmopolitan self-fashioning, this paper highlights the way in which 'race' and nationality trouble claims to cosmopolitanism. In the analysis I consider the mixing of cultures and selective 'local' norms picked up by this group of migrants. I focus on the oscillating cultural framings that they navigate in their professional and social interactions, particularly in terms of phenotype, cultural discourse and bodily presentations. In so doing, I argue for a more critical view towards popular notions of cosmopolitanism currently in circulation and instead invoke an alternative cosmopolitan urbanism.

T1  - A Population-Based Study of Job Stress in Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites
AN  - 887499140; 201118173
AB  - There is little known about the association between socioeconomic status and job stress in Mexican Americans. To address this issue, data were originated on a community level using personal interviews from working Mexican Americans using a multistage probability sample. In this study we described the population's sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, and job stress measures in Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic Whites, and non-Hispanic Blacks. Regression models were used to examine the associations of sociodemographic characteristics and health conditions for each job stress measure among 937 individuals. Our results indicate an association between low socioeconomic status and the perception of less job control, less job security, and less social support. Mexican Americans demonstrated more job security and social support in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites of similar socioeconomic status. We were able to define potential factors that may contribute to an individual's perception of job stress. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Can't hold us back! Hip-hop and the racial motility of aboriginal bodies in urban spaces
AN  - 1792351613
AB  - Urban centers across Canada are partitioned by racial geographies that circumvent and circumscribe the movements of aboriginal bodies. This article examines how aboriginal youth experience and engage these racisms that organize Canadian social spaces. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken at a drop-in recreational centre in the inner city of Edmonton, Alberta, it documents the different ways in which indigenous youth employ hip-hop as a means to contest their subjection to these immobilizing racisms. First, it shows how these youth employ hip-hop as a technology of self-transformation through which they recreate their selves as meaningful, efficacious political actors capable of disrupting their relegation to criminogenic places. Second, it documents how the practice of a distinctly indigenous hip-hop allows these youth to innovate an aesthetic space disruptive of the historicist racisms that otherwise subject aboriginality to anachronistic spaces. Finally, this article shows that, by performing a hybridized, distinctly indigenous breakdance, these practitioners of hip-hop dramatize the physical and cultural motility of aboriginal bodies.

T1  - Race/Ethnicity And U.S. Adult Mortality: Progress, Prospects, and New Analyses
AN  - 887498951; 201118128
AB  - Although there have been significant decreases in U.S. mortality rates, racial/ethnic disparities persist. The goals of this study are to: (1) elucidate a conceptual framework for the study of racial/ethnic differences in U.S. adult mortality, (2) estimate current racial/ethnic differences in adult mortality, (3) examine empirically the extent to which measures of socioeconomic status and other risk factors impact the mortality differences across groups, and (4) utilize findings to inform the policy community with regard to eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in mortality. Relative Black-White differences are modestly narrower when compared to a decade or so ago, but remain very wide. The majority of the Black-White adult mortality gap can be accounted for by measures of socioeconomic resources that reflect the historical and continuing significance of racial socioeconomic stratification. Further, when controlling for socioeconomic resources, Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants exhibit significantly lower mortality risk than non-Hispanic Whites. Without aggressive efforts to create equality in socioeconomic and social resources, Black-White disparities in mortality will remain wide, and mortality among the Mexican-origin population will remain higher than what would be the case if that population achieved socioeconomic equality with Whites.

T1  - Hegemonic Ideological Coordinates and the Rhetorical Construction of "The Illegal Immigrant" in the United States
AN  - 1266150039; 201300395
AB  - This study examines American constructions of "the illegal immigrant" as it appears in popular and political discourse. In doing so, it advances the idea of "hegemonic ideological coordinates" as the domain of a social field that helps individuals to come to terms with their belief in illegal immigration restrictions. Hegemonic ideological coordinates are defined in this essay as the parameters that influence the symbolic construction of political belief. Specifically, they are a collection of socio-centric statements which condition identity with the values and judgments of preceding generations that "subject" individuals through language of constraint and/or liberation. This essay examines the hegemonic ideological coordinates of anti-illegal immigration rhetoric. It examines American anti-illegal immigration rhetoric surrounding twelve coordinates: (1) "Un-American," (2) "Alien(iz)ation of the Enemy," (3) "Criminality," (4) "Economic Deterioration," (5) "Public Services," (6) "Infectiousness," (7) "Bestialization," (8) "Racialization," (9) "God," (10) "Environmental Contaminants," (11) "Overpopulation," and (12) "Pieces of Shit and Other Expletives." In the end, it is possible to gain valuable insights into the illegal immigration controversy, the formation of American political belief and the U.S. rhetorical construction of the scapegoat.

T1  - Discursive Deracialization in Talk about Asylum Seeking
AN  - 870433372; 201114198
AB  - In this paper we explore the extent to which 'discursive deracialization', the removal of 'race' from potentially racially motivated arguments, is taking place in talk about asylum seeking. A discourse analysis is conducted on the part of a corpus of data collected from focus groups with undergraduate students talking about asylum seeking, in which they were asked if they considered it to be racist to oppose asylum. We show that speakers use three arguments for opposing asylum that are explicitly framed as non-racist: opposition is based on (1) economic reasons (2) religious grounds and the associated threat of terrorism and (3) the lack of asylum seekers' ability to integrate into British society. These findings are discussed with regard to the implications they have for our understanding of discursive deracialization in which it is shown that there is a common knowledge understanding, albeit one that needs qualifying, that opposition to asylum is not racist.

T1  - Multicultural Ideology and Transnational Family Ties among Descendants of Cape Verdeans in Sweden
AN  - 852899922; 201103149
AB  - This article explores the relationship between the dominant Swedish multicultural ideology and second-generation Swedish-Cape Verdeans' perceptions of their transnational family relations. It examines how young Swedish-Cape Verdeans use their kinship relations to carve out an identity and sense of belonging that is reconcilable with Swedish multicultural ideology, and how the racist speech and xenophobic rejection they experience fuels their desire to create a transnational belonging. In Swedish public discourse, proper integration entails 'preserving one's culture' while simultaneously achieving socio-economic assimilation, especially in the labour market. Thus, official Swedish multicultural ideology, and its translation into popular understandings of 'culture' and 'origin', affect how the young Swedish-Cape Verdeans relate to their transnational kin, and to the more blatant discrimination.

T1  - Teaching Obama: history, critical race theory and social work education
AN  - 902082817; 201122245
AB  - Barack Obama's first autobiography, Dreams from My Father (1995), explores themes of race and identity up to the late 1980s in the life of the first African American president. The book emphasizes Obama's personal struggle as the son of an interracial couple, and the social and environmental context that shaped his growth and transformation. Using the tools of critical race theory, Freeman illustrates how Obama's autobiography can be used in the classroom to explore an individual's developing racial consciousness in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a prism through which students can understand what it means to live in the post-civil-rights-movement era. Obama's life history illuminates how the ideas and meanings of racial progress in the United States are contested and struggled over on a daily basis at both the micro and macro level.

T1  - A multidimensional approach to identity: Religious and cultural identity in young Jewish Canadians
AN  - 852897996; 201103082
AB  - This study used an online questionnaire to explore the relations among different dimensions of religious and cultural Jewish identity in young Canadian adults (N = 258). We investigated the extent to which three aspects of Jewish identity-religious identity, cultural identity, and identity salience- predicted openness to interfaith relationships and sociopolitical attitudes related to Israel. Results showed that compared to participants who self-identified as cultural Jews, those who self-identified as religious Jews or as both religious and cultural Jews scored higher on measures of cultural and religious identification. Moreover, relative to culturally identified Jews, religious and religious/cultural Jews were less open to interfaith relationships, endorsed more right-wing political attitudes with respect to Israel's foreign policy, and reported that their Jewish identity was more salient than their Canadian identity in identity-relevant situations. Similarly, relative to Jews of other denominations, Orthodox Jews reported higher levels of Jewish identification, greater salience of their Jewish identity, and advocated more right-wing political views.

T1  - Identity, Difference and Social Cohesion in Contemporary Britain
AN  - 1010630889; 201210624
AB  - This paper looks at questions of Britishness, identity and difference that have arisen as the UK has changed over the last 65 years, drawing on a range of source materials from the social, political and cultural spheres. It considers how racism and white ethnocentrism have helped shape both public debate and British black and South Asian experience as depicted in popular culture, literature and film, emphasising the role of this cultural practice in changing Britain. It addresses the ongoing debate about Britishness, cultural diversity and social cohesion with particular reference to developments since 9/11. The paper begins with a brief account of the history of migration and settlement in the post-Second World War period and looks at social and cultural responses to the issues that were raised by increased diversity in the UK. The paper argues that similar themes and issues continue to inform the cultural politics of race and ethnicity in the twenty-first century. The final section of the paper looks at how the cultural political agenda has responded to questions of diversity and social cohesion since 2001. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Is a Raceless Identity an Effective Strategy for Academic Success Among Blacks?
AN  - 818800571; 201071960
AB  - Objective. Fordham (1988, 1996) notes that because the larger black community has a culture that is oppositional to mainstream U.S. society, blacks who wish to maintain academic success and achieve upward socioeconomic mobility feel pressure to adopt a raceless identity. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a raceless identity leads to better educational outcomes for blacks in high school than does a nonraceless identity. Methods. data from the Maryland Adolescence Development In Context Study (MADICS), we create five profiles intended to capture blacks' connection to their race and determine whether racial-ethnic connections among blacks are associated with school achievement, educational aspirations, value attributed to schooling, or detachment from schooling. These links are assessed net of affective feelings about being black and beliefs about shared fate. Results. The findings are not consistent with the racelessness perspective. Specifically, blacks in the race ambivalent and race similar profiles have higher achievement and educational aspirations, and attribute more value to schooling and are less detached from schooling than are those in the race neutral profile. Conclusion. to which racelessness helps achievement. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Future in Inequality
AN  - 1883033771
AB  - Recently an article in Personality and Social Psychology Review urged social psychologists to reacquire their "sociological imagination" and incorporate broader, structural factors in their work. Studies of social inequality in particular seem ripe for this kind of collaboration. Psychological investigations relating to inequality typically center on interpersonal prejudice, stigma, or power relations. The sociological concept of social capital—loosely, benefits derived from social networks—has great relevance to social psychological theories of prejudice and discrimination. Psychologists often conceptualize prejudice as exclusion from ingroup resources and status based on a stigmatized characteristic. Research on the reciprocal relationship between neural and social networks also shows interdisciplinary promise. From this perspective, psychologists and sociologists both can model, for example, the diffusion of stereotypes or racial prejudice in a social system based on assumptions about how people process outgroup information and the likelihood of intergroup interaction. Together, these independent streams of research can jointly develop a structural theory of action that explains how neural and social networks change reciprocally. It is here that the future (understanding) of inequality lies.

T1  - Ethnic Dimensions in the Discourse and Identity Strategies of European Converts to Islam in Andalusia and Flanders
AN  - 818800195; 201072197
AB  - This paper provides a comparative analysis of the ethnic dimensions in discourse and identity strategies of European converts to Islam. To highlight the very different conditions which European neo-Muslims face when adopting an ethnicising discourse and/or strategies, two divergent settings for study are selected. We present data on Andalusia (Spain) where, in the aftermath of Francoism, Spanish neo-Muslims revitalised Andalusian ideas about the rootedness of Andalusia in Dar al Islam. This case is compared with Flanders (Belgium). Do we find similar ethnicising strategies and discourses among these two categories of European neo-Muslims? What are the limits of and possibilities for ethnicising conversion in each setting? And what are the implications with regard to the legitimating of the claimed mediatorship of converts between Islamic and European societies, on both an individual and a collective level? We are unable to conclude that the dynamics at the micro level are different in each setting, but are able to show that there are clear strategic differences at the macro and median levels.

T1  - 'Diversity' on Main Street? Branding Race and Place in the New 'Majority-Minority' Suburbs
AN  - 852898051; 201103194
AB  - The emergence in the United States of an increasing number of spaces across the socioeconomic spectrum with majority nonwhite populations merits close attention because of these spaces' potential in reconfiguring historical and contemporary claims to place. In an era in which the neoliberalization of urban development has spurred local governments toward more active involvement in defining relationships between race, ethnicity, consumption, and space, 'majority-minority' suburbs are particularly important sites of study. In the late 2000s, two branding campaigns in majority-Asian American and Latina/o municipalities in Los Angeles's San Gabriel Valley-a densely populated region popularly known as a 'suburban Chinatown'-put forth specific discourses of race, ethnicity, and culture in attempts to actualize specific visions and claims to place, identity, and history. In doing so, these campaigns illuminated and reinforced larger racial, geographic, and ideological divides. 'Diversity' on Main Street embraced pluralist multicultural discourses of the nation, while the 'Golden Mile' proposal sought to showcase the transformation of a central thoroughfare by ethnic Chinese capital and immigration. A close examination and comparison of these two campaigns shows how struggles over race, geography, and history are intertwined in the contemporary identities of places and integral to the shaping of civic landscapes.

T1  - The (dis)similarities of white racial identities: the conceptual framework of 'hegemonic whiteness'
AN  - 754041834; 201053333
AB  - This article examines the processes of white racial identity formation in the United States via an examination of a white nationalist organization and a white antiracist organization. Findings indicate that the construction of white racial identity in both groups is based on the reproduction of various racist and essentialist ideologies. The realization that there is a shared 'groupness' to outwardly different white identities has the potential to destabilize the recent trend that over-emphasizes white heterogeneity at the expense of discussion of power, racism and discrimination. As a resolution to this analytic dilemma, this article advances a conceptual framework entitled 'hegemonic whiteness'. White identity formation is thereby understood as a cultural process in which (1) racist, reactionary and essentialist ideologies are used to demarcate inter-racial boundaries, and (2) performances of white racial identity that fail to meet those ideals are marginalized and stigmatized, thereby creating intra-racial distinctions within the category 'white'.

T1  - Empire and ethnicity
AN  - 754039075; 201049695
AB  - Historians and social scientists have typically assumed a conflictual or exploitative relationship between empire and ethnicity. On the one hand, empire might be seen (as perhaps Ernest Gellner saw it in Nations and Nationalism) as a superstructure of coercion to which a group of ethnic units were subject. On the other (according to an influential view), empire fabricated ethnicities (tribes or castes) to divide and rule. This article suggests that both of these views are too crude. In the British case at least (and in the modern history of empire, no generalisation that excludes the British case has much value), 'imperial ethnicity' was a much more subtle phenomenon. It existed 'at home' as one element in a more complex identity. It was a powerful force in British settler societies, where an indigenous identity could not be imagined. And, perhaps surprisingly, it was deeply attractive to some colonial elites in Asia and Africa -- at least for a time. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 743065754; 201043019
AB  - Cultural neuroscience issues from the apparently incompatible combination of neuroscience and cultural psychology. A brief literature sampling suggests, instead, several preliminary topics that demonstrate proof of possibilities: cultural differences in both lower-level processes (e.g. perception, number representation) and higher-order processes (e.g. inferring others' emotions, contemplating the self) are beginning to shed new light on both culture and cognition. Candidates for future cultural neuroscience research include cultural variations in the default (resting) network, which may be social; regulation and inhibition of feelings, thoughts, and actions; prejudice and dehumanization; and neural signatures of fundamental warmth and competence judgments.
