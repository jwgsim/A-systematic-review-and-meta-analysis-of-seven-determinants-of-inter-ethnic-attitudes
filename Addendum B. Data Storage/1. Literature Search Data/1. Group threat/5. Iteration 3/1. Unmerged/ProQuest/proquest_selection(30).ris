T1  - Heterosexual men in Trump's America downplay compassion more for masculine (than for feminine) gay victims of hate crime: Why?
AN  - 2675939622
AB  - Why would heterosexual men downplay their compassion for masculine (vs. feminine) gay victims of hate crime? Two social identity‐inspired explanations provide contrasting answers to this question. The reactive distinctiveness thesis (RD) assumes that heterosexual men would downplay their compassion more, when cued to a gay victim's masculinity than to their femininity, provided evaluative concerns are strong. In contrast, the feminization‐threat thesis (FT) assumes that compassion downplays would be more visible when heterosexual men are cued to a gay victim's femininity (not to the victim's masculinity), provided evaluative concerns are strong too. Consistent with RD, three experiments (Ntotal = 1,475) revealed that heterosexual men who read news about (gay) victims at a hate crime scene downplayed their compassion to a greater degree when cued to the masculinity rather than to the femininity of such targets (Studies 1–3). Meanwhile FT's prediction received partial support when considering feminine (vs. masculine) heterosexual victims, rather than homosexual victims (Study 3).

T1  - Green or Gender-Modern Nativists: Do They Exist and Do They Vote for Right-Wing Populist Parties?
AN  - 2671468276
AB  - A current focal point of right-wing populist (RWP) parties across Western societies has been anti-environmentalism and anti-feminism, entangled with their dominant anti-migrant agenda. This clustering of positions overlaps with the conceptual GAL-TAN (Green, Alternative, Liberalist – Traditional, Authoritarian, Nationalist) distinction in voter studies. Still, numerous voters might transcend this distinction, for instance adhering to femonationalism. By taking a feminist ground-up approach, we reveal how nativist, anti-feminist, and anti-environmentalist attitudes do (or do not) cluster across Western Europe. Our results show that approximately 30% of voters deviate from the GAL-TAN logic, with considerable clusters of citizens combining strong nativism with support for gender equality or moderate nativism with anti-feminism. Further, we estimate the support for RWP parties and show that nativism is core to supporting RWP elites, and anti-environmentalism can provide an additional vote bonus. However, our analysis reveals that the (anti-)feminist and nativist elements of people’s political ideology entail more complex entanglements: both anti-feminist nativist voters and femonationalist voters gravitate to RWP parties. These results imply that feminist quantitative studies are needed to lay bare the average-defying minority groups that can be mobilised to support RWP parties.

T1  - Don’t tell me about my moral failures but motivate me to improve: Increasing effectiveness of outgroup criticism by criticizing one’s competence
AN  - 2581010218
AB  - Criticizing people on their prior moral failures often causes them to react defensively, especially when this is done by an outgroup. In the current research, we tested whether people become more receptive to such outgroup criticism when it refers to (failures of) their competence, rather than their morality. We conducted two studies, using a 2: Critic's group‐membership (receiving criticism from an ingroup vs. outgroup) × 2: Dimension (competence vs. morality as focal concern addressed with the criticism) mixed design. Findings showed that, regardless of source, participants made fewer negative attributions, were more motivated to improve, and more often indicated they changed their behavior after they had been criticized on their competence, instead of on their morality. Thus, criticizing past behavior for failing to show competence instead of morality might be a way to reduce defensive responses and to stimulate behavior change, even for outgroup critics.

T1  - Being bisexual in contemporary Italy: between stigma and desire of visibility
TT  - Being bisexual in contemporary Italy
AN  - 2531473956
AB  - PurposeThe Italian sociological scientific community has shown a limited interest in issues related to bisexuality. The purpose of this paper is to fill the knowledge gap on the subject, showing data of an empirical research conducted online on the Italian bisexual community.Design/methodology/approachThe article is based on a mixed methods online survey on Italian bisexual people, which included 218 interviews. The questionnaire was made up of closed and open-ended questions, to investigate their behaviours, habits and lifestyles.FindingsSocial pressure and lack of understanding by others sometimes make difficult for bisexual people to show themselves openly for what they are, especially in some contexts, such as the word of work. From a sociological point of view, one can argue that one of the tools when bisexual people face the stigma related to bisexuality is to control, often in an obsessive way, the information they provide about themselves, carefully evaluating the contexts in which they can free themselves and the time when they must expose themselves in line with the expectations of the heteronormative society.Research limitations/implicationsThe non-probabilistic sample limits the external validity of the findings. There are also critical elements that characterise social research when transposed online: first, the profiles of the respondents not always are verifiable; second, the digital divide excludes some groups that cannot access the web or involves an over-representation of those who are more familiar with technologies.Originality/valueThe work presented is the first Italian sociological study aimed at deepening the “invisible B” phenomenon of the LGBT acronym in a systematic way. Nowadays bisexuality remains under-researched in social sciences and overall in sociology. Putting “bisexuality” at the centre of the sociological attention appears important to provide serious and scientifically valid data and information useful both to develop the knowledge on this identity category and to contain forms of discrimination and prejudice.

T1  - Violence Next Door: The Influence of Friendship With Perpetrators on Responses to Intimate Partner Violence
AN  - 2502151141
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a prevalent problem worldwide. Friends of perpetrators may be in a unique position to support or affect change. However, little is known about the influence of friendship with a perpetrator on responses to IPV. Social identity theory describes an ingroup bias whereby ingroup perpetrators of violence are viewed as less personally responsible than outgroup perpetrators. This bias has been consistently found for impersonal ingroup relationships, but there is limited research in relation to friends of perpetrators. Drawing on social psychological theories, this study aimed to explore the impact of friendship with a perpetrator on responses to IPV—specifically, on attributions of causality and social rejection. A fictional vignette depicting IPV perpetrated by either a friend or a stranger was presented to 174 university students, who then completed a questionnaire on attributions and social rejection. Results indicated that participants attributed high blame to the perpetrator regardless of their relationship, but friends of the perpetrator were significantly more likely than strangers to attribute the cause of the violence to external factors. Friends of perpetrators were likely to continue the friendship, though social rejection was significantly more likely when the perpetrator was attributed high blame and internal causality. Ingroup bias was not consistently present across all outcomes, demonstrating the complexity of social relationships and IPV. The findings suggest expectancy based on past behavior may influence attributions for violence in existing relationships. The combination of high blame, external attributions, and low social rejection was discussed in relation to opportunities for friends to intervene to prevent IPV. The multifaceted influence of friendship on responses to IPV perpetration suggests the need to consider relationship factors when designing violence prevention campaigns and bystander intervention programs.

T1  - Psychological and socio-cultural adaptation of Syrian refugees in Turkey
AN  - 2516239068
AB  - We studied the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation processes of Syrian refugees in Turkey using semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews among 15 participants. The study explored the themes and issues emerging in the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation processes such as life-satisfaction, contact with the host community and future plans of Syrian adults. Berry's acculturation model (1997) is used to form the theoretical basis of this research. Our findings revealed that psychological and socio-cultural adaptation of Syrian refugees are strongly influenced by economic concerns, pre-migration expectations, religion and perceptions of Turkish natives' expectations/ attitudes towards Syrians. From the perspective of the informants, economic concerns and uncertainty regarding duration of stay have a negative impact on refugees' acculturation, leading to delayed psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. Positive perceptions of Turkish natives' expectations/ attitudes towards Syrians are perceived to increase motivation to seek social support, which promotes well-being and life satisfaction in Turkey. Yet, negative perceptions such as prejudice and discrimination, may pose a risk for psychological health and low socio-cultural adaptation. One major finding of the paper is the two-fold impact of religion on Syrian refugees: Religion can be considered a binding/ equalizing function subsuming refugee and native groups under a superordinate identity. Nonetheless, it also appears to generate social distance when perceived as a threat to the secular national identity. The findings of this research can be used to minimize factors that undermine favorable acculturation outcomes and promote factors that facilitate high levels of psychological and socio-cultural adaptation.

T1  - Perceptions of Not Equally Tolerable Discriminations: Is Personal Experience so Decisive?
AN  - 2472327776
AB  - Discrimination is nowadays more frequently perceived, whilst not always readily identifiable. This study extends previous research on perceived discrimination by examining, simultaneously, the effects of both direct and indirect personal experiences of discrimination, together with sociodemographic variables (conservatism and social status), on the perception of group‐based discriminations; in addition to the mediating role of discriminatory outgroup attitudes. All of this comparing discriminations that are not understood as equally tolerable (race–nationality vs. age–disability discriminations), in two different nationwide surveys (2013 and 2016), and applying multigroup structural equation modelling. The final models showed different patterns, depending on the type of perceived discrimination. Whilst the effects of experiences were similar in both models, those as a result of sociodemographic variables differed, coupled with the interrelation between outgroup attitudes and perceived group‐based discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes showed to be what most affected both types of perceived discrimination, although in opposite directions.

T1  - Population Size and Social Contact as Predictors of Religious Thought and Intergroup Attitudes: The Case of Muslims in Forty Countries
AN  - 2470251105
AB  - This paper examines the effects of different percentages of Muslim population and their interactions with non-Muslims on their religious views and intergroup attitudes. By analyzing three different datasets of Pew Research Center, with an aggregation of more than 39,000 Muslims' responses from 40 different countries, this paper offers a counter-argument against the use of the previously mentioned approach. This will be presented by analyzing these datasets from three different levels of analyses. Unlike the present social contact literature in which the primary focus is on the host/majority population's nature of interaction with minorities and its effects on the former's intergroup attitudes, this research focuses on minorities' contact with majority members and its impact on their religious and intergroup views. Consequently, our findings indicate a more meaningful and factual understanding of Muslim minorities' religious views and intergroup attitudes emerges when their social experiences are taken into consideration.

T1  - Evidence for blatant dehumanization of mental illness and its relation to stigma
AN  - 2391192430
AB  - People with mental illness face stigma, and due to their low social status, they may also face blatant dehumanization that denies their status as fully evolved human beings. In the current research, three studies documented the existence of blatant dehumanization of mental illness. Study 1 (N = 112) showed that participants rated people with mental illness in general as being significantly less human than other dehumanized social groups such as Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Study 2 (N = 158) showed that dehumanization occurs for specific mental disorders but that the level of dehumanization varies widely among disorders. Study 3 (N = 223) documented significant correlations between dehumanization of mental illness and standard measures of stigma such as fear, pity, and social distance. Overall, the results establish the relevance of blatant dehumanization to mental illness stigma and suggest new directions for understanding stigma.

T1  - Is negative the new positive? Secondary transfer effect of exposure to LGBT portrayals in TV entertainment programs
AN  - 2354725994
AB  - This study investigates the primary effect of positive, neutral, and negative exposure to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) TV portrayals in entertainment programs on attitudes toward the LGBT community and the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of such exposure on attitudes toward people with Asperger's Disorder (the secondary out‐group), controlling for face‐to‐face and online contacts with both out‐groups. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative Study 1 used an online survey of 716 Israeli Jews, to investigate primary and secondary effects of TV exposure to LGBT portrayals. The positive primary effect of TV exposure was shown—regardless of LGBT portrayals perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. STE of TV exposure to neutral and negative LGBT portrayals is likely to diminish social distance to people with Asperger's Disorder, while no STE was found with positive LGBT portrayals. Full mediation effect of attitudes toward the LGBT community was found. Qualitative Study 2, based on 52 in‐depth interviews, was conducted in order to reveal the hidden mechanisms of these effects, examining the parasocial experience and its interpretations by the viewers. According to qualitative findings, the positive primary and secondary effects of negative exposure may be explained by varied interpretations of gay portrayals on TV by different people depending on social background and life experience, opposite reaction on stereotypical gay portrayals on TV, and asymmetrical negative‐positive heuristic. Given the important role of TV in fostering more positive intergroup relations, this research revealed sources of prejudice reduction and increase in tolerance toward “others” for society at large.

T1  - Discrimination, Work Stress, and Psychological Well-being in LGBTI Workers in Spain
TT  - La discriminación, el estrés laboral y el bienestar psicológico en personas trabajadoras LGTBI en España
AN  - 2478115072
AB  - Discrimination and prejudice against LGBTI people in Spain are much lower than they used to be; however, negative attitudes towards them may still persist. The purpose of this study was to analyze whether LGBTI individuals perceive the existence of prejudice or discrimination due to their sexual orientation in the workplace. To assess these perceptions in relative terms, we compared them with those of heterosexual individuals. We also analyzed whether perceived discrimination was associated with work stress, the presence of common mental disorders, and depression. Results revealed that LGBTI employees reported experiencing greater discrimination in the workplace because of their sexualorientation, which in turn led to a greater incidence of work stress, mental disorders, and depression. Our findings confirm that job discrimination against LGBTI people is still present, along with some of its harmful consequences, and highlight the need for interventions to reduce prejudice against LGBTI persons in the workplace.Alternate abstract:
A pesar de que la discriminación y el prejuicio hacia el colectivo LGTBI en España hayan disminuido, es posible que aún pervivan actitudes negativas hacia estas personas. En la presente investigación analizamos si las personas LGTBI perciben la existencia de prejuicio o discriminación hacia ellas en el ámbito laboral debido a su orientación sexual. Para analizar en términos relativos dichas percepciones, las comparamos con las que tienen las personas de orientación heterosexual. Después se examinó si la percepción de discriminación está relacionada con el estrés laboral, la presencia de trastornos mentales y la depresión. Los resultados mostraron que las personas LGTBI experimentaban mayor discriminación en su trabajo en virtud de su orientación sexual, produciéndoles mayor estrés laboral, trastornos mentales y depresión. Estos resultados confirman la pervivencia de discriminación hacia las personas LGTBI en el ámbito laboral y algunas de sus perniciosas consecuencias y muestran la necesidad de intervenciones para la reducción del prejuicio hacia los trabajadores LGTBI.

T1  - The Persistence of Racialized Health Care Attitudes: Racial Attitudes among White Adults and Identity Importance among Black Adults
AN  - 2283281404
AB  - This study evaluates the emergence and persistence of the racial divide on health reform in public opinion using survey data from 2008 through 2017. The findings support existing work showing a consistent relationship between racial resentment and attitudes on the Affordable Care Act among White adults. However, the study also builds on existing work by evaluating the relationship between strength of racial identity among Black adults and health care opinion during President Barack Obama's Administration. The paper investigates the implications of the findings for future health policy in the post-Obama era using survey data on the Republicans’ attempt to pass the American Health Care Act in 2017. The results underscore the conditions that make the “spillover” of racial attitudes into seemingly non-racial policy areas more or less likely to occur. The findings also provide suggestive evidence for how future health reforms may receive different levels of support from both White and Black adults.

T1  - The Exploration of how Identity Intersectionality Strengthens STEM Identity for Black Female Undergraduates attending a Historically Black College and University (HBCU)
AN  - 2423041343
AB  - This study examined the impact of racial and gender intersectionality on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) identity development and the academic achievement of Black female STEM undergraduates attending an HBCU. Research has demonstrated that the intersection of race and gender are likely to subject Black women to prejudice and ostracism in STEM disciplines. Data revealed that Black women experienced racial and gender intersectionality, but that quantitative findings demonstrated a decrease in Black racial centrality and private regard over time. Qualitative reports suggested otherwise. Further research must be done to understand the differences between the quantitative and qualitative findings.

T1  - Becoming Italian, becoming American: ethnic affinity as a strategy of boundary making
AN  - 2183933532
AB  - Based on the case study of Albanian immigrant incorporation in a Little Italy in the Bronx, this paper develops the concept of ethnic affinity. It argues that boundary-work between ethnic Italians and Albanian immigrants resulted in intergroup relations that coupled Albanian occupational incorporation with the (re)construction of respective group identities as culturally similar - and distinct from Latino and African-American groups in the neighbourhood. Engaging recent literature on ethnic boundary making, I argue that ethnic affinity constitutes a new strategy of boundary reinforcing, in addition to established strategies of boundary crossing, blurring, and shifting (Zolberg and Woon 1999; Wimmer 2008). Developed in the context of shifting ethno-racial neighbourhood makeup, this affinity between ethnic Italians and Albanian immigrants relied on American constructions of shared European whiteness, overturning contemporary divides between Italians and Albanians in Europe. Ethnic affinity provides a conceptual framework that goes beyond notions of ethnic succession, passing, or assimilation.

T1  - Space and personal contacts: Cross-group interaction between mainland and local university students in Hong Kong
AN  - 2154580823
AB  - Despite sharing physical space that supports contact with out-group members and institutional arrangements that encourage cross-group interaction, many university students still congregate within their own groups. To explain this phenomenon, this study examines the micro-level social processes that prevent or facilitate intergroup interaction. A qualitative study of Mainland Chinese and local university students in Hong Kong reveals that students lack opportunities for mutually engaging experiences across multiple points in time due to fragmented daily living space, defended interpersonal space, and politicized online space, which contribute to the absence of cross-group interactions. Cross-group friendships depend on external forces to remove inhibitions, which then allow emotional bonding. This study contributes to the understanding of cross-group interaction by pointing out the importance of daily routine activities and mutually engaging experiences in influencing cross-group interaction among students.

T1  - Measuring Attitudes About Hate: Development of the Hate Crime Beliefs Scale
AN  - 2123579692
AB  - Employing the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA) of 2009 and other such legislation as a backdrop, the present study evaluated the nature of beliefs about hate-crime legislation, offenders, and victims. In addition, it investigated construct validity (i.e., political beliefs and prejudice) and predictive validity (i.e., blame attribution and sentencing recommendations). A total of 403 U.S. adults completed measures of prejudice and an initial pool of 50 items forming the proposed Hate Crime Beliefs Scale (HCBS). Participants were randomly assigned to read one of four hate-crime vignettes, which varied in regard to type of prejudice (racial-, sexual orientation-, transgender-, and religion-based prejudices) and then responded to blame and sentencing questions. Factor analyses of the HCBS resulted in four sub-scales: Negative Views (i.e., higher scores reflect negative views of legislation and minority group protection), Offender Punishment (i.e., higher scores suggest endorsement of greater punishment), Deterrence (i.e., greater scores denote support for hate-crime legislation as a deterrent of more violence), and Victim Harm (i.e., higher scores reflect pro-victim attitudes). Greater pro-legislation and pro-victim beliefs were related to liberal political beliefs and less prejudicial attitudes, with some exceptions. Controlling for a number of demographic, situational, and attitudinal covariates, the Negative Views sub-scale displayed predictive utility, such that more negative views of legislation/minority group protection were associated with elevated victim blame, as well as lower perpetrator blame and sentencing recommendations. Results are discussed in the context of hate-crime research and policy, with additional implications considered for trial strategy, modern prejudice, and blame attribution theory.

T1  - Living in Two Worlds: Experiences and Perceptions of Diversity Among Adolescents in Racially-Integrated Schools
AN  - 2037004382
AB  - This study explored the experiences and perceptions of diversity among adolescents in racially-integrated schools in South Africa. Social psychological perspectives were used to consider the socio-cultural context of integrated schools in South Africa. A total number of 60 adolescents from desegregated, urban, public high schools in central South Africa participated in 10 focus groups. Participants struggled with the goal of staying true to themselves while living in two worlds. The greatest threat to diversity was the potential loss of the uniqueness of the African culture when adolescents conform to the pressures of fitting into a Western culture. Many participants experienced being stereotyped, often perpetuated by school ethos, parents, communities and language. Despite the challenges, the participants articulated the potential benefits of attending a racially-integrated school. Furthermore, the importance of creating enabling environments for intergroup relations and equipping adolescents with the necessary skills to become citizens who can contribute to a diverse and humane society, is reiterated.

T1  - Beyond the irony of intergroup contact: The effects of contact and threat on political participation and support for political violence in Northern Ireland
AN  - 2002180660
AB  - Research has suggested that intergroup contact can ironically lead to a reduction in commitment to social change and that threat can play an important role in this process. In post-agreement societies, however, characterized more so by symbolic rather than material conflict, the role that intergroup contact and threat play in social action may be particularly complex. This article examines intergroup contact, intergroup threat, support for political violence, and political participation among a student sample (n = 152) of Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. Results show that contact is associated with lower symbolic and realistic threat for both groups and to lower levels of support for political violence but not to political participation. Symbolic threat mediated the association between contact and support for political violence and between contact and political participation for the Protestant majority group only. This suggests that contact may have a positive effect upon group relations but that this is dependent upon status and the social–political context.

T1  - 'I was a scarf-like gangster girl' - Negotiating gender and ethnicity on the street
AN  - 1923538067
AB  - Drawing on an ethnographic study in Copenhagen, this article explores the gendered ethnicities of young women navigating multi-ethnic street terrains. The study includes an ethnically heterogeneous sample of 25 women aged 13-23 who are involved in street-oriented peer groups and activities. The analysis demonstrates how young women modify their lifestyle, language, body and posture to establish proximity to ethnic minority youth. By applying intersectional theory, the article explores gender and ethnicity as situational accomplishments, and it is argued that ethnic identifications in this context need to be explored as flexible and fluid, changing, not only over a lifetime, but within a single day. This exploration of young women's gendered ethnicities adds to the limited research on the gendered and racialized dynamics of street culture.

T1  - The Mandate of the Collective: Apology Representativeness Determines Perceived Sincerity and Forgiveness in Intergroup Contexts
AN  - 1910840175
AB  - The sincerity of an apology is often critical for it to be viewed positively by victims. For collective apologies, we argue that sincerity takes on a particular meaning: It is a function of the apology's perceived representativeness for the offender group's will or sentiment. Consistent with this notion, when an apologetic (vs. nonapologetic) message was democratically chosen (Study 1) or explicitly endorsed by the majority of the offending outgroup (Study 2), it was considered more sincere and, through this, led to more forgiveness. Furthermore, while disagreement about an apology within the offender group reduced its perceived representativeness and sincerity, this was less so when the dissenters could be subtyped: when disagreement was correlated with an existing subgroup within the offending outgroup (Study 3) and in line with expectations for that subgroup (Study 4). This research shows that victim group members consider intragroup processes within the offending outgroup for attributions of sincerity.

T1  - Korean Migrants' Use of the Internet in Canada
AN  - 1886222528
AB  - Drawing on qualitative interviews with South Korean migrants in Canada, this study examines how full-time working migrants appropriate the Internet to maintain sociocultural connections with their homeland, their diasporic community, and the host society. The present study raises the question of how the rapid diffusion of the Internet may redefine the meanings of the Korean diaspora, and it explores how migrants engage in, or negotiate, the digital mediascape of the host society. While Korean migrants in the present study encountered no difficulty with accessing and using the Internet, it was largely appropriated in Korean language and in relation to Korean community rather than serving as a platform through which they could actively engage in the host society's mediascape. Thus, it is questionable how the ethnic use of the Internet may contribute to the co-construction between migrant and host media users.

T1  - Public narratives on human mobility: Countering technocratic and humanitarian refugee narratives with a "one-world" solidarity narrative
AN  - 1876702819
AB  - This article articulates a one-world narrative, which reconfigures human mobility in dialogical response to the ideational borders of the European Union. Fifty-two semi-structured interviews, in Scotland and Sweden, bring participants, ranging from people with refugee status to the generationally nonmobile, into dialogue with the integration ideals of the European Union. Within this ideational space, participants employ I-positional dialogical capacities such as "outsideness" and "multivoicedness" to articulate a postnational "one-world" solidarity narrative (OWN). OWN is revealed as distinct from a posthuman "one-earth" sustainability narrative, which was found to "border" and delimit mobility. Three dimensions of OWN, (a) borders as constructed; (b) citizen of the world; and (c) accidental nature of existence, together repoliticise depoliticised technocratic reasoning, culturalism, and the asymmetries of humanitarian narratives on refugees. In conclusion, articulating the public's dialogical capacities is key to moving beyond public opinion towards public dialogue on vexed political questions such as immigration.

T1  - Strong, female and Black: Stereotypes of African Caribbean women's body shape and their effects on clinical encounters
AN  - 1876655314
AB  - The aim of this article is to explore how tendencies to stereotype minority ethnic groups intersect with lay discourses about them in ways that can reproduce cultural prejudices and reinforce inequalities in access to services and health outcomes. Drawing upon Black feminist and cultural studies literature, we present a theoretical examination, the stereotypes of the Black woman as 'mammy' and 'matriarch'. We suggest that the influence of these two images is central to understanding the normalisation of the larger Black female body within African Caribbean communities. This representation of excess weight contradicts mainstream negative discourses of large bodies that view it as a form of moral weakness. Seeking to stimulate reflection on how unacknowledged stereotypes may shape clinical encounters, we propose that for Black women, it is the perception of strength, tied into these racial images of 'mammy' and 'matriarch' which may influence when or how health services or advice are both sought by them and offered to them. This has particular significance in relation to how body weight and weight management are/are not talked about in primary care-based interactions and what support Black women are/are not offered. We argue that unintentional bias can have tangible impacts and health outcomes for Black women and possibly other minority ethnic groups.

T1  - The making of tribes: The Chang and Chakhesang Nagas in India's Northeast
AN  - 1873923375
AB  - Highlighting 'pre', 'trans' and 'new' tribal formations amongst upland Nagas in India's Northeast, this article formulates both a historical critique against dominant categorisations of the region's social landscape and posits alternative ways of 'seeing' local patterns of kinship, identity and belonging. Drawing on ethno-historical perspectives from the Chang and Chakhesang Nagas, I illustrate the problematic cultural transitivity of the idea and idiom of 'tribe' which conceals the social formations that existed--and occasionally persist--before, beneath, betwixt and between categories of 'tribe'. This realisation brings us to a dilemma which, I think, ought to be at the heart of the anthropology of Nagas and of India's Northeast more widely--namely, how to account for the ethnographic observation that social organisation--both past and present--is based on interpersonal, village and clan networks which cut across tribal and ethnic groups with clearly permeable boundaries and yet most people maintain a view of the whole society as made up of partitioned, culturally coherent and historically immutable entities.

T1  - Labour Market Limbo: The Uneven Integration of Co-Ethnic Argentine Immigrants in Spain
AN  - 1861254527
AB  - Immigration and citizenship laws that discriminate by race, ethnicity, and national origins are increasingly illegitimate in contemporary democracies, yet laws that grant privileged access and membership to immigrants who share natives' ethnicity persist. This enduring positive selection rests upon the assumption that co-ethnicity fosters integration. Countering this logic, this article centers on co-ethnics' insertion into local labour markets. It draws from a case study of Aguaviva, Spain, a depopulating village in which both co-ethnic Argentines and Romanian immigrants reside. The analysis qualifies the trend of deracialization in immigration and citizenship policy and shows that positive preferences do not uniformly foster integration. In dual labour market systems, co-ethnics struggle because they are not different enough for secondary sector jobs reserved for immigrant "others," yet in the primary sector they enter into direct competition with natives.

T1  - Tibetan minzu market: the intersection of ethnicity and commodity
AN  - 1832905626
AB  - In downtown Chengdu a pocket of Tibetan culture has sprung up: a Tibetan market where Tibetans and Han Chinese meet to buy and sell ethnic minority products. Pointing to how Tibetan migration to Chengdu has contributed to the growth of a vibrant 'minzu market' attracting Tibetan and Han Chinese merchants, customers, Buddhist devotees, and voyeurs, this article presents novel understandings of the ethnic goods market in urban Chengdu. The article first explores the growth of the market, which is the result of a history of political and economic reforms, increased mobility, and religious revival. Second, it maps the market infrastructure according to the ethnicity of the shopkeepers and the commodities that are traded. Although there is still a clear ethnic division in the market, this article also documents the emergence of Han Chinese market participation in forms of trade that have historically been dominated by Tibetans.

T1  - Collectively coping with contact: The role of intragroup support in dealing with the challenges of intergroup mixing in residential contexts
AN  - 2067639736
AB  - The social identity approach to stress has shown how intragroup support processes shape individuals' responses to stress across health care, workplace, and community settings. However, the issue of how these ‘social cure’ processes can help cope with the stress of intergroup contact has yet to be explored. This is particularly important given the pivotal role of intergroup threat and anxiety in the experience of contact as well as the effect of contact on extending the boundaries of group inclusion. This study applies this perspective to a real‐life instance of residential contact in a divided society. Semi‐structured interviews with 14 Catholic and 13 Protestant new residents of increasingly mixed areas of Belfast city, Northern Ireland, were thematically analysed. Results highlight that transitioning to mixed communities was fraught with intergroup anxiety, especially for those coming from ‘single identity’ areas. Help from existing residents, especially when offered by members of other religious denominations, signalled a ‘mixed community ethos’ to new residents, which facilitated adopting and sharing this identity. This shared identity then enabled them to deal with unexpected intergroup threats and provided resilience to future sectarian division. New residents who did not adopt this shared identity remained isolated, fearful, and prone to negative contact.

T1  - The Look of Losing, Then and Now: PROD
AN  - 1851016396
AB  - This article asks whether losing in a political debate is associated with a set of visible, empirically verifiable nonverbal indicators that correspond to physical weakness, pronounced stress, evasive or fearful behavior, and other outward signs of secondary or subordinate status. To answer this question, a comparative content analysis of the first 1960 and 2012 U.S. presidential debates is performed, contrasting the "losing" performance of Richard Nixon during the first televised presidential debate of 1960 with the "lackluster" performance of Barack Obama during the first televised debate of 2012--arguably the worst night of his political career. Campaign lore and anecdotal accounts suggest in Nixon's case that negative evaluations were mostly due to his haggard appearance rather than debate performance, but detailed content analysis using biobehaviorally derived expressive categories suggests the vice president's nonverbal behavior was equally important. For the 2012 debate, particular emphasis is placed on the communicative behavior of President Obama, who appeared evasive and at times dominated by Mitt Romney, which disappointed supporters and gave Romney momentum in the polls. To facilitate comparison, each debate is subjected to a shot-by-shot analysis of the candidates' nonverbal behavior, including facial expressions, vocal tone, communicative gestures, blink rate, and other nonverbal tics.

T1  - Interethnic bridging social capital and the significance of ethnocentric interethnic interaction within Malaysian universities
AN  - 1963401115
AB  - This article explores the possible theoretical relationships of ethnocentrism (independent variable) and interethnic interaction (mediating variable) with interethnic bridging social capital (IBSC) (dependent variable). Interethnic bridging social capital is extremely noticeable that there is a lack of such investigation in specifically Malaysian public universities. In an attempt to clarify the current situation, a survey questionnaire was conducted with 343 undergraduate students from the three main ethnic groups. The findings reveal that not only ethnocentrism can effect directly and negatively on IBSC, but also its impact can be partially mediated through interethnic interaction as well. Overall, this article contributes to our understanding of how negative attitudes towards outsiders inhibit trust, reciprocity and cooperation in heterogeneous communities.

T1  - Socio-Cultural Determinants of Physical Activity among Latin American Immigrant Women in Alberta, Canada
AN  - 1830616523
AB  - Acculturation has been associated with decreased physical activity among immigrants. This study assessed the process of changing physical activity patterns within the context of Latin American immigrant women's migration experiences to Canada. Using the ecological model of health promotion, we applied a mixed methods research design. Thirty-six Latin American immigrant women, 18 recent (<10 years in Canada) and 18 non-recent (>10 years in Canada), participated. Six focus groups and 14 in-depth individual interviews were conducted. The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire was administered. Overall, 86 % of the participants reported gaining weight since coming to Canada. Participants reported becoming more sedentary upon arriving in Canada. Only 27.3 % of recent and 41.7 % of non-recent immigrant women were considered sufficiently physically active. Lack of time, resources, social support, and migration stress were identified as key barriers to physical activity. Migration stress associated with social integration barriers strongly influence physical activity among Latin American immigrant women.

T1  - Feeling European: an exploration of ethnic disparities among immigrants
AN  - 1820665657
AB  - Over the last 20 years, European identity has become a key topic widely investigated in social sciences. However, most research has only focused on EU nationals and EU immigrants, neglecting the fact that a substantial segment of citizens in Europe are non-EU immigrants. This article explores the differences between and within EU and non-EU immigrant groups in terms of European identity and potential factors behind these differences. Based on the 2013 IAB-SOEP Migration Sample of first generation immigrants in Germany (N = 2581), this paper reveals that non-EU immigrants tend to identify as European - even if to a lesser extent than EU immigrants. Moreover it provides a systematic comparative exploration of different factors possibly able to foster a European identity among EU and non-EU immigrants. It reveals, for instance, that religious affiliation has no significant impact but that spatial mobility is especially important in accounting for patterns in ethnic disparities in the endorsement of a European identity. Furthermore, this article illuminates a positive association between European identity and identity with the receiving society among both EU and non-EU immigrants as well as a positive association between European identity and identification with the origin country among EU immigrants.

T1  - What an ethnic lens can conceal: the emergence of a shared racialised identity position among young descendants of migrants in Sweden
AN  - 1809640286
AB  - The article problematises the use of the ethnic lens in research on the young descendants of migrants. It discusses methodological and theoretical insights derived from an interview study on young people from the same neighbourhood in Stockholm, Sweden - the majority of whom had parents with varying ethnic identifications. Because the study did not use any one particular ethnic group as an entry point, it illuminates processes of racialisation that exceed ethnic boundaries and the development of a racialised identity position shared by descendants with different ethnic ties. It thereby contributes to an expanding field of European studies that ethnographically illustrate racialisation of the migrant descendants in different European contexts, and their diverse answers to racialisation. Compared to US experiences, this specific European mode of racialisation limits the range of identity positions offered to a higher extent and furthermore positions a wider span of people as non-white. By focusing on the relationship between how people are represented and how they perceive themselves the article further questions the transnational perspective as an alternative means for circumventing the ethnic lens. The incorporation of a transnational perspective in this research was namely perceived by the participants as ascriptions of ethnic otherness.

T1  - Immigration Policies and the Factors of Migration from Developing Countries to South Korea: An Empirical Analysis
AN  - 1789876893
AB  - This study examines the impacts of immigration policies adopted by the Korean government, vis-a-vis other economic, social, demographic, and political factors, on labour migration from developing countries to South Korea using a modified gravity model. The model is extended to marriage-related migrants to gain insights on marriage migration. The positive results in three out of the five immigration policies examined affirm that liberal policies are associated with increased migration, especially for preferred groups like ethnic Koreans, marriage migrants, and professionals. The positive effects of "push" factors such as population, unemployment, and inflation are generally similar to their effects on migration to the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK despite its more rapid transition from a migrant-sending into a migrant-receiving country. Political terror's non-significance may be due to South Korea's limited asylum policy. Finally, the results of the extended model imply that marriage migration share plenty of similarities with labour migration.

T1  - Exploring the Relations Between Religious Orientation and Racial Identity Attitudes in African College Students: A Preliminary Analysis
AN  - 1780916577
AB  - As the Black African college student population increases across U.S. college campuses, helping professionals are encouraged to more clearly understand the unique identity developmental needs of these students in order to fortify their academic endeavors and contribute to their success. Both religion and race are powerful forces that shape identity, providing an overall sense of purpose, a feeling of connection with others, and a sense of community. Yet, both of these aspects of identity are rarely studied in Black African college student populations. This study examined the relations between religious orientation and racial identity attitudes in 49 Black African college students, whose diverse racial, ethnic, and religious experiences have been understudied. The results from multiple regression analyses indicated that religious orientation was significantly related to racial identity status. Specifically, intrinsic religious orientation was positively related to preencounter (i.e., pro-White, anti-Black beliefs about one's own racial group) racial identity attitudes, quest religious orientation was positively related to immersion-emersion (i.e., anti-White, pro-Black attitudes about one's own racial-cultural group) racial identity attitudes, and the relations between intrinsic religious orientation and internalization (i.e., internalized positive self-acceptance) racial identity attitudes approached significance. Recommendations for future research and implications for diversity in higher education are discussed. [web URL: http://jbs.sagepub.com/content/47/4/313.abstract]

T1  - The Inner Geographies of a Migrant Gateway: Mapping the Built Environment and the Dynamics of Caribbean Mobility in Manchester, 1951-2011
AN  - 1778950102
AB  - Between the 1960s and 1990s a series of urban redevelopment projects in Manchester radically transformed ethnic settlement in the city. The ward of Moss Side, which had been a gateway for Caribbean and African immigrants, experienced repeated slum clearances in which whole communities were relocated and large tracts of housing stock were demolished and redesigned. The relationship between these physical and demographic changes has been overshadowed by the persisting stigmatization of Moss Side as a racialized "ghetto," which has meant that outsiders have constructed the area as possessing a fixed and homogenous identity. This article uses geographic information systems in conjunction with local surveys and archival records to explore how the dynamics of immigrant mobility within Moss Side were shaped by housing stock, external racism, family strategies, and urban policy. Whereas scholarship on ethnic segregation in Britain has focused on the internal migration of ethnic groups between administrative areas, using areal interpolation to connect demographic data and the built environment reveals the intense range of movements that developed within the variegated urban landscape of Moss Side.

T1  - Vile vigilance: An integrated theoretical framework for understanding the state of Black surveillance
AN  - 1768022945
AB  - The family is the principal source of socialization and protection against racism for many Blacks. Transmitting values, norms, morals, and beliefs (i.e., racial socialization) to successive generations is done to promote racial awareness and to prepare an individual to survive in racist environments. Further, developing a sense of security, resiliency, and cultural pride provides psychological protection against racial prejudice and discrimination. Protective socialization is even more critical when it becomes the difference between life and death at the hands of law enforcement-a fate faced by too many Black males as a result of racist policing practices, including the over-patrolling of Black communities. Because discriminatory surveillance and over-patrolling can incite a number of social, physical, and mental health issues, a holistic approach to understanding the interaction between Blacks and law enforcement is critical. This article reviews the Mundane Extreme Environmental Stress (MEES) model, racial socialization theory, and Family Stress Model in the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the patterns of interactions between Blacks and law enforcement, the immediate and long-term effects of unjustified shootings on Black families and communities, and the response of sociopolitical systems. The new theoretical framework will be used to inform the work of human service providers and practitioners by identifying targets for interventions to improve relations and trust between Black communities and law enforcement institutions.

AB  - Stimulated by a recent government ban on kosher slaughter (shechita), and a whale stranding involving Ngati Toa near Wellington, the author compares the quests of Indigenous and minority groups for cultural rights in Aotearoa (New Zealand). Observing Maori and Jews navigating in the contexts of the Treaty of Waitangi and human rights legislation, this paper provides concrete ethnographic examples that highlight how such claims articulate with the political and legal contexts in this Antipodean nation.

T1  - Mapping Chineseness on the landscape of Christian churches in Indonesia
AN  - 1784139808
AB  - Scholarship on the Chinese Indonesian community has largely been concerned with the tensions between the community and the majority non-Chinese (or pribumi). The fault lines were usually examined against the background of Suharto's assimilation policy, the 1998 anti-Chinese riots, the stark imbalance of the nation's wealth within this minority group, and Chinese loyalty - or chauvinism - in the time of nation-building, and in the face of the rise of modern China. Little attention has been given to Christianity as offering a shelter for the inconspicuous propagation of Chineseness; particularly in terms of the conduct of services in Chinese, the teaching of the language, and business-management leadership. The network of Chinese churches locally, and extending internationally beyond Indonesia, represents a rich field for further scholarship. This article sets out an epistemological map in the service of such research.

T1  - Attitudes towards Roma people and migrants: a comparison through a Bayesian multidimensional IRT model
AN  - 1764076363
AB  - In the context of social psychological research on relations between cultural defined groups, the main topics of interest include ethnic prejudice, attitudes and stereotypes. In the present study, in order to measure and compare attitudes towards Roma people and migrants and to investigate how these attitudes vary according to individual characteristics, we develop an integrated model which embeds a multidimensional Item Response Theory model for polytomous data into a structural equation formulation. Item and person parameters and structural coefficients are estimated on data collected through a web survey. Full probabilistic inference is performed by applying Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.

T1  - Internalized gay ageism, mattering, and depressive symptoms among midlife and older gay-identified men
AN  - 1751218095
AB  - In this paper we introduce the construct of "internalized gay ageism," or the sense that one feels denigrated or depreciated because of aging in the context of a gay male identity, which we identify as an unexplored aspect of sexual minority stress specific to midlife and older gay-identified men. Using a social stress process framework, we examine the association between internalized gay ageism and depressive symptoms, and whether one's sense of mattering mediates or moderates this association, controlling for three decades of depressive symptom histories. The sample is 312 gay-identified men (average age = 60.7 years, range = 48-78, 61% HIV-negative) participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984/85, one of the largest and longest running studies of the natural history of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., who provided contemporary (2012/13) reports of stress experiences. We find that internalized gay ageism can reliably be measured among these men, is positively associated with depressive symptoms net of an array of other factors that may also influence symptomatology (including depressive symptom histories), and mattering partially mediates but does not moderate its effect on depressive symptoms. Midlife and older gay men have traversed unparalleled historical changes across their adult lives and have paved the way for younger generations of sexual minorities to live in a time of less institutionalized discrimination. Still, they are at distinct risk for feeling socially invisible and devalued in their later years.

T1  - Willingness to Record Police-Public Encounters: The Impact of Race and Social and Legal Consciousness
AN  - 1945406088
AB  - Although using personal electronic devices to record police-public encounters has surfaced as an important social phenomenon that could potentially shape public perceptions of the police and police-community relations, very little research has investigated factors affecting people's willingness to record the police. Using survey data collected from two universities, this study assessed whether race/ethnicity and social and legal consciousness influence college students' inclination to record public interactions with the police. Results indicated that minority students and those who believed that recording served social justice, had a deterrent effect on the police, and was legally justified were more likely to engage in such behavior. Past recording experience and negative encounters with the police also led to higher levels of willingness to record police activity. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.

T1  - Strategic Intersectionality and Political Representation: Female Muslim Councilors in London
AN  - 1747609043
AB  - This article addresses questions of how race/ethnicity, gender, and religion influence political representation. We use original interview data to test a strategic intersectionality theory developed by Fraga and colleagues (2005) in the case of female Muslim councilors in London, the United Kingdom. The original strategic intersectionality theory proposes that women are more effective advocates for ethnic group interests due to their unique capacity to leverage three primary resources: a substantive policy focus, multiple identity advantage, and gender inclusive advantage. We modify the thesis by analyzing religion as an additional identity marker and further disaggregating the three primary sources of leverage. We use the modified thesis to test whether female Muslim councilors of three London boroughs are more effective advocates for Muslim interests than their non-Muslim colleagues. We find mixed evidence for the presence of the three sources of leverage associated with strategic intersectionality, resulting in a more complex theorizing of this phenomenon than that found in prior research. This study offers a new contribution to the operationalization of intersectionality and the literature on intersectionality and political representation.

T1  - Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism in Iran: The Effects of Identity, Threat, and Political Trust
AN  - 1734967225
AB  - Antisemitism and anti-Zionism constitute two important ideological building blocks of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This article is the first to present quantitative empirical survey data elucidating attitudes towards Jews and Israel among an opportunity sample of Iranians. This study examines the correlates of antisemitism and anti-Zionism in Iran with particular attention to the effects of identity, threat, and political trust. Consistent with emerging research into antisemitism and anti-Zionism, there was a positive association between both forms of prejudice, suggesting social psychological overlap between the constructs. Given the pervasiveness of antisemitic and anti-Zionist representations in Iran, there were no significant differences in levels of anti-Zionism or antisemitism on the basis of gender and educational orientations. Political conservatives did manifest greater antisemitism and anti-Zionism than political reformists, although both groups scored high on these scales. There was a significant interaction effect of Iranian national identity and political trust on anti-Zionism, and a significant interaction effect of Muslim religious identity and political trust on antisemitism. Political trust was by far the most powerful predictor of both forms of prejudice, followed by the perception of identity threat. These observations are considered through the lenses of Social Identity Theory and Identity Process Theory from social psychology.

T1  - Color-Blindness and Commonality: Included but Invisible?: PROD
AN  - 1710020482
AB  - Although overt racism still adversely affects the well-being and advancement of Black Americans, subtle racism also has a pervasive influence. Color-blind racism, a form of subtle racism, rationalizes the current disadvantaged status of Black Americans and institutionalizes practices that perpetuate the disadvantage. The present article, adopting a psychological perspective, reviews the evidence on the existence and dynamics of contemporary forms of color-blind racism. It documents how racial biases that unconsciously and uncontrollably strategically shape the behavior of White Americans, even among seemingly well-meaning people. The article further examines how White Americans emphasizing color-blindness and common connection between members of different groups can improve intergroup attitudes but reinforce hierarchical relations between groups, which benefit Whites. Understanding the nature of subtle bias and the automatic processes that may underlie it can help illuminate how seemingly well-meaning interventions can obscure its effects, creating a veneer of tolerance while deflecting attention away from unfair treatment (and thus undermining motivation for action toward equality) among members of both dominant and disadvantaged groups.

T1  - Freedom of religion, women's agency and banning the face veil: the role of feminist beliefs in shaping women's opinion
AN  - 2100413765
AB  - Several countries have imposed bans on the wearing of face veils, a controversial option considered in Bill 94 by the province of Quebec in 2010. This paper examines non-Muslim women's support for the acceptability of the niqab in public spaces. Analysing the 2010 Quebec Women's Political Participation Survey, we find that key feminist arguments - that wearing the niqab is a woman's free choice, a matter of freedom of religion and a visible symbol of women's oppression - are important drivers of opinion. Their role in shaping opinion, however, is complex and mirrors divisions among feminist groups in the province. Additional attitudinal drivers include generation, exposure to the practice and openness to immigration. Equally important, our findings suggest that being a member of a racial minority, feelings of cultural insecurity and religiosity are of little consequence for thinking on the issue.

T1  - LATINA/O WHITENING?
AN  - 1700674470; 201525336
AB  - Some scholars argue that Latina/os in the United States may soon become White, much like the supposed Whitening of Eastern European immigrant groups in the early twentieth century. High rates of White racial identification on surveys among Latina/os is one explanation provided for this assertion. However, personal identification is but one element of racial boundary maintenance. It is when personal identification is externally validated that it is most closely associated with group-based experiences. This article maps components of the White-Latino racial boundary that may be permeable to White expansion by examining conditions under which Latina/os self-identify as White and report that they are externally classified as White by other Americans. Employing novel data from the 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, this article shows that nearly 40% of Latina/os sometimes self-identify as White, yet a much smaller proportion-only 6%-report being externally classified as White by others. Moreover, logistic regression analyses suggest that for those with light phenotypical features and high levels of socioeconomic status, the odds of reported external Whitening are increased. Interestingly, phenotypically light Latina/os with low-socioeconomic-status levels have low probabilities of reporting external classification as White when compared to their phenotypically light and high-socioeconomic-status counterparts, suggesting that the combination of both skin color and class may be central to the White-Latino racial boundary. Results also indicate that many who report external Whitening do not prefer to self-identify as White. In sum, multidimensional measures of racial classification indicate that only a very small minority of Latina/os may be 'becoming White' in ways that some previous researchers have predicted.

T1  - Majority-minority acculturation preferences concordance as an antecedent of attitudes towards immigrants: The mediating role of perceived symbolic threat and metastereotypes
AN  - 1735657122; 201536997
AB  - Through an experimental design, we investigated the effects of majority-minority acculturation preferences concordance and immigrants' generational status on Italians' attitudes towards Albanian immigrants. The role of perceived threat and metastereotypes in mediating this relationship was examined. Participants (N = 178) were categorized into different levels of culture maintenance and intercultural contact concordance. Findings showed that discrepancies in the contact dimension affected majority members' attitudes towards immigrants. Both perceived threat and metastereotypes were found to mediate the relationship between contact discrepancies and attitudes towards immigrants. Culture maintenance concordance interacted with immigrants' generational status in influencing majority members' attitudes. This research confirmed the importance of taking into account the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between majority and immigrant acculturation preferences, confirming that the most positive attitudes were produced when immigrants were perceived to adopt the same strategy as the majority, especially with respect to intergroup contact.

T1  - Ethnic Origin or Residential Location: Educational Labour Market Attainment of Young People of Immigrant Background in France
AN  - 1849287675
AB  - The poor educational outcomes and labour market difficulties of ethnic minorities are often attributed to their residential location and their segregation in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. In this article, we seek to determine whether the educational and employment trajectories of young people with at least one parent born in North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa or in the Middle East are equivalent to those of young people whose parents were both born in France, holding sociodemographic characteristics and place of residence constant. To this end, we exploit fine-scale geolocation data at the level of the infra-communal census district (IRIS) provided by the 1998 and 2004 Génération surveys. The specifications used in the regression models enable us to measure the effect of the origin variable after controlling for a wide range of individual variables and for the geographic fixed effect at the IRIS level (conditional logit). Our results highlight the large differences between the children of African immigrants and the children of French-born parents. These differences persist even after controlling for geographic effects.

T1  - The Relationship between Empathy and Attitudes toward Government Intervention
AN  - 1718064936; 201532993
AB  - Throughout history, government policy and programs have played integral roles in shaping social services. This article reports the findings of a study that explored the relationship between interpersonal empathy and attitudes toward government intervention among college students. Findings suggest that increased levels of empathy are associated with more positive attitudes toward government intervention. This relationship is even stronger for participants from marginalized identity groups. Nurturing empathy among those engaged in social welfare policy-making may support government efforts that are in the best interest of communities they are intended to help.

AN  - 1660024556; 201505648
AB  - This thematically analyzed study seeks to explore the career decision perceptions of sexual minority college students at an urban historically black college/university (HBCU). This qualitative focus group study delved into how sexual minorities feel their visible variables of race, gender expression, and degree of disclosure influence their career thought process. Theories relative to the study included Krumboltz's social learning theory of career decision-making, gender role theory, racial socialization, Cass's homosexual identity model, and impression management. Though participants initially proclaimed they did not allow their sexual minority identity to affect their career decisions, their overall responses indicated otherwise.

T1  - Order of actions mitigates hypocrisy judgments for ingroup more than outgroup members
AN  - 1700674490; 201524880
AB  - Compared to the conventional order of hypocritical actions-saying one thing and then doing another-merely reversing the order of these actions can mitigate whether an individual is judged to be a hypocrite (Barden, Rucker, & Petty, 2005). The present research examines how factors extraneous to a target's own actions-specifically, group membership-influence hypocrisy judgments. Three experiments provided consistent evidence that reversing the order of statement and behavior mitigated hypocrisy judgments to a greater extent when observers judged ingroup targets compared to outgroup targets. This pattern was observed across two distinct groups (i.e., gender and political party). In addition, mediational evidence suggested that the greater mitigation for ingroup targets stemmed from the observer's greater tendency to make attributions that ingroup targets had genuinely changed for the better.

T1  - Exposure to Outgroup Members Criticizing Their Own Group Facilitates Intergroup Openness
AN  - 1708527559; 201530141
AB  - A major barrier to conflict resolution is group members' tendency to hold on to the ingroup's narrative of the conflict and reject the outgroup's perspective. In the current research, we propose that voicing internal criticism to an outgroup crowd can undermine such orientations and foster intergroup openness. Across four experiments, Israeli Jews who were exposed to a Palestinian criticizing Palestinians were more open to the Palestinians' perspective of the conflict, than those not exposed to the criticism. This effect was obtained when the criticism was related (Study 1) and unrelated (Study 2) to the conflict, and was consistently mediated by increased hope about the future relations between the groups. Study 3 showed that the effect is more pronounced among those who believe that groups can change. Study 4 established that perceptions about the outgroup as open-minded underlie the effect of ingroup criticism on hope, and further demonstrated downstream effects of openness.

T1  - The Effect of Minority/Majority Origins on Immigrants' Integration
AN  - 1559007640; 201431975
AB  - This paper develops an inexplicably understudied variable with far-reaching implications for immigrants' experience: whether an immigrant was a member of a minority group in his or her country of origin. I investigate three groups of Israeli-born immigrants in the United States: Israeli Palestinians, ultra-Orthodox Jews, and the Jewish majority. Using the US censuses and American Community Surveys, I show that each group possesses different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics as well as different cultural and economic trajectories. Ultra-Orthodox Jews display processes of separation; the Jewish majority displays processes of integration; and Israeli Palestinians display processes of accelerated integration. In addition, analysis of these three groups' background and self-selection mechanisms, utilizing data from the Israeli Social Survey, provides a better understanding of these profound differences.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity and Its Effects on Social Cohesion
AN  - 1622293774; 201438447
AB  - Recent years have seen a sharp increase in empirical studies on the constrict claim: the hypothesized detrimental effect of ethnic diversity on most if not all aspects of social cohesion. Studies have scrutinized effects of different measures of ethnic heterogeneity in different geographical areas on different forms of social cohesion. The result has been a cacophony of empirical findings. We explicate mechanisms likely to underlie the negative relationship between ethnic heterogeneity and social cohesion: the homophily principle, feelings of anomie, group threat, and social disorganization. Guided by a clear conceptual framework, we structure the empirical results of 90 recent studies and observe three patterns. We find that (a) there is consistent support for the constrict claim for aspects of social cohesion that are spatially bounded to neighborhoods, (b) support for the constrict claim is more common in the United States than in other countries, and (c) ethnic diversity is not related to less interethnic social cohesion. We discuss the implications of these patterns. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethno-religious minorities and labour market integration: generational advancement or decline?
AN  - 1531933811; 201423251
AB  - This paper examines the generational progress of ethnic minorities in Britain by analysing four labour market outcomes: economic inactivity, unemployment, access to salaried jobs and self-employment. An important contribution of this paper is the possibility to examine the impact of a range of cultural and social resources on employment outcomes, namely language fluency, co-ethnic spouse, co-ethnic employer, bridging and bonding social capital. Controlling for ethnic and religious identities, individual, social and human capital characteristics, it finds clear advantages of language proficiency in obtaining employment and salaried jobs. However, the second generation shows little advancement in all the outcomes examined and a particularly strong religious penalty is found among Muslim women. It concludes that persistent ethno-religious penalty experienced by the second generation poses a serious policy challenge and does little to strengthen our economy or in building a cohesive society.

T1  - Introduction: Patterns of generational change: convergent, reactive or emergent?
AN  - 1531932418; 201423289
AB  - The aim of this special issue is to map the extent of generational change among Britain's ethnic minority population and to understand some of the underlying processes involved. Is there greater integration across generations, or has the 'new second generation' in Britain remained isolated from the mainstream, perhaps as a result of the prejudice and discrimination from the white British that they have encountered or because of desires to maintain ethnic values and resist western practices? We also ask whether processes of generational change have proceeded at the same pace and direction in different domains -- notably cultural, social, structural and political -- and whether it has proceeded at the same pace among different minorities.

T1  - Negotiating optimum distinctiveness: cognitive tendencies toward primordialism among Mapuche youth
AN  - 1520342652; 201413560
AB  - In recent years primordialism, as a model for understanding people's essentialist perceptions of ethnic similarity and difference, has returned to social scientific debates with a new degree of respectability and theoretical rigour. This article provides further evidence for why primordialism is prioritized by ethnic minorities as a cognitive mechanism for maintaining group distinctiveness, drawing on data gathered among indigenous youth in Chile. In the absence of traditional cultural tenets such as indigenous language and knowledge among the majority of the sample, criteria for membership are premised on perceived essentialisms of blood and surname. The result of categorizing others under primordial terms, however, is that it facilitates a space in which individual preferences of ethnic expression and distinctiveness can be negotiated. This brings the dichotomization of primordialism and constructionism under further scrutiny, suggesting that they may be compatible in the everyday practices of social life.

T1  - Predictors of Feminist Activism Among Sexual-Minority and Heterosexual College Women
AN  - 1504423932; 201405469
AB  - Engagement in activism is related to several aspects of social development in adolescence and emerging adulthood. Therefore, it is important to examine the correlates of different forms of activism, such as feminist collective action, among all youth. However, previous research has not investigated young sexual-minority women's engagement with feminist collective action. This study examined predictors of college-aged heterosexual and sexual-minority women's commitment to and participation in feminist activism. Sexual orientation, number of years in college, social support, experiences with discrimination, and gender identity were tested as predictors of commitment to and participation in feminist activism with a sample of 280 college-aged women (173 heterosexuals and 107 sexual minorities). Similar predictors were related to both commitment to and participation in feminist activism. However, for sexual-minority women, but not heterosexual women, the number of years in college was correlated with participation in feminist activism. Young sexual-minority women reported more participation in feminist activism than did heterosexual women, even after controlling for social support, discrimination, and gender identity.

T1  - Developing Cooperative Communities to Reduce Stigma about Mental Disorders
AN  - 1504423420; 201407955
AB  - This article explores the theoretical and practical considerations of developing cooperative communities to reduce the stigma of mental disorders and achieve meaningful structural and systemic change. A cooperative community is conceptualized as an alliance of people from differing backgrounds who work together to achieve a positive social change desired by all members of the community but not necessarily for the material benefit of all. In defining the social psychological processes involved in the development of a cooperative community-comprising (1) people with mental disorders, (2) members of the broader public, and (3) health professionals-we reconcile the evidence of disparate psychological theories of stigma and prejudice reduction, intergroup relations, identity formation and social change to show that techniques drawn from each of those theories are required to create positive change and effectively address the stigma of mental disorders. We then explore practical considerations for developing cooperative communities in the mental health sector and consider future directions for health and public policy in this area.

T1  - Newspaper Accounts of Racial Profiling: Accurate Portrayal or Perpetuation of Myth?
AN  - 1728660861; 201534028
AB  - There is both speculation and debate surrounding the prevalence of racial profiling in the United States. Since most people do not directly experience this problem themselves, many rely on information provided to them by various media sources (including newspapers). This study investigates trends in the presentation of racial profiling by three major American newspapers. A content analysis of newspaper articles from 1986 to 2010 reveals the frequency and context of the reporting of racial profiling, the extent to which it is presented as a problem for all racial minority groups as opposed to a select few, and the identification of the 'primary definers' of the problem of racial profiling.

T1  - Meaning in music: Deviations from expectations in music prompt outgroup derogation
AN  - 1512219940; 201408681
AB  - Encountering stimuli that violate expectations can elicit compensatory behavior. One notable result of such compensatory responses is the derogation of outgroups. The present research investigated for the first time if music that defies expectations fosters the derogation of outgroups. In Study 1, exposure to unconventional relative to conventional music increased wagers placed in favor of an ingroup winning a hypothetical rugby match against an outgroup. In extension of this finding, Study 2 revealed that unconventional music led to lower allocated budgets for support of a minority. Study 3 confirmed that music led to harsher punishments of a hypothetical outgroup offender after being exposed to an unconventional edit of a music piece relative to its regular version. The consequences of these findings are discussed in relation to intergroup relations and theories of meaning maintenance. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - In Ireland 'Latin Americans are kind of cool': Evaluating a national context of reception with a transnational lens
AN  - 1494749282; 201402089
AB  - In this article, I analyze how government policies and social reception shaped Latin Americans' patterns of incorporation and identity formation in Ireland, a new immigrant destination country in Europe where Latin American migrants lack both historical presence and (neo)colonial linkages, in the early 2000s. I show that Latin Americans in Ireland perceived a weaker form of racialization, not only than several other immigrant, refugee and racial groups there, but also than Latin Americans going to the USA, Spain, and (for Brazilians) Portugal. I then argue that these results illustrate how many Latin American migrants are now embedded within a transnational social field that connects flows of people and ideas across several different receiving countries -- both traditional and new -- which in turn shapes their relative evaluations of individual national receiving 'contexts of reception'. I conclude by examining the implications of these results for immigration and Latino Studies scholarship. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Prejudice toward American Muslims: An Integrated Threat Analysis
AN  - 1718067858; 201530688
AB  - This study explores prejudice toward American Muslims. Prejudice is conceptualized using Stephan and Stephan's integrated threat theory (ITT). ITT identifies four kinds of threat that can lead to prejudice: realistic threats, symbolic threats, stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety. Data were gathered in the United States (N = 281) among self-identified Christians. Findings confirm: 1) a positive correlation between real and symbolic threats, and stereotypes, 2) increased contact with an immigrant group, in this case Muslims, is negatively correlated with perceptions of real and symbolic threat, and 3) levels of prejudice differ based on level of education. Theoretical and practical implications of the relationship between prejudice, interpersonal contact/communication, and education are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Exploring the effect of in-group and out-group race-related stressors on anxiety among Asian Pacific Islander American students
AN  - 1433108454
AB  - This cross-sectional study examined (a) the impact of in-group (own-group conformity pressure) and out-group (perceived discrimination, stereotype confirmation concern) race-related stressors; (b) the direct effect of 2 in-group- (private regard, centrality) and 1 out-group-oriented (public regard) racial identity factors; and (c) the potential protective role of these identity factors on the impact of stressors on the anxiety of Asian Pacific Islander American (API) college students attending a racially diverse university. As predicted, positive feelings toward one's own racial group (i.e., private regard) had a significant negative relationship with anxiety. Private regard protected APIs from own-group conformity pressures and stereotype confirmation concerns. Findings address the diverse university context that may create acculturative pressures or stereotype confirmation concern conditions.

T1  - The Visibility and Invisibility of Migrant Faith in the City: Diaspora Religion and the Politics of Emplacement of Afro-Christian Churches
AN  - 1364702216; 201323402
AB  - In today's post-industrial city, migrants and ethnic minorities are forming, through their religious practices, particular spaces of alterity, often at the 'margin' of the urban experience-for instance, in converting anonymous warehouses into places of worship. This paper examines diverse facets of the religious spatiality of Afro-Christian diasporic churches-from local emplacement to the more visible public parade of faith in the urban landscape. One of the aims is to explore to what extent particular spatial configurations and locations constitute 'objective expression' of social status and symbolic positionalities in the post-migration secular environment of the 'host societies'. Without denying the impact of urban marginality, the paper shows how religious groups such as African Pentecostal and Prophetic churches are also engaged, in their own terms, in a transformative project of spatial appropriation, regeneration and re-enchantment of the urban landscape. The case study of the Congolese Kimbanguist Church in London and Atlanta also demonstrates the need to examine the articulation of local, transnational and global practices and imaginaries to understand how religious and ethnic identities are renegotiated in newly 'localised' diasporic settings.

T1  - THE RACIAL INCORPORATION OF LATINOS INTO THE U.S. MAINSTREAM
AN  - 1429637938; 201335753
AB  - For the last decade, scholars have pondered how the changing ethnoracial demographics of the United States would influence the country's racial, social, political, cultural, and economic landscape. Latinos are now the country's largest ethnoracial minority and the 2012 election provided an indication of just how significant this group will be for shaping the future of the United States. Scholars of race in particular have speculated how the ethnic and racial diversity of Latinos will change existing U.S. racial dynamics with some arguing that the historical Black/White binary will remain intact with Latinos falling on one or the other side of the binary. Yet, other scholars suggest that the Black/White binary will shift to a Black/non-Black binary in which Blacks will remain at the bottom of the U.S. ethnoracial hierarchy while Asian Americans and Latinos will be grouped with Whites. Going even further, another set of scholars argues that the size of the Latino population and its more fluid racial boundaries will trigger a Latin-Americanization of U.S. race relations such that Whites will remain at the top of the hierarchy, with Blacks and a few other lower-socioeconomic-status (SES) minority groups at the bottom while there will be an intermediate group between, "the Honorary Whites," that consists of mixed-race individuals and higher SES Asians and Latinos.

T1  - Contested memories: the Shahid Minar and the struggle for diasporic space
AN  - 1364704492; 201323281
AB  - Drawing on new empirical research on 'the Bengal diaspora', this paper explores the struggle over Bangladeshi identity in East London, as exemplified in the monument of the Shahid Minar and the related celebration of Ekushe, which marks the beginning of the Bangladesh national liberation struggle. Bringing together theories of diaspora consciousness and memorialization, the paper explores the ways in which rituals and memory work both as a form of continuity with the homeland and as a method of claims-staking for minority groups in multicultural spaces. Using original interviews with community and religious leaders, the paper explores the ways in which the establishment of the monument and the memorialization of the Liberation War represents the re-imagination of the Bangladeshi community in London and draws the lines for the contestation of this identity.

AN  - 1559006561; 201431854
AB  - This study (N = 215) investigated the impact of group entitativity on ingroup favoritism in the allocation of negative outcomes. Three conditions of group entitativity were created by modifying the standard minimal group condition through the manipulation of proximity and common fate. Findings showed that increasing group entitativity enhanced intergroup discrimination, and pointed out the strong impact of common fate. Thus, this study adds to the evidence on the effects of group entitativity in the field of intergroup relations. This research was supported by a grant from the Italian Ministry of University and Research (PRIN 2007PJYAKF). Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Nouns Cut Slices: Effects of Linguistic Forms on Intergroup Bias
AN  - 1417524757; 201333313
AB  - Three studies examined the effect of nouns and adjectives for designations of nationality on intergroup bias. In Study 1, participants (N = 237) evaluated group artifacts whose authors' nationality was labeled with nouns or adjectives. Use of nouns enhanced in-group favoritism, manifested as a preference of the in-group artifact. Study 2 (N = 431) tested the effect of nouns and adjectives on attitudes toward the in-group and out-group focusing on the moderating role of in-group identification. Use of nouns led to a stronger relative preference of the in-group, pronounced especially in low identified group members. Study 3 (N = 979) examined the effect of nouns and adjectives in a more applied survey setting. Intergroup bias concerning material restitution for confiscated property was stronger when the ethnicity of the former owners was labeled with nouns. The article emphasizes that subtle variation in language use has a consistent impact on intergroup evaluation. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Social Structure of the Kapalis of Bengal: An Oral Historical Approach
AN  - 1364702821; 201323560
AB  - The article is an attempt to understand the social structure of a little-known Hindu caste population of rural Bengal, traditionally dependent upon the jute-centered economy. The population is widely distributed in different districts of undivided Bengal and is known as Kapali and Vaishya Kapali, which are synonymous. The government of West Bengal declared both of them as Other Backward Classes (OBC). Serious research and documentary evidence on the caste population in general are numerous. In the case of the Kapali, the primary way of doing research is by using the oral historical approach. Special emphasis is given to the immigrant informants from Bangladesh. Findings suggest that the Kapali society vertically divides into major groups on the basis of geography and cultural practices. Each one was further vertically segmented into samaj and stratified again. Many vertical sections are reported. Each vertical section is called samaj and each one is socially isolated. Kulinism was practiced in the samaj. The contemporary society is undivided having no social hierarchy in West Bengal. These kinds of divisions, however, are present in Bangladesh even today. Through time, the rigidity of the samaj is diluted and a series of changes in social structure is observed. Findings also suggest that ecology and politics played vital roles in the change of social structure of the Kapali samaj. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A threat called Turkey: Perceived religious threat and support for EU entry of Croatia, Switzerland and Turkey
AN  - 1347784673; 201319987
AB  - European Union (EU) enlargement evokes strong opposition among its citizens. Meanwhile, EU citizens' opinions are likely to become increasingly important in determining the future of the European project. Countries aspiring to EU membership must therefore take public opinion in the EU into consideration. What determines public support for EU entry? A factor that has been ignored in the relevant literature is perceived threat posed by a candidate country's religion. On the basis of data derived from a voter survey fielded in the Netherlands (N=1394), we show that perceived religious threat is not very relevant for public support for EU access of Croatia or Switzerland. It is, by contrast, a major predictor of opposition to Turkish entrance to the EU. In the Turkish case, religious threat overshadows all other factors suggested in the literature except for immigration threat. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for Turkey's EU accession bid, and that of other Muslim countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Are anti-Muslim feelings more widespread than anti-foreigner feelings? Evidence from two split-sample experiments
AN  - 1448996490; 201342943
AB  - This article tests the claim that anti-Muslim feelings are more widespread than general anti-foreigner feelings. It reports on two split sample experiments, in which a randomly selected part of the respondents evaluated statements for which the target group was identified as 'foreigners' and the other part evaluated the identical statements but with the target group identified as 'Muslims'. By using open-ended questions we are able to separate those respondents who had Muslims in mind when asked about foreigners from those who did not. We find that anti-Muslim feelings are more intense than anti-foreigner feelings along a wide range of attitude dimensions. Furthermore, those respondents who had Muslims in mind while judging statements about foreigners, turned out to be at least as hostile as those who were asked explicitly about Muslims.

T1  - Liking more or hating less? A modest defence of intergroup contact theory
AN  - 1417521669; 201331847
AB  - Here, I argue that Dixon et al. have overstated the prevalence of "benevolent" forms of prejudice; many stigmatised groups are currently the targets of overtly hostile evaluation and treatment by others (e.g., Muslims; immigrant groups). I also believe that the target article oversimplifies its presentation of prejudice researchers' primary theoretical and policy goals and that it overlooks important work in intergroup emotions.

T1  - 'Grounded' politics: Manifesting Muslim identity as a political factor and localized identity in Copenhagen
AN  - 1448996364; 201342935
AB  - A prominent strand within current migration research argues that, to understand the participation of immigrants in their host societies, we must focus on their incorporation into the cities in which they settle. This article narrows the perspective further by focusing on the role that immigrants play within one particular neighbourhood: Norrebro in the Danish capital, Copenhagen. The article introduces the concept of grounded politics to analyse how groups of Muslim immigrants in Norrebro use the space, relationships and history of the neighbourhood for identity political statements. The article further describes how national political debates over the Muslim presence in Denmark affect identity political manifestations within Norrebro. By using Duncan Bell's concept of mythscape (Bell, 2003), the article shows how some political actors idealize Norrebro's past to contest the present ethnic and religious diversity of the neighbourhood and, further, to frame what they see as the deterioration of genuine Danish identity.

T1  - National models of immigrant integration: The costs for comparative research
AN  - 1125223823; 201240352
AB  - National models of integration are omnipresent in public and political discourses about how Western European immigration countries address the presence and integration of immigrants and minority groups. That France is viewed as a "republican" country, the Netherlands and Britain as "multicultural" and Germany as an "ethno-national" country, is something that has structured most of the public analyses and political debates within these countries. Models are conceived as "national traditions", "legacies", sometimes "sanctuaries", by a variety of actors involved in the policymaking and the politics of integration, ranging from civil servants, policymakers, opinion leaders and the media. This, however, changed in the early twenty-first century, models now being seen as a burden to the integration of immigrants. This reaction was directed at the Dutch and British multicultural politics in the 2000s and 2010s. This did not, however, alter the conventional political wisdom that views the Netherlands and Britain as countries with (a history of) multicultural models. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Violence Committed Against Migrants in Transit: Experiences on the Northern Mexican Border
AN  - 1010078620; 21655940
AB  - Thousands of Mexican and Central American migrants converge at the Mexico-United States border. Undocumented migrants in transit to the United States are vulnerable due to their lack of access to health care and legal assistance. This study attempts to provide evidence on the violent-related consequences that migration has on migrants. A mixed-method study was conducted between April 2006-May 2007 in shelters in Baja California, Mexicali and Tijuana, Mexico. Twenty-two in-depth interviews were performed and fifteen hundred and twelve migrants responded a questionnaire. Results from both in-depth interviews and the analysis of the quantitative data shows the different types of violence experiences by migrants which include threats, verbal abuse, and arbitrary detention based on ethnicity, as well as assaults, beatings and sexual violence. It is crucial to stress the importance and the need to evidence the condition in which migrants' transit to the US and to effectively respond to the violence they experience. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Self-Reported Discrimination and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Whites, Blacks, Mexicans and Central Americans
AN  - 927713012; 21562787
AB  - This study investigates whether self-reported racial discrimination is related to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Analyses focused on Whites (n = 52,571), Blacks (n = 4,343), Mexicans (n = 12,336), Central Americans (n = 1,504), Multi-ethnic Latinos (n = 1,102), and Other Latinos (n = 1,828) who participated in the 2003 and 2005 California Health Interview survey. Logistic and negative binomial regression was used to examine the association between HRQoL (assessed with the CDC unhealthy days measures) and self-reported racial discrimination. Discrimination was reported by 10% of Whites, 57% of Blacks, and 24-31% of the Latino groups. These reports were associated with increased number of unhealthy days, disability days, and poor self-rated health, even after, controlling for education and other factors. This association did not consistently vary by race/ethnicity. Racial discrimination may be a risk factor for poor HRQoL among diverse groups. Future research should examine the factors that may reduce potential exposure to racial discrimination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Neighborhood Ethnic Composition and Resident Perceptions of Safety in European Countries
AN  - 1037878816; 201231203
AB  - Employing data from the 2002 European Social Survey for 21 national representative samples, we provide the first cross-national analysis of the relations between ethnic composition of neighborhood and perception of neighborhood safety in the European context. The data reveal considerable variation both across countries and across individuals in perceived safety. Bi-level regression analysis shows that perceived safety tends to be lower in countries characterized by a high imprisonment rate and among Europeans who are physically and socially vulnerable (e.g., among women and elderly people, and among populations of low income and low education). Net of individual-level and country-level attributes, the analysis shows that perceived safety is lowest in neighborhoods mostly populated by non-European ethnic minorities and highest in neighborhoods mostly populated by Europeans. The effect of ethnic composition of neighborhood on perceived safety holds even after controlling for previous personal exposure to crime and views toward minorities' impact on crime. We discuss the results in comparison to findings in the United States and in the light of theory in order to delineate the ways that views and perceptions about places are formed and shaped.

T1  - Experiencing Everyday Discrimination: A Comparison Across Five Immigrant Populations
AN  - 910387457
AB  - Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data, this article explores and compares the subjective experiences of everyday discrimination articulated by immigrants across five different national origin populations. The comparison reveals that discrimination is perceived, encountered, and experienced differently by immigrants from various national origins backgrounds. Further, from the perspective of immigrants themselves, discrimination is not just about phenotypical racial characteristics, but also about language abilities, class position, immigration status, foreignness, and personhood. The article describes some of the contexts or settings within which discrimination is encountered, including a discussion of both mainstream and minority contexts. The latter is rarely addressed in the literature on discrimination. Finally, using some hypothetical scenarios, it examines how immigrants of different national origins say they might react to discriminatory behavior. This exercise not only illuminates some intriguing variations across the five populations but also addresses broader discussion of confrontation as opposed to forbearance in the literature on discrimination.

T1  - Territory, Ancestry and Descent: The Politics of Sickle Cell Disease
AN  - 1018354199; 201212831
AB  - Sociologists have long questioned the naturalness and stability of 'ethnic groups', suggesting that a concern with how they are socially constituted is more appropriate. However, the example of genetically based medical conditions appears to challenge this by suggesting that, in certain cases, ancestry, territorial affiliation and identity may be linked objectively by genetics. The article uses the example of sickle cell disease (SCD) to examine this claim. After reviewing the difficulties associated with notions of ethnicity, the article develops an account of how SCD came to be seen as an 'ethnic disease', and how it came to play a major role in the stabilization of particular forms of group identity. It concludes by emphasizing the need for a critical view of popular notions of territory and group identification. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright BSA Publications Ltd.]

T1  - Acculturation, Gender, Depression, and Cigarette Smoking Among U.S. Hispanic Youth: The Mediating Role of Perceived Discrimination
AN  - 897013979; 21293915
AB  - Hispanic youth are at risk for experiencing depressive symptoms and smoking cigarettes, and risk for depressive symptoms and cigarette use increase as Hispanic youth acculturate to U.S. culture. The mechanism by which acculturation leads to symptoms of depression and cigarette smoking is not well understood. The present study examined whether perceived discrimination explained the associations of acculturation with depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking among 1,124 Hispanic youth (54% female). Youth in Southern California completed surveys in 9th-11th grade. Separate analyses by gender showed that perceived discrimination explained the relationship between acculturation and depressive symptoms for girls only. There was also evidence that discrimination explained the relationship between acculturation and cigarette smoking among girls, but the effect was only marginally significant. Acculturation was associated with depressive symptoms and smoking among girls only. Perceived discrimination predicted depressive symptoms in both genders, and discrimination was positively associated with cigarette smoking for girls but not boys. These results support the notion that, although Hispanic boys and girls experience acculturation and discrimination, their mental health and smoking behaviors are differentially affected by these experiences. Moreover, the results indicate that acculturation, gender, and discrimination are important factors to consider when addressing Hispanic youth's mental health and substance use behaviors.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'Fear of numbers': Reflections on the South African case
AN  - 919904396; 201201681
AB  - Arjun Appadurai's The Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger (2006) draws largely on the case of India for empirical data. The 'fear of small numbers' that he discusses relates to the insecurity of contemporary societies, where 'pollution' of the national body by minority groups leads not only to irritation and discomfort but at times to the need for the violent cleansing of the pollutant, to conflict. Neville Alexander (2008), similarly, said that 'to define yourself into a minority corner in a situation such as the transition in South Africa is to play with fire in an almost literal sense'. In South Africa, historically, concerns with population numbers concern neither minorities nor majorities, but the manipulation of both through classification and counting of categories. South Africa presents us with the fear of numbers, both large and small. Such an approach demands acknowledgement of the complexity and international comparative studies of census-taking.

T1  - Children's social relationships in the Northern Italian school context: evidence for the immigrant paradox
AN  - 1125220951; 201242364
AB  - This study examines the existence of the immigrant paradox in a sample of 130 immigrant (69 Albanian and 61 Serbian) and 162 Italian native children, aged 7-12 years. All participants were individually tested regarding levels of emotional instability, pro-social behavior and aggressive behaviour as indicators of children's ability to interact adequately in a school context. Results showed significant differences between immigrant and native children, and particularly in the area of emotional instability. In spite of lower socioeconomic status, immigrant children showed lower levels of emotional instability than natives, while no significant group differences emerged on pro-social and aggressive behaviours. Gender differences revealed that boys in all ethnic groups scored higher on emotional instability and aggression and lower on pro-social behaviours than girls. Overall, the results resemble the paradox, suggesting that immigrant children display positive social relationships within the Italian school context. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Drawing of the Mark of Cain. A Socio-Historical Analysis of the Growth of Anti-Jewish Stereotypes
AN  - 923286680
AB  - In late 2009 his work on the history of anti-Semitism was published, following an extended gestation period and a lifetime of contemplating anti-Jewish stereotypes, the power of prejudices, and the conditions under which they may lead to persecution, violence, and murder.

Van Arkel presents some original concepts, such as "secession friction", as he describes the relationship between Jews and Christians; "terrorizing the discriminant", as he describes the compulsion among bystanders to participate in the discrimination and persecution; and the "genealogy of stereotypes", as he designates the dynamics and flexibility of anti-Jewish stereotyping, which are stronger, more contradictory, more manifold, and more irrational with respect to Jews than to other minorities.

Aside from observing several similarities in their dynamics, Van Arkel identifies a difference between anti-Jewish and anti-black forms of racism, which he attributes to differences in stereotypes and labour-market positions.

T1  - The power of talk: Developing discriminatory group norms through discussion
AN  - 896180241; 201120083
AB  - Research has shown that group discussion can increase intergroup prejudice and discrimination. However, we know little about the process by which discussion has this effect. Therefore, four studies were conducted in a real-world context to investigate this process. Results suggest that discussing a negative societal stereotype (relative to individual rumination in Studies 1 and 3 and alternative discussions in Studies 2 and 3) increases intentions to engage in discrimination against the out-group target of the stereotype. This is mediated by the formation of an in-group norm which supports discrimination (Study 1) and the extent to which the discussion validates the stereotype (Study 2). A fourth study manipulated the extent to which consensus on the negative stereotype was reached through discussion. When the discussion ended in consensus, participants have greater intention to undertake collective action against the stereotyped out-group, mediated by a congruent in-group norm. These results provide evidence that the process by which discussion increases intergroup discrimination is via the formation of discriminatory local group norms. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The roots of contemporary attitudes toward immigration in Australia: contextual and individual-level influences
AN  - 887495870; 201118081
AB  - This paper examines the roots of attitudes toward immigration among Australians of English-speaking background using the 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007 Australian Election Studies. The paper demonstrates that attitudes toward immigration in Australia have their roots in multiple sources, some of them relating to the local context in which individuals reside, others in the socio-economic and financial situation experienced by individuals. Attitudes toward immigration in Australia are also related to attitudinal factors and historical legacies that manifest themselves in mistrust and suspicion toward Asian neighbours. Finally, the paper demonstrates that the presence of immigrants and ethnic minorities influences Australians' attitudes toward immigration but that this effect must be understood in conjunction with the educational context of the areas of residence. While in high education areas Australians tend to react positively to the presence of immigrants, in low education areas they tend to react negatively to the presence of immigrants.

T1  - Power and threat in intergroup conflict: How emotional and behavioral responses depend on amount and content of threat
AN  - 907927883; 201124526
AB  - We propose that in intergroup conflict threat content is important in understanding the reactions of those who experience threats the most: the powerless. Studies 1 and 2 show that powerless groups experience more threat than powerful groups, resulting in the experience of both more anger and fear. Threat content determines which emotions elicit behavior that adequately deals with the situation. When confronted with a physically threatening outgroup, fear elicits an avoidance reaction in powerless groups (Study 1). When valuable resources are threatened, anger makes powerless group members want to confront the outgroup, at least when they strongly identify with their group (Study 2). Study 3 replicates the finding that threat content determines which emotions are functional in directing behavior. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Estranged Natives and Indigenized Immigrants: A Relational Anthropology of Ethnically Mixed Towns in Israel
AN  - 856403341; 201106915
AB  - Ethnic relations between the Palestinian and Jewish communities in ethnically mixed towns in Israel are marked by class divides, political fragmentation, and perception of alienation vis-a-vis place and other. Analyzing patterns of communal identity politics, this article revisits the spatial history of Jaffa since 1948. Against theories of urban ethnocracy predicated on the convergence of state policies and capitalist accumulation, which in turn engender longstanding spatial segregation between Jews and Arabs and between new and old residents, I argue that it is precisely the indeterminate 'contact zones' between communities and spaces that constitute the political and cultural realities in these cities. Proposing a relational reading of these spatial dynamics, this article shows that in contradistinction to the basic premise of the nation-state, in Jaffa as well as other mixed towns, the coupling between space and identity collapses. The concepts of 'spatial heteronomy' and 'stranger relations' are proposed to characterize the challenge raised by ethnically mixed towns to the Jewish state and to the ethnonational logic that guides it.

T1  - Ethnic Minorities in the Mass Media: How Migrants Perceive Their Representation in Swiss Public Television
AN  - 964199354; 201207514
AB  - Communication research highlights deficiencies in the media's representation of migrants. The study at hand analyzes these deficiencies from the perspective of the migrants concerned: How do they perceive their representation in the media, especially on television? And how do they assess the perceived situation with regard to immigrant integration? This topic has been examined in a qualitative pilot study based on six group discussions amongst migrants and Swiss citizens with an immigration background in the German-, French-, and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland. The results show a high discrepancy between the desire for more presence and participation on the one hand, and the wish to stand in the spotlight less often, on the other hand.

T1  - Hidden Minorities in Kosovo: "We Feel Like Ghosts in Our Own Community"
AN  - 925711798; 201204241
AB  - This article presents an analysis of the self-representation of the smaller (non-Serbian and non-Kosovo-Albanian) minorities in Kosovo. On the basis of in-depth interviews with representatives of different minorities living in Kosovo such as Roma, Ashkali, Egyptians, Bosniaks, Gorani, Croats and Turks, we reveal the ways in which they express their perceptions of living in the "new" Kosovo. The main contention of the article is that while these minority groups openly express that they are subject to discrimination and acknowledge how Kosovo Albanians and Serbs frame them as the "Other", they want to remain "hidden".

T1  - East Timorese Women in Australia: Community, Gender and Identity
AN  - 1907225723
AB  - This paper examines how East Timorese women in Melbourne, Australia view gender relations within the context of their resettlement and integration process in Australia as part of a broader question about gender and the construction of ethnic identities within a diverse community. Based upon a small qualitative study with fifteen East Timorese migrant women, we examine the complexity of the ethnic identity of East Timorese women in Australia, whose community reflects the diversity of their homeland, status divisions used historically within East Timor, different migration experiences and socio-economic and generational differences. The experience of East Timorese women varies according to the circumstances and timing of their arrival in Australia. Although most fled conflict and trauma, for the most part the women interviewed do not describe themselves in terms of a traumatized self-identity and depict their community in terms of engagement, support and resilience. Gender relationships changed with migration to Australia, with women enjoying more 'equality' in their relationships, in contrast to their past lives in East Timor. Yet many women also describe the maintenance of strong patriarchal values within the family, continued expectations of their responsibility to domestic affairs and the importance of maintaining a public face of appropriate behavior as 'good Timorese women.' They maintain Timorese identity through raising children and transmitting the potent cultural markers of food and language skills.

T1  - Colonialism and the Indigenous present: an interview with Bonita Lawrence
AN  - 754043934; 201053397
AB  - In this interview, a leading scholar of Indigeneity, Bonita Lawrence, discusses some of the crucial issues facing Native people in Canada today. She reflects on the denial of citizenship arising from the Indian Act's definition of 'Indianness' - which, in Lawrence's words, reduces cultural identity to racial identity. Also examined are the dilemmas of finding common ground between Indigenous struggles against the colonialism of the Canadian settler-state and the anti-racist struggles of Black people and other racialised groups. Exploring the interaction of Black and Indigenous peoples in Canada, it is argued, reveals the limitations of a superficial multiculturalism.

T1  - DISCRIMINATION-RELATED STRESS, BLOOD PRESSURE AND EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS ANTIBODIES AMONG LATIN AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS IN OREGON, US
AN  - 754038378; 201049756
AB  - Perceived discrimination has been linked to poor health outcomes among ethnic and racial minorities in the United States, though the relationship of discrimination-related stress to immigrant health is not well understood. This article reports findings from a preliminary study that examined blood pressure and Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels in relation to self-reported indicators of stress, acculturation and social support among 79 adult immigrant Latino farm workers in Oregon, US. Findings show that increases in discrimination-related stress predicted elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels among male participants. Though female participants reported similar levels of discrimination stress, this perceived stress was not reflected in biological measures. Among women, greater English language engagement was linked to higher SBP, and more years in the US was associated with higher diastolic blood pressure. Study results suggest that male and female immigrants' physiological responses to stress may be influenced in distinctive ways by processes of adjustment to life in the US. If replicated, the finding that discrimination stress predicts elevated SBP may have clinical and public health implications given that elevated SBP is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

T1  - Racial Contact and Change in South Africa
AN  - 743066398; 201043235
AB  - We investigate the effects of sociopolitical change on intergroup contact and social distance attitudes in South Africa, and the effect of these variables on intergroup attitudes and racial policy attitudes. The data come from secondary analysis of surveys conducted between 1991 and 2005, as well as a dedicated survey conducted in 2006. The results reveal widespread racial isolation among Black people; ambivalent attitudes to racial integration among Whites, who support integration in principle but are opposed to it personally; and contrasting outcomes of contact for Blacks and Whites. Increased intergroup contact was associated with reduced stereotyping and increased support for transformation policies among Whites but was associated with increased opposition to transformation policies among Blacks. Contrary to the predictions of contact theory, attitudes of Blacks and Whites toward Coloured and Indian compatriots were generally more negative in provinces with high levels of intergroup contact between these groups.

T1  - Experiences of Racial Discrimination & Relation to Violence Perpetration and Gang Involvement among a sample of Urban African American Men
AN  - 199567075; 18553221
AB  - Objective To examine racial discrimination and its relation to violence involvement among a sample of urban African American men. Methods Participants of this cross-sectional study were African American men (N = 703) between the ages of 18 and 65 years, recruited from four urban community health centers and two hospital-based clinics within an urban center in the Northeast. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relation of reported racial discrimination to recent perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV), street violence involvement, and gang involvement. Racial discrimination was measured via 7 items assessing everyday and lifetime experiences of racial discrimination. Results In logistic regression models adjusted for age and homelessness, men reporting high levels of discrimination (scores above the sample median) were significantly more likely to report IPV perpetration (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.9; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2-2.9) and street violence involvement (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.2) as compared to men reporting lower levels of discrimination. No relation was found between experiencing discrimination and gang involvement. Conclusions Findings showcase the potential relevance of racial discrimination to efforts focused on reducing racial disparities related to violence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Imagining intergroup contact reduces implicit prejudice
AN  - 743053342; 201026419
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that imagining intergroup contact can be sufficient to reduce explicit prejudice directed towards out-groups. In this research, we examined the impact of contact-related mental imagery on implicit prejudice as measured by the implicit association test. We found that, relative to a control condition, young participants who imagined talking to an elderly stranger subsequently showed more positive implicit attitudes towards elderly people in general. In a second study, we demonstrated that, relative to a control condition, non-Muslim participants who imagined talking to a Muslim stranger subsequently showed more positive implicit attitudes towards Muslims in general. We discuss the implications of these findings for furthering the application of indirect contact strategies aimed at improving intergroup relations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gender moderates the self-regulatory consequences of suppressing emotional reactions to sexism
AN  - 60360126; 201017531
AB  - This study examined whether members of low-status, stigmatized groups are less susceptible to the negative cognitive consequences of suppressing their emotional reactions to prejudice, compared with members of high-status, non-stigmatized groups. Specifically, we examined whether regulating one s emotional reactions to sexist comments--an exercise of self-regulation--leaves women less cognitively depleted than their male counterparts. We hypothesized that the greater practice and experience of suppressing emotional reactions to sexism that women are likely to have relative to men should leave them less cognitively impaired by such emotion suppression. Results were consistent with this hypothesis. Moreover, these results suggest that our social group memberships may play an important role in determining which social demands we find depleting.

T1  - Something to gain or something to lose? Affirmative action and regulatory focus emotions
AN  - 60351199; 201017454
AB  - Previous research on willingness to support affirmative action has examined groups that are historically advantaged or disadvantaged. We argue and show that support for affirmative action depends on whether people are induced to think of the in-group as having something to gain or as something to lose from affirmative action, and the self-regulatory focus this elicits. We hypothesized that group members should be more inclined to adopt a focus on promotion when in-group benefits of affirmative action are emphasized, while a focus on prevention should emerge when addressing potential in-group losses due to affirmative action. Data in support of this hypothesis were obtained in an experimental study asking university students (N = 83) to report emotions indicating a focus on promotion or prevention. Results further indicate that emphasizing in-group benefits (vs. non-benefits) enhances support for affirmative action, and that these effects are mediated by the regulatory focus adopted. Importantly, only promotion-oriented emotions predict support when the in-group is seen to benefit from affirmative action, whereas prevention emotions only predict support when the in-group is portrayed as standing to lose from affirmative action. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - el barrio de La Chueca of Madrid, Spain: An Emerging Epicenter of the Global LGBT Civil Rights Movement
AN  - 743043390; 201026597
AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine and deconstruct the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) barrio (community) of Chueca in Madrid, Spain, from political and sociological perspectives. First, we develop a critical framework for understanding the historical, political, social, cultural, and economic changes that took place in Spain after Franco's death in relation to LGBT issues. Ethnographic research was conducted from May to July 2007 in the Spanish cities of Madrid, Barcelona, and Ibiza, and focused primarily on the community of Chueca. A social constructionist perspective was used to examine sociocultural issues in this ethnosexual community through an in-depth study of the dynamics of this barrio. The theoretical framework of intersectionality and the constitutive relations among social identities is exemplified in Chueca. Hence, individuals in Chueca and their intersectionality perspective reveal that their identities influence and shape their beliefs about gender and symbols. We describe how Chueca reflects recent progressive changes in LGBT-related laws and statutes drafted by the federal government and how these have influenced the high level of societal acceptance toward intimate same-sex relationships in Spain. Additionally, we exemplify and present Chueca as an enclave that has been affected by the globalization of the private market, 'gay' identity, and enterprise, having a direct effect on cultural norms and social behaviors. Last, we examine the current state of the Chueca community relative to other developing LGBT Latino/a communities in the United States. Adapted from the source document.
