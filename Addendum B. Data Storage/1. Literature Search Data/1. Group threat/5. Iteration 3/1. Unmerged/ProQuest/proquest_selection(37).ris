T1  - The mediating role of national identification, binding foundations and perceived threat on the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants in Malta
AN  - 2640325760
AB  - What mitigates the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants? Addressing this question, we explored how national identification, endorsing binding moral foundations and the perception of threat mediate the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants in Malta. It was hypothesized that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure are more prone to identify with being Maltese and more probable to endorse binding moral foundations and perceive high threat from migrants, leading to a more prejudiced attitude towards migrants living in Malta. Two hundred and twenty‐two individuals participated in this quantitative study. Results from this study showed that national identification, binding moral foundations and perceived threat mediate the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants. The implications of the findings for theories about how need for cognitive closure contributes to increased prejudiced attitude in native population is discussed.

T1  - Heteronormativity, Disgust Sensitivity, and Hostile Attitudes toward Gay Men: Potential Mechanisms to Maintain Social Hierarchies
AN  - 2474584042
AB  - Within a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, heteronormative ideology serves as a social force that maintains dominant group members’ status (e.g., heterosexual men). Disgust may be an emotional reaction to gay men’s violation of heteronormativity (i.e., same-sex sexual behavior) and motivate hostile attitudes toward gay men to promote interpersonal and intergroup boundaries. Based on this theoretical framework, we hypothesized that sexual disgust—compared to pathogen or moral disgust—would be most strongly associated with antigay hostility and would statistically mediate its relationship with heteronormativity. Heterosexual men in the United States (n = 409) completed an online questionnaire assessing heteronormative ideology, disgust sensitivity, and hostile attitudes toward gay men. Results support the hypotheses and suggest that gay men’s sexual behavior is the most likely elicitor of disgust and antigay hostility, as opposed to a perceived pathogen threat or moral transgression. The findings indicate that heteronormative attitudes and sexual disgust are likely contributors to antigay hostility. Thus, intervention efforts should seek to improve tolerance of same-sex sexual behavior among heterosexual men, which may mitigate emotional reactions and hostile attitudes toward gay men.

T1  - The Prospective Association of Internalized Sexual Prejudice during Adolescence with Binge Drinking, Smoking, and Disordered Weight Control Behaviors in Adulthood
AN  - 2470588419
AB  - Prior research shows the importance of internalized sexual prejudice and participation in health indicators for sexual minority people, yet no research has used prospective measures or differentiated sexual minority groups. Data come from the longitudinal cohort study Growing Up Today Study 1 (N = 6,606), limited to participants who provided information on internalized sexual prejudice in adolescence and health indicators in adulthood. Completely heterosexual women with same-sex partners and mostly heterosexual women who reported high internalized sexual prejudice during their adolescence were more likely to binge drink during adulthood than completely heterosexual women with no same-sex partners. Similar patterns existed for mostly heterosexual and lesbian women when predicting smoking. Sexual orientation-related disparities in binge drinking smoking were largest for women with high internalized sexual prejudice who identify as completely heterosexual women with same-sex partners and mostly heterosexual women–groups that may have lower levels of connectedness to the buffering effects of sexual minority communities.

T1  - Prejudice and acculturation preferences towards Russian immigrants in Finland
AN  - 2570350481
AB  - Russian minorities are one of the most significant minority groups in Finland. Research on Finnish-Russian relations, suggests that Finnish adolescents have feelings of prejudice towards Russian immigrants. Studies that examine the association between these feelings of prejudice and the kind of acculturation preferences Finns have towards Russian immigrants do not exist. In a sample of 305 Finnish adolescents, this study investigates the relationship between feelings of prejudice and support for acculturation preferences (assimilation and integration) towards Russian immigrants. While controlling for the effect of age, gender, level of education, and family´s economic condition, results revealed a significant positive relationship between prejudice and assimilation and a negative but non-significant relationship between prejudice and support for integration. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed as well.

T1  - Signaling Similarity in the Icelandic Labour Market: How Can Immigrants Reduce Statistical Discrimination?
AN  - 2389722810
AB  - The authors discuss the reduction of statistical discrimination of immigrants. They look at the process of hiring immigrants from the point of view of human resource (HR) managers. Management literature has shown that HR managers face significant uncertainties when hiring which can, in turn, lead to statistical discrimination on their part. In this paper, they use qualitative interviews to examine how immigrants can reduce statistical discrimination in the Icelandic labour market by signalling their similarity to employers and divergence from their immigrant group.

T1  - Same same but different. How the play of difference intersects female refugee support workers’ constructions of a common identity
AN  - 2407556884
AB  - As in most parts of Europe, the influx of a large number of refugees from the summer of 2015 on has greatly stirred German society and politics and deeply divided the population on how to deal with asylum seekers and immigration. This article enters this controversy by examining supporters committed to the pro-refugee side of the debate – female volunteers in refugee support work. It investigates how the volunteers interpret their relationship with refugees and adopts the social-psychological hypothesis claiming that the construction of a common identity helps decrease prejudice and facilitate intergroup relations. However, I go on to argue that manifestations of difference continuously interfere with these conceptions of ‘sameness’, as difference is fundamental for the construction of identities and meaning in general. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews with female refugee support workers in Germany, this paper then traces how female volunteers imagine and locate ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ when working with refugees. The article shows that while outwardly, participants are keen to develop a sense of a shared identity with the refugees, distinctions through power hierarchies or cultural or gender identities disrupt their experience in ambivalent, complex and covert ways.

T1  - Caught between sympathy and suspicion: journalistic perceptions and practices of telling asylum seekers’ personal stories
AN  - 2296048924
AB  - Personal stories in news reports serve multiple purposes, but at their core lie efforts at illustrating and authenticating a social or political issue through human experience, an illustration that is compelling in its affective appeal. Telling the personal stories of people belonging to minority groups may work as a potent journalistic vehicle in countering negative stereotypes and prejudices against them. This article examines how Finnish journalists incorporate the personal stories of asylum seekers into their coverage of the so-called ‘European refugee crisis’ of 2015–2016. Drawing on qualitative interviews, we inquire into how journalists understand the meaning and purpose of asylum seekers’ personal stories in their news reporting and reflect on the professional values and ethical dilemmas when telling them. Our findings reveal that while journalists tend to sympathise with the vulnerable and see it as important to combat xenophobia and racism, their relationship with asylum seekers becomes increasingly informed and constrained by socio-political and discursive structures that foster a culture of suspicion towards asylum seekers.

T1  - The far right as social movement
AN  - 2269357606
AB  - The literature on the far right is trying to connect with social movement studies. Scholars from different social scientific backgrounds are increasingly acknowledging that extra-parliamentary grassroots activism is part of the alliance and conflict structure of nativist collective actors. The recent rise in far-right street politics - or, precisely, its re-emergence with seemingly different clothes - should encourage the study of the inter-relations between party and non-party collective actors. As a case in point, the far right not only includes political parties geared towards elections and public office but also social movements or 'networks of networks' that aim to mobilise public support, and a conglomeration of subcultural groups and groupuscules. By putting forward a three-part metric to analyse mobilisation factors at the macro, meso, and micro levels, this piece and the Special Issue it introduces bring the (inter-)relations between far-right parties, movements, and subcultures frontstage, and elaborate on nativist collective action across different arenas of contention.

AB  - In three studies, we examined whether ingroup disparaging humor leads to greater stereotyping of the ingroup. First, in Study 1, (N = 101) university students were exposed to (a) ingroup disparaging humor, (b) neutral humor, or (c) ingroup disparaging nonhumorous text. Participants exposed to disparaging humor reported more stereotypic evaluations than those in the neutral humor or disparaging text condition. Study 2 (N = 167) replicated these findings with humor conditions (disparaging vs. neutral) and showed that ingroup identification moderated the effects of the type of humor. Low identifiers exposed to ingroup disparaging humor (vs. those in the control condition) reported a greater frequency of stereotypic evaluations, whereas the manipulation did not affect high identifiers. Finally, Study 3 (N = 153) also manipulated the source of the jokes. As in Study 2, we found an interaction effect showing that high identifiers were not affected by the manipulation, whereas for low identifiers disparaging humor increased stereotyping and led to more negative emotions toward the ingroup. No significant effects were found for source of the jokes. We discuss findings in terms of how the traditional pattern of humor facilitating outgroup stereotyping also seems to apply to ingroup stereotyping.

T1  - "La beauté est dans la rue": Four reasons (or perhaps five) to study crowds: GPIR
AN  - 1932684507
AB  - In this paper, I argue that the study of crowds provides important lessons for social psychology in four key areas. First, it reveals the political influences which shaped and continue to shape the questions we ask and the answers we provide. Second, it demonstrates the importance of a methodological strategy which attends to real-world phenomena and the ability of theory to make sense of them. Third, it generates new theoretical insights and conceptual paradigms which have relevance to social psychology in general. Fourth, it provides new insights into the way that the social relations which constitute everyday social reality are created, consolidated, and changed. In sum, I suggest that the crowd is uniquely fertile ground in which to investigate the subject matter of social psychology.

T1  - Groupism and the politics of indigeneity: A case study on the Sámi debate in Finland
AN  - 1923538193
AB  - The article addresses the problems of defining an indigenous people by deconstructing the Sámi debate in Finland, which has escalated with the government's commitment to ratify ILO Convention No. 169. We argue that the ethnopolitical conflict engendered by this commitment is a consequence of groupism, by which, following Rogers Brubaker, we mean the tendency to take discrete groups as chief protagonists of social conflicts, the tendency to treat ethnic groups, nations and races as substantial entities and the tendency to reify such groups as if they were unitary collective actors. The aim of the article is to deconstruct groupist thinking related to indigenous rights by analytically separating the concepts of group and category. This allows us to deconstruct the ethnicised conflict and analyse what kinds of political, social and cultural aspects are involved in it. We conclude that indigeneity is not an ethnocultural, objectively existing fact, but rather a frame of political requirements.

T1  - Moving beyond the individual: Community-level prejudice and health
AN  - 1915558868
AB  - What rote does racial bias play in race-based health disparities? Debate on this question has intensified since the publication of the Institute of Medicine's report, Unequal Treatment, in which wide-ranging racial disparities were shown to persist even when socio-economic and biological factors were controlled. Much evidence shows that individuals' reported experiences of racial bias -- in society broadly, as well as in health care settings, specifically -- consistently relate to worse health outcomes. Orchard and Price make a valuable contribution to this small but growing literature in their study of community-level prejudice and disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight. Orchard and Price (2017) make a strong contribution to an emerging literature on community-level bias and health disparities. These data stimulate broader consideration of the antecedents of racial bias and the mechanisms through which it may affect the health of stigmatized group members. Additional research is needed to pursue the effects of racial bias at multiple-levels and harness the insights gained from interdisciplinary work.

T1  - Sexual and Gender Minority Health Curricula and Institutional Support Services at U.S. Schools of Public Health
AN  - 1914570420
AB  - Limited research has examined the ways in which public health training programs equip students to address health disparities affecting the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and other sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. This study outlines the availability of public health curricula on SGM health topics, and the prevalence of LGBT and SGM-inclusive institutional support services across CEPH-accredited U.S. schools of public health. Content analysis of all course offerings related to gender and sexuality revealed a limited focus on sexual and gender minority health: just 4.7% of courses contained keywords indicating that LGBT or SGM health topics were covered. Similar analysis of institutional support services available at U.S. schools of public health found that only 25% of schools had LGBT student organizations, and just 19% had an office of diversity that specifically advertised LGBT or SGM-inclusive programming or services on the institution's Web site. Finally, only two of 52 schools offered an educational certificate centered on LGBT health. These findings illustrate a significant need for enhanced curricular content and institutional support services that equip public health students to address SGM health disparities. Improvement in this area may encourage future health care professionals to work to reduce these disparities, to improve SGM persons' experiences in health care settings, and to generate further research in this area.

T1  - Gender, Sexual Orientation, and Rape Myth Acceptance: Preliminary Findings From a Sample of Primarily LGBQ-Identified Survey Respondents
AN  - 1883087401
AB  - This study is among the first to examine the relationship between sexual orientation and rape myth adherence using a nationwide survey of primarily lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) respondents (n = 184). The more established Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale and a modified Male Rape Survey serve as the primary instruments to test both rape myth adherence and instrument-appropriateness. Results suggest that respondents were most likely to support myths that discredit sexual assault allegations or excuse rape as a biological imperative and least likely to support myths related to physical resistance. Consistent with previous work, men exhibited higher levels of rape myth adherence than women. Regarding sexual orientation, respondents who identified as queer consistently exhibited lower levels of rape myth adherence than respondents who identified as gay.

T1  - Acts and practices of citizenship: Muslim women's activism in the UK
AN  - 1843960113
AB  - Drawing on the growing literature on Muslim women's activism, this paper explores grammars of action that frame political mobilizations of Muslim women in the UK. By taking a broad view of political activism, we identify acts and practices of citizenship through which Muslim women activists engage with, reinterpret and challenge social norms. The article critically engages with dominant readings of post-migration minorities' political mobilization through the lens of citizenship regimes and draws attention to more processual and agency-centred perspectives on citizenship. We focus on two salient themes that Bristol-based Muslim activists were concerned with: mobilizing against violence against women, manifested in the anti-FGM campaign by Integrate Bristol, and attempts to re-negotiate the terms of participation in religious spaces, manifested in claims for more inclusive mosques. In both instances, mobilization was not confined to the local community or national level, but supported by and embedded in related transnational struggles.

T1  - Ethnic and immigrant politics vs. mainstream politics: the role of ethnic organizations in shaping the political participation of immigrant-origin individuals in Europe
AN  - 1833157130
AB  - Previous scholarship has reported contradictory results regarding the impact of involvement by immigrant-origin individuals (IOIs) in ethnic organizations on political participation. In this article, we assess the effect of involvement in different types of organizations (ethnic, pan-immigrant and native) on participation in various types of political activities. We use cross-national micro-data from a population survey undertaken in 2004-2008 to IOIs in nine European cities. Our findings indicate that ethnic organizations perform an integrative function for IOIs in the political sphere, but they mainly affect participation linked to immigration-related issues concerning specific ethnic groups and IOIs. Moreover, most effects of involvement in ethnic organizations on the different types of political participation examined are similar in closed and in open political opportunity structures (POS). We only find evidence that involvement in ethnic organizations depresses conventional political action in open POS settings while it increases political action in closed POS settings.

T1  - Racialized political shock: Arab American racial formation and the impact of political events
AN  - 1833157085
AB  - This article explores significant factors influencing the process of Arab American racial formation. I bring into conversation theories of racial formation and 'political shock' in social movement scholarship to develop the notion of 'racialized political shock' as an important factor in how racial and ethnic groups mobilize and organize. Many moments of political shock are highly racialized and have the potential to reorder the racial and ethnic landscape in ways that can open opportunities or introduce constraints to mobilizations around racial formation. Drawing on existing studies of Arab Americans, this paper highlights how Arab American racial formation has been galvanized during moments of racialized political shock. In the Arab American case, these moments have led to a call for recognition outside the category of white. I conclude by outlining ways forward in the study of Arab Americans, who have been overlooked in studies of race and ethnicity in the US.

T1  - Does Closeness to Someone Who Is Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Influence Etiology Beliefs About Homosexuality?
AN  - 1831273196
AB  - Research suggests that contact with sexual minorities and etiology beliefs regarding the origins of homosexuality are associated with antigay bias; however, factors related to etiology beliefs have received little empirical attention. Our primary research question is: Does closeness to someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual influence etiology beliefs? Students (n = 851) from four U.S. universities completed an anonymous survey, and regression results indicated that contact and closeness were not significantly associated with etiology beliefs. Because both contact and relationship closeness were associated with antigay attitudes, and closeness demonstrated the largest effect, we tested three alternative structural equation models to determine if contact and closeness mediated etiology beliefs. Results suggested that contact and the degree of closeness are indirectly associated with students' etiology beliefs through antigay bias.

T1  - Religion and reducing prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 1830218242
AB  - Drawing on findings from the study of prejudice and prejudice reduction, we identify a number of mechanisms through which religious communities may influence the intergroup attitudes of their members. We hypothesize that religious participation could in principle either reduce or promote prejudice with respect to any given target group. A religious community's influence on intergroup attitudes will depend upon the specific beliefs, attitudes, and practices found within the community, as well as on interactions between the religious community and the larger social environment in which it is embedded. Basing our proposals on findings from the literature on prejudice formation and prejudice reduction allows us to outline useful directions for future studies of religion and prejudice.

T1  - Competition and intergroup bias: Toward a new construal process framework distinguishing competitive perceptions from competitive motivations: GPIR
AN  - 1830218153
AB  - Research on the effects of intergroup competition has relied on various conceptual approaches and has produced inconsistent findings. Following a review of the intergroup competition literature, we propose a framework which emphasizes that the influence of intergroup competition varies primarily according to participants' construal of potentially competitive events. We assess this via two variables: competitive intergroup perceptions (CIP), the perception that one's ingroup and another group(s) in the current situation are attempting to gain a reward at each other's expense; and competitive intergroup motivations (CIM), the individual desire for one's group to do better or acquire more of a reward than the other group(s). In four studies that presented participants with an ambiguously competitive intergroup setting and administered CIP and CIM scales adapted for the context, both variables were empirically nonredundant (Studies 1-4) and showed unique relations with intergroup outcomes: CIM, rather than CIP, was directly associated with greater intergroup bias (Studies 2-4), discriminatory intentions (Study 3), and discriminatory behavior (Study 4). CIP consistently registered an indirect effect on intergroup bias and behavior through CIM. Our results suggest that in ambiguous group contexts, CIM facilitates the pursuit of goals for the ingroup, which may involve expressing intergroup bias and more antisocial outgroup behavior, and that these tendencies are quite sensitive to corresponding changes in CIP. The current framework offers more precise insights into the influence of competitive group dynamics, and can easily be integrated with other research paradigms to determine how and when intergroup competition produces intergroup bias and discrimination.

T1  - Changing racial boundaries and mixed unions: the case of second-generation Filipino Americans
AN  - 1827656019
AB  - I examine an understudied topic of intermarriage - nonwhite mixed unions. Drawing on a study of second-generation Filipino Americans, I compare how respondents in inter-ethnic (those partnered with other Asians) and nonwhite interracial (i.e. Latino, black, and non-Asian bi-racial) unions perceive racial boundaries, or their 'racial schemas'. I argue that mixed unions can change how partners view racial boundaries. Drawing on phenotype, culture, and power position, both inter-ethnically and nonwhite interracially partnered respondents viewed themselves as different from whites. However, they differed in how they constructed nonwhite boundaries. Respondents in inter-ethnic unions drew on their Asian identity to distinguish themselves from Latinos and blacks, while informants in nonwhite interracial unions highlighted their Filipino identity to distance themselves from East Asians and align themselves with Latinos and blacks. These findings show that marriage affects racial boundary development and that mixed unions impact individuals' racial incorporation.

T1  - Man Up, Man Down: Race-Ethnicity and the Hierarchy of Men in Female-Dominated Work
AN  - 1825149052
AB  - Scholars have largely overlooked the significance of race and socioeconomic status in determining which men traverse gender boundaries into female-dominated, typically devalued, work. Examining the gender composition of the jobs that racial minority men occupy provides critical insights into mechanisms of broader racial disparities in the labor market--in addition to stalled occupational desegregation trends between men and women. Using nationally representative data from the three-year American Community Survey (2010-2012), we examine racial/ethnic and educational differences in which men occupy gender-typed jobs. We find that racial minority men are more likely than white men to occupy female-dominated jobs at all levels of education--except highly educated Asian/Pacific Islander men--and that these patterns are more pronounced at lower levels of education. These findings have implications for broader occupational inequality patterns among men as well as between men and women.

T1  - It's not all black and white: A propensity score matched, multilevel examination of racial drug sentencing disparities
AN  - 1823550849
AB  - This study aims to alleviate some of the mixed findings throughout the literature on racial disparities in sentencing outcomes by utilizing propensity score matching and multilevel modeling to assess racial drug sentencing disparities in state courts from 2000-2012. The findings illustrate the effect of race on sentencing varies significantly across states, and aggregate factors impact this relationship. Specifically, although differential offending, minority population, and arrests do not alleviate disparities, they are moderators that explain variance across states. Finally, aggregate socioeconomic factors such as poverty and education are also significant moderators that indicate the importance of structural disadvantage in sentencing outcomes.

T1  - Unionization and Income Growth of Racial Minority Immigrants in Canada: A Longitudinal Study: IMR
AN  - 1821571531
AB  - This study examines the effect of unionization on the labor market integration of newly arrived immigrants in Canada. We find that non-white recent immigrants gain access to unionized jobs at a slower rate than do white recent immigrants. The effect of unionization on earnings is somewhat lower for non-white recent immigrants than for white recent immigrants. These findings are based on growth curve modeling of longitudinal data from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID). Therefore, unionization does not contribute to reducing the earnings gap of non-white recent immigrants relative to white immigrants and the native-born.

T1  - Targeted harassment, subcultural identity and the embrace of difference: a case study
AN  - 1821634094
AB  - This paper examines the significance of experiences and understandings of targeted harassment to the identities of youth subcultural participants, through case study research on goths. It does so against a context of considerable recent public discussion about the victimization of alternative subcultures and a surprising scarcity of academic research on the subject. The analysis presented indicates that, although individual direct experiences are diverse, the spectre of harassment can form an ever-present accompaniment to subcultural life, even for those who have never been seriously targeted. As such, it forms part of what it is to be a subcultural participant and comprises significant common ground with other members. Drawing upon classic and more recent understandings of how subcultural groups respond to broader forms of outside hostility, we show how the shared experience of feeling targeted for harassment tied in with a broader subcultural discourse of being stigmatized by a perceived 'normal' society. The role of harassment as part of this, we argue, contributed to the strength with which subcultural identities were felt and to a positive embrace of otherness.

T1  - Indian time for nature? A multi-level approach to American Indian outdoor time in everyday life
AN  - 1804188100
AB  - Social scientists have utilized daily time use studies as one method of understanding everyday lives. The bulk of this research, usually quantitative, identifies broad racial, ethnic and gender differences. Yet, certain groups and questions are typically excluded in daily time use research. One such group is American Indians. To address this lacuna, we look at the deeply discussed view that American Indians are closer to nature than other US ethnic groups. We use a nationally representative sample of individual daily time use (American Time Use Survey; n = 136,960) to look at leisure time outdoors. Our results show that American Indians report greater time spent outdoors but that this is only statistically significant for those who identify as exclusively American Indian (not for American Indians that are multi- and bi-racial). This study confirms previous qualitative research that suggests American Indians have a distinct relationship with nature.

T1  - Precarity and agency through a migration lens
AN  - 1792351185
AB  - This special issue leverages the migrant experience to better understand precarity and agency in the contemporary world. By way of introduction, we examine the broader bodies of literature on precarity and agency, relate them to research on migration, and link them to the contributions in the special issue. Laying a foundation for further research, we illuminate three approaches to study the precarity-migration-agency nexus: an industry-specific approach, a sending country/deportee approach, and a collective action approach. We conclude with a critical analysis of freedom and national borders, considering the 'open borders' movement, postnational citizenship, and opposition to marketization.

T1  - Immigrant Criminalization in Law and the Media: Effects on Latino Immigrant Workers' Identities in Arizona: PROD
AN  - 1784933161
AB  - This article examines the effects of two forces in the context of reception: the legal regime and enforcement practices and media portrayals of immigrants as they combine to shape the lives of immigrants, particularly Latinos, directly and indirectly. It focuses on the case of Latino immigrants living in Phoenix, Arizona. Although the context of reception is conceptualized as including laws and policies, the media contributes significantly, as media portrayals reinforce or fuel the effects of laws and policies. When laws are exclusionary and enforcement is expanded, negative media portrayals contribute to create a particularly hostile context at the level of formal institutions and at the level of public discourse. Immigrants respond in multiple ways, including shaping their identities to highlight their image as hard workers and to distance themselves from images of immigrants as criminals. These two forces shape immigrants' views about themselves and of their position in U.S. society. [web URL: http://abs.sagepub.com/content/60/5-6/597.abstract]

T1  - The praxis of ethnic studies: transforming second sight into critical consciousness
AN  - 1784151073
AB  - This article focuses on a youth participatory action research (YPAR) program called the Social Justice Education Project (SJEP) that fostered young people of color's critical consciousness. Their critical consciousness emerged through praxis (reflection/action) while focusing on preserving ethnic studies in Tucson, Arizona. Because the SJEP home was in ethnic studies, the youth also struggled to keep their program alive. The Arizona Department of Education claimed the program bred 'radicals' who wanted to overthrow the government and therefore lobbied the state legislature to ban K-12 ethnic studies in public schools. In January 2012, the ban went into effect, shutting down ethnic studies classes as well as the SJEP. Young people's qualitative research on their struggle led to action to save the education that gave them hope for a more equitable and just world. The article addresses the praxis of YPAR, which sparks a thought process leading to the drive to take action. Observing and documenting educational injustices inspire the need to seek radical change of Self and schools. Through the reflection and action facilitated by YPAR, young people of color construct a message about the importance of ethnic studies for individual as well as social transformation.

T1  - Zones of Difference, Boundaries of Access: Moral Geography and Community Mapping in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire
AN  - 1768022783
AB  - In Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 18% of men who have sex with men (MSM) are HIV-positive. Based on ethnographic research conducted among HIV peer educators and activists in Abidjan, I examine their narratives and hand-drawn maps of city space. I draw on a methodological process of map-making to examine research participants' evaluations of neighborhoods and link these evaluations to debates over national and cultural belonging in Côte d'Ivoire. I suggest a moral geography emerges from the maps and narratives and ask what the bioethical implications of moral geography are in the context of service delivery and activism among sexual minorities.

T1  - Religious minorities and secularism: an alternative view of the impact of religion on the political values of Muslims in Europe
AN  - 1784150903
AB  - This paper proposes an alternative explanation of Muslims' endorsement of secular values based on their belonging to religious minorities. We argue that, contrary to what is often asserted in both the academic literature and the public debate, Muslims' endorsement of secular values is not simply a matter of strong individual religiosity, but may also result from belonging to a religious minority. We suggest that this group-level variable may explain differences in the support for democratic values by Muslims in Europe, in addition to the individual-level variable pertaining to individual religiosity. Our findings show that belonging to a religious minority in the country of origin positively affects the degree of support of secularist values. More generally, they suggest that denominational Muslim identities should be investigated by taking into account the role of belonging to religious minorities. Moreover, the article will show how belonging to a religious minority can moderate the negative effect of religiosity on secular values.

T1  - Prospects on Hungarian as a Regional Official Language and Szeklerland's Territorial Autonomy in Romania
AN  - 1855325266
AB  - This article analyses two options the Hungarian ethno-linguistic community in the Transylvanian region of Romania has in order to preserve its ethno-linguistic identity. Firstly, there is the option of unrestricted language use in the public domain. At present the Romanian legal framework assigns members of the Hungarian speaking community in Transylvania individual linguistic and cultural rights only. The Romanian language policy is further restricted by a threshold rule. The ratio of minority must number 20 per cent of the total inhabitants of a certain administrative-territorial unit in order to have their language recognised officially. The second possibility is that historical territories where Transylvanian Hungarians statistically form a dominant majority (i.e. Szeklerland) are granted territorial autonomy. The territoriality principle would secure linguistic minority rights. We will conclude that the prospects for Hungarian as a regional language in Romania are more realistic than the recognition of Szeklerland's territorial autonomy.

T1  - Post-genocide Identity Politics in Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina and their Compatibility with International Human Rights Law
AN  - 1855324037
AB  - Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina were scenarios of large-scale violence throughout the 1990s, substantiated by the manipulation of public and private discourses that denied diversity. After the conflicts, the states were faced with the challenge of addressing not only the consequences of the conflicts but also the constructed narratives behind them. In the two cases, public policies were implemented to elude further violence and strengthen a peaceful and long-term coexistence. Whether based on the rejection of ethnic identity or on the preservation of ethnic and national divides, both countries adopted policies that undermine basic rights and ignore sections of society excluded from official versions of history. Victimization is still a tool for political interests and remains present in public discourses. Irrespective of governmental policies that intend to surpass ancient animosities, divisionism is still present and underpins politics, religion, and social life in Rwanda and in Bosnia.

T1  - Racial zigzags: Visualizing racial deviancy in German physical anthropology during the 20th century
AN  - 1752183466
AB  - In 1907, German anthropologist Theodor Mollison invented a unique method for racial differentiation, called 'deviation curves'. By transforming anthropometric data matrices into graphs, Mollison's method enabled the simultaneous comparison of a large number of physical attributes of individuals and groups. However, the construction of deviation curves had been highly desultory, and their interpretation had been prone to various visual misjudgements. Despite their methodological shortcomings, deviation curves became very popular among racial anthropologists. This positive reception not only stemmed from the method's utilities, but was related to additional interests of its protagonists which the method helped promote. Deviation curves provided a unique solution to the holistic-atomistic controversy in German anthropology. By giving separate measurements a consolidated visual form, they substantiated the idea that the attributes of certain social groups were part of distinct racial compounds. Deviation curves thus reinforced racial suppositions, in face of severe criticism on the ontological reality of race itself. Finally, deviation curves emphasized the biological singularity of disadvantaged human groups -- Jews, Africans and also women -- and of their divergence from ideologically defined physical norms. Disciplinary and social interests thus became intertwined in the formation of a scientific method, which is used to this day in physical anthropology.

T1  - How Like Perceives Like: Gay People on "Gaydar"
AN  - 1728270920
AB  - When lacking explicit knowledge of someone's sexual orientation, gay people commonly assess the likelihood that another is gay using their "gaydar." The term gaydar is a playful mix of the word gay with radar, suggesting that one can sense, intuit, or perceive some set of characteristics in another that signal a shared minority status. While commonly mentioned, the exact criteria a gay person uses when employing their gaydar are little discussed. Drawing methodologically on a series of five focus groups of self-identified lesbians and gay men, this study explores the physical, visual, energetic, and conversational cues gay people consider when they employ the trope of gaydar. Specifically, interview subjects most often described their gaydar as triggered by the following elements: physical presentation, including mannerisms, dress, and voice; interactions, especially eye contact; a presence or absence of certain conversational social norms; and, intangibly, as a kind of energetic exchange.

T1  - 'Gay Enclaves Face Prospect of Being PassÉ': How Assimilation Affects the Spatial Expressions of Sexuality in the United States
AN  - 1757508041
AB  - Journalists, activists and academics alike predict that gay neighborhoods in the United States will disappear, yet many of their claims are unsubstantiated or overly determined by economic factors. This article examines 40 years of media accounts to identify the mechanisms that explain why these urban areas are changing. I begin with the observation that the rate of assimilation of sexual minorities into mainstream society has accelerated in today's so-called 'post-gay' era. Assimilation expands the residential imagination of gays and lesbians beyond the boundaries of a specific neighborhood to the entire city itself. Furthermore, as sexual orientation recedes in centrality in everyday life, residents opine that few care if a person self-identifies as gay or straight. These two respective mechanisms of expansion and cultural sameness bring existing economic wisdom into dialogue with a cultural and political perspective about how our shifting understandings of sexuality also affect the decisions we make about where to live and socialize.

T1  - Business and Social Profiles of Immigrant-Owned Small Firms: The Case of Pakistani Immigrant Entrepreneurs in Greece
AN  - 1700673509; 201525217
AB  - This study examines Pakistani immigrant entrepreneurs in Greece in order to identify patterns of ethnic entrepreneurship and socio-economic challenges faced by ethnic entrepreneurs. The research aims to enhance understanding of the characteristics and business profiles of Pakistani immigrant entrepreneurs in Greece's capital, Athens, and make recommendations for the development of a follow-up three-year longitudinal study of Pakistani immigrant businesses in Athens. A survey administered to 13 Pakistani immigrant entrepreneurs recorded a wide range of data from which frequency distributions were processed as well as cross-tabulations and Chi-square tests, to reveal strong associations. Findings of note reveal that Pakistani immigrant entrepreneurs set up enterprises with their own capital rather than turning to the private financial sector, are mostly well-educated despite earlier research noting the opposite, Greece is the terminal migration destination of choice for Pakistani immigrant entrepreneurs, their market-share of work permits is proportionately larger than their residence permit share, they differ from other ethnic groups by substantial preference for operation of call centers, and they are very much bound to their ethnic enclaves. This body of research offers a unique contribution to an area which has until now been largely ignored. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Psychopathology, adversity, and creativity: Diversifying experiences in the development of eminent African Americans
AN  - 1700673184; 201525182
AB  - Symptoms associated with mental illness have been hypothesized to relate to creative achievement because they act as diversifying experiences. However, this theory has only been tested on predominantly majority-culture samples. Do tendencies toward mental illness still predict eminent creativity when they coexist with other diversifying experiences, such as early parental death, minority-status, or poverty? These alternative diversifying experiences can be collectively referred to as examples of developmental adversity. This conjecture was tested on a significant sample of 291 eminent African Americans who, by the nature of their status as long-term minorities, would experience more developmental adversity. Replicating majority-culture patterns, African American artists showed higher mental illness rates than African American scientists. Yet the absolute percentages were significantly lower for the African Americans, regardless of profession. Furthermore, mental illness predicted higher eminence levels only for the African American artists, an effect that diminished when controlling for developmental adversity. Because the latter predicted eminence for both artists and scientists, the 'madness-to-genius' link probably represents just 1 of several routes by which diversifying experiences can influence eminence. The same developmental ends can be attained by different means. This inference warrants further research using other eminent creators emerging from minority culture populations.

T1  - Patriotic Unity and Ethnic Diversity at Odds: The Example of Tatar Organisations in Moscow
AN  - 1708525424; 201528615
AB  - The Russian Federation's policy of promoting patriotism, in place since the early 2000s, raises the issue of how the country's non-Russian ethnic groups receive this policy. To answer this question, this essay studies the reception of Russian state-promoted patriotism in the 2000s among the Tatar community in Moscow. Looking at the activities of Tatar associations (especially the Regional Tatar National-Cultural Autonomy organisation), it shows the syntheses and compromises negotiated by activists between patriotism and ethno-cultural belonging in the capital. Paradoxically, their attempts at synthesis strengthen an essentialist representation of the Tatar community, leading ultimately, on the one hand, to criticism of state nationality policy, and on the other, to the discontent of Tatar independent activists who criticised the undemocratic rules and personal domination in the Regional Tatar National-Cultural Autonomy organisation supported by state authorities. These criticisms echo the tensions in the Russian political agenda at the beginning of the 2010s. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Introduction: Critical Approaches to Migration Law
AN  - 1854257244
AB  - The collection of articles in this special issue of the International Journal on Minority and Groups Rights cover various strands in the typology of reflective criticism. They concern themselves with both pragmatic and systemic responses to the law of migration. The articles aim to provide for a wider assessment and understanding of the law -- be it a legal decision, a legislative or treaty provision, or practice or a policy. The schematic typology does not advocate a sharp division between systemic and scholarly reflection. Nor does it advocate segregation in scholarship. The adopted premise is that there are different ways to reflect. All of these are capable of co-existence. What must be preserved -- especially against the dominant hegemonic approaches to study of law and policy where those involved 'talk or negotiate' with the law -- as would a mere commentator or neutral collaborator -- is the role of the academic scholar as a critic.

T1  - Minority Children and Education in the Work of the Advisory Committee
AN  - 1854257087
AB  - This article seeks to analyse the relevance of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (Framework Convention) for minority children in the field of education. It does this with a comprehensive analysis of primary sources, namely opinions of the Framework Convention's Advisory Committee, which monitors the treaty's implementation. The article therefore also analyses the role of this independent monitoring body in protecting minority children's rights. It argues that the Framework Convention provides a very relevant structure for children's rights, and demonstrates that perhaps the most valuable contribution of the Advisory Committee to the field of children's rights has been, firstly, in identifying various obstacles that are preventing the full implementation of children's rights in the field of education; secondly, in recommending measures for removing those obstacles or mitigating their effects; and, thirdly, in identifying best practices with regards to the rights of children to education.

T1  - An Immigrant's Tale: The Mexican American Southwest 1850 to 1950
AN  - 1778950084
AB  - Recent scholarship on Mexican Americans in the United States, relying largely on qualitative evidence, sees racism and exploitation as the major explanatory factors in their history. Using representative samples of persons of Mexican origin, we argue that immigration is fundamental to their historical experience. A small, beleaguered community in 1850, the Mexican-origin population grew during the late nineteenth century due to greater security under US jurisdiction. However, immigration between 1900 and 1930 created a Southwest broadly identified with persons of Mexican origin. Economic development in Mexico, restriction of European immigration to the United States, and extreme cross-border wage differentials prompted extensive emigration. Despite low human capital, circular migration, and discrimination, immigrant Mexicans earned substantially higher wages than workers in Mexico or native-born Hispanics in the United States. They followed typical immigrant paths toward urban areas with high wages. Prior to 1930, their marked tendency to repatriate was not "constructed" or compelled by the state or employers, but fit a conventional immigrant strategy. During the Depression, many persons of Mexican origin migrated to Mexico; some were deported or coerced, but others followed this well-established repatriation strategy. The remaining Mexican-origin population, increasingly native born, enjoyed extraordinary socioeconomic gains in the 1940s; upward mobility, their family forms, and rising political activity resembled those of previous immigrant-origin communities. In the same decade, however, the Bracero Program prompted mass illegal immigration and mass deportation, a pattern replicated throughout the late twentieth century. These conditions repeatedly replenished ethnicity and reignited nativism, presenting a challenge not faced by any other immigrant group in US history.

T1  - The New Majority: How Will Latino Youth Succeed in the Context of Low Educational Expectations and Assumptions of Sexual Irresponsibility?
AN  - 1619442714
AB  - Latino youth are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the USA and will soon comprise a significant portion of our future leadership and workforce. Prejudicial stereotypes about Latino youth--such as the assumption that teen pregnancy will inevitably lead to lower educational attainment--ignore significant advancements in educational and sexual health outcomes and contribute to inequities in health and education policies. A total of 332 Latino-identified youth living in California gave voice to their educational aspirations, challenges, and sexual and reproductive health needs through an exploratory mixed-methods research study. Youth participated in interviews and focus groups (n=105) and in a statewide survey (n=227) to explore assets that help youth overcome discriminatory low expectations and improve sexual decision making and educational aspirations. Results indicated most Latino youth desire to attend college. Likelihood of attending college was associated with individual and environmental assets. Lower likelihood of attending college was associated with perceived discrimination from teachers. Sexually active youth reported high levels of contraceptive use. Many youth want to defy the negative stereotypes and are seeking successful futures despite the structural challenges and social bias. There is an urgent need to reframe the negative public discourse about Latino youth, to acknowledge their resilience and to address underlying structural factors creating inequities. Specific policy recommendations are provided to promote positive sexual health and educational outcomes among Latino youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Comparative Analysis Between the Nile Valley's Liberal Arts Tradition and the Development of Western Education
AN  - 1700676354; 201525176
AB  - This article is an analysis of the original purpose of studying the seven liberal arts in the context of contemporary higher education. Nile Valley theorists in ancient Africa tied the purpose of studying liberal arts to the conceptualization that all humans are born divinely natured. In order to cultivate a learner's divinity properly, the student studied the seven liberal arts. Greek theorists embraced and promoted liberal arts along Mediterranean Europe. However, Rome's ascendency and eventual collapse created an educational void in the West until the Moors reintroduced liberal arts curricula into Europe during the medieval period. Medieval schools featuring liberal arts eventually incorporated Western cultural trends of male superiority, upper class privilege, social inequality, and ethnic-group discrimination into the academic environment. American higher education institutions followed the European model but included racial discrimination, segregation, and financial accumulation, which contrasted the original purpose of investigating the seven liberal arts.

T1  - Does Segregation Create Winners and Losers? Residential Segregation and Inequality in Educational Attainment
AN  - 1775310173
AB  - This article examines the effects of residential segregation on the basis of poverty status and race for high school and college completion. Segregation effects are estimated by contrasting educational outcomes among persons raised in metropolitan areas with varying levels of segregation. This metropolitan-level approach provides two advantages in evaluating segregation effects over neighborhood effects studies: it incorporates effects of residential segregation outside of the affected individuals' neighborhoods of residence and it allows evaluation of gains and losses across groups from segregation. Data are drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the decennial censuses. Poor-nonpoor segregation is associated with lower rates of high school graduation among adolescents from poor backgrounds, but has no effect on rates of graduation for students from nonpoor backgrounds. Black-white segregation is associated with lower rates of high school graduation and college graduation for black students, but has no effect on graduation rates for white students. Use of proximity-adjusted segregation measures or instrumental variable estimation gives similar results. The results suggest that residential segregation harms the educational attainment of disadvantaged groups without increasing the educational attainment of advantaged groups

T1  - Who supports redistributive policies in contemporary Japan? An integrative approach to self-interest and trust models
AN  - 1708525580; 201529093
AB  - This article investigates determinants of support for redistributive policies by taking an integrative approach with two main models that explain welfare attitudes: a self-interest model and a trust model. While the former focuses on effects of social positions and the latter focuses on effects of trust, there might be interactive effects between these two factors. The authors focus on three types of trust - generalized trust, primordial trust, and trust in institutions - and analyze how trust intervenes in effects of self-interest. They analyze data from a public opinion survey conducted in Japan, and present the results. Whereas generalized trust and trust in institutions alleviate effects of self-interest, primordial trust strengthens them. Furthermore, generalized trust increases support for selective redistributive policies regardless of one's socio-economic status. These results prove that trust works differently according to one's socio-economic position and that the three types of trust play different roles in support for redistribution policies.

T1  - Validation of the Coping With Discrimination Scale in Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1551001386; 201429063
AB  - The Coping With Discrimination Scale (CDS) shows promise as a self-report measure of strategies for coping with racial discrimination. To assess the psychometric properties of the measure for use with sexual minorities (i.e., gay, lesbian, bisexual, or GLB persons), a nonprobability sample of 371 GLB adults completed the instrument along with several standardized, self-report measures. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the five-factor structure of the original scale with the exclusion of five items. Adequate internal consistency reliability was found. Internalization, drug and alcohol use, and detachment subscales were correlated positively with measures of psychological distress and negatively with a measure of life satisfaction, providing evidence of construct validity. The education/advocacy and resistance subscales were largely unrelated to concurrently administered validation measures, consistent with prior findings. Coping strategy use varied as a function of primary sources of social support. The CDS appears to be a psychometrically sound measure of several discrimination coping strategies for use with sexual minorities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'If it's Your Money, I Will Pay and Go': Shifting and Contested Significance of Brideprice Payment among the Dagaaba of Northwest Ghana
AN  - 1700675795; 201525381
AB  - Like many ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa, the Dagaaba of northwest (now Upper West region) Ghana have regarded, and for the most part, continue to regard the payment of the brideprice as the cornerstone upon which marriage is built - without it a marriage contract is not considered legal. Since the 1980s, however, the significance or essence of the payment has been contested and challenged by many Dagaaba. While some (young men) argue for a reform of the payment, others (young women) argue that the practice should be abolished altogether. Yet a third group (mostly elders) believes that brideprice payment is a 'tradition' passed down over generations that should be maintained. This article examines the origins and historical significance of brideprice payments, and how views about these payments have changed over time among the Dagaaba - from those born near the close of the last century, to those of marriageable age now. The goal of this examination is to contribute to the ongoing discussion among African scholars and governments on the importance of maintaining certain aspects of their cultural heritage.

T1  - Expanding the Spectrum of Attitudes Toward the Death Penalty: How Nondichotomous Response Options Affect Our Understandings of Death Penalty Attitudes
AN  - 1559007336; 201433359
AB  - Overall, studies show that the majority of Americans support the use of the death penalty for murderers; however, few studies have investigated response patterns to death penalty survey questions that offer more than yes/no response options. Without a realistic understanding of Americans' attitudes, the existence of this controversial legislation may hinge on inaccurate depictions of public opinion. The current study utilizes a college sample of students from a southern university (N = 775, average age 22) to investigate how nondichotomous response options affect our understandings of death penalty attitudes. Using independent variables that are commonly found in quantitative studies about death penalty attitudes (i.e., religiosity, biblical literalism, political attitudes, race, gender, age, southern region) as well as independent variables less commonly seen in death penalty studies (i.e., feminist identity, and student-specific variables: grade point average, freshman status, high school size, and sociology major/minor), ordinary least squares and logistic regression results indicate that examining death penalty support with nondichotomous response options reveals more nuanced results when compared to examinations of death penalty that use dichotomous response options. Policy implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Responses to social exclusion in cultural context: Evidence from farming and herding communities
AN  - 1542001187; 201426960
AB  - In a series of studies, we investigated the role of economic structures (farming vs. herding) and source of ostracism (close other vs. stranger) in social exclusion experiences. We first confirmed that herders rely on strangers to a greater extent than do farmers for economic success (validation study). Next, we verified that farmers and herders understand the concept of ostracism, and its emotional consequences, in similar ways (Study 1). The studies that followed provided converging evidence that cultural group membership shapes sensitivity and responses to social exclusion. Using different methodologies, in Studies 2 and 3, we showed that, whereas the psychological consequences of ostracism by close others are similar for farmers and herders, herders are more strongly affected by ostracism from strangers. The last two studies demonstrated that herders recommend more affiliative responses to ostracism by strangers than do farmers both to those involved in the ostracism event (Study 4) and to naive individuals (Study 5). Moreover, Study 5 revealed that the amount of time spent with strangers mediated cultural group differences in the extent to which affiliative and aggressive actions are recommended following social exclusion by strangers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the economic systems on which communities are based shape how their members interact with others and that this, in turn, can shape individuals' responses to social exclusion.

T1  - Sexual Orientation and Fear at Night: Gender Differences Among Sexual Minorities and Heterosexuals
AN  - 1531931094; 201423326
AB  - Using data from the 2000-2010 General Social Survey, a nationally representative sample of 5,086 adults in the United States, the authors examine sexual orientation and gender differences in reports of being afraid to walk alone at night. Results indicate that sexual minorities are significantly more likely to report fear at night than heterosexuals, and women are significantly more likely to report such fear than men. Further, our findings suggest that these sexual orientation and gender differences are due to sexual minority men being more likely than heterosexual men to report fear at night. Thus, the results of this study reveal that three groups-heterosexual women, sexual minority women, and sexual minority men-do not differ from one another in reporting fear, yet these groups are all more likely than heterosexual men to report fear at night. These findings give weight to the importance of investigating the intersection of sexual orientation and gender in individuals' reports of fear. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND ETHNIC MOBILIZATION: U.S. MILITARY DEATHS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
AN  - 1767329101; 201606180
AB  - This study explores the question of proportionality of American military deaths during the Vietnam War in terms of patterns of social stratification and ethnic mobilization. In particular, this study divides the war into two phases according to military goal: a victory phase and a withdrawal phase. Several hypotheses are tested by phase of war and indicate several important findings. First, deaths among draftees increase as the phase of war shifts from an emphasis on victory to an emphasis on withdrawal. Second, death rates among Hispanic draftees are significantly higher than death rates among other ethnic group draftees throughout the course of the whole war. Third, black servicemen die disproportionately to their to their overall death rate for the whole war in the victory phase of the war and Hispanic servicemen die disproportionately to their overall death rate for the whole war in the withdrawal phase of the war. Fourth, black and Hispanic servicemen come from less affluent communities than do white servicemen. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Seeking Equality in Broadcasting: The Case for Third Sector Broadcasting
AN  - 1684424337; 201518528
AB  - Members of groups which are traditionally economically or socially disadvantaged tend to also suffer from additional barriers in relation to their ability to establish and control mass media outlets and from insufficiency of media output which represents them and addresses their specific needs. These inequalities in the field of mass media can help perpetuate and aggravate a situation of marginalization and are especially notable in relation to broadcasting due to the higher barriers of entry associated with the medium. The present article makes a case for the state promotion and support of third sector broadcasting as an affirmative measure which can be used to combat inequalities in broadcasting while discussing its advantages and disadvantages in comparison to alternative measures. The aim is not to negate the need for other ty pes of measures but to ex plain why aiding the development of third sector broadcasting outlets is an option which warrants serious consideration by every state seeking to address situations in which specific groups have been disadvantaged in the field of mass media and broadcasting in specific.

T1  - Guarding Our Borders with Gardasil: Immigrant Women and Physical Autonomy
AN  - 1520336455; 201419678
AB  - The invisibility of immigrant women's health care and justice needs, which are directly related to the triple oppression they face and intersectional identities they hold, is highlighted by the silence surrounding a requirement that they be immunized against cervical cancer with the controversial vaccination, Gardasil. Such a requirement was the unintended consequence of a statutory mandate colliding with an agency recommendation, and it disproportionately burdened women and girls emigrating from Mexico. A quiet and far-reaching coalition used unconventional means to get the policy reversed and opened new ways for scholars to understand potential responses to agency-level injustices for groups marginalized by dominant discourses of public health and immigration.

T1  - Racial/Ethnic Differences in Recent Drug Detoxification Enrollment and the Role of Discrimination and Neighborhood Factors
AN  - 1494748665; 201402016
AB  - Drug detoxification and long-term drug treatment utilization is lower for drug-dependent minorities than Whites. Log-binomial regression was used to assess discrimination and neighborhood-level factors on past 6-month drug treatment utilization among 638 New York City (NYC) drug users between 2006 and 2009. Drug-use discrimination was positively associated with detoxification and long-term treatment. Participants in higher concentrated Black neighborhoods were less likely to attend long-term treatment. Significantly fewer Blacks versus Whites and Hispanics reported drug-use discrimination, which may systematically filter drug users into treatment. More research is needed to understand social forms of discrimination and drug treatment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Let's Beat Up the Poor!
AN  - 1567044365; 201435126
AB  - It is well known that racialized communities experience ongoing, disproportionate levels of poverty. Historically, in the case of Puerto Ricans, their racialization as inferior 'Others' was initially entangled with the racialization of African Americans. Gradually, Puerto Ricans became a newly racialized group different from whites and blacks primarily because they had become an 'underclass.' Gherovici contends that the poor should not be treated contemptuously and that the symptoms that are partly constituted by racism should be attacked, as opposed to the poor who suffer them.

T1  - Latino and Latina Educational Attainment: An Investigation of Bi-Lingual Language Abilities and the Familial Context
AN  - 1567049314; 201435088
AB  - Compared to other ethnic groups in the United States, Latinos have been shown to have lower levels of school performance. Researchers have often pointed to characteristics such as lower family incomes and greater numbers of children as reasons for their lower levels of academic success. Previous studies also suggest that language abilities, particularly English skills, may present barriers for Latino children to perform well in school. Using data from the 2004 Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles survey, this study directly examines the relative impact of family and language characteristics on the school performance and educational attainment of young adult Latinas and Latinos. Overall, females are shown to have higher academic performance and attainment. Family characteristics appear to have a greater impact on females' educational success, whereas males' educational success appears to be more susceptible to the influence of language characteristics, particularly with regard to Spanish language skills.

T1  - Calibrated Ambitions: Low Educational Ambition as a Form of Strategic Adaptation Among Chinese Youth in Spain
AN  - 1494750919; 201402181
AB  - Deemed 'model minorities,' second-generation Chinese-Americans have, on average, high levels of educational attainment and, as a result, they have experienced more upward mobility than other groups. Yet, on the other side of the Atlantic, a strikingly different story about Chinese immigrants and their offspring emerges. Based on analysis of the Longitudinal Study of the Second Generation in Spain, findings from this study show that Chinese youths in Spain have substantially lower educational ambitions and attainment than youths from every other nationality. Met with discrimination at school and in the labor market, yet finding financial success in niche markets as small business owners, I argue that the Chinese in Spain have, at least temporarily, forged an alternative pathway of mobility based on entrepreneurial endeavors rather than educational accomplishments -- a formula passed on from immigrant parents to their offspring. The way Chinese youths in Spain have calibrated their ambition represents a form of strategic adaptation to the barriers put up against immigrant minorities in Spanish society.

AN  - 1463011670; 201345869
AB  - Eurasianism is a popular creed in post-Soviet Russia. Its supporters believe Russia is a unique blend of Slavic and non-Slavic, mostly Muslim Turkic people. With the rise of Russian nationalism, Muslims were transformed into enemies. It has been a different story in Ukraine, where Russians -- 'the old brothers' -- became an alien force and Turkic people an acceptable minority. This trend has held for the last 20 years regardless of all vacillations in Ukrainian political/cultural development. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Relationship Between Multiple Roles and Well-Being among Gay, Lesbian, and Heterosexual Adults
AN  - 1463013116; 201345894
AB  - Previous studies have shown that occupying multiple roles, as a worker, a partner, and a parent, is associated with higher levels of well-being. Yet, because these studies have been based on predominantly heterosexual samples, it is unclear whether this pattern extends to gay men and lesbians or varies by sexual orientation. This study, which uses pooled data from a probability sample of U.S. adults (N = 18,187), begins to fill the void. Results suggest that for sexual minorities as well as heterosexuals, occupying multiple roles is positively associated with well-being; however, the findings suggest that differences exist across gendered sexual orientation groups in both the extent and strength of the associations. There also are differences across these groups in the importance of different role combinations in relation to well-being. Results are discussed in light of traditional role theory and in terms of contextual factors related to sexual orientation. Adapted from the source document.

In this study, we explored whether two types of perceived racial discrimination, perceptions that the healthcare system is racially biased in general (perceived institutional racial discrimination) and perceptions that one has personally encountered racial discrimination while seeking health care (perceived interpersonal racial discrimination), mediated racial differences in patients' trust in physicians. We examined this in a sample of black (N = 127) and white (N = 303) patients being treated in two Veterans Affairs orthopedic clinics for advanced osteoarthritis. Patients completed measures of perceived institutional and interpersonal racial discrimination in health care before meeting with an orthopedic surgeon and a measure of physician trust after the visit. Using a multiple mediator bootstrapping procedure, we tested whether perceived institutional and/or interpersonal racial discrimination mediated the association between race and trust. Compared to whites, blacks reported lower physician trust (M = 4.00 vs. 4.17, Beta = -0.15, 95 % CI = -0.25, -0.05), more perceived institutional racial discrimination (M = 3.13 vs. 2.60, Beta = 0.43, 95 % CI = 0.25, 0.61), and more perceived interpersonal racial discrimination (M = 1.94 vs. 1.21, Beta = 0.60, 95 % CI = 0.47, 0.74). Perceived interpersonal, but not institutional, racial discrimination mediated the race difference in physician trust and accounted for 55 % of the variance. Our finding that lower physician trust among black patients than white patients was explained by perceptions of interpersonal racial discrimination in health care suggests that issues of racial discrimination may need to be addressed in order to foster minority patients' trust in physicians.

T1  - College is a Rich, Han, Urban, Male Club: Research Notes from a Census Survey of Four Tier One Colleges in China
AN  - 1429638741; 201335863
AB  - The opportunity to attend college and earn a degree has increased dramatically in China. However, that does not mean that everyone has an equal opportunity. Historically, there has been well-documented systematic discrimination against minorities, women and the rural poor. The main question of this paper is whether or not this discrimination has persisted since the recent expansion of China's tertiary education system. Using a census of incoming freshmen from four tier one universities, this paper assesses if certain types of students are over-represented while other types of students are under-represented. Comparing the shares of students from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds from our primary survey data with government generated census statistics, we conclude that poor, minority and rural female students are systematically under-represented. In contrast, rich, Han, urban males are dominant in college. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Understanding Latin American Beliefs about Racial Inequality
AN  - 1520336642; 201413522
AB  - Scholars argue that Latin American ideologies of mestizaje, or racial mixing, mask ethnoracial discrimination. We examine popular explanations for indigenous or Afrodescendant disadvantage in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru using the 2010 AmericasBarometer survey. Findings show that numerical majorities across all countries endorse structural-disadvantage explanations and reject victim-blaming stances; in seven of eight countries, they specifically recognize discrimination against ethnoracial minorities. Brazilians most point to structural causes, while Bolivians are least likely to recognize discrimination. While educational status differences tend to be sizable, dominant and minority explanations are similar. Both are comparable to African-American views and contrast with those of U.S. whites.

T1  - 'Weak power': community and identity
AN  - 1322723561; 201310720
AB  - This article considers an experience of Gypsy identity in order to critique the convention that focuses on the benefits of community, while downplaying the inherent tensions between individual expression, freedom and the constraints and limitations of community life. The critique of community will be furthered via an exploration of cultural/ethnic identity formation, looking at self-ascription and intersectionality. Related to this, story telling as a means of transmitting identity and how this relates to 'truth' is also addressed. This analysis will be the basis of a proposal that marginality, via identity, although a powerful space, maintains what Hall (1991) described as 'weak power'; marginality becomes an asset that is gained at the cost of confirming and extending marginality. I will move from the particular identity example (Gypsies) and examine the wider prevalence of 'weak power', looking at how the social construct that is 'community', while propagating solidarity and fraternity, promotes social insularity and forms of discrimination and prejudice.

The present article argues that, while the play demonstrates the significance of American nationalism, the title character, of mixed blood, ironically challenges the traditional racial ideologies that constructed social meanings through biological differences and suggests that the ethnic identity is made through cultural constructs.

T1  - Antiracism and Social Movements in Norway: The Importance of Critical Events
AN  - 1347781653; 201318727
AB  - How can a single event become critical, potentially challenge a dominant discourse and lead to institutional change? In this article we use two recent events in Norway to answer this question. In the first a dark-skinned person was killed by the police; in the second, an ambulance crew refused to take an injured man to hospital for emergency treatment. The term 'critical event' means that certain events can become critical if, through framing, they facilitate a collective consciousness articulated in ways that challenge existing frames of interpretation. In this article we discuss this perspective in relation to the two incidents, and show its analytical value for studying collective action and the possibility of social change.

T1  - Homonegative Microaggressions and Identity in Bisexual Men and Women
AN  - 1322724040; 201310836
AB  - Homonegative microaggressions are small verbal, behavioral, or environmental slights, intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile or derogatory messages toward sexual minorities. This is an exploratory attempt to investigate how bisexual men and women experience these microaggressions, compared to gay men and lesbians. Bisexual men and women were found to experience the microaggression Alien in Own Land and report more identity confusion than gay men or lesbians. Using a hierarchy of four linear regression models, experience of the microaggression Alien in Own Land was found to mediate the relationship between a bisexual orientation and feelings of identity confusion. These results have implications for future research and for clinicians with bisexual clients. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Capital Formation and Diversity: Impacts of Individual and Place-Related Characteristics
AN  - 1551001454; 201429076
AB  - Using structural equation modelling, we assess the degree to which the characteristics of both individuals and the cities in which they live may affect scores on three domains underlying social capital-trust, interaction and membership. We find that diversity, as it relates to both the individual and the city of residence, affects social capital formation. However, the impact of diversity is not necessarily negative. As the proportion of visible minorities in a city increases, the average level of trust decreases, suggesting that, on this dimension at least, increased diversity can have a negative impact on this aspect of social capital formation. However, as contextual or city-level diversity increases, the level of participation in organisations and trust in others increases. This suggests that bridging social capital can increase as diversity increases. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Continuity or regime change in the Netherlands: Consociationalism in a deterritorialized and post-secular world
AN  - 1448996382; 201342818
AB  - In legal and political theory consociational democracy is a neglected model. Even so, consociationalism has many features that make it relevant for the cultural and religious divisions of the 21st century. Consociationalism is a quintessentially Dutch 'regime of toleration'. It was originally developed for the entrenched religious and sociopolitical divisions of the Netherlands in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This traditional segmentation has disappeared and many commentators believe the system has outlived its relevance. The article contends, however, that consociationalism in its generic form of power sharing is still topical and relevant. The revolution in information and communication technology has changed the habitat in which minorities exist. The consociational model can inform ways to deal with the new deterritorialized communities of the globalized world, which seem every bit as autonomous of the nation state as the old religious and sociopolitical segments of Dutch society.

T1  - The Growing Muslim Minority Community in Papua New Guinea
AN  - 1551000555; 201428960
AB  - Since 2001 the Muslim population of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has increased from a modest 479 to over 5000 (approximately 500%) mainly as a result of a spike in conversions to Islam by indigenous Papua New Guineans. The evidence suggests that the recent growth of the Muslim minority in PNG is likely to continue in the future. Nevertheless, for the foreseeable future, Muslims in PNG will remain a small religious minority in a predominantly Christian country. Based on extensive fieldwork undertaken among this growing Muslim minority community in PNG, this paper discusses statistics, patterns and trends of conversion to Islam in a Muslim-minority country that borders Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim majority country. It provides a brief but important empirical contribution to the study of an emerging Muslim minority that appears representative of a broader trend of global Muslim population growth through religious conversion.

T1  - It's a game of give and take: Modeling behavior in a give-or-take-some social dilemma
AN  - 1315601589; 201307334
AB  - We investigate a new give-or-take-some (GOTS) dilemma paradigm that merges traditional give-some and take-some dilemmas. In this hybrid social dilemma, individuals can choose to give or to take resources from a shared resource pool. Previous empirical work by McCarter, Budescu, and Scheffran (2011) found that the composition of the group and the individuals' endowments influenced their tendency to give and/or take. We reanalyze results from two experiments from McCarter, Budescu, et al. (2011) using the new paradigm and propose a simple model of individual behavior based on the players' perceptions of their relative standing in the group and their perception of fair allocations. We also use these data to fit the model at the individual level and use it to provide a general framework for interpreting the group results.

T1  - Understanding and addressing the stigma of mental illness with ethnic minority communities
AN  - 1313192774
AB  - Higher income societies have moved from institutional to community-based care for people experiencing mental illness. However, stigma and discrimination persists and undermines help-seeking, recovery and life chances. This study examines beliefs, stigma and the effectiveness of existing national mental health campaigns with Pakistani, Indian and Chinese heritage communities in Scotland, UK, using community based participatory research. Community organisers were trained and supported to co-facilitate focus groups with 87 people using a range of languages. Whilst diversity within and between communities was apparent, important trends emerged. People with mental illness experience high levels of stigma from communities. Families experience significant associated stigma. This shame combines with culturally inappropriate services to reduce help-seeking from mental health services, friends and families. Existing anti-stigma campaigns have failed to reach or engage with communities due to a combination of practical issues such as the use of inappropriate language, imagery and media, but also due to assuming western medical concepts of illness.

T1  - Multiculturalism and Settlement: The Case of Dutch Postcolonial Migrant Organisations
AN  - 1322723934; 201310727
AB  - This article examines the effects of multiculturalism of the 1980s and 1990s on the organisational patterns of immigrant populations in the Netherlands. This is a controversial topic in this country since politics of multiculturalism have allegedly excessively sponsored migrant organisations causing their 'fragmentation' and having adverse consequences for these organisations' role in the integration process. Based upon a systematic survey of the available data about postcolonial migrant organisations from 1945 to 2008, our conclusion is that the growth in postcolonial migrant organisations from the 1980s onwards has been impressive. For this specific category of immigrants, there is, however, little in the way of evidence that links this growth, or fragmentation of the landscape of migrant organisations for that matter, to Dutch multicultural minorities policies. Much of the growth should be related to the global phenomena of emerging identity discourses and increasing levels of identity politics. The policy implication is that, at least for the Netherlands, government policies creating favourable conditions for migrant organisations have been discarded without proper justification as counterproductive.

T1  - Accentuate the Positive: Americanos and the Articulation of Latina/o Life in the United States
AN  - 1266143788; 201300355
AB  - At the turn of the century, data from the 2000 U.S. Census announced an emergent population of 35 million Latina/os, and focused the attention of journalists, media producers, politicians, and marketing demographers on Latina/o individuals and Latinidad as a coherent structure of feeling that might unite a disparate group who share a common ancestry. Since then, Latina/os have garnered an extraordinary amount of attention from cultural producers and audiences alike. This essay conducts a dual analysis of the textual and extratextual features of Americanos: Latino Life in the United States/La Vida Latina en Los Estados Unidos, a coproduction of Olmos Productions, Time Warner, and the Smithsonian Institution, that presents a generous vision of both Latina/os and America. While Americanos does indeed display affirmative representations of Latina/o life, the conditions of its production yield a text that adheres to the dominant ideologies of multiculturalism and the American Dream. By articulating Latinidad without oppositional politics, Americanos cannot fully address the relations of power that define both lived experience of Latinidad and minority representation in the United States.

T1  - Disability Status Differentials Among Asian Immigrants in the United States: The Added Dimensions of Duration and Age
AN  - 1494750506; 201402132
AB  - The healthy immigrant and erosion effects are widely cited observations for immigrants' health patterns in the United States. Yet, these effects are not always found in empirical studies. We examined both effects among Asians using the 2000 Census Public Microdata Sample. We examined six disability outcomes: sensory, physical, mental, mobility, work and self-care. We also investigated the moderating effect of age on years in the United States. We found substantial variation in disability status across our 13 Asian ethnic groups. Support for the healthy immigrant and erosion effects differed across the disability outcomes. For physical, sensory and mental disabilities, the healthy immigrant and erosion effects were displayed at younger ages. For work and mobility disabilities, younger immigrants displayed a higher prevalence for these outcomes than their US-born counterparts, but this pattern reversed at older ages. Self-care disability did not show any duration differences. Age also appears to be an important moderator of the healthy immigrant and erosion effects. Cohorts and question wording may also be important alternative explanations to immigrant health patterns. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - European organizations and minority rights in Europe: On transforming the securitization dynamic
AN  - 1438553947; 201340218
AB  - Minority rights conditionality has been seen by scholars as a key part of the EU enlargement process. While the focus on minority rights has largely been discussed in terms of democracy and even human rights, this article argues that conditionality was a result of the securitization of minorities rather than part of an agenda to protect or empower. In this article, we look at the methods of desecuritization as factors of 'narratives, norms and nannies'. In response to Paul Roe's conclusions about the impossibility of desecuritizing societal security, we examine whether the EU, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe have the ability to change the societal dynamics among ethnic groups in such a way as to make the desecuritization of societal security more likely. Overall, we illustrate how a focus on 'deconstructivist' and 'constructivist' approaches to societal security has failed to make European organizations important transformative actors in interethnic relations.

T1  - Do Survey Data Estimate Earnings Inequality Correctly?: Measurement Errors Among Black and White Male Workers
AN  - 1315600374; 201307602
AB  - Few studies have considered how earnings inequality estimates may be affected by measurement error in self-reported earnings in surveys. Utilizing restricted-use data that links workers in the Survey of Income and Program Participation with their W-2 earnings records, we examine the effect of measurement error on estimates of racial earnings inequality. Results show that varying levels of mean-reverting error causes underestimation of earnings inequality. Notably, mean reversion is steeper for Black men than for White men, bringing about substantial downward bias in the estimated earnings gaps between Whites and Blacks at lower percentiles as well as large underestimation of within-racial group inequality for Black men. Together, our results call attention to the potential distortions generated by systematic measurement error on economic inequality estimates. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Disparities and Implicit Bias: A Commentary
AN  - 1125223749; 201240401
AB  - Despite changing societal norms that are less tolerant of overt discrimination, demonstrable disparities between racial and gender groups remain. The contributors to this impressive special issue document and offer explanations for these disparities in employment and professional contexts, and with regard to disparate outcomes associated with the legal system, and in medical and health care contexts. In our commentary, we examine these aggregate-level disparities and the individual-level explanatory accounts proposed for their existence. The evidence that these papers present is often enough to rule out alternative explanatory accounts, and implicit bias remains a viable account for disparities that, to varying degrees, fit with the available data and the claim that implicit biases are contributing to an understanding of ongoing real-world disparities. As such, we believe that implicit bias research will continue to play a crucial role in understanding and hopefully reducing these aggregate-level disparities in employment, legal, and health care domains.

T1  - Green multiculturalism: articulations of ethnic and environmental politics in a Colombian 'black community'
AN  - 1315603024; 201307513
AB  - This paper analyzes the intersection of two parallel developments that have had a curious impact on agrarian politics in Colombia: on the one hand, attempts to appropriate land for 'green' ends such as biofuel production, which have become ubiquitous all across Latin America, and on the other, the implementation of multicultural reforms, which in Colombia resulted in the collective titling of more than five million hectares of land for 'black communities'. Although these two developments can be read as contradictory -- with 'green grabs' threatening ethnic groups' territorial rights and multicultural reforms purportedly safeguarding them -- I argue that, together, they produce a unique political articulation which I term 'green multiculturalism'. My analysis of oil-palm cultivation in a 'black community' in southwestern Colombia reveals three interrelated consequences. First, I suggest that green multiculturalism produces 'black communities' as 'green' collective subjects charged not only with being wardens of nature, but also bearers of the responsibility to right environmental wrongs. Second, I note that the agrarian practices associated with oil-palm cultivation act as disciplining technologies that seek to transform local rationalities into entrepreneurial ones. Finally, I contend that these initiatives are 'landscaping projects' that seek to transform forms of interspecies relating. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES OF MINORITIES IN CONTEMPORARY INDIA: A CONCISE ANALYSIS
AN  - 1283641412; 201303323
AB  - India continues to confront human rights problems with respect to minorities, who in the context of this study are Dalits. They are generally members of the Scheduled castes and "assimilated" Scheduled tribes; they constituted 24.4% of the national population in the 2001 census (out of approximately 1 billion). Caste classification creates amongst its citizens social strata in the country. And, this social schema determines a group's status in the socioeconomic configuration of the society. Due to the peculiar features of this system, the institution has attracted many scholars to its study. Notwithstanding the extensive scholarship on the topic, we do not have a clear explanation of the term in part because of the complexity of its practice. This study is not on the caste system per se; it is on the nature of the breaches of the human rights of minorities, generally exacerbated by the character of the caste structure, that this essay seeks to address. Accordingly, we shall proceed with the discourses around the following themes: 1. Situate the study within a brief theoretical framework of human rights, minorities globally and constitution; 2. Briefly discuss the cultural and historical reasons for the discrimination against the Dalits; 3. Examine relevant provisions of the national constitution, international human rights instruments and the human rights of minorities in the society; 4. Summarize a case study from a fieldwork conducted in the English Bazar municipalities of Malda district in West Bengal on some human rights issues; and 5. Conclude on ways that might advance the amelioration of the infractions of the human rights of minorities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Integration and religiosity among the Turkish second generation in Europe: a comparative analysis across four capital cities
AN  - 1037875956; 201231059
AB  - Drawing on recent cross-national surveys of the Turkish second generation, we test hypotheses of secularization and of religious vitality for Muslim minorities in Europe. Secularization predicts an inverse relationship between structural integration and religiosity, such that the Turkish second generation would be less religious with higher levels of educational attainment and intermarriage. The religious vitality hypothesis predicts the maintenance of religion in the second generation, highlighting the role of religious socialization within immigrant families and communities. Taking a comparative approach, these hypotheses are tested in the context of different national approaches to the institutionalization of Islam as a minority religion in four European capital cities: Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels and Stockholm. Across contexts, religious socialization strongly predicts second-generation religiosity, in line with religious vitality. The secularization hypothesis finds support only among the second generation in Berlin, however, where Islam is least accommodated. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Symbolic Equality: Law and National Symbols in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1283642635; 201303452
AB  - The way in which the law regulates the display of national symbols has important consequences for minority national groups. If the majority is allowed to monopolise the official display of national symbols, members of the minority may be further alienated and discouraged from participating in public life. In contrast, a more even-handed approach to national symbols has the potential to foster an inclusive and pluri-national public culture. This article evaluates the regulation of national symbols in Northern Ireland. It contrasts the relative success of legislation regulating the display of symbols in the workplace with the latest equality litigation under Northern Ireland's Good Friday Agreement of 1998 ('the Agreement'). With respect to the latter, it is argued that the case-law suffers from a general failure to appreciate the implications of the Agreement for the display of national symbols. The article goes on to explain how equality with respect to the display of national symbols -- or 'symbolic equality' -- should be understood as an extension of the Agreement's commitment to the more general principle of 'parity of esteem'.

T1  - Conceptualizing Professional Diaspora: International Medical Graduates in Canada
AN  - 1037883421; 201231153
AB  - This paper applies the concept of diaspora to the analysis of the creation and maintenance of an ethnically diverse community of internationally educated medical graduates residing in Canada. Traditionally, the research on diaspora concerns ethnic communities that preserve their homeland ties while residing in foreign countries. We suggest, however, that ethnic roots are not imperative for the analysis of diasporic communities when other forms of shared values and meanings can become a basis for creation of collective identity. Reconfiguring both the homeland and host country as places of geographical and professional belonging provides opportunity to conceptualize an ethnically diverse group of immigrant physicians residing in Canada as professional diaspora. Probing the interviews with 67 international medical graduates living in Canada, we demonstrate (1) how they create medical diaspora, (2) what myths and sensitivities they share in constructing their professional and/or geographic homelands, and (3) the relationship they develop with their hosting society. We suggest that in spite of the increasing mobility of internationally educated health care providers, the analysis of professional diasporas could become a useful tool for analyzing complex relationships between home countries, hosting countries, and international travelers.

T1  - Immigrant China
AN  - 1023025721; 201223946
AB  - This article tackles a new phenomenon that will have profound consequences for the future of the international migration order: international migration to the People's Republic of China. For decades, China has had large numbers of foreign students, expatriates, returned overseas Chinese, and ethnic Chinese refugees. However, in the past few years, immigration to China has become much more diverse and numerous. Chinese students and scholars abroad return to China in ever greater numbers. Traders and labor migrants from all over the world are attracted by China's trading opportunities, political stability, and prosperity. Middle-class Koreans, Taiwanese, and Southeast Asians are looking for cheaper living costs and better jobs. European, North American, and Australian university graduates travel to China for employment or to start a business. This article asks to what extent government policy making and the formation of immigrant groups and ethnic relations are informed by unique features of China's late socialist society and government, or alternatively, to what extent they follow patterns similar to established developed immigrant countries in Asia, Europe, and North America.

T1  - Beyond Coethnic Boundaries: Coethnic Residential Context, Communication, and Asian Americans' Political Participation
AN  - 964189276; 201208184
AB  - This study examines when and where residential context and communicative factors help and hurt Asian Americans' political participation both within and beyond coethnic boundaries. Using multilevel analyses, this paper found that living in ethnically homogeneous residential areas and using ethnic media increase Asian-related political awareness. However, these coethnic features in their communicative structure did not directly bridge Asian communities to the political participation. Instead, coethnic features indirectly galvanize Asian Americans' political participation, which may spill over to more general domains of political participation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Categorization and Communication in the Face of Prejudice: When Describing Perceptions Changes What Is Perceived
AN  - 925714254; 201204087
AB  - In the face of prejudice against an ingroup, common ground for communication exists when people use similar social categories to understand the situation. Three studies tested the hypothesis that describing perceptions of prejudice can fundamentally change those perceptions because communicators account for the common ground in line with conversational norms. When women (Study 1), African Americans (Study 2), and Americans (Study 3) simply thought about suspected prejudice against their ingroup, categorization guided their perceptions: Participants assimilated their views of the prejudiced event toward the perceptions of ingroup members but contrasted away from the perceptions of outgroup members. Conversely, when participants described their perceptions, they contrasted away from the given category information and actually arrived at the opposite perceptions as those who merely thought about the prejudiced event. Study 3 identified an important qualification of these effects by showing that they were obtained only when participants could assume their audience was familiar with the common ground. Implications are discussed for understanding the role of communication in facilitating and inhibiting collective action about prejudice. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

AB  - Research on Muslim minorities in Europe has focused on Muslim organizations. This is understandable as most organizations are uncomplicated objects of study: they provide members for interviews and locations for participant observation. But many Muslims are not engaged in Muslim organizations. How do we research them? Drawing on the experiences from a study on highly practising, but non-organized Muslims in Aarhus, Denmark, this paper will discuss the usefulness of focus group interviews in studying the world views of non-organized Muslims.

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 1417524805; 201332225
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Predicting Earnings Among Immigrants To Canada: The Role Of Source Country
AN  - 964189979; 201207483
AB  - The current study examines the importance of country of origin in predicting the labour market earnings among recent immigrants to Canada. The authors argue that, in addition to individual-level characteristics associated with immigrant capital, macro-level features associated with immigrant origins must be taken into account when considering the economic performance of immigrants in their host country. Country-level factors are said to accompany immigrants to their destination country, which generate disparities in the "quality" of immigrants' human and social capital across origin groups, as well as differences in how they are received by the resident population. The present study uses random effects multilevel modelling to investigate the extent to which immigrant incomes vary randomly across source country while taking into consideration individual-level characteristics selected on the basis of human capital, social capital, and discrimination theories. Multilevel regression analysis confirms that immigrant incomes indeed vary significantly by country of origin, though the effect is small. Furthermore, it is revealed that the gross domestic product (GDP) of the sending country explains much of the level 2 variability in the labour market earnings of recent immigrants, as well as the relationship between racial minority status and immigrant incomes. The practical significance and policy implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Electronic media and popular discourse on Russian nationalism
AN  - 919904080; 201202454
AB  - This article analyzes electronic letters to the editor on the coverage of the riot in Kondopoga (2006) and the bombings in the Moscow subway (2010). Letters to electronic media are used for the first time as a source for popular opinion on nationalism and ethnic conflicts in Russia. The first argument of this study is methodological: a comparison between the polls and the letters suggests that letters to electronic media represent public opinion on nationalism even though Internet users still constitute a minority of Russian citizens. This study also claims that the letters under examination indicate a move from extreme nationalism to so called "banal nationalism," the term coined by Michael Billig, during the period between 2006 and 2010. Finally, the article argues that the concept of the civic nation is not yet well understood or accepted by Russian citizens. Although this concept, expressed in Russian by the newly coined word rossiane, became somewhat more popular in 2010 than it had been in 2006, the ethnic understanding of Russian still prevails. The basis for the new identity rossiane, as it is presented in the letters, lacks common memories, myths and traditions that would resonate strongly in popular imagination.

T1  - Political Participation Among Latinos in the United States: The Effect of Group Identity and Consciousness
AN  - 902083216; 201122332
AB  - Objective: How do group identity and consciousness affect Latinos' political participation in the United States? Recent studies that examine this relationship generally focus on a single ethnic group, for example, Mexicans, or the panethnic group, Latino/Hispanic, which limits the scope of their results. This study investigates how group identity and consciousness affect the political participation of differently identified Latinos. Methods: Using the unique 2007 Latino National Survey (LNS), a telephone survey of 8,500 Latino respondents, I investigate how group identity and consciousness affect political participation, as measured by electoral and nonelectoral activities. Results: Findings suggest that Latinos who self-identify as American are more likely to engage in political action; however, a sense of group consciousness among ethnic, panethnic, and racial-identified Latinos alters this effect. Conclusion: The type of and extent to which Latinos engage in political action is contingent on primary self-identity and specific aspects of group consciousness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Que Es Racismo? Awareness of Racism and Discrimination in Ecuador
AN  - 896182022; 201120105
AB  - In the national consciousness, Ecuador is a mestizo nation. However, it is also an ethnically diverse nation with sizable minorities of indigenous and Afro-descended peoples. In national surveys, there is also a considerable minority who self-identify as blanco (white). Although there is strong evidence of continuing discrimination and prejudice toward both indigenous and Afro-descended peoples, there is little public discussion or political action addressing such issues. The emergence of a powerful and resilient indigenous movement in the late 1980s gained international interest and acclaim in the 1990s, in part because of the peaceful mobilization efforts and effective bargaining tactics of the movement. However, indigenous leaders usually have not engaged in a discourse of racismo and/or discriminacion. There has been much less social movement solidarity and activism among Afro-Ecuadorians, but their leaders commonly employ a discourse of racismo and discriminacion. In August and September 2004, a survey of more than eight thousand adult Ecuadorians was conducted in regard to racism and related topics. In this research, we use several measures from this survey that focus on awareness of and sensitivity to issues of racism, prejudice, and discrimination. Self-identification respondents enables us to contrast the responses of whites, mestizos, Indians, and Afro-Ecuadorians to the measures. Other independent variables of interest are level of education, the region in which the respondent resides, and whether the respondent lives in an urban or rural area. Regression results show differences among the ethnic groups in levels of awareness of racism, but more powerful predictors are level of education and rural residence.

T1  - Racial and Ethnic Differences in Women's Marriage, Household Composition and Class Status: 1980-2008
AN  - 887499957; 201118149
AB  - The gender literature has demonstrated that marriage is an important economic context for and predictor of women's class status; however, with regard to this finding, the literature has paid less attention to racial/ethnic differences among women. This paper raises important questions about the presumption of marriage as a route to the middle class for all women. Using 1980, 1990, and 2000 IPUMS and 2008 ACS data for Asians, blacks, Hispanics, Whites we derive a middle class index (MCi) based on education, homeownership, per person income, and occupational prestige factors. By 2008, all groups have increased their share of SALA households, but black female SALA middle-class households comprise the highest percentage of their middle-class than do the other racial/ethnic groups. We also construct synthetic cohorts to determine if these women are simply marrying later and find that more SALA middle-class households are maintaining their status over time, but that again, this trend is most pronounced for black women.

T1  - Interethnic relations in Northern Iraq: Brokerage, social capital and the potential for reconciliation
AN  - 881460755; 201116448
AB  - Ethnic relations in Iraq have been strained since the collapse of the Baath regime in 2003. Looking specifically at Kirkuk in northern Iraq, ethnic relations have been particularly uncooperative and violent. At the surface level, it is difficult to imagine interethnic reconciliation. The main conflict in the city, between Kurds and (settled) Arabs, goes back several decades. However, in this article it is argued that the situation is not necessary hopeless. Although ethnic groups in Kirkuk are largely separated by mutual distrust, they do not constitute entirely decoupled catnets. Despite residential segregation, there exists considerable room for social meetings across ethnic boundaries. Workplaces and, to some extent, voluntary organizations provide ethnically heterogeneous interaction spaces where interethnic brokerage may evolve. Many of these organizations are structurally constrained, making it likely that people will establish contacts with others sharing the same interaction space. In such settings, casual contacts have a potential to develop into true acquaintance contacts and, thus, into interethnic social capital.

T1  - Economic Dynamics and Changes in Attitudes Toward Undocumented Mexican Immigrants in Arizona
AN  - 1030869555; 201230123
AB  - Mexican immigration to the United States comprises an important social issue in contemporary public policy debate, particularly given the recent passage of Arizona's Senate Bill 1070 (SB 1070). The current study investigated how individuals' sentiments toward undocumented Mexican immigrants shifted between 2006 and 2009 in Arizona, and also examined economic concomitants to these shifts. Participants included 3,195 culturally diverse students attending a state university in Arizona. They reported their attitudes toward undocumented Mexican immigrants regarding housing, employment, values, social welfare, citizenship, health care, and education issues. Results show less-positive attitudes as each year progressed among European and Latino Americans, as well as other ethnic minorities. Further, anti-undocumented immigrant sentiment increased as unemployment increased and gross domestic product real growth rate decreased. Ethnic differences emerged in the relative negativity toward undocumented immigrants such that European Americans were less positive towards undocumented Mexican immigrants than Latinos over 4 years. These findings suggest that economic dynamics may beget anti-immigrant sentiment, leading to contentious legislation, such as Arizona's recent immigration law. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Today, We Are All Ahmadi': Configurations of Heretic Otherness between Lahore and Berlin
AN  - 881461977; 201116433
AB  - The Ahmadis are widely regarded as heterodox in Pakistan, where they have moved after the Partition of British India in 1947, and where they have later been declared by the state as being 'non-Muslim'. Faced with violence and discrimination on a regular basis, they have migrated in large numbers to Europe, including Germany. There, they are free to continue their religious practice, but at the same time have been treated with hostility as they become part of central city life. Faced with suspicion both at home and now in Europe, this article explores the double sense of heterodoxy which the Ahmadis now face, and explores the complex reactions, including media campaigns to which they have given rise in Germany.

T1  - The post-colonial state and minorities: ethnocide in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh
AN  - 754040127; 201050656
AB  - This paper argues that ethnocide in post-colonial states can be located in the interplay of three processes: (1) nation-building and development visions of the bureaucratic state; (2) the struggle for autonomy by the minorities; and (3) militarised pursuit of national security agenda by the bureaucratic state. The bureaucratic, political, economic, cultural and military penetration of the state into the territories of the indigenous communities often results in the marginalisation of those communities and destruction of their cultures and identity. It leads to demand for autonomy by the minorities. The state reacts to the struggle for autonomy by pursuing a militarised security agenda. Ethnocide in the post-colonial state occurs against the vortex of these processes. The Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh is an interesting case of ethnocide in the above context.
