T1  - The development and validation of a multidimensional scale of perceived Latino threat
AN  - 2658419133
AB  - Perceived threat is a central feature of theories of intergroup behaviour, such as the minority threat perspective. Studies have linked perceptions of Latinos as threatening the interests of Whites to Whites’ support for more punitive policies in the U.S., especially in areas experiencing a recent growth in the Latino population. This research, however, is limited in that researchers rarely measure perceptions of Latino threat directly and have yet to expand on the limitations of existing measures. To this end, this study was designed to develop a 20-item Perceived Latino Threat Scale (PLTS) and assess its association with relevant external criteria, including several vehicles for the social control of Latinos. The scale was administered to students attending a Southwestern university during the Republican Party presidential primaries (Study 1: N = 332) and just prior to the 2016 election (Study 2: N = 259). Bifactor analyses indicated that perceptions of Latino threat can be subdivided into four dimensions: economic, political, criminal, and opportunity threat. Higher perceptions of Latino threat, especially economic threat, were associated with support for Donald Trump, being a Republican and politically conservative, and harbouring punitive attitudes toward crime and border control. Implications for theory and research are discussed.

T1  - Exploring the effectiveness of school-proximity residency restrictions for sex offenders
AN  - 2625409370
AB  - Since the early 1990s, federal and state legislation restricting the residency options of convicted sex offenders has been justified on the basis of protecting vulnerable populations while deterring future criminal opportunities. While many of these policies maintain public support, recent empirical inquiries have begun to question their effectiveness and appropriateness. Using data from registered sex offenders’ residences in three mid-western states, we explore the effect residency restriction laws have on preventing sex offenders from residing within proximal distance to elementary schools. Preliminary results indicate that sex offenders on average do not reside significantly closer or farther away from elementary schools in states with different proximal distance requirements, but that sex offenders reside significantly closer to elementary schools in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status. We conclude that residency restriction policies for sex offenders should be reconsidered in light of these results.

T1  - Concealability beliefs facilitate navigating intergroup contexts
AN  - 2464643588
AB  - Living in a diverse world requires the ability to navigate intergroup contexts. However, interacting with outgroup members can cause anxiety that leads to lower‐quality interactions and avoidance of future contact. One reason people experience this anxiety is the concern that others will judge them on the basis of an identity. These concerns may be reduced among people who believe the identity is unperceivable by others. The belief that one's identity is concealable may therefore reduce intergroup anxiety and ease people's experiences in intergroup contexts. The present work tests this proposition in two studies and finds that individual differences in concealability beliefs are negatively associated with intergroup anxiety and positively associated with the propensity to initiate intergroup contact and with the quantity and quality of people's cross‐group friendships. Materials, data, and code for both studies and a pre‐registration for Study 2 are available online (https://osf.io/4cjhg/).

T1  - Perceiving demographic diversity as a threat: Divergent effects of multiculturalism and polyculturalism: GPIR
AN  - 2451091565
AB  - The growing racial/ethnic diversity in the United States can be perceived as threatening to White Americans. The present work examines how interethnic ideologies—different ways of framing ethnic diversity—moderate perceptions of threat and political conservatism among White Americans exposed to a passage about the US becoming a “majority-minority” nation. Across 3 studies, we found divergent effects of multiculturalism and polyculturalism within the context of growing diversity. Priming multiculturalism increased perceived threats to the ingroup’s power and status, which in turn led to greater endorsement of conservative political views (Studies 1 and 3) and warmer feelings toward a conservative political figure (i.e., Donald Trump; Studies 2 and 3); however, these relationships were attenuated and sometimes reversed among participants primed with polyculturalism. We discuss implications for how interethnic ideologies influence White Americans’ threatened responses to increasing diversity.

T1  - LGBTQ+ Latino/a Young People’s Interpretations of Stigma and Mental Health: An Intersectional Minority Stress Perspective
AN  - 2429062666
AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ+) young people of color encounter interlocking systems of social prejudice and discrimination. However, little is understood about how subjective meanings of perceived structural stigma associated with multiple marginalized social statuses influence mental health. We document how perceived stigma can shape mental health inequalities among multiply marginalized individuals if they also encounter stigmatizing societal frameworks. Data come from in-depth interviews with 41 LGBTQ+ Latino/a young adults in the Rio Grande Valley collected from 2016 to 2017. Utilizing an intersectional minority stress framework, we qualitatively examine how young people conceptualize structural stigma, their multiple social locations (e.g., sexuality, gender, race/ethnicity, age), and their mental health. Findings highlight how LGBTQ+ Latino/a young adults experience structural racism, gender policing, and anti-LGBTQ+ religious messages in relation to their mental health. This study showcases the importance of an intersectional minority stress framework for documenting processes that can shape mental health inequalities.

T1  - An experimental approach to Intergroup Threat Theory: Manipulations, moderators, and consequences of realistic vs. symbolic threat
AN  - 2153888462
AB  - According to Intergroup Threat Theory (Stephan, Ybarra, & Rios, 2015), perceived threats from outgroups can be categorised into realistic threats (to the ingroup's power, resources, or well-being) and symbolic threats (to the ingroup's values, identity, or way of life). Although many studies have documented correlations between such threats and intergroup attitudes, experimental and quasiexperimental tests of Intergroup Threat Theory are relatively sparse. In the present article, we review our own and others' research on manipulations, moderators, and consequences of realistic and symbolic threat, with close attention to the ways in which these threats are similar vs. different. Given the growing racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity in the Western world, understanding how and under what conditions each type of threat can be causally induced is critical to reducing threat and ultimately improving intergroup harmony.

T1  - The legitimacy of elite gatekeeping
AN  - 1930436459
AB  - Natasha Warikoo's study of how students at Harvard, Brown, and Oxford Universities view race and fairness highlights the vast differences between the U.S. and Britain with respect to perceptions of meritocracy by these winners in the competition for places in elite institutions. The strict enforcement of uniform standards for admission is seen as critical and legitimate at Oxford, whereas a more holistic approach in the U.S. - one that sees racial diversity as an important and desirable part of the institution's culture and identity - is seen as critical to a "diversity bargain". I question the sources of students' ideas about race and the diversity bargain, suggesting that they may be rooted more in their pre-college experiences than in their life at university. I also raise questions about whether and how an admissions lottery would work to address some of Warikoo's concerns.

T1  - Achieving ethnic authenticity through 'return' visits to Vietnam: paradoxes of class and gender among the British-born Vietnamese
AN  - 1878812048
AB  - The Vietnamese in Britain are a small and less visible community who remain largely unrecognised in wider society. For those born in Britain, constructing a Vietnamese identity and a sense of ethnic belonging is often rendered problematic due to a lack of inclusion in, and identification with, their local Vietnamese community. Instead, 'return' visits to Vietnam occupy a particularly important space in their narratives of ethnic authentification. Drawing upon the literature on migrant-homeland relations, this paper highlights the importance of divisions of gender, class and migration trajectories in understanding patterns of transnational participation and engagement among Vietnamese migrants. It is argued that British-born Vietnamese women are more likely to engage actively in their 'return' visits and make personal and emotional investments compared to their male counterparts whose visits remain largely symbolic. These differences are shaped by social class configurations and gender expectations both in Britain and Vietnam. However, while 'return' visits provide more effective ethnic authentification strategies for women than men who experience a more compromised masculine status and negative experiences in the 'homeland', paradoxically their class differences with the majority of the population weakens and questions this authenticity leading to an 'arrested' achievement of ethnic authenticity.

T1  - Positionings of the black middle-classes: understanding identity construction beyond strategic assimilation
AN  - 1877540835
AB  - This paper explores the identities of Britain's black middle-classes. Drawing upon interviews with seventy-two participants, I theorize a 'triangle of identity'. This triangle emphasizes how black middle-class identities are constructed within the dynamics of three poles. Firstly, there is the class-minded pole whereby class comes to the fore as a conceptual scheme; secondly, there is the ethnoracial autonomous pole whereby 'race' is central to one's identity and whiteness is actively resisted; and lastly there is the strategic assimilation pole, where one continually moves between classed and racialized spheres of action. This tripartite approach to identity builds upon previous research by further exploring the social, cultural and phenomenological distinctions within Britain's black middle-classes.

T1  - Making sense of race/ethnicity and gender in televised football: reception research among British students
AN  - 1875839351
AB  - Most people today watch football by way of the mass media, sites that reproduce and transform ideologies and ideas surrounding racial/ethnic and gender identity. However, still little remains known as to what extent actual football viewers take up or resist these ideas. Drawing on a cultural studies perspective, this study tries to identify the dominant discourses that British television viewers use to assign meaning to race/ethnicity and gender in men's and women's football on television. Eleven focus groups of British students (n = 44) were utilized to explore these discourses. Our findings indicate that viewers from various ethnic backgrounds were largely compliant with the hegemonic media discourses about natural physicality in both gender and race/ethnic comparisons. At the same time, multiple negotiated/oppositional discourses were found in relation to women's football that showed how other social practices contributed to such readings. Limitations and possible areas for future research are discussed.

T1  - Strangers within? Russian-speakers' migration from Latvia to London: a study in power geometry and intersectionality
AN  - 1869136144
AB  - This paper seeks to contribute to debates on ethnic identification and migration through a focus on a specific group - Russian-speakers from the Baltic state of Latvia who have migrated to the UK. Twenty-six interviews with members of this group were gathered in London and the wider metropolitan area during 2012 and 2014. Russian-speakers represent uniquely combined configurations of 'the other within': in most cases, they are EU citizens with full rights; yet, some still hold non-citizens' passports of Latvia. While in Latvian politics Russian-speakers are framed as 'others' whose identities are shaped by the influence of Russia, interview findings confirm that they do not display belonging to contemporary Russia. However, London is the 'third space' - a multicultural European metropolis - which provides new opportunities for negotiating ethnic identification. Against the background of triple 'alienation' (from Latvia, from Russia and from the UK), we analyse how ethnicity is narrated intersectionally with other categories such as age and class. The findings show that Russian-speaking migrants from Latvia mobilise their Europeanness and Russianness beyond alienating notions of (ethno)national identity. The paper also demonstrates that being open to ethnicity as a category of practice helps us towards a progressive conceptualisation of often overlooked dimensions of integration of intra-EU linguistic 'others'.

T1  - Embodying Métissage: Entangling Memory, Identity and Difference in Feminist Intercultural Storymaking
AN  - 1922920888
AB  - This paper attempts to unpack some of the dominant understandings of memory, identity and difference in intercultural lifewriting. The paper draws from my research in embodied lifewriting and narratives of resistance in marginalised women's lives, and the works of Trinh T. Minh-ha and Karen Barad to unpack, unsettle and reconceptualise the notions of memory, identity, hybridity and difference in intercultural lifewriting. I am particularly interested in how the métissage of embodied, mythological and diffractive narratives function as an important feminist research methodology. The paper is framed within contemporary materialist feminist thinking and gestures towards an ontological and epistemological shift in the reconceptualisation of identity and difference that underpins how we craft and read intercultural lifewriting. Implicit in the hybridised process of storymaking is the interweaving of memory, imagination, identity, gender, race, history and culture. Memory, in this sense, becomes a loose and messy network of multiple strands that continually interweave, thread and hold the tapestry of storytelling and storymaking together. If personal stories are to be powerful tools for agency and resistance through the re-scripting of dominant cultural themes and identities, then we need to examine the many different ways a story can be told and retold.

T1  - Supporting the democratic political organisation of Muslim immigrants: the perspective of Muslims in the Netherlands and Germany
AN  - 1855096743
AB  - Using data from three survey studies, this paper examines the support for the democratic political organisation of Muslims among Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and Germany (Study 3). Using a social psychological perspective, support is examined in relation to religious group identification, Muslim linked fate, perceived discrimination, fundamentalist religious belief, and host national identification. The findings in all three studies show support for the political organisation of Muslims. Furthermore, higher religious group identification and higher linked fate were associated with stronger support. More discrimination and more fundamentalist beliefs were also associated with stronger support, and part of these associations was mediated by linked fate. National identification was not associated with support for the political organisation of Muslims.

T1  - Identities beyond ethnic-based subordination or conflict in the Southeast Asian borderlands: a case study of Lao villagers in northeast Cambodia
AN  - 1832906757
AB  - This paper explores everyday expressions of identity by Lao villagers living in northeast Cambodia near the border with Laos, and uses this to reflect on trends in studies of identity in the remote borderlands of Southeast Asia. I argue that while ethnicity is certainly crucial, discipline-specific emphases - ethnic-based subordination or conflict for social studies and political studies, respectively - result in less attention to other important dynamics shaping identity. Furthermore, I suggest that low-profile case studies not strongly linked to ethnic-based subordination or conflict - such as the Lao in Cambodia - require study for a more comprehensive view of identity in the borderlands. The case study from northeast Cambodia identifies four key dynamics shaping identity: inter-state relations, ethno-national identities, cross-border livelihoods and social status. I show how minimal inter-state tensions and varied personal connections to Laos were important in facilitating villagers' involvement in lucrative illegal cross-border logging in Laos, but the latter were never used to justify this practice. Instead in this everyday setting, villagers emphasised their sense of marginalisation within Cambodia and thus demonstrate their regular prioritisation of status.

AB  - This article documents the first decades of the work of the Aboriginal Protection Board in Victoria, Australia in the mid-nineteenth century, as it oversees the establishment of mission stations to gather up Aboriginal peoples and provide protection from settler violence. It augments existing accounts of white settler governance of Aboriginal peoples by examining the social and historical conditions for the emergence of separations and distinctions between Aboriginal peoples through shifting governmental versions of the 'Aboriginal problem'. The production of race-based categories of persons is highlighted in the State's management of the Aboriginal children through the mission systems and their effects on Aboriginal ties to community and identity.

T1  - The Benefits of in-betweenness: return migration of second-generation Chinese American professionals to China
AN  - 1814221841
AB  - In an era of growing transnational practices, this paper considers the trend of second-generation Chinese Americans who have 'returned' to the People's Republic of China (PRC) to work. Previous studies of return migration to China have focused on issues of ethnic and racial identity that arise during temporary homeland trips undertaken by those seeking to connect with ancestral and cultural origins. Accordingly, most research has highlighted the sense of cultural 'in-betweenness' experienced by Chinese Americans whose travels in the ancestral homeland bring an uncomfortable realisation that they are considered neither fully Chinese nor fully American. By contrast, my in-depth interviews with 52 second-generation Chinese American professionals in Beijing and Shanghai suggest that this liminality can be particularly useful in the workplace. I argue that first-world Chinese co-ethnics who work on a long-term basis in the PRC can uniquely leverage Western training with their assumed knowledge of Chinese culture to create personal economic advantage: a practice that I refer to as 'strategic in-betweenness'. Nonetheless, while participants described distinct career-related benefits to being Chinese American in the PRC, they also feared they would soon be replaced by high-skilled, Western-educated Chinese natives who are moving back to their home country in large numbers.

T1  - The legitimizing role of accent on discrimination against immigrants
AN  - 1833134649
AB  - This article analyses the influence of accent on discrimination against immigrants by examining the hypothesis that accent leads to discrimination only in more prejudiced individuals, merely because people speaking with a native accent are perceived to be better qualified than those whose accent is non-standard. In Study 1 (N=71), we found that only prejudiced individuals use accent to discriminate against immigrants. In Study 2 (N=124), we replicated this effect and found that the influence of accent on discrimination is mediated by the perceived quality of the accent. Study 3 (N=105) replicated the previous results even after controlling for the effect of stereotyping. These results are the first experimental illustration of the hypothesis that accent triggers intergroup discrimination only among prejudiced individuals because they evaluate native accents as being qualitatively better than accents of immigrants, thereby legitimizing ingroup bias.

T1  - Attachment and prejudice: The mediating role of empathy
AN  - 1796451718
AB  - In two studies, we examined the novel hypothesis that empathy is a mechanism through which the relationship between attachment patterns and prejudice can be explained. Study 1 examined primed attachment security (vs. neutral prime), empathy, and prejudice towards immigrants. Study 2 examined primed attachment patterns (secure, avoidant, anxious), empathy subscales (perspective taking, empathic concern, personal distress), and prejudice towards Muslims. Across both studies, empathy mediated the relationship between primed attachment security and low prejudice levels. The findings suggest that enhancing felt security and empathic skills in individuals high in attachment-avoidance may lead to reduced prejudice.

T1  - The impact of Islam and the public and political portrayals of Islam on child-rearing practices - Discursive analyses of parental accounts among Muslims living in Denmark
AN  - 1773275719
AB  - With the rise of Islamist terrorist attacks in the US and Europe the impact of Islam on child-rearing practices has become a matter of public attention and debate. Within the political discourse in the Western world and in the mass media, Muslims are often being portrayed negatively. Research has documented how Muslims living in the West are adversely affected by the negative portrayals of Islam associated with the War on Terror. The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of Islam on child-rearing practices and parental identity formation among self-identified Muslims in Denmark. Using a discursive approach to analyzing interviews with parents in 29 Middle Eastern refugee families, six rhetorical strategies were identified: (1) minimizing differences, (2) highlighting compatibility, (3) emphasizing positive aspects of Islam, (4) countering common prejudice, (5) actively distancing oneself from terrorists/extremists, and (6) separating Islam as a religion from cultural traditions. It is argued that the global as well as national political discourse post 9/11 is reflected in all of the six rhetorical strategies. Whether parents position themselves as having a high or low bicultural identity or a Muslim parental identity, their positioning involves drawing on the discursive resources from the mass media, the global and national political and public discourse. Furthermore, it is argued that all rhetorical strategies can be seen as attempts to counter the hurt associated with the negative portrayal of Islam.

T1  - Chinese Muslims in Canada: a demographic profile and a preliminary test of ethnic saliency
AN  - 1784138844
AB  - To date, there has been little to no literature examining Chinese Muslim immigrants to Western nations. Recognizing the dearth of such literature, this research presents what appears to be the first-ever descriptive statistical picture of Chinese Muslims migrating to and residing in Canada. By examining how this immigrant population compares to and fares against non-Muslim Chinese and non-Chinese Muslims in Canada with Canadian census data in 1991 and 2001, the research provides preliminary analysis on the saliency of originating Chinese Muslim ethnicity in immigration outcomes. The current findings suggest that with the intersection of cultural and religious identities, Chinese Muslim may experience a different assimilation process compared to non-Muslim Chinese and non-Chinese Muslims.

T1  - Race, Space, and Cumulative Disadvantage: A Case Study of the Subprime Lending Collapse
AN  - 1728660713; 201534222
AB  - In this article, we describe how residential segregation and individual racial disparities generate racialized patterns of subprime lending and lead to financial loss among black borrowers in segregated cities. We conceptualize race as a cumulative disadvantage because of its direct and indirect effects on socioeconomic status at the individual and neighborhood levels, with consequences that reverberate across a borrower's life and between generations. Using Baltimore, Maryland as a case study setting, we combine data from reports filed under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act with additional loan-level data from mortgage-backed securities. We find that race and neighborhood racial segregation are critical factors explaining black disadvantage across successive stages in the process of lending and foreclosure, controlling for differences in borrower credit scores, income, occupancy status, and loan-to-value ratios. We analyze the cumulative cost of predatory lending to black borrowers in terms of reduced disposable income and lost wealth. We find the cost to be substantial. Black borrowers paid an estimated additional 5 to 11 percent in monthly payments and those that completed foreclosure in the sample lost an excess of $2 million in home equity. These costs were magnified in mostly black neighborhoods and in turn heavily concentrated in communities of color. By elucidating the mechanisms that link black segregation to discrimination we demonstrate how processes of cumulative disadvantage continue to undermine black socioeconomic status in the United States today.

T1  - The Heterogeneous Isthmus: Transnationalism and Cultural Differentiation in Panama
AN  - 1718068081; 201530778
AB  - This article addresses understandings of race and ethnicity within Latin American research by examining and arguing for an increasingly transnational interpretation of identity through an analytical engagement with the changing politics of difference in Panama. Applying historiographical and ethnographic approaches, we interrogate ethno-racial differentiation from a transnational perspective, concluding that dominant national discourses on identity in Panama have shifted in response to transnational alliances and pressures, and that a monolithic nationalism driven by the narrative of panamenismo (a national political discourse in Panama predicated upon the concept of a monolithic and singular Panamanian culture) has given way to an ethno-racial climate in which the politics of identity and representation are approached more pluralistically and arguably more equitably.

T1  - Legitimating Contexts, Immigrant Power, and Exclusionary Actions
AN  - 1777916726
AB  - In multi-ethnic nation-states, opposition to immigration has manifested itself in attitudes and behaviors. Past research has typically focused on anti-immigrant attitudes, and relied on threat and competition theories to explain patterns in such attitudes. These theories suggest that perceived threats stemming from new influxes or large concentrations of immigrants should prompt dominant groups to protect their interests, leading to anti-immigrant attitudes. Extending political opportunity theory, they also claim that conservative elites and voters in local areas coupled with low levels of threat further legitimate anti-immigrant activity. They test these ideas using a new data set of exclusionary action targeted at immigrants in over 50 US metropolitan areas. In support of the legitimating contexts model, they find that low levels of demographic and political threat -- when immigrants enjoy less power -- alone and coupled with a higher share of conservative voters act to legitimate and encourage restrictive events on the part of noninstitutional actors.

T1  - Migrants as agents of development: Diaspora engagement discourse and practice in Europe
AN  - 1667948607; 201509629
AB  - This article analyses how European governments and civil society actors engage diasporas in Europe as agents for the development of their countries of origin. Through a critical examination of diaspora engagement discourse and practice in various European countries, we identify three implicit understandings. First, development is conceived of as the planned activities of Western professional development actors; second, diasporas are seen as actual communities rooted in a national 'home' and sharing a group identity; and third, migration is regarded as binary mobility. We argue that these interpretations are informed by notions of ethnic or national rootedness in given places and that they lead to further assumptions about why, and in pursuit of what goals, diasporas engage. We conclude that such essentialized understandings limit the potential of diaspora engagement as a means of innovating the development industry by broadening understandings of what development entails and how it can be done.

AB  - A reliability generalization was performed on the Racial Identity Attitudes Scale, Black Racial Identity Attitudes Scale, People of Color Racial Identity Attitudes Scale, and White Racial Identity Attitudes Scale on published studies from 1984 through 2013. Studies providing a Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for their sample population were included to assess whether assorted variables affected reliability scores. Results suggest Blacks' scores produced significantly lower reliability scores (M = 0.65, SD = 0.11) than individuals of other races (M = 0.76, SD = 0.10) on the immersion/emersion subscale. Respondents in undergraduate programs produced higher reliability scores (M = 0.72, SD = 0.08) than those enrolled in or who had completed graduate degrees (M = 0.59, SD = 0.11) on the pre-encounter/conformity subscale, F(3, 57) = 2.83, p = 0.047.

T1  - Racial Identity, Perpetrator Race, Racial Composition of Primary Community, and Mood Responses to Discrimination
AN  - 1718065773; 201530772
AB  - Studies suggest that racial identity, race of the perpetrator, and prior race-related experiences influence responses to racial discrimination. This study employed a visual imagery paradigm to examine how racial centrality (or the significance of one's race), perpetrator race, and the racial composition of one's primary community were associated with mood responses to racial discrimination vignettes. Participants were 129 self-identified African American young adults (55% female) recruited from a southeastern university in the United States. Participants completed measures of sociodemographic characteristics and racial centrality and rated their mood following exposure to vignettes consisting of blatant and subtle discrimination with Black and White actors. Individuals with higher racial centrality endorsed greater anger and disgust and had stronger overall mood ratings following the subtle discrimination condition. Also, participants reported significantly higher levels of distress and disgust when the perpetrator was White. These results suggest that individual and situational factors help shape affective responses to discrimination. We discuss implications of the findings and highlight being connected to one's racial identity as a healthy psychological response to racism.

T1  - Perceptions of Commonality and Latino-Black, Latino-White Relations in a Multiethnic United States
AN  - 1708527508; 201528700
AB  - This study examines the extent that Latinos' sense of social, economic, and political power shapes their perceptions of commonality with blacks and whites. In accordance with my theory, which builds on the racial threat and group position theories, I find that Latinos' sense of power structures their perceptions of blacks and whites. When native-born Latinos feel economically threatened, they are less likely to perceive commonality with blacks. When native-born Latinos gain some political influence, they identify less with whites. Among Latino immigrants who perceive discrimination, residing in a high-threat economic setting is negatively related to perceiving commonality with whites. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Battleground of Identity: Racial Formation and the African American Discourse on Interracial Marriage
AN  - 1728660426; 201534077
AB  - This article utilizes a sample of letters to the editor from African American newspapers to investigate racial identity formation. Drawing on an analysis of 234 letters, published predominantly between 1925 and 1965, I examine how African American writers discussed black-white intermarriage. Writers used the issue of intermarriage to negotiate conceptions of racial identity and the politics of racial emancipation. Because of its strong symbolic implications, the intermarriage discourse became a 'battleground of identity' for the conflict between two competing racial ideologies: integrationism and separatism. The battleground concept elucidates why some debates become polarized, and why it is so difficult to arbitrate them. I argue that identity battlegrounds may emerge around emotionally charged and concrete but heavily symbolic issues that densely link to key ideas in the ideological systems of two or more conflicting movements. They must be issues that none of the movements can cease to compete over without surrendering their political essence. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Perceived control qualifies the effects of threat on prejudice
AN  - 1660023887; 201505464
AB  - People sometimes show a tendency to lash out in a prejudiced manner when they feel threatened. This research shows that the relationship between threat and prejudice is moderated by people's levels of perceived control: Threat leads to prejudice only when people feel concurrently low in control. In two studies, terrorist threat was associated with heightened prejudice among people who were low in perceived control over the threat (Study 1; N = 87) or over their lives in general (Study 2; N = 2,394), but was not associated with prejudice among people who were high in perceived control. Study 3 (N = 139) replicated this finding experimentally in the context of the Global Financial Crisis. The research identifies control as an important ingredient in threatening contexts that, if bolstered, can reduce general tendencies to lash out under threat. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The management of otherness beyond the state: integration policies and inclusive citizenship as a government paradigm in the Basque Country
AN  - 1660023915; 201505733
AB  - If identity and difference in the modern West are questions that fall within the field of government of institutions responsible for the question of citizenship, how is cultural difference to be governed from sub-state institutions, whose powers do not cover these questions? On the basis of fieldwork developed between 2010 and 2012, this text analyses the efforts made in the Basque Country to give shape to the problematic concept of 'inclusive citizenship'. The construction of this concept involves different planes, from the theoretical-moral plane (where concepts like alterity, race, difference or social exclusion intervene) to the practical-administrative one (where the government of alterity is considered from the perspective of administering social vulnerability). Analysis of this concept helps to confront a paradox: how is the problem of administering cultural difference to be faced when it is exercised from administrative structures that are not those of the central state, which is precisely the empirical correlate of what we think about cultural difference?

T1  - Acculturation Preference Profiles of Spaniards and Romanian Immigrants: The Role of Prejudice and Public and Private Acculturation Areas
AN  - 1667951060; 201509294
AB  - The main goal of this study was to identify acculturation preference profiles using cluster analysis in public and private areas of culture in the host and immigrant populations, and to find out the relationship between these profiles and prejudice levels. Four hundred and ninety-nine Spaniards and 500 Romanians participated in a survey. The sampling of Spaniards was multistage random and the sampling of Romanians was by quota. The results confirm our predictions. Romanians who are less prejudiced against Spaniards prefer assimilation in public areas and integration in private areas. Romanians who are more prejudiced against Spaniards prefer integration in public areas and separation in private areas. Spaniards who are less prejudiced against Romanians prefer integration in both public and private areas. Spaniards who are more prejudiced against Romanians prefer assimilation in both areas.

T1  - Gender, Malayness and the Ummah: Cultural Consumption and Malay-Muslim Identity
AN  - 1660024574; 201505711
AB  - Anxieties over the position of Malay identity have often spilled over into locally-produced popular materials. Such anxieties are reflected particularly in portrayals of Malay-Muslim womanhood. Malay-Muslim women are a significant target audience for these concerns, specifically in their assumedly natural roles as nurturers of a family unit. Despite this focus on Malay-Muslim women, however, theirs is a voice that is rarely heard as Malaysia advances towards an Islamic modernity. This article examines how urban Malay-Muslim women negotiate these tensions in their consumption and interpretation of local popular culture. Borrowing from Michel de Certeau's framework on everyday resistance, this article argues that these practices are in turn indicative of the interviewees' desire to be a part of a forward-looking Islamic modernity narrative and global community or ummah, and ultimately leave behind anxieties over Malay identity by choosing to construct their subjectivity in religious rather than ethnic terms.

T1  - COPS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF WHITE MASCULINE DECLINE
AN  - 1751968672
AB  - Examining the interconnection of gender, race, and social class in the representation of white female domestic violence complainants on the popular television series Cops, this analysis illustrates how roles in the performance of the criminal justice system can be used to address the crisis in white masculinity. Central to this examination is the crisis in white masculinity and the felt social, cultural and political marginalization of white men brought about by radical social and cultural changes since the civil rights movement. In this article, I examine Cops as the manifestation of this crisis-as a place where individuals manage and exorcise their anxieties and fears in relation to this crisis in identity. Utilizing thirty-five domestic violence vignettes from the series, I argue that the series portrays white male police officers as 'victims' of marginalized others, in this case lower class white women, in order to mark and exorcise the transition of white masculinity in the modern US.

T1  - Topologies of Race: Doing territory, population and identity in Europe
AN  - 1708525350; 201528651
AB  - Territorial borders just like other boundaries are involved in a politics of belonging, a politics of 'us' and 'them'. Border management regimes are thus part of processes of othering. In this article, we use the management of borders and populations in Europe as an empirical example to make a theoretical claim about race. We introduce the notion of the phenotypic other to argue that race is a topological object, an object that is spatially and temporally folded in distributed technologies of governance. To elaborate on these notions, we first examine a number of border management technologies through which both race and Europe are brought into being. More specifically we focus on how various such technologies aimed at monitoring the movement of individuals together with the management of populations have come to play crucial roles in Europe. Different border management regimes, we argue, do not only enact different versions of Europe but also different phenotypic others. We then shift the focus from border regimes to internal practices of governance, examining forensic DNA databanks to unravel articulations of race in the traffic between databases and societies.

T1  - Cleanliness/dirtiness, purity/impurity as social and psychological issues
AN  - 1728662622; 201533987
AB  - The issue of cleanliness in its clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies definitely has a social and cultural dimension. Some daily cleaning practices are indeed quite common actions in every culture and society, even if some differences in the frequency and quality of the practices and in the value attributed to them do exist. In this article, we will discuss how cleaning practices and contamination fears sink their roots in the social context and in cultural practices. In particular, we will explore the connections between one's own sense of cleanliness and attitudes of prejudice and intolerance toward other groups. First, the issue of cleanliness over the centuries and the exaggerations of cleanliness referring to individual psychopathology will be examined. Then, the psychosocial meaning of cleanliness will be considered in revealing the impact of the clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies on day-to-day social interactions with others.

T1  - Structural Racism and Indigenous Health: What Indigenous Perspectives of Residential School and Boarding School Tell Us? A Case Study of Canada and Finland
AN  - 1684423823; 201518483
AB  - The objective of this study was to explore, as an example of structural racism, the effects of residential school and boarding school on the self-perceived health of Indigenous peoples' in Canada and Finland. Structured interviews were conducted at Six Nations of the Grand River and Inari municipality. The individual and intergenerational negative effects included themes of vulnerability (language and cultural loss, fractured identity, and negative self-worth), and resilience (Indigenous identity, language and cultural renewal). Indigenous identity, culture, and language are intertwined and key determinants of health. Further studies about structural racism and a strong Indigenous identity as a protective factor may provide valuable insight into health disparities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - National identity and securitization in Israel
AN  - 1567045299; 201435182
AB  - This article seeks to demonstrate how discriminatory laws, passed in Israel since the eruption of the second intifada, are part of an ongoing securitization process of the Palestinian minority in Israel. These discriminatory laws serve as part of a security practice, employed by political elites that seek to represent threats to the hegemony of the Jewish identity as existential to national security. In doing so, the Israeli authorities advance a national security policy that perpetuates the perceived threat posed to the state by the Palestinian minority. The analysis focuses on discriminatory legislation passed between 2000 and 2012 by the Israeli Knesset and the political attitudes of the Israeli public before and after the second intifada to uncover the ways in which political actors and audiences negotiate the meaning of security in Israel. Securitization theory helps explain why desecuritization of the minority is highly unlikely even in the event that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be resolved.

T1  - If you're going to be a leader, at least act like it! Prejudice towards women who are tentative in leader roles
AN  - 1559004889; 201431766
AB  - Role congruity theory predicts prejudice towards women who meet the agentic requirements of the leader role. In line with recent findings indicating greater acceptance of agentic behaviour from women, we find evidence for a more subtle form of prejudice towards women who fail to display agency in leader roles. Using a classic methodology, the agency of male and female leaders was manipulated using assertive or tentative speech, presented through written (Study 1, N = 167) or verbal (Study 2, N = 66) communications. Consistent with predictions, assertive women were as likeable and influential as assertive men, while being tentative in leadership reduced the likeability and influence of women, but not of men. Although approval of agentic behaviour from women in leadership reflects progress, evidence that women are quickly singled out for disapproval if they fail to show agency is important for understanding how they continue to be at a distinct disadvantage to men in leader roles.

T1  - Identity Isomorphism: Role Schemas and White Masculinity Formation
AN  - 1531934676; 201423298
AB  - This article explores a counterintuitive intersection of class, gender, and race within two politically antagonistic white movements -- white nationalists and white antiracists. Ethnographic field-notes, in-depth interviews, and content analysis provide comprehensive data and triangulation for how implicit perceptions of class and gender are intertwined with the social construction of an ideal white, male, middle-class identity. While both organizations express antithetical political goals, they together reinforce broader discourses about whiteness and white supremacy. In so doing, these two organizations present an empirical and theoretical puzzle: How and why do two supposedly antithetical and divergent white male organizations simultaneously rationalize the inclusion and exclusion of women and the lower class from their ranks? Findings gesture toward tempering conceptual models of white male identity formation to further explore how cultural schemas are utilized toward the construction of both identity formation and interest protection.

T1  - White backlash in the 'post-racial' United States
AN  - 1551001563; 201428989
AB  - From the 'Reagan Revolution' to the election of Obama in the USA; from the populism of Enoch Powell and Thatcher to the rise of the British National Party in the UK; and from the backlash against multiculturalism in both Australia and Canada, westernized nations with colonial histories and unequal relations between a powerful white class and a subjugated non-white class now witness a strikingly adamant discourse and movement: growing numbers of white people claim that they are racially oppressed and seek redress against policies, laws and practices that they believe discriminate against them. I critically examine the white backlash in the 'post-racial' era (1960s -- present) of the USA by reviewing the extant scholarship on the white backlash, by highlighting landmark legal cases and media spectacles that represent claims of white racial victimization, and by arguing that white victimization discourse is an integral mechanism in the formation of contemporary white racial identity.

T1  - The African Scholar in the Western Academy
AN  - 1551001216; 201428935
AB  - In this essay, I push the discursive envelope on what it means to speak of a particular space, location, and position of the 'Black Scholar' in the (Western) academy and its colonial satellites globally. The Black Scholar is not about racializing the identity of Blackness (or Black subject as simply an intellectual of Black identity) nor a pursuit for 'an essential Black subject.' Rather, it is about an appreciation of the interface of critical (Black) scholarship and creative intellectual thought and practice that goes back through time as a counterpoint and challenge to dominant ideologies, including 'ideologies of the authentic.' It is argued that the Black Scholar is fundamentally about an intellectual praxis informed by an African sense of history, culture, identity, community knowledge, and political work to bring about change in the lives of African peoples.

T1  - 'I'm American, not Japanese!': the struggle for racial citizenship among later-generation Japanese Americans
AN  - 1520331066; 201413532
AB  - As one of the oldest Asian American groups in the USA, most Japanese Americans are of the third and fourth generations and have become well integrated in mainstream American society. However, they are still racialized as foreigners simply because of their Asian appearance. Their Asian phenotype continues to have a foreigner connotation because of large-scale immigration from Asia and an American national identity that is racially defined as white. This paper analyses how later-generation Japanese Americans are racialized as outsiders in their daily interaction with mainstream Americans, which is often accompanied by essentialized assumptions that they are also culturally foreign. In response, they engage in everyday struggles for racial citizenship by demanding inclusion in the national community as Americans despite their racial differences. It is uncertain whether such attempts to contest their racialization will cause current mono-racial notions of American identity to be reconsidered in more inclusive and multiracial ways.

T1  - Urban civility or urban community? A false opposition in Richard Sennett's conception of public ethos
AN  - 1512219946; 201408536
AB  - Richard Sennett can be interpreted as one of the more robust representatives of a current critique with regard to ethnic communities in urban areas, namely, that such ethnic enclaves are a proof of urban disintegration and failing citizenship. Firstly, I take issue with Sennett's assumption that there is an inherent tension between in-group solidarity and the ability to deal with members of perceived out-groups. Secondly, instead of simply cutting citizens off from the wider public sphere and leaving them politically ineffective, as Sennett argues, urban communities can be instrumental in a struggle for emancipation and equal rights. Thirdly, a sense of belonging is a basic aspect of human well-being. Urban villages or ethnic clusters are able to provide this. Therefore, as long as a local identity is not exclusive or the effect of involuntary segregation, ethno-cultural concentrations in the city are acceptable from the moral-political point of view.

It argues that Indian Ocean experiences, histories, and debates present an alternative perspective to the one dominant in Egypt, Iraq, and the Levant. In particular, it suggests that even as late as the twentieth century, Arabness in the Arabian Peninsula and Indian Ocean circuit, which had a different history from that of Northern Arabia, was conceived more as a caste-like or class notion than an ethnic or racial one. Certainly, at specific moments and in particular contexts, there is overlap between the caste and ethnic notions and, certainly, neither should be considered essential to identity in the Middle East. Nevertheless, Limbert contends, it is through attention to the Middle East's margins- that is, in this case, the Indian Ocean-that we might better understand the various meanings of, and shifts in, the notion of Arabness.

T1  - 'We were here first, so we determine the rules of the game': Autochthony and prejudice towards out-groups
AN  - 1512218298; 201408682
AB  - This paper identifies autochthony -- the belief that a place belongs to its original inhabitants and that they are therefore more entitled -- as a relevant new determinant of out-group prejudice. We hypothesized that autochthony uniquely predicts prejudice towards migrant groups and that it mediates the relationship between national identification and prejudice. The mediation process was anticipated to be especially strong for people who perceive out-group encroachment, that is, those who feel that immigrants are 'getting out of place'. These hypotheses were tested in two studies using nationally representative samples of native Dutch participants. In Study 1 (N = 793), we showed that autochthony is an empirically distinct construct and that it is a unique predictor of prejudice. Furthermore, higher national identifiers expressed stronger claims of autochthony, and these claims were in turn associated with more negative feelings towards migrant groups. Study 2 (N = 466) showed support for a moderated mediation model: Beliefs in autochthony were only related to prejudice for participants who perceived out-group encroachment.

T1  - Frequency of Sexual Activity With Most Recent Male Partner Among Young, Internet-Using Men Who Have Sex With Men in the United States
AN  - 1567048142; 201435238
AB  - Sex frequency, defined here as the number of oral or anal sex acts with the most recent partner in the past year, is a potential driver of risk for sexually transmitted infections. However, few data on sex frequency have been reported for men who have sex with men (MSM). Data from an Internet survey of MSM were used to describe sex frequency with most recent main and casual male partners and to estimate factors associated with higher sex frequency. Among 5,193 MSM, higher sex frequency was associated with younger age, shorter relationship duration, and reporting a main (vs. casual) partner; and lower sex frequency with male partners was associated with heterosexual or bisexual (vs. homosexual) identity or Black race (vs. non-Hispanic White). Secondary analyses of estimates of sex frequency from 2 publicly available nationally representative datasets comprised of primarily heterosexual survey respondents (the 2008 General Social Survey and the 1992 National Health and Social Life Survey) were performed. Sex frequency among MSM respondents was similar to that reported by heterosexuals. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When ideology clashes with reality: racial discrimination and black identity in contemporary Cuba
AN  - 1512219404; 201408773
AB  - This article examines the commonality and types of racial discrimination among blacks in Cuba. Using survey data I determine that an experience of racial discrimination is common for black Cubans and these experiences are often consequences of structural racism, rather than just isolated incidents of individual prejudice, which is the claim made by the Cuban government and supported by scholars as well. The existence of racism and racial discrimination creates group differences and survey results show that feelings of group identity are present in the majority of the sample. The project finds a relationship between experiences of discrimination and group identity so that the salience of race in Cuba through experience is connected to levels of black consciousness.

T1  - Researching white mothers of mixed-parentage children: the significance of investigating whiteness
AN  - 1463011609; 201345761
AB  - This article takes as its starting point the increasing number of research studies that pay specific attention to family relationships when investigating mixedness. It draws on the critical study of whiteness to illustrate the significance of examining, in more detail than is usual, white mothers' racialized identity in studies of mixed-parentage families. It is argued that by doing so, understanding of the identity development and sense of belonging of children and young people in mixed-parentage families can be enhanced, as well as understanding of these issues in mixed-parentage families generally. The article explains how kinship relationships and wider social networks are two related areas of investigation that can help to shed light on what happens to whiteness in mixed-parentage families. Both encourage a specific focus on the identity and sense of belonging of mothers, without marginalizing the identities of other family members. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religiosity and Prejudice: Different Patterns for Two Types of Religious Internalization
AN  - 1559005075; 201431767
AB  - The literature on the relationship between religiosity and prejudice has shown inconsistent findings. We argue that it is necessary to distinguish between different types of religiosity and that its relationship with prejudice is mediated by different values. Results of two studies conducted in Italy show that identified religiosity and introjected religiosity predict different levels of prejudice toward Muslim immigrants. Moreover, the negative relationship between identified religiosity and prejudice was mediated by prosocial values, whereas valuing conformity mediated the positive relationship between introjected religiosity and prejudice. The results show that it is possible to better understand the relationship between religiosity and prejudice by disentangling the different ways of being religious. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Is Big Really Beautiful? Understanding Body Image Perceptions of African American Females
AN  - 1463008769; 201345862
AB  - The purpose of this study was to obtain body image information from African American (AA) college-age women (age 18-25) from a historically Black college and/or university (HBCU) and a predominately White college (PWC) with regard to their body image, body shape, appearance, and related factors. Findings from this study will provide the health education profession with valuable information on body image from a cultural perspective of AA women. A one-way ANOVA was used to analyze comparisons between the two groups. Results from the Young Women's Experiences with Body Weight and Shape were analyzed using five different factors: weight dissatisfaction, slimness as quality of life, interpersonal messages regarding slimness, rejecting the value of thinness, and valuing exercise. Significant differences were found with: weight dissatisfaction (p = .010), slimness as quality of life (p = .000), and interpersonal messages regarding slimness (p = .000). AA women at the HBCU were more satisfied with their body image on these three factors and similar to AA women at the PWC on two factors: rejecting the value of thinness (p = .229) and valuing exercise (p = .828). These findings will assist in developing programming based on racial differences and similarities. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - What do I Think of Others in Relation to Myself? Moral Identity and Moral Inclusion in Explaining Prejudice
AN  - 1512218202; 201408692
AB  - The aim of this article is to analyze the effect of moral identity on prejudice in conjunction with moral inclusion/exclusion attitudes. In particular, the hypothesis is that even if high moral identity people tend to be less prejudicial than low moral identity people, this result can be explained with reference to moral inclusion/exclusion attitudes. A questionnaire was distributed to 192 Italian subjects. According to the hypothesis, results show that moral identity is negatively correlated with blatant prejudice, but that this effect is completely mediated by the perception of moral inclusion/exclusion with the other groups. These results suggest that it is not how morally you behave (symbolization), or the relevance you give to moral traits for your identity (internalization), that have an effect on prejudice, but rather it is who you include within the moral community within which moral values apply.

T1  - When white people report racial discrimination: The role of region, religion, and politics
AN  - 1429630075; 201335789
AB  - Scholarly interest in the correlates and consequences of perceived discrimination has grown exponentially in recent years, yet, despite increased legal and media attention to claims of 'anti-white bias,' empirical studies predicting reports of racial discrimination by white Americans remain limited. Using data from the 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, we find that evangelical Protestantism increases the odds that whites will report experiencing racial discrimination, even after controlling for racial context and an array of social and psychological characteristics. However, this effect is limited to the South. Outside the South, political affiliation trumps religion, yielding distinct regional profiles of discrimination reporters. These findings suggest that institutions may function as regional 'carriers' for whites inclined to report racial discrimination. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Finding 'strong' and 'soft' racial meanings in cultural taste patterns in Brazil
AN  - 1417525634; 201331935
AB  - This study advances literature on the role of cultural tastes in racial identity and work on race in Brazil. I ask how racial categories and cultural tastes co-constitute each other in meaningful patterns and how these patterns reveal the racialized meanings of cultural objects. Using correspondence analysis, I identify taste clusters and then compare these patterns across three racial classification schemas in Brazil. Across all schemas, there is a distinction between blackness and whiteness in terms of the cultural tastes that constitute identities. This holds across symbols of national identity, foreign-influenced genres and Brazilian popular culture. The strength of underlying racial meaning offers a second axis of variation -- between 'strong' (primordial, fixed, strictly bounded) versus 'soft' (descriptive, ambiguous, porous) racial identities. Some symbols of national identity carry more primordially laden and invariable racial meaning than do others and thus associate with two distinct types of black identity.

T1  - Lesbian Generations- Transsexual... Lesbian... Feminist...
AN  - 1650145879; 201502285
AB  - I INTERPRETED QUITE LITERALLY, perhaps too literally, Leila Rupp's kind invitation to 'speak informally for about ten minutes' in the roundtable on lesbian generations by putting the emphasis on 'informally' and extemporizing some rather haphazardly organized thoughts on what generation of lesbian I considered myself to be. The venue being the Big Berks and the personal, of course, still being political, I assumed in framing my remarks that an ample amount of autobiographical reflection would be, if not original in its methodological implications, then intelligible or at least excusable under the circumstances. When my turn came to speak, I offered an impromptu performance in which I sought to cite generational, ethnic, national, and class-based competencies of lesbian identity, while simultaneously ironically distancing myself from those very norms through a calculated and strategic cultivation of affect. By which I mean to say: I tried to make people laugh, and I was pleased to have succeeded through a variety of techniques (gesture, expression, phrasing, timing, embodied context) that don't render well on the printed page. You had to be there-but what follows is a loose rendition of that performance into text. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Role of Language Resources in Labour Market Entry: Comparing Estonia and Ukraine
AN  - 1347781641; 201318799
AB  - This paper explores how language proficiency influences the dynamics of labour market entry among young Russians and the native populations in two former Soviet Republics-Estonia and Ukraine. We use data from the Estonian TIES survey and the Youth Transition Survey in Ukraine to compare the speed of finding any first job with that of entry to the first higher-status employment requiring good communication skills, thus revealing the role of language proficiency in the job-entry process. The results from event-history analyses show that proficiency in the official Estonian language plays a pivotal role for labour market entry in Estonia, particularly for higher-status employment. In Ukraine, on the other hand, monolingual Russian-speaking youth do not experience any difficulties in finding high-status first employment, even though the official language of the country is Ukrainian. We do not find any positive effect of bilingualism in either of these countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Automatically activated facets of ageism: Masked evaluative priming allows for a differentiation of age-related prejudice
AN  - 1373428360; 201328380
AB  - This study investigated the automatic activation of ageism by using a go/no-go version of the masked evaluative priming task. Pictures of younger persons, of older persons in everyday contexts, and of older persons depicting age-related conditions of decline were used as masked primes that preceded positive and negative target adjectives conveying either other-relevant valence (e.g., just and mean) or possessor-relevant valence (e.g., serene and lonely). The evaluative priming effect (denoting relative negativity of old-everyday primes in comparison with younger primes) was significant, as hypothesized, only for possessor-relevant targets. It was not moderated by explicit ageism. A second priming index (denoting relative negativity of old-decline primes in comparison with old-everyday primes) predicted, however, explicit ageism. Again, this result was, as expected, constrained to the index based on possessor-relevant targets. This study provides further evidence that prejudice in terms of automatic evaluations of social stimuli can be more fine grained beyond a mere one-dimensional positive-negative differentiation.

T1  - Globalization and a Conservative Dilemma: Economic Openness and Retributive Policies
AN  - 1221407309; 201244762
AB  - Globalization is associated with economic openness and, in this sense, is in line with conservative free market ideology that embraces less government intervention. Globalization is also associated with greater contact with dissimilar outgroups and potential threats from terrorists and seems to run against conservative attitudes toward outgroup threat and civil liberties. We report research employing two nationally representative samples of 1,000 adults (collected in 2006 and 2008) that explored conservative individuals' attitudes as American views of terrorism evolved following 9/11. Despite diminishing estimates of the likelihood of terrorist attacks, conservatism remained strongly associated with support for seeking revenge for foreign terrorist attacks and for restricting the civil liberties of foreign visitors and noncitizens in order to prevent terrorism. These trends were not accounted for by differences in levels of perceived threat or by demographic characteristics distinguishing conservatives from others. Results are discussed in the context of globalization and the role of political ideology. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Uneasy being English: The significance of class for English national sentiments
AN  - 1494299697; 201402086
AB  - The contemporary forms of English identity and nationalism have received sustained attention since the late 1990s. Much of this attention has been framed in terms of English responses to recent constitutional changes in the UK, particularly Scottish and Welsh devolution in 1997. In this paper, I try to understand contemporary sentiments towards Englishness less in terms of political change, and more in terms of its relationship to class. Drawing on qualitative interviews with the ethnic majority respondents, I demonstrate the associations people make between class, inequality and exclusion and being English. In particular, I identify both a decline in social deference and an increase in contempt towards a so-called underclass in people's talk about being English. In reflecting on this, I suggest that part of the explanation for why people are uneasy about identifying with 'being English' relates to an absence of an equal sense of English national membership.

T1  - 'The Negro should not be used as a combat soldier': reconfiguring racial identity in the United States Army, 1890-1918
AN  - 1283644052; 201303502
AB  - When the United States entered the First World War, the nation's Jim Crow politics contributed to the general rejection of African American men for war-time military service. Only after political pressure from black and white progressives threatened to spill over into the public sphere were the 92nd and 93rd Divisions organized and sent to France. This policy has long been studied and criticized by historians, particularly in light of the long service of the United States Army's four 'colored regiments', the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th Infantry Regiments. However, in spite of the presence and distinguished service of these four black regiments, the War Department and the army demonstrate a morally ambiguous record of racial tolerance that allowed for the exclusion of Blacks from military service with the American Expeditionary Forces. This record is highlighted in the work of two of the army's medical officers, Charles Woodruff and Robert Shufeldt, whose work on medical ethnology and racial degeneration reveal critical justifications that were not only used to argue for the exclusion of African Americans from military service, but also, in the post-war period, to marginalize the black soldier's combat record and support the view that black men were unfit for future military service.

T1  - 'To make a better world tomorrow': St. Clair Drake and the Quakers of Pendle Hill
AN  - 1125218645; 201240491
AB  - This article is part of a larger project by the author to record St. Clair Drake's contribution to the black radical tradition. Here he examines Drake's involvement with the Quakers in the early years of the Depression. Drawing on writings in African American and Popular Front periodicals of the time, it considers how a Quaker community shaped Drake's identity as an intellectual activist and how his encounter suggests the ways in which black intellectuals engaged with non-violence as a philosophy and strategy for social change before the civil rights movement. Drake's participation in non-violent campaigns for workers' rights, world peace and an end to racial discrimination and violence reflects the Quakers' sustained interest in African American affairs well beyond the anti-slavery movement. His eventual break with the Quakers underscores Drake's practice of constantly pushing boundaries in his search for the most effective means to transform society at the grassroots, as he journeyed across the Atlantic world.

T1  - Teaching & Learning Guide for: Multiracial Americans: Racial Identity Choices and Implications for the Collection of Race Data
AN  - 1364699671; 201323455
AB  - In 2010, approximately nine million Americans self-identified with two or more races on the United States Census a 32 percent increase in the last decade. President Barack Obama, the son of a white Kansas-born mother and Kenyan father, was not one of these self-identified multiracial Americans. In fact, Obama chose only to check the black box, illustrating that multiracial ancestry does not always translate to multiracial identity. Since the 1990s, there has been a growing body of research examining the multiracial population and key questions have included: How do multiracial Americans identify themselves? And why? This paper reviews this research, with a focus on the factors shaping racial identity and the implications regarding the collection of race data in the US Census. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Attributions for Discriminatory Events and Satisfaction with Social Support in Gay Men
AN  - 1322723218; 201310733
AB  - Attributions modulate the impact of stressful events on mental health. However, little is known about attributions for discriminatory events and their relationship to psychosocial outcomes in sexual minority individuals. Relationships were examined between gay men's attributions for discrimination and their satisfaction with social support, a variable critical to mental health in this population. Gay men (N = 307) completed online measures of satisfaction with social support, attributions for discriminatory events, and key minority stress constructs. Self blaming attributions for discrimination were associated with decreased satisfaction with social support, independent of the frequency with which participants reported experiencing discrimination. The link between self blaming and satisfaction with social support was partially mediated by a latent affective construct comprised of anxiety, depression, and low positive affect. A moderation effect was also found, such that the relationship between frequency of perceived discriminatory events and dissatisfaction with social support was amplified for men reporting more blame toward perpetrators of discrimination. Results support attributions for discrimination as valuable additions to minority stress models. Assessing self and other blame for these discriminatory events may help to clarify pathways by which discrimination can undermine gay men's satisfaction with their social support networks.

T1  - A different contender? Barack Obama, the 2008 presidential campaign and the racial politics of sport
AN  - 1283642904; 201303392
AB  - This paper explores popular representations of Barack Obama's relationship to sport during the 2008 US presidential campaign. It delineates how white normativity framed the candidate's passion for basketball and his participation in a highly publicized bowling game. We argue that Obama's athletic activities became key vehicles for reading his body and by extension his identity and his politics. The question that could only be asked in a white supremacist context -- is Obama too black or not black enough to be President? -- mirrored long-standing tensions in America's affective relation to black male athletes. Representations of Obama bowling further illuminate the complicated ways in which whiteness operates. The essay concludes with a brief discussion suggesting the importance of analyses of sport for ethnic and racial studies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Mutts like Me': Multiracial Students' Perceptions of Barack Obama
AN  - 1125217585; 201240429
AB  - Existent sociological studies of multiracialism in the United States focus on identity construction, the cultural and legislative battle over multiracial categorization, and the implications of demographic shifts towards an increasingly "mixed race" population. This article engages literature from each of these areas, and uses data from in-depth interviews with self-identified multiracial students to document their perceptions of President Barack Obama and trace the symbolic boundaries of multiracial identity. Interviews are specifically directed towards the influence of race on Obama's identity management and political career, the relationship between Obama and respondents' multiracial identity, and Obama's impact on America's racial history. Respondents hold favorable opinions of the President despite his inconsistent affirmation of multiracial identity. They believe that emphasis on Obama's blackness rather than multiracialism is the unfortunate result of both personal choices and political pressures. In addition, the cohort insists that racism remains is a major factor in Obama's career and in America at large. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Responding to sex-based discrimination: Gender differences in perceived discrimination and implications for legal decision making
AN  - 1023026810; 201223671
AB  - The present studies examine responses to individual and institutional sex-based discrimination and how these responses vary as a function of the perceiver's gender. In Study 1A, women perceived more sexism than men and the magnitude of the gender gap was significantly larger for institutional sexism as compared to individual sexism. Study 1B provided validation for the measures of perceptions of individual and institutional sexism. In Study 2, participants reached a verdict and determined remedies in a lawsuit where the plaintiff was a woman claiming to be a victim of individual or institutional sexism. Women were more likely than men to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. When the plaintiff was a victim of individual discrimination, men and women awarded comparable remedies but when the plaintiff was a victim of institutional sexism, women awarded significantly more remedies than men. Thus the present research suggests that gender moderates responses to institutional and individual forms of discrimination and these gender differences may have important implications for victims of discrimination.

T1  - Leaving it to the Children: Non-Racialism, Identity, Socialisation and Generational Change in South Africa
AN  - 1221409572; 201244079
AB  - Although a critical value of the anti-apartheid movement and within the democratic Constitution, there is a lack of national consensus on the meaning of non-racialism in South Africa and how best it can be achieved, particularly given the continued use of historically defined race categories for redress. In response, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and Gauteng City-Region Observatory conducted a series of qualitative focus groups exploring the understanding of non-racialism among South Africans, and found widespread ambiguity about its meaning among research participants. Results suggest that while many continue to associate strongly with identity groups based on apartheid race categories, integration and engagement has increased within public life. Less change has occurred within private spaces, where stereotypes and racism remain firmly intact. Participants view non-racialism as more likely to be achieved by future generations than present ones. However, the research findings cast doubt on whether children will be able to reject stereotypes within families and at home. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Post-1980s Multicultural Immigrant Neighbourhoods: Koreatowns, Spatial Identities and Host Regions in the Pacific Rim
AN  - 1847586589
AB  - Recent trends in migration across the Pacific Rim have suggested that neighbourhoods have become important sources of community identity, requiring a re-evaluation of the relationship between urban places and immigrants. Specifically, we argue that the notion of ethnic enclaves may not fit well with some of the newer, post-1980s immigrant populations in Pacific Rim cities. Using data from the cases of Los Angeles, Tokyo and Beijing, we argue that Korean settlement in these cities represents a new kind of immigrant neighbourhood that links Korean migrants with other migrant communities, consumers in the broader region and local government interests to produce places that mitigate increasingly multicultural and multi-ethnic urban hierarchies in their localities. This role has become particularly important regarding real estate and economic development strategies.

T1  - Kazakhstan: constructing identity in a post-Soviet society
AN  - 1315600387; 201307716
AB  - One of the problems with the now independent countries of Central Asia is that they have little history of independent statehood and even less experience of any ideological context that legitimizes a specific set of political arrangements, other than the discredited Marxist model of the Soviet system. Neither habit nor attachment to a coherent set of political ideals is very helpful as the basis for individual identification with or support of the State. Perhaps as a consequence, political operatives in Central Asian countries have opted to emphasize the centrality of ethnicity to legitimize their current political arrangements. But in Kazakhstan this presents a potential problem -- the country is ethnically very diverse, has a large Russian/Slavic population and the 'core nation' of ethnic Kazakhs comprises a bare majority of Kazakh citizens. We utilize survey research to test the influence such factors as ethnicity, religion and other nexus of identity have on feelings of attachment to the state. Our findings indicate that identifying as 'Kazakh' indeed has a positive effect on identification with the state, as do identifying as Sunni Muslim and 'Asian'. However, institutional trust and economic well-being are also positive influences on affective regard for the state, allowing an opening for broadening and deepening the basis for state legitimacy.

T1  - Discovering the Privilege of Whiteness: White Women's Reflections on Anti-racist Identity and Ally Behavior
AN  - 1037887533; 201231022
AB  - In the discussion group White Women Against Racism (WWAR), participants engaged in dialogue promoting self-examination of white privilege and anti-racist social action. Through qualitative analyses of field observations of group meetings and interviews, this study explores their engagement in the deconstruction of white privilege, white identity, and the challenges of anti-racist action for social change. The women examined whiteness through a lens of white privilege that opened new avenues to anti-racist white identity and activism. Participants also explored the influence of multiple identities and intersections with whiteness as sources of influence on their own anti-racism. The women conceptualized struggles with everyday anti-racist action as intertwined with privilege and social norms of silence. Although white privilege research typically focuses on classroom instruction or gaps in awareness, this study emphasizes the voices and experiences of White women to analyze white privilege awareness in relation to white anti-racist identity development and ally behavior.

T1  - White Privilege, Language Capital and Cultural Ghettoisation: Western High-Skilled Migrants in Taiwan
AN  - 1023030538; 201223893
AB  - Drawing on the case of Taiwan, this article looks at high-skilled migration from the West to Asia. I explore how Western high-skilled migrants exert agency to negotiate their positions as non-citizens, privileged others and professional workers. I have coined the term 'flexible cultural capital conversion' to describe how English-speaking Westerners convert their native-language skills, as a form of global linguistic capital, into economic, social and symbolic capitals. Their privileged positions are nevertheless mediated and constrained by their class, nationality, race/ethnicity and gender. In the global context, whiteness is marked as a visible identity and the 'superior other'. Such cultural essentialism functions as a double-edged sword that places white foreigners in privileged yet segregated job niches. Their flexibility in capital conversion and transnational mobility is territory-bound. Many experience the predicament of 'cultural ghettoisation' in the global South, and they often face grim job prospects on returning home to the North. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - White on Black: Can White Parents Teach Black Adoptive Children How to Understand and Cope With Racism
AN  - 919905200; 201201736
AB  - In this article, the authors examine White parents' endeavors toward the racial enculturation and inculcation of their transracially adopted Black children. Drawing on in-depth interviews, the authors identify and analyze themes across the specific race socialization strategies and practices White adoptive parents used to help their adopted Black children to develop a positive racial identity and learn how to effectively cope with issues of race and racism. The central aim of this article is to examine how these lessons about race help to connect family members to U.S. society's existing racial hierarchy and how these associations position individuals to help perpetuate or challenge the deeply embedded and historical structures of White supremacy. The authors use the notion of White racial framing to move outside of the traditional arguments for or against transracial adoption to instead explore how a close analysis of the adoptive parents' racial instructions may serve as a learning tool to foster more democratic and inclusive forms of family and community.

T1  - Economic Participation and National Self-Identification of Refugees in the Netherlands
AN  - 1030867463; 201227738
AB  - This study examines whether refugees self-identify as a member of the host society. We use survey data of more than 2,500 Somali, Iraqi, Afghani, Iranian, and ex-Yugoslavian refugees in the Netherlands. The results show that economic participation in the host country is positively related to refugees' national self-identification. In addition, we find that refugees' social ties with Dutch natives are associated with national self-identification and that the relationship between economic participation and national self-identification is partially explained by these social ties. Perceived discrimination is not related to refugees' national self-identification. Implications of these findings for debates on immigration and integration are discussed.

T1  - Intergroup Dialogue Courses on Sexual Orientation: Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Student Experiences and Outcomes
AN  - 1023025415; 201223830
AB  - Intergroup dialogue is a method of social justice education. Most intergroup dialogue research explores race and gender identities. Sexual orientation dialogues are uncommon and not yet examined empirically. This qualitative study explores sexual orientation dialogue courses from the perspective of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) student participants. Understanding target, or marginalized, group perspective of planned intergroup experiences is important given concerns raised in the literature. We document student motivations for participating in dialogues, core outcomes, and main challenges that arose in dialogue. Core outcomes include learning about and accepting one's sexual identity and empowerment. Challenges include those stemming from invisibility of sexual orientation identity. Recommendations are made for intergroup dialogue practice and research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Development of New 'Third-Cultural Spaces of Belonging': British-Born Cypriot 'Return' Migrants in Cyprus
AN  - 902085319; 201122326
AB  - This paper explores spaces of belonging of British-born Cypriots who have 'returned' to the parental homeland, Cyprus. Drawing on life narratives and ethnographic observations collected during fieldwork in Cyprus, the findings demonstrate the potential limitations of exploring notions of 'home' and 'belonging' within ethnic, national or primordial cultural boundaries. Rather, my analysis indicates the need to focus on the new spaces of belonging formed around personal and social relations. These migrants draw upon a variety of home, expatriate and international relationships to create a space made up by components to which they feel they belong, characterised by their time, place, views and experiences. The privileging of such experiences of belonging over 'traditional' classifications of identity (such as ethnicity, religiosity and nationality) brings about a sense of unity defined by one's relations to (actual and metaphorical) spaces, beyond the traditional 'here/there' and 'them/us' dichotomies. By negotiating 'essentialised' and 'non-essentialised' notions of 'home', participants establish new 'third-cultural spaces of belonging'-hybridised, yet located in Cyprus. Hence, being part of such a 'third-cultural space' and also of a 'localised space' are not mutually exclusive. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Generation Islam": Arab American Muslims and Racial Politics after September 11
AN  - 1010632377; 201210458
AB  - This research draws upon the lived experiences of sixty young adult Muslims living in Los Angeles in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the racialized processes shaping the representation, oppression, and emergent identities of the Muslim diaspora. Historically, Arab American Muslims have occupied a contradictory position within U.S. race relations. They have been designated by the government as categorically white, but simultaneously have been the victims of racism in different institutional arenas. I explore how the War on Terror has shaped the collective and individual racial consciousness of young adult Arab American Muslims. Moreover, I argue that the newest generation of Muslims, designated "Generation Islam" by mainstream media outlets, exhibits a distinguishing feature that older cohorts of Arab American Muslims do not possess: namely, they are more likely to disidentify with whiteness. My research demonstrates how this generation of Arab American Muslims is far more likely than previous generations to situate their racial identity as non-white "racialized" subjects.

T1  - Biased Allocation of Faces to Social Categories
AN  - 919901874; 201201511
AB  - Three studies show that social categorization is biased at the level of category allocation. In all studies, participants categorized faces. In Studies 1 and 2, participants overallocated faces with criminal features -- a stereotypical negative trait -- to the stigmatized Moroccan category, especially if they were prejudiced. On the contrary, the stereotype-irrelevant negative trait stupid did not lead to overallocation to the Moroccan category. In Study 3, using the stigmatized category homosexual, the previously used negative trait criminal -- irrelevant to the homosexual stereotype -- did not lead to overallocation, but the stereotype-relevant positive trait femininity did. These results demonstrate that normative fit is higher for faces with stereotype-relevant features regardless of valence. Moreover, individual differences in implicit prejudice predicted the extent to which stereotype-relevant traits elicited overallocation: Whereas more negatively prejudiced people showed greater overallocation of faces associated with negative stereotype-relevant traits, they showed less overallocation of faces associated with positive stereotype-relevant traits. These results support our normative fit hypothesis: In general, normative fit is better for faces with stereotypical features. Moreover, normative fit is enhanced for prejudiced individuals when these features are evaluatively congruent. Social categorization thus may be biased in itself.

T1  - The Behavioral Immune System (and Why It Matters)
AN  - 914767474; 201200121
AB  - Like many other animals, human beings engage in behavioral defenses against infectious pathogens. The behavioral immune system consists of a suite of psychological mechanisms that (a) detect cues connoting the presence of infectious pathogens in the immediate environment, (b) trigger disease-relevant emotional and cognitive responses, and thus (c) facilitate behavioral avoidance of pathogen infection. However, the system responds to an overly general set of superficial cues, which can result in aversive responses to things (including people) that pose no actual threat of pathogen infection. In addition, the system is flexible, such that more strongly aversive responses occur under conditions in which perceivers are (or merely perceive themselves to be) more vulnerable to pathogen infection. Recent research reveals many provocative implications -- for the experience of disgust, for extraversion and social interaction, for xenophobia and other prejudices, and for the origins of cultural differences.

T1  - Direct contact and authoritarianism as moderators between extended contact and reduced prejudice: Lower threat and greater trust as mediators
AN  - 902083873; 201122120
AB  - Using a representative sample of Dutch adults (N = 1238), we investigated the moderating influence of direct contact and authoritarianism on the potential of extended contact to reduce prejudice. As expected, direct contact and authoritarianism moderated the effect of extended contact on prejudice. Moreover, the third-order moderation effect was also significant, revealing that extended contact has the strongest effect among high authoritarians with low levels of direct contact. We identified trust and perceived threat as the mediating processes underlying these moderation effects. The present study thus attests to the theoretical and practical relevance of reducing prejudice via extended contact. The discussion focuses on the role of extended contact in relation to direct contact and authoritarianism as well as on the importance of trust in intergroup contexts.

T1  - Transnational lifestyles as a new form of cosmopolitan social identification? Latin American women in German urban spaces
AN  - 881468786; 201116387
AB  - Joining a religious sect, the sex industry or the art field can open transnational opportunities for women to participate actively in different social and cultural domains. This article is based on a qualitative study of migration, gender and identity among Latin American women in Berlin. Drawing from a transnational practices perspective, I refer to lifestyles that serve to develop cosmopolitan skills and competencies such women develop by relying on multiple identifications. These competencies facilitate their ability to find recognition as well as express a sense of belonging that extends beyond the ethnic categorizations deployed within hegemonic discourses. The women presented here identified themselves within lifestyles that helped them to develop cosmopolitan sociabilities as alternative representations of themselves. Looking at forms of cosmopolitan identification, this paper focuses on individual agency as these women contested, resisted or empowered themselves against racialized and ethnicized global hierarchies of power.

T1  - Structure and Agency in Scholarly Formulations of Racism
AN  - 1125220382; 201240453
AB  - That the issue of racism is a pressing social concern which requires serious and detailed attention is, for ethnomethodology, not a first principle from which its own inquiry is launched but rather a matter to be considered in light of how mundane actors (both professional and lay) treat that very topic. This paper explores how the assumption of an ontological distinction between social structure and individual agency is integral to the intelligibility of racism as formulated in scholarly accounts. In particular, I explore how recent scholarly treatments of racism pose as problematic the diverse formulations of racial identity assembled through the deployment of various measures, and then seek to adjudicate upon the resulting inconsistency with an analytic heuristic that assumes an underlying or foundational source for the various expressions it seeks to resolve. Further, I explore examples of analytic work that makes use of first-person accounts of racially significant episodes and experiences as a means to document the formulation of the events and actions those accounts describe in terms that warrant a reading informed by the assumption of the structure-agency distinction. I relate the corroborative work that takes place in the research relationships between students and teachers with ethnomethodology's own project to explore how the efficaciousness of analytic readings of racism entail the pervasive assumption of the structure-agency distinction in order to be rendered them with the sense they have for the various participants involved.

T1  - The Symbolic Power of Color: Constructions of Race, Skin-Color, and Identity in Brazil
AN  - 875717071; 201115306
AB  - Some current cultural anthropologists define race as a social construct, yet explorations of the socio-historical constructions that give form and structure to racial identities perpetuating notions of "race" are rarely discussed. This study explores the theory of racial formations proposed by Michael Omi and Howard Winant as it applies to Brazil's racial project, arguing that Brazil's rhetoric on race and national identity during the late 19th to early 20th century culminated in a racial project ultimately known as democracia racial. As a result, I propose that Brazilian racial consciousness is symbolically pluralistic, encompassing race, social class, and social position, generating a particularly virulent, yet silent form of racism. I expand upon racial formation theory through analysis of my fieldwork carried out in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, in 2004. This analysis illustrates how contemporary Brazilian social structure and daily cultural discourses on race, skin-color, racial identity, and social marginalization reflect the nation's early racist ideology, yet contest its reality. Informants discuss self-identifications of skin-color, the meanings attributed to color tonalities, and the impact racism has on their daily lives. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigrant Suburban Settlement and the 'Threat' to Middle Class Status and Identity: The Case of Farmers Branch, Texas
AN  - 852898036; 201103178
AB  - In the United States, the failure to achieve immigration reform at the national level has resulted in numerous responses in local communities that have been most impacted by the settlement of new immigrants. Some of these responses have emerged in suburban communities that have experienced a rapid rise in the foreign-born population during the last twenty years. This essay offers an in-depth analysis of one such community, Farmers Branch, Texas, covered nationally for a series of anti-immigrant ordinances passed by its City Council. Following a description of the history of this community, the growth of its foreign-born population, and the legal manoeuvres to control unauthorized immigration, the essay argues that anti-immigrant legislation in local places like Farmers Branch is at its core a reflection of a debate about and anxiety over American identity - how it is defined and how it is changing. In particular, these responses are about a perceived threat to middle class status and identity. This is discussed first in relationship to issues of home ownership and income and then, in relation to cultural dimensions of class, including matters of taste and the spatializations of middle class identity. Finally, the paper unpacks the concept of 'rule of law'. By invoking the claim that Americans are law abiding while unauthorized immigrants have broken the law, lawfulness becomes an exclusionary tool and gives those who support anti-immigrant ordinances a platform for legislating a certain quality of life, and de-Americanizing those who do not fit their conceptualization of what it means to be American. Rule of law becomes a weapon in the fight for middle class status and the status quo. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Becoming black, becoming president
AN  - 902082845; 201122266
AB  - Speculation about the relationship between Barack Obama's election to the presidency and race in the United States was rife prior to, during and after his successful campaign. King looks at three aspects of this issue. First, as a kind of outsider, Obama had to prove himself black enough for African Americans of the traditional sort and not too dangerous for Whites. How did he achieve this? Second, Obama's election was made possible by changes in the voting behaviour of white Americans, particularly in the North, and the way that African Americans like Obama gained a foothold in, and at times control of, urban political machines, such as, in his case, Chicago. How have American historians treated this shift in white voting behaviour? Finally, the central question of how race still impinges on President Obama's performance as president. King concludes with a look at issues such as colour blindness and whiteness, the nature of black political identity and solidarity, and the variety of political roles from which a black leader such Obama can choose.

T1  - Inclusion of Afro-Descendents in Ethnic Data Collection: Towards Visibility
AN  - 896165444; 201120157
AB  - Afro-descendant civil society organisations in Latin America have pursued an important strand of advocacy on reforming national censuses. The aim has been to increase the visibility of Afro-descendant populations through disaggregated data and thus to improve recognition of their distinct identity. Brazil is leading the way on such data collection while other countries are taking first steps, like Argentina and Chile. International organisations have offered support in these efforts, including development agencies and human rights institutions. The census questions added have not always met the expectations of civil society, nor have civil society actors always agreed among themselves on the categories of self-identification. The 2001 World Conference against Racism has also played a key role by challenging the racial democracy myth, exposing racism as a factor in inequality and stimulating increased Afro-descendant social mobilisation.

T1  - An Assessment of Afro Centricism, Color-Blind Ideology, and Intersectionality
AN  - 887499948; 201118226
AB  - Some have argued that multiracial/multicultural congregations are the fastest growing types of large Christian churches in the United States today (Yancey 2003). In this multi-sited unobtrusive ethnography, I compare three churches to explore diverse meanings of church unity in the context of American color-blind society (Bonilla-Silva, 2007). Site 1, an African American Protestant evangelical congregation is distinguished by its coherence around black liberation theology. Site 2, a largely white Protestant evangelical leadership and multiracial congregation practices a color-blind approach. Finally site 3, an inclusive multi-racial church and pastoral staff works hard at maintaining its multi-racial/multi-cultural identity through a more intersectional approach to unity. The availability of resources for understanding, expressing, and mediating racial identity shapes the choices of members in these church settings concerning addressing cultural difference. And local context, educational attainment, and exposure of ministers and parishioners, all indicators of social isolation (as discussed by Emerson & Smith, 2000), contribute to this resource base. Despite efforts to build internal cohesion, some analysts may continue to criticize multiracial churches' slow progress toward eradicating color blind racism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - One America? President Obama's Non-Racial State
AN  - 1125217611; 201240431
AB  - The historic campaign and election of President Barack H. Obama is an unparalleled journey of race, politics and identity. During Obama's campaign, he was characterized as a race-neutral candidate, but when necessary emphasized his blackness to maintain the support of the African American community. The success of this strategy has raised new questions about America's capacity to transform the racial divide, new forms of racism and a new understanding of party politics. How do these complexities transcend into an administration that is responsive to the needs of minorities. This essay will assess the complexities of the Obama Administration and its policy implications for African Americans. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Nepalese Gurkhas and their battle for equal rights
AN  - 818801061; 201072157
AB  - For almost 200 years, Nepalese Gurkhas have played a key role within the British armed forces. The dynamics of this ongoing relationship are complex and in many ways characterised by enduring colonial constructs of race and identity. This article analyses this relationship, paying close attention to the discriminatory treatment afforded Gurkhas on matters such as pay and pensions, mobility within the chain of command and restrictions on their right to settle permanently in the UK. Initially it familiarises the reader with the origins of this relationship, exploring how colonial perceptions of the Gurkhas as a 'martial race' continue to occupy a powerful place in the public imagination. It goes on to examine the growing body of Gurkha litigation as a way of understanding why policies that institutionally discriminate against the Gurkhas have been allowed to persist. It contends that colonial constructs of difference continue to occupy the subtext of judicial reasoning and government law and policy vis a vis the Gurkhas. Finally, the article proposes some practical solutions to rectify some of the problems of discrimination Gurkhas continue to experience.

T1  - We all live in Germany but ... Ingroup projection, group-based emotions and prejudice against immigrants
AN  - 758123758; 201056788
AB  - Immigration, cultural diversity and integration are among the most central challenges for modern societies. Integration is often impeded by negative emotions and prejudices held by the majority members towards immigrants in a common society. Based on the ingroup projection model (Mummendey & Wenzel, 1999), we examined the impact of perceived relative ingroup prototypicality on intergroup emotions and prejudice. Additionally, we examined whether this impact is causal and explored the issue of causality in more detail contrasting a linear causal model with bi-directional or reciprocal causality. Hypotheses were tested in a study with a two-wave panel of majority members (N=1085) in Germany. We examined the proposed relations between relative ingroup prototypicality, intergroup emotions and prejudice and determined the causal direction of these relationships. Results support the predictive power of relative ingroup prototypicality on intergroup emotions and prejudice. Moreover, most causal relations between our measures are reciprocally causal. We discuss the implications of these findings for the general conception of prejudice and intergroup emotions. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Prosthetic white hyper-masculinities and 'disaster education'
AN  - 758122190; 201057050
AB  - Critiques of Whiteness Studies paradoxically focus on embodiment whether this is whiteness as an embodied identity that has realist properties or the inscription of labouring bodies through a process of racialization. In this article I consider the ways in which whiteness may be best understood as a prosthetic that can situationally be attached/detached from white bodies. Paradoxically, this flexibility of whiteness increases white people's powers of symbolic and material control over environments and the bodies of people of colour. In earlier work I have considered prosthetic whiteness to be mostly associated with ruling class masculinities. However, in certain contexts this ruling class discourse may become generalized. To examine how situationally this might be the case I examine survivalist and preparedness literature ('disaster education') that considers the racialized other to be embodied, mindless, bodies ('zombies') and surviving whites to be disembodied, primal, heroic agents. Using popular culture, public information films and the recent preparedness information in the UK on 'swine flu' I show how people of colour are positioned as non-agentic, static and (most significantly) as immobile and risky bodies as opposed to the portrayal of 'white' subjects in preparedness as mobile and able subjects whose genetic survival is at stake.

T1  - Cultural stereotypes of disabled and non-disabled men and women: Consensus for global category representations and diagnostic domains
AN  - 758122018; 201056809
AB  - Despite the fact that disabled people comprise a heterogeneous social group, cross-impairment cultural stereotypes reflect a consistent set of beliefs used to characterize this population as dependent, incompetent, and asexual. Using a free-response methodology, stereotypical beliefs about disabled men (DM) and women (DW) were contrasted against the stereotypes of their non-disabled counterparts illustrating the dimensions considered most diagnostic of each group. Results revealed that both disabled and non-disabled participants expressed consensus about the contents of group stereotypes that exaggerate traditional gender role expectations of the non-disabled while minimizing perceived differences between DM and DW. Implications for the field of stereotyping and prejudice, and the individual and system justifying functions of cultural stereotypes are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reactions to Ethnic Deviance: The Role of Backlash in Racial Stereotype Maintenance
AN  - 764420117; 201064644
AB  - Backlash effects are social and economic penalties for counterstereotypical behavior (Rudman & Phelan, 2008). Five experiments support a model of the role of backlash in racial stereotype maintenance from the standpoint of perceivers and actors (Rudman & Fairchild, 2004). In Experiment 1, perceivers sabotaged Asians and Whites for succeeding in counterstereotypical domains, thereby preventing their future success. In Experiment 2, a White rapper suffered prejudice and economic discrimination, relative to a Black rapper, and prejudice mediated discrimination. Further, actors threatened by backlash for achievement in cross-racial domains responded to success in ways that bolster ethnic stereotypes. For example, Black men and women who feared backlash for academic skill (Experiment 3), and non-Black (Experiment 4) and non-White (Experiment 5) men who experienced backlash for cross-racial achievement, resorted to defensive strategies that preserve racial stereotypes (e.g., refusing to publicize and pursue counterstereotypical talents). Implications for cultural stereotype maintenance are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

AB  - The identity 'Jew' can be religious or ethnic, or both religious and ethnic. This ethnographic case study of an emergent communal organization of young adult secular Jews explores the reconciliation of organizational issues when these two elements of identity conflict. Findings suggest that religious elements take priority over secular ones when inclusion in the broader Jewish community is a salient concern. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Slaughter in the suburbs': livestock slaughter and race in post-apartheid cities
AN  - 743066355; 201043191
AB  - The slaughter of animals is a fundamental aspect of the economic, social and spiritual life of many people in South Africa. Under apartheid, these events generally occurred in rural areas or urban townships designated for black people. Since the transition to democracy in the 1990s, increased suburban mixing has exposed established middle-class residents, notably white people, to cattle slaughter. The article explores the resulting public discourses on these events, such as condemnations, liberal appeals for tolerance and Africanist claims to citizenship and space. In addition, the article examines anxieties that some white people express in relation to the materiality of the slaughter of animals in residential areas. The article offers a multi-layered analysis of reactions to animal slaughter in relation to race, identity, difference, space and the place of animals and meat production in cities.

T1  - Learning to control ethnic intergroup bias in childhood
AN  - 743065769; 201043058
AB  - The aim of this research was to identify what factors deter explicit intergroup bias in childhood. Two studies were conducted to examine what facilitates the control of ethnic bias amongst 6-9-year-old majority children. In both studies in-group accountability was either low (i.e., only accountable to experimenter) or high (i.e., also accountable to classmates and teachers). Study 1 (n = 287) found that only 8-9-year-old with low social emotions reduced their bias with increased accountability. Study 2 (n = 236) showed children with low Theory of Social Mind (ToSM: Abrams, Rutland, Ferrell, & Pelletier, 2009), who perceived an anti-prejudice in-group norm, decreased their bias when accountability increased. In both studies children high in social emotion and ToSM showed low bias irrespective of accountability. Together these studies make a novel contribution by showing for the first time affective and social-cognitive factors that influence how children learn to control explicit bias.

T1  - At Home in the Caribbean Diaspora: "Race" and the Dialectics of Identity
AN  - 835111484; 201100438
AB  - Explores ethno-political identity in the English-speaking Caribbean & its Diasporas. Although being black was non-problematic in the early days of decolonization when most of the population was black, immigrants to European & North American cities where whites were the majority often suffered discrimination, a decline in social status, & a life filled with resentment. Following independence, ex-dentured East Indians, Chinese, Syrians, & light-skinned creoles in the Caribbean began to reassess their "blackness" & lighter skinned people were granted privileges not available to darker-skinned citizens. Meanwhile, black leaders who accepted the logic of capitalism ignored class critiques of capitalist structures of exploitation. The link between ideology & the politics of social control is discussed, along with the concept of Afrocentricity; consequences of racial mixing for Afrocentric consciousness; & Hindu nationalism which, like Afrocentricity, is seen as an ideological distraction. Other issues discussed include the impact of historical memory on the politics of identity; Indian nationalism in Trinidad; & mistrust between Hindus & Muslims which challenges claims of a diasporic Caribbean unity.
