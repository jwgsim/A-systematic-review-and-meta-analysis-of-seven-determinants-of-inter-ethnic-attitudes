T1  - Profiles of Racial Socialization Messages from Mothers and Fathers and The Colorblind and Anti-Black Attitudes of Asian American Adolescents
AN  - 2661728877
AB  - Racial equality requires coalitions and solidarity across racial groups, but there continues to be racially colorblind and anti-Black attitudes within the Asian American community, a diverse community consisting of individuals with ancestral origins in East, Southeast, and South Asia. However, there is limited research on the factors that contribute to the development of these attitudes among Asian Americans. Parents could potentially play an important role in perpetuating or challenging the colorblind and anti-Black messages that pervade U.S. society. Thus, the current study investigates how 309 Asian American adolescents’ (M age = 16.8; SD = 1.15; 50.5% female) perceptions of parents’ racial socialization messages about race and racism relate to the youth’s racial attitudes. Latent profiles of youth’s perceptions of mothers’ and fathers’ racial socialization messages and their associations with colorblind racial attitudes and anti-Black attitudes were examined. For mothers, three socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant, Race Hesitant, and Race Embracing; for fathers, two socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant and Race Embracing. Adolescents with Race Embracing mothers reported less anti-Black attitudes compared to those who had Race Hesitant mothers. For fathers, there were no differences among the profiles and anti-Black attitudes. However, surprisingly, adolescents with Race Embracing fathers were more likely to have colorblind racial attitudes compared to those with Race Avoidant fathers. The findings highlight the importance of racial socialization in the development of Asian American adolescents’ racial attitudes to continue fighting for interracial solidarity.

T1  - When White Americans see “non-Whites” as a group: Belief in minority collusion and support for White identity politics: GPIR
AN  - 2652815350
AB  - White Americans may find diversity threatening in part because they construe non-White Americans as a coherent social and political force. We argue that this perception manifests in a belief that minority groups collude against White people and that White people should act as a political bloc to defend ingroup interests. In a 3-year longitudinal study, the belief in minority collusion and support for White identity politics increased significantly among a nationally representative sample of 2,635 White Americans. Compared to White Democrats, White Republicans more strongly endorsed minority collusion beliefs and White identity politics, and increased more in these beliefs over time. Essentialist perceptions of the White ingroup were associated with longitudinal increases in minority collusion beliefs, but not in support for White identity politics. Endorsement of minority collusion and support for White identity politics both predicted lower support for Black Lives Matter and greater support for the Alt-Right movement. Implications for race relations, stigma-based solidarity, and the psychology of partisanship and ideology are discussed.

T1  - Racial Attitudes and Criminal Justice Policy
AN  - 2623521699
AB  - Empirical research on public policy preferences must attend to Whites’ animus toward Blacks. For a quarter-century, studies have consistently found that Kinder and Sanders’s four-item measure of “racial resentment” is a robust predictor of almost every social and criminal justice policy opinion. Racial animus increases Whites’ opposition to social welfare policies that benefit Blacks and their support for punitive policies that disadvantage this “out-group.” Any public opinion study that fails to include racial resentment risks omitted variable bias. Despite the continuing salience of out-group animus, recent scholarship, especially in political science, has highlighted other racial attitudes that can influence public policy preferences. Two developments are of particular importance. First, Chudy showed the progressive impact of racial sympathy, a positive out-group attitude in which Whites are distressed by incidents of Blacks’ suffering (such as the killing of George Floyd). Second, Jardina and others documented that Whites’ in-group racial attitudes, such as White identity/consciousness or white nationalism, have political consequences, reinforcing the effects of racial resentment. As the United States becomes a majority-minority nation, diverse in-group and out-group racial attitudes are likely to play a central role in policies—including within criminal justice—that the public endorses.

T1  - Good Cop, Bad Cop: Race-Based Differences in Mental Representations of Police
AN  - 2429413282
AB  - The current work investigates race-based biases in conceptualization of the facial appearance of police. We employ a reverse correlation procedure to demonstrate that Black Americans, relative to White Americans, conceptualize police officers’ faces as more negative, less positive, and more dominant. We further find that these differential representations have implications for interactions with police. When naïve participants (of various races) viewed images of police officers generated by Black Americans (relative to those generated by White Americans), they responded with greater anticipated anxiety and reported more fight-or-flight behavioral intentions. Across four studies, findings suggest Black and White Americans conceptualize police and police–citizen interactions fundamentally differently. These findings have important theoretical (e.g., using reverse correlation to document the mental representations held by minority group members) and practical implications (e.g., identifying race-based differences in representations of police that may affect community–police relations).

T1  - Episodic simulation reduces intergroup bias in prosocial intentions and behavior
AN  - 2389726589
AB  - People frequently feel less empathy for and offer less aid to out-groups in need relative to their in-groups. Most attempts aimed at reducing intergroup bias in helping emphasize group-focused cognitions and emotions. However, little is known about how the sensory properties of intergroup episodes informs intergroup decisions. Here we investigate whether episodic simulation (i.e., the ability to imagine events in a specific time and place) (a) increases participants' general willingness to help, and (b) decreases the difference in prosocial intentions and behavior toward in-group versus out-group targets. Experiment 1 revealed that imagining a helping episode significantly increased self-reported intention to help in-group and out-group targets, and eliminated the gap between groups relative to a control manipulation. Path modeling analyses indicated that the effect of episodic simulation was mediated by the vividness of the imagined episode and heightened perspective-taking for the target. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and ruled out reduced encoding of group membership as an explanation for the effect. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the effect of episodic simulation on prosocial intentions was distinct from the effects of imagining people (or contact with them). Experiments 4 and 5 replicated previous experiments with helping behaviors (i.e., writing in a letter of support to the victim of a misfortune; monetary donation to the person in need). These results shed light on a previously unexplored channel of group debasing and conflict reduction. We close by considering implications for future research at the intersection of episodic and intergroup processes.

T1  - Examining the relationship between intergroup relations and head start use in the south
AN  - 2357520897
AB  - This study examines how Black and Hispanic parents’ report of intergroup relations measured through group identity, linked fate, competition, and conflict are related to their utilization of Head Start services in a region that experienced Hispanic population growth. Surveys were conducted with 227 Black and 130 Hispanic parents in poverty in a mid‐sized city in the South. For Hispanic parents, a sense of linked fate within their ethnic group is associated with a lower likelihood of enrollment, however, measures of intergroup relations are not related to the Head Start enrollment status of Black parents. Implications for policies on preschool expansion are discussed.

T1  - Spontaneous imagined contact and intergroup relations: Quality matters
AN  - 2341199376
AB  - While research on experimental interventions that aim to improve outgroup attitudes via contact imagery grows, it is important to examine if contact imagery that occurs in spontaneous, non‐experimentally controlled conditions drives attitudes, and in what direction. To answer this, we constructed and validated a spontaneous imagined intergroup contact scale (SIICS) that differentiates between frequency, quality and elaboration of the spontaneous imagery of outgroups. In three correlational studies (NPortugal = 305, NUnited Kingdom = 185, NItaly = 276), we tested the role of spontaneous imagined contact frequency, quality and elaboration in predicting attitudes and social distance (Studies 1–3) and intended behaviour (Study 3) toward immigrant groups. Results demonstrated that spontaneous imagined contact quality consistently predicted key outcome variables above and beyond the other two dimensions. Importantly, the effects were significant while controlling for other potent forms of direct and indirect contact. Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed.

T1  - Pro‐peace or anti‐war: The effect of emotions primed by protest songs on emotions toward in‐group and out‐group in conflict
AN  - 2319730323
AB  - Members of societies in conflict hold stable positive and negative views, and emotions of the in‐group and out‐group, respectively. Music is a potent tool to express and evoke emotions. It is a social product created within a social and political context, reflecting, and commenting it. Protest songs aim to change views and attitudes toward ongoing conflicts. Their message may be expressed positively (pro‐peace songs) or negatively (anti‐war songs). Previous research has shown that evoking emotions such as guilt toward the in‐group or empathy toward the out‐group may influence attitudes toward reconciliation. The present research, conducted in Israel, presents three studies investigating whether emotions evoked by positive or negative protest songs may influence in‐group members' guilt toward the in‐group (Israeli Jews) and empathy toward the out‐group (Palestinians). Studies 1 and 2 show that negative emotions evoked by negative protests songs predicted both empathy and guilt when the out‐group is considered as a whole (Study 1) or as a particular individual (Study 2). Study 2 in addition showed that empathy predicts an altruistic decision regarding an out‐group member. Emotions evoked by lyrics alone (Study 3) did not contribute to explained variance in either guilt or empathy, nor the altruistic decision. Results suggest that negative emotions expressed by negative protest songs, focused on the in‐group, are more effective in influencing attitudes toward out‐groups. Results are discussed in the context of group emotions in conflict and the role of protest songs in intergroup relations.

T1  - In the name of truth: People's reactions to ingroup and outgroup members who self-disclose a severe error
AN  - 2336248703
AB  - Usually people consider morality traits to be highly valuable, both in themselves and in others. Moreover, they tend to select moral groups and are often motivated to protect the positive identity of their groups by derogating immoral ingroup members. However, sometimes even moral ingroup members could represent a threat to the group and therefore be negatively evaluated, such as in the case of people who report another person's wrongdoing (whistleblowing). To date an investigation of people's judgments of someone who self- disclose his/her own wrongdoing is still missing. Our study aims to investigate how group members react to an ingroup and an outgroup member who confessed to having committed a severe wrongdoing. Results of a study conducted by using a real episode concerning a surgeon who confessed a fatal error, confirm our expectation; even if medical students appreciated the confession of the surgeon, they are less positive in evaluating his behavior compared to other students.

T1  - The Relationships of Intergroup Ideologies to Ethnic Prejudice: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2252656494
AB  - This meta-analysis summarizes the results of research on the relationships of majority group members’ endorsement of assimilation, colorblindness, multiculturalism, and the relative relationships of colorblindness and multiculturalism to ethnic prejudice. Random effects analyses found that assimilation was positively related to explicit prejudice (g. = 0.80), multiculturalism was negatively related to both explicit (g. = −0.26) and implicit prejudice (g. = −0.19), and colorblindness was negatively related to explicit prejudice (g. = −0.07). Multiculturalism was more closely associated with low prejudice than colorblindness (g. = 0.15). Effect sizes varied as a function of methodology (experimental vs. correlational), country in which research was conducted (United States vs. other countries), and, in experimental studies of multiculturalism, type of prime used (abstract vs. concrete). Discussion points include methodological issues, groups used as targets of prejudice, national diversity norms, additional issues raised in the studies reviewed, and directions for future research.

T1  - Bridging Group Divides: A Theoretical Overview of the “What” and “How” of Gateway Groups
AN  - 2241816256
AB  - One of the most recent developments in the realm of intergroup relations is that of the gateway group notion. This conceptual framework addresses the potential of groups with multiple social backgrounds to play a role in the facilitation of positive intergroup relations between their distinct social counterparts (e.g., immigrants as a gateway between home and host countries). Given their shared identity with different social groups, people with multiple identities can potentially bridge the cleft between the two otherwise separate groups with which they are affiliated. In this article, we first provide a theoretical introduction to the gateway group notion and review preliminary experimental and social network‐based research on gateway groups' potential to improve intergroup relations. We then integrate this novel concept with the existing literature on intergroup contact and social categorization and discuss the potential social implications of gateway groups.

T1  - Perceptual Knots and Black Identity Politics: Linked Fate, American Heritage, and Support for Trump Era Immigration Policy
AN  - 2318743810
AB  - Since the 2016 U.S. presidential election, much ado has been made about how racial anxiety fueled White vote choice for Donald Trump. Far less empirical attention has been paid to whether the 2016 election cycle triggered black anxieties and if those anxieties led blacks to reevaluate their communities’ standing relative to Latinos and immigrants. Employing data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey, we examine the extent to which race consciousness both coexists with black perceptions of Latinos and shapes black support for anti-immigrant legislation. Our results address how the conflation of Latino with undocumented immigrant may have activated a perceptional and policy backlash amongst black voters.

T1  - Context and Change: A Longitudinal Analysis of Attitudes about Immigrants in Adolescence
AN  - 2334621425
AB  - Research has explored many different relationships between contextual influences, such as levels of immigration or economic condition, and attitudes about immigrants, with mixed results. These have largely been international comparative studies using cross-sectional data, therefore they have been unable to make claims about changes in environmental context translating to changes in attitudes of respondents. Furthermore, the previous literature has almost exclusively tested these relationships using data from adults, despite research showing that attitudes are most subject to change during adolescence. This study addresses these issues by using a longitudinal data set of repeated measures of 2,328 German adolescents (about 14–18 years old) over four response waves (2010–2014). Using a multilevel analysis, results show that contextual changes, including the percentage of foreign-born people and unemployment rates within respondents’ states, correspond to changes in attitudes toward immigrants consistent with group threat theory. These results were stable even when controlling individual-level factors.

T1  - When one’s group is beneficial: The effect of group-affirmation and subjective group identification on prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2087352669
AB  - In three experiments, we examined whether group-affirmation reduces prejudice against outgroups. In Experiments 1 and 2, White participants completed a test of abilities then were assigned to one of three affirmation conditions. Participants either received positive feedback about their ingroup’s performance, positive feedback about their personal performance, or no feedback. Participants then provided judgments toward Blacks. Across both experiments, participants who received the ingroup performance feedback expressed the lowest levels of anti-Black prejudice, but Experiment 2 indicated this effect was limited to strongly White-identified participants. In Experiment 3, we used a different group-affirmation procedure (writing about American values) and outgroup target (Middle Easterners). Among strongly American-identified participants, those who explained why a value was important for Americans expressed lower levels of prejudice against Middle Easterners compared to those in a control condition. We suggest that affirming one’s group—or social identity—can serve as a beneficial resource in the domain of prejudice.

T1  - Cultural Involvement and Preference in Immigrant Acculturation
AN  - 2010617738
AB  - Measures of cultural involvement (CI) and cultural preference (CP) incorporate Berry’s integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization outcomes, locating them at the ends of two axes suggested by Szapocznik et al. (International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 4 (3–4), 353–365, 1980) in a bidimensional space formed by origin culture and destination culture scales. Each measure combines information from both origin culture and destination culture scales, retains the continuous properties of these scales, connects two of the four-category acculturation outcomes, and has theoretical significance and potential comparability across studies of different immigrant populations. Together they offer a quantitative measure of variations in the structural relation between an immigrant group and its new destination culture, and should reveal new insights into the acculturation process.

T1  - The education of minorities in Bulgaria and Romania: Analyzing the formation and articulation of preferences
AN  - 2036642551
AB  - This paper investigates explanations in variation in the education-related preferences of comparable minorities in Bulgaria and Romania (i.e., Turks and Hungarians, respectively) as articulated by political, institutional, and civil society actors claiming to speak on their behalf. The study, which is based on original data extracted from 32 in-depth interviews, begins with a classification of the preferences that the interviewees articulated and the diverse arguments on which these were grounded. Subsequently, I turn to the potential explanations of the observed variation by examining a number of themes that emerged during the discussions and that also correspond to the factors usually considered in the literature on ethnic politics. These include the constraining effect of majority public opinion, the minorities' political representation, and notions related to the opportunities of exit and voice. I argue that actors' preferences adapt to the prevailing circumstances through an incremental process: before higher order preferences can be met or even conceived all the lower steps along the way have to be accounted for.

T1  - Sexism and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting in a Sample of Heterosexuals and Sexual Minorities: the Mediation Effect of Sexual Stigma
AN  - 2023984942
AB  - The present study aimed to: (a) investigate the relationship between attitudes toward same-sex parenting and sexism both in heterosexuals and sexual minorities; (b) verify whether sexism predicted negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting via the mediating role of sexual stigma (sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and internalized sexual stigma [ISS] in lesbians and gay men [LG]). An Italian sample of 477 participants (65.6% heterosexual people and 34.4% LG people) was used to verify three hypotheses: (a) heterosexual men showed higher levels of sexism than heterosexual women and LG people; (b) heterosexual men reported more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting than those of heterosexual women and LG people; and (c) sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people mediated the relationship between sexism and attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Overall, men and heterosexual people showed stronger sexist tendencies and more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Moreover, sexism affected attitudes toward same-sex parenting via sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people. These results suggest that negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting reflect sociocultural inequalities based on the traditional gender belief system and points to the necessity of social policies to reduce prejudice toward sexual minority groups.

T1  - Closing ranks: Ingroup norm conformity as a subtle response to threatening climate change: GPIR
AN  - 2016165884
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that climate change threat increases group-based cognition and action tendencies. As ingroups can provide extended primary control, we expected climate change threat to increase conformity with ingroup norms and group protective behavior. In three studies (N = 404), we experimentally manipulated climate change threat (Studies 1–3) and group norm content (Studies 2 and 3). We found that participants under climate change threat more strongly derogated group members who acted against the group’s interests (Study 1). When a specific group norm was made salient, both manipulated (Study 3) and perceived climate change threat (Studies 2 and 3) increased ingroup norm conformity. Importantly, this effect occurred for norms of radical left-wing behavior. This suggests that climate change threat does not necessarily induce a conservative shift. Instead, it elicits group-based defenses whose expression depends on which ingroup and which of its norms are salient.

T1  - More Inclusive States, Less Poverty Among Immigrants? An Examination of Poverty, Citizenship Stratification, and State Immigrant Policies
AN  - 2010932406
AB  - Over the last 20 years, policymaking related to immigrant populations has increasingly been conducted at the state-level. State immigrant polices may influence immigrant poverty by determining immigrants’ level of access to social, economic, political, and health resources and by shaping the social environment. Further, these immigrant policies may shape the stratification between citizens and noncitizens, potentially contributing to distinct patterns of disparities in poverty by both citizenship and race/ethnicity. To assess the relationship between immigrant policy and socioeconomic stratification of immigrants across citizenship status and race/ethnicity in the U.S., we combined data from the 2014 American Community Survey and a measure of level of inclusion of state immigrant policies. We estimated fixed-effects logistic regressions to test the associations between poverty and the interaction of level of inclusiveness, citizenship, and race/ethnicity, controlling for state- and individual-level characteristics. Results showed that there are significant disparities in poverty by citizenship status and race/ethnicity. Asian/Pacific Islander (API) noncitizens experienced lower levels of poverty in states with higher levels of inclusion. Both Latino and API citizens experienced lower levels of poverty in states with higher versus lower levels of inclusion. Among Latinos, the gap in poverty rates between noncitizens and citizens is larger in more inclusive than less inclusive ones, suggesting that the potential positive impact of more inclusive environments does not necessarily translate to the most vulnerable Latino group. The level of inclusion was not associated with differences among Whites and Blacks. Findings suggest that states with more inclusive immigrant policies may foster environments that advance the economic well-being of API noncitizens, as well as API and Latino citizens.

T1  - Nothing Compares to You: Prince and the Theory of Optimal Distinctiveness
AN  - 1945565951
AB  - Prince has left an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of people everywhere, not only in the USA but also globally. Using Marilyn Brewer’s optimal distinctiveness theory (ODT) as a framework, this article examines how Prince negotiated his social identity as an integral part of two worlds—(African Americans and the music industry) while standing apart from both. The optimal distinctiveness model posits that social identities derive from a fundamental tension between two competing social needs—the need for inclusion and the need for uniqueness. By utilizing Brewer’s model, we gain greater insight into Prince’s musicianship and business acumen.

T1  - Ethno-racial identity (politics) by law: "Fraud" and "choice"
AN  - 1925474191
AB  - Following an introduction to the changes in how ethno-racial identity is conceptualized in the social sciences and humanities by the destabilization of categorical frameworks, the author looks at how law reacts to these discussions and paradigm shifts, and argues that legal and administrative approaches face severe linguistic and conceptual limitations by operating within a "choice" and "fraud" binary. The article then questions if the free choice of identity exists as a principle of international minority protection law, a legal field that arguably represents a global political and ethical consensus. The author makes two claims. First, according to the basic tenet of legal logic, a proper right to free choice of identity allowing people to opt out of racial, ethnic, or national (minority) communities would necessitate the freedom to opt in to the majority or to any chosen group. The second claim, however, is that international law would not actually construct an approach to opting in. Thus, the right to free choice of identity is not an autonomous, sui generis right under international law.

T1  - Examining the Protective Effect of Ethnic Identity on Drug Attitudes and Use Among a Diverse Youth Population
AN  - 1914770463
AB  - Ethnic identity is an important buffer against drug use among minority youth. However, limited work has examined pathways through which ethnic identity mitigates risk. School-aged youth (N=34,708; 52% female) of diverse backgrounds (i.e., African American (n=5333), Asian (n=392), Hispanic (n=662), Multiracial (n=2129), Native American (n=474), and White (n=25718) in grades 4-12 provided data on ethnic identity, drug attitudes, and drug use. After controlling for gender and grade, higher ethnic identity was associated with lower past month drug use for African American, Hispanic, and Multiracial youth. Conversely, high ethnic identity was associated with increased risk for White youth. An indirect pathway between ethnic identity, drug attitudes, and drug use was also found for African American, Hispanic, and Asian youth. Among White youth the path model was also significant, but in the opposite direction. These findings confirm the importance of ethnic identity for most minority youth. Further research is needed to better understand the association between ethnic identity and drug use for Multiracial and Hispanic youth, best ways to facilitate healthy ethnic identity development for minority youth, and how to moderate the risk of identity development for White youth.

T1  - The changing interaction of ethnic and socio-economic segregation in England and Wales, 1991-2011
AN  - 1900462004
AB  - Following the publication of the 2001 and 2011 Census data, considerable attention has been given to patterns of ethnic residential segregation within the UK. The evidence contributes to debates about integration; however, as Kapoor (2013) has argued, discussion about it also risks promoting the idea that what we measure is voluntary segregation, arising from the outcome of residential choices and a preference to live with one's ethno-cultural peers. In reality, ethnic and social segregation overlap and are easily confounded; it is important to pay attention to where they geographically coincide. In this paper we use an area typology to assess whether minority ethnic groups are disproportionately concentrated in neighbourhoods in England and Wales containing the lowest proportions of their adult populations in full-time employment, and evaluate how those concentrations have changed between 1991 and 2011. We consider the (residential) exposure of the ethnic groups to the White British and also to each other, and identify the groups affected by the persistence of economic disadvantage. The analysis shows that patterns of ethnic segregation intersect strongly with neighbourhoods of socio-economic disadvantage, with inequalities in the labour market and the increase of part-time working suggested as contributing factors. A decreased exposure to the White British is an increased characteristic of the disadvantaged neighbourhoods where minority groups live. However, exposure between those groups has increased.

T1  - Cross-Border Marriages in South Korea and the Challenges of Rising Multiculturalism
AN  - 1897632250
AB  - This study explores trends in international marriage migration, determinants of international marriage, and factors that affect employment and poverty status of marriage migrant females in Korea. The results suggest that the number of cross-border marriages increased rapidly in the early 2000s but has declined since the mid-2000s, perhaps because of the Korean government's strict regulations and of saturation in the demand for foreign wives. The analysis also indicated that rural males with a graduate degree have a similar probability to urban males with a high-school education. Employment opportunities vary substantially by the foreign wife's country of origin, implying that social policies for addressing the difficulties of multicultural families should be tailored toward specific ethnic groups. Those who participated in work training programmes were significantly more likely to be employed than non-participants, and the size of social support network significantly reduced the odds of living in poverty.

T1  - Racial Residential Segregation and the Distribution of Health-Related Organizations in Urban Neighborhoods
AN  - 1906450481
AB  - Recent research has considered the role of racial/ethnic residential segregation as it relates to health and health care outcomes in the United States. In this article, I employ key theories of segregation and urban inequality to explain the spatial distribution of health-related organizations. Using data from the 2010 County Business Patterns and the U.S. Census in a series of spatial regression models, I examine the distribution of a variety of health-related organizations across the United States. I find that the concentration and clustering of racial/ethnic minorities (blacks and, to a lesser extent, Latinos and Asians) in urban neighborhoods is inversely associated with the number of health-related organizations, including food resources, physical fitness facilities, health care resources, civic associations, and social service organizations. The spatial distribution of health-related organizations could help to explain broader links between racial/ethnic minority segregation and health.

T1  - A Bourdieuian Analysis of Job Search Experiences of Immigrants in Canada
AN  - 1886222537
AB  - Drawing on qualitative interviews, this paper examines the labour market integration experiences of immigrants from Turkey to Canada. Analysis is framed in the context of Bourdieu's theoretical framework in order to understand the ways in which members of certain immigrant groups follow varied integration trajectories. This paper contributes to the literature by first focusing on the experiences of immigrants who arrived with varied levels of education and under different immigration classes, settling in diverse segments of the labour market and, second, by exploring strategies developed to deal with job search challenges. The findings show that capital and habitus travelled with participants from Turkey and that the intersection of their immigration status with the set of written and unwritten rules of the Canadian labour market and its subfields (both professional and non-professional) shaped their integration experiences.

T1  - Minority statuses and positive views of the country in the United States: an investigation of nativity/immigrant status, and racial/ethnic and religious backgrounds
AN  - 1877540831
AB  - Using a nationally representative sample of adults in the US, this study examines the majority and minority's positive views of the country in terms of nativity status, race and ethnicity, and religion. The results suggest that the majority-minority differences vary by demographic characteristics and attitudes examined. Although non-US citizens have a lower level of regard for the US as the best country in which to be a citizen than their counterparts, they have no less favourable views in other respects. Among ethnic minorities, only blacks have more negative views of the US than whites do. While religious minorities also have less regard for the country than the majority, individuals with no religious affiliation hold lower levels of most national attitudes. These findings suggest that the associations between minority status and views of the country go beyond race and ethnicity, which previous research has overlooked.

T1  - Interculturalism as a New Framework to reduce Prejudice in Times of Crisis in European Countries
AN  - 1876465467
AB  - With the socio-economic crisis that is affecting Europe particularly negatively, immigrants have been often reported as additional threats in the job market for established residents. Theories of prejudice, such as the Theory of Self-interest or that of the Perceived Group Threats, have suggested economic factors to explain these kinds of attitudes towards immigrants. More recently, some scholars have advanced theories of intercultural values to account for individuals' dispositions towards those perceived as newcomers. The aim of this work is to understand whether or not intercultural values are able to modify the effects that economic factors exert on prejudice in times of crisis. The main objective is to identify whether the kinds of values instilled within societies play a stronger role than other variables, particularly economic factors. The findings show that Interculturalism plays a much greater role than economic factors in influencing attitudes towards outsiders.

T1  - Interculturalism in Times of Crisis
AN  - 1876465452
AB  - This article locates the discussion of this Special Section within the wider analysis of Interculturalism and intercultural dialogue as a new way of framing dynamic inter-ethnic and broader community relations, and considering how perceived and real crisis affects both states' and societys' understandings of ethnicity, culture and diversity. Taking cases from Catalonia, Spain, the European Union, this Special Section's multi-level approach illustrates how intercultural dialogue can be developed at the sub-State, State, Region and international levels. By surveying the articles in the Special Section, this introduction critiques the Interculturalism framework and develops it. Crucially, drawing out insights from across these different types of groupings and from theorists offering a range of perspectives, this collection is able to offer new insights on Interculturalism, its relations with Multiculturalism, and forms of intercultural dialogue.

T1  - Examining Discrimination, Ethnic-Racial Identity Status, and Youth Public Regard Among Black, Latino, and White Adolescents
AN  - 1871509773
AB  - How positively adolescents believe others feel about their ethnic-racial group (i.e., public regard) is an important part of their ethnic-racial identity (ERI), which is likely informed by contextual and individual factors. Using cluster analyses to generate ERI statuses among Black, Latino, and White adolescents (n = 1,378), we found that associations between peer versus adult discrimination and public regard varied across ERI status and ethnic-racial group. However, among all adolescents, an achieved ERI (i.e., having explored ethnicity-race and having a clear sense about its personal meaning) buffered the negative association between adult discrimination and public regard, but not between peer discrimination and public regard. Implications for understanding the interplay between contextual and individual factors for public regard are discussed.

T1  - "Asianness" under Construction: The Contours and Negotiation of Panethnic Identity/Culture among Interethnically Married Asian Americans
AN  - 1862124401
AB  - Based on life-history interviews of interethnically married U.S.-raised Asians, this article examines the meaning and dynamics of Asian American interethnic marriages, and what they reveal about the complex incorporative process of this "in-between" racial minority group into the U.S.. In particular, this article explores the connection between Asian American interethnic marriage and pan-Asian consciousness/identity, both in terms of how panethnicity shapes romantic/marital desires of individuals and how pan-Asian culture and identity is invented and negotiated in the process of family-making. My findings indicate that while strong pan-Asian consciousness/identity underlies the connection among intermarried couples, these unions are not simply a defensive effort to "preserve" Asian-ethnic identity and cultur against a society that still racializes Asian Americans, but a tentative and often unpremeditated effort to navigate a path toward integration into the society through an ethnically based, albeit hybrid and reconstructed identity and culture, that helps the respondents retain the integrity of "Asianness."

T1  - The language of threat: Linguistic perceptions and intergroup relations
AN  - 1867932097
AB  - Inspired by sociolinguistic scholarship, this study examines the influence of linguistic vitality, the social health of a language, on perceived in-group threat and out-group attitudes. Using an experimental design that manipulated perceptions of the linguistic vitality of French in Quebec, this study sought to ascertain the causal role of linguistic vitality on intergroup attitudes. The results demonstrate that the type of information, positive or negative, about linguistic vitality influences perceptions of threat towards a language. However, results about linguistic vitality information’s impact on out-group attitudes, support for independence and subjective identity revealed inter-individual heterogeneity.

T1  - Adoption as a social marker: Innovation diffusion with outgroup aversion
AN  - 1851120979
AB  - Social identities are among the key factors driving behavior in complex societies. Signals of social identity are known to influence individual behaviors in the adoption of innovations. Yet the population-level consequences of identity signaling on the diffusion of innovations are largely unknown. Here we use both analytical and agent-based modeling to consider the spread of a beneficial innovation in a structured population in which there exist two groups who are averse to being mistaken for each other. We investigate the dynamics of adoption and consider the role of structural factors such as demographic skew and communication scale on population-level outcomes. We find that outgroup aversion can lead to adoption being delayed or suppressed in one group, and that population-wide underadoption is common. Comparing the two models, we find that differential adoption can arise due to structural constraints on information flow even in the absence of intrinsic between-group differences in adoption rates. Further, we find that patterns of polarization in adoption at both local and global scales depend on the details of demographic organization and the scale of communication. This research has particular relevance to widely beneficial but identity-relevant products and behaviors, such as green technologies, where overall levels of adoption determine the positive benefits that accrue to society at large.

TY  - JOUR
T1  - True Finns and Non-True Finns: The Minority Rights Discourse of Populist Politics in Finland
AN  - 1833978490
AB  - This article analyses minority rights discourse in statements of the populist radical right party called the True Finns, which has become a major political force in Finland in the 2010s. A framework for the analysis is provided by research about the development of political approaches to multiculturalism in Western democracies. Kymlicka (2010) argues that a backlash against multicultural policies has mainly occurred in relation to the acceptance of ethnic-cultural diversity among immigrant groups. Support for a backlash is found in the minority rights statements of the party. However, the political rhetoric of the party is not mainly about policies relating to immigrants, but basic principles of group-specific rights for minorities are also disputed. The article argues that the populist rhetoric has to be understood as related to fundamental discourses about majority and minority rights in developed welfare states.

T1  - Reproducing monocultural education: ethnic majority staff's discursive constructions of monocultural school practices
AN  - 1822486393
AB  - This paper investigates the role of ethnic majority staff in the perpetuation of monocultural education that excludes non-western, ethnic minority cultures and reproduces institutional racism in schools. Based on qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews in four ethnically diverse schools in the Flemish educational system, we specifically investigate the role of ethnic majority staff in the reproduction of monocultural school practices through a discursive theoretical lens. The study advances the current literature on institutional racism by showing how situated meanings of monocultural school practices at the micro level of individuals are discursively inter-linked with the macro-level monocultural model of education.

T1  - Loneliness, immigration background and self-identified ethnicity: a nationally representative study of adolescents in Denmark
AN  - 1814221973
AB  - Migration is an increasing worldwide phenomenon that creates multicultural societies with a growing number of adolescents who have experienced a process of migration or who have an ethnic background other than that of the majority. Migration may lead to loss of social relations and create challenges related to acculturation in the new country. These experiences may induce feelings of loneliness. Research on ethnic and migrant disparities in loneliness among adolescents is limited and inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to examine how adolescents' immigration background and self-identified ethnicity are associated, independently and combined, with loneliness. We used data from the Danish 2010 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey which included a representative sample of 3083 13- and 15-year-olds. The results suggest that immigrants but not descendants of immigrants have an increased risk of loneliness compared to adolescents with a Danish origin. The results also suggest that adolescents' self-identified ethnicity plays an essential role but differently for immigrants and descendants: identifying with the Danish majority was protective against loneliness among immigrants, whereas identifying with an ethnic minority group was protective against loneliness among descendants.

T1  - It's either you or me! Impact of deviations on social exclusion and leaving: GPIR
AN  - 1853502256
AB  - When detecting deviations from group norms, observers often respond by attempting to exclude the deviates or by leaving the group. Despite the commonalities between these two impactful responses, they have rarely been addressed simultaneously. Therefore, three experiments investigated how deviant behavior in small groups relates to observers' intentions to exclude the deviate from the in-group and to leave that group themselves. Exclusion intentions are evoked by severe deviations from core elements of the group norm, mediated by heightened identity subversion (Studies 1-3). Study 3 demonstrated that leaving becomes more likely when perceived situational control is low--here evoked by acceptance of the deviant behavior by other in-group members, suggesting that aggravating conditions must be present for this response. Observing deviations seems to trigger leaving and exclusion intentions, yet they result from two distinct processes. We discuss our results in relation to work on group schism and literature on social exclusion.

T1  - Creating a Rebuttable Presumption of Profiling in Cases of Alleged Profiling of Muslims and Other Minorities in Canada
AN  - 1827433530
AB  - This paper addresses the subject of profiling in the Canadian context both in the narrower and broader senses. It discusses the close connection between wider discretionary power and profiling; the need and justification of rebuttable presumptions and its constitutional basis and discusses possible ways to end profiling in line with the contextual analysis of equality under s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The paper proposes for the shift in the burden of proof away from a victim of profiling to the law enforcement authority-in an alleged case of profiling-in the context of a search, or an arrest, of a Canadian Muslim or member of other minorities by police and other law enforcement authorities, and demonstrating that such search or arrest was not motivated by race, religion, or ethnicity. Thus creating a rebuttable presumption of profiling against the law enforcement authority when they use their discretionary power in search or arrest of a member of a racial, religious, or ethnic minority group. A member of Canadian law enforcement authority against whom profiling is alleged can rebut the presumption by proving that race, religion, or ethnicity was not a factor in using their discretionary power to stop, search, or detain the alleged victim of profiling.

T1  - Perceived collective continuity and attitudes toward outgroups
AN  - 1828416995
AB  - In a series of six studies, we examined the role that perceived collective continuity (PCC) plays in intergroup attitudes. While the extant literature focuses on attitudes toward ingroups, the current studies chose to expand upon this research by concentrating on three types of outgroups (national, religious, and organizational). Results indicated that for groups perceived as neutral or positive, increased PCC was associated with more positive attitudes, while for enemy groups, increased PCC was associated with more negative attitudes. Entitativity played a mediating role such that as the outgroup was perceived as more continuous, it was also seen as more entitative. Higher entitativity led to less negative attitudes toward a past ally but more negative attitudes toward a past enemy. Results held whether past conflict and PCC were measured or manipulated, further supporting our findings. PCC has negative or positive implications for judgments of outgroups depending on intergroup history. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Using ethnography from a 1995 'race' crisis at Rutgers University, I show the applicability of George Bond's writings on inequality. Bond's ideas about social constructions of the past, organic ideologies, and people's acceptance of structures that subjugate them, are discussed to demonstrate the use of 'hoaxes' and clientage in the Rutgers episode. The discussion occurs in the broader context of theory about social inequality and social dominance.

T1  - Homeland (Dis)Integrations: Educational Experience, Children and Return Migration to Albania
AN  - 1789877303
AB  - Based on empirical research conducted in Albania, this article reports that educational experience and performance, and hence, integration of the children of (returned) migrants in their parents' homeland is obstructed by structural factors linked to the educational system. A finding such as this challenges the centrality of an essentialized notion of ethnicity in models of "second generation" integration and evidences the centrality of the nation-state, and the education system as one of its pillars, in the integration of migrants and their children. Comparative integration context theory appears to apply to the integration of children of returned migrants; yet it needs to take into account the mobile lives of migrants and their children, the transnational disjuncture between different educational systems, and the role of locality within the nation-state. Moreover, including children in analyses of integration, in the context of education, calls for the inclusion of life-course and scale in integration theories.

T1  - Ethnic discrimination in hiring decisions: a meta-analysis of correspondence tests 1990-2015
AN  - 1784417984
AB  - For almost 50 years field experiments have been used to study ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring decisions, consistently reporting high rates of discrimination against minority applicants - including immigrants - irrespective of time, location, or minority groups tested. While Peter A. Riach and Judith Rich [2002. "Field Experiments of Discrimination in the Market Place." The Economic Journal 112 (483): F480-F518] and Judith Rich [2014. "What Do Field Experiments of Discrimination in Markets Tell Us? A Meta Analysis of Studies Conducted since 2000." In Discussion Paper Series. Bonn: IZA] provide systematic reviews of existing field experiments, no study has undertaken a meta-analysis to examine the findings in the studies reported. In this article, we present a meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015. In addition to summarising research findings, we focus on groups of specific tests to ascertain the robustness of findings, emphasising differences across countries, gender, and economic contexts. Moreover we examine patterns of discrimination, by drawing on the fact that the groups considered in correspondence tests and the contexts of testing vary to some extent. We focus on first- and second-generation immigrants, differences between specific minority groups, the implementation of EU directives, and the length of job application packs.

T1  - Does assimilation work? Sociocultural determinants of labour market participation of European Muslims
AN  - 1784151480
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that even after controlling for relevant socio-economic background variables, the labour market position of immigrant minorities lags considerably behind that of natives. The label 'ethnic penalties' is often used to denote these gaps and reflects the idea that differences between natives and immigrants that cannot be explained by demographic and human capital variables must be due to discrimination by employers. I challenge this interpretation by looking at the role of sociocultural variables such as language proficiency, interethnic social ties and gender values as alternative sources of unexplained ethnic group differences. I use the data from the cross-national 'Eurislam' survey of four immigrant ethnic groups of predominantly Muslim belief-Turks, Moroccans, former Yugoslav Muslims and Pakistani-as well as native ethnics. The results indicate that once sociocultural variables are taken into account, differences in rates of labour market participation and unemployment between native ethnics and the Muslim groups are strongly reduced and in many cases become statistically insignificant. Using mediation analyses, I demonstrate that the findings do not fit a scenario that assumes that the causality primarily flows from labour market participation to sociocultural assimilation rather than the other way around.

T1  - Understanding Immigrant Population Growth Within Urban Areas: A Spatial Econometric Approach
AN  - 1760244837
AB  - During the last two decades, many studies have described the evolution of the spatial distribution of immigrant groups within an urban area (for example, by using segregation indexes). Nevertheless, the factors that could explain the growth of the immigrant population within an urban area have not yet been fully explored. Moreover, the studies referred to have mainly been conducted in countries that have traditionally received large populations of immigrants, such as the USA, Canada, the UK and Northern Europe. In regard to European cities, the case of the Barcelona metropolitan area (BMA) is particularly relevant: the percentage of immigrants in the total population has increased significantly within a very short period of time (from 5.05% in 2001 to 15.16% in 2008, 12.03% in 2013). Consequently, the main objective of this study is to examine the factors influencing the relative variation in the percentage of non-EU immigrants during the period of stronger growth (2001-2008). From a methodological point of view, we constructed two spatial models at the census tract level: the spatial lag and spatial error models. The predictors that we selected encompass several dimensions: socioeconomic status (unemployment, low education, household income and blue-collar workers), immigrant diversity (entropy), housing (small dwellings and condition of dwelling), and population density and distance to the central business district (CBD). According to the results of the spatial models, the most important factors explaining the growth of immigrant populations are, in descending order: household income, small dwellings and immigrant diversity.

T1  - When votes depend on who's listening: Voters' intragroup status and voting procedure predict representative endorsement in intergroup contexts
AN  - 1773420895
AB  - Three experiments investigated whether the selection of a representative in intergroup interdependence settings can reflect group members' strategic behaviour. We tested the impact of an individual's intragroup status (normative vs. pro-out-group deviant, Experiments 1-3) and of voting procedure (Experiments 2 and 3) on the choice of an in-group representative. Experiment 1 shows that normative members prefer normative representatives, whereas pro-out-group deviant members equally like normative and pro-out-group deviant representatives. Experiment 2 extends these results and shows that voting procedure (private vs. in-group audience) moderates this effect. Pro-out-group deviant members' preferences and behaviours appear more strategic and context-sensitive than normative ones. Specifically, pro-out-group deviants vote more for normative representatives than for pro-out-group deviants when facing an in-group audience, whereas the reverse pattern emerges in private. Experiment 3 shows that this moderation effect is specific to in-group audiences compared to out-group ones, reinforcing the idea that normative members 'stick to their guns'. Implications of these findings for leader endorsement and intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - Group Differences in Intermarriage with Whites between Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics: The Effects of Assimilation and Structural Constraints
AN  - 1748050453
AB  - This study examines the reasons for differences in the prevalence of intermarriage with Whites between racial minorities in 283 U.S. metropolitan areas. The analysis demonstrates that Asians have the highest and Blacks the lowest rate of intermarriage with Whites, with Hispanics falling in between. We tested two theories for these group differences. First, the structural explanation, which posits that differences in the relative size of each racial group in marriage markets affects their chances for intermarriage. Second, the assimilation explanation, which suggests that differences in social distance with Whites influences the propensity for intermarriage. The decomposition analysis shows that the cultural assimilation explanation is the primary reason for the Hispanic-Black gap in intermarriage. However, both explanations predict Black-Asian and Asian-Hispanic differences in intermarriage with Whites.

T1  - Race, Ethnicity, Sexuality, and Women's Political Consciousness of Gender
AN  - 1747611949
AB  - Existing research emphasizes the importance of group identification and perceived similarity in the development of group consciousness. Intersectionality suggests that for many women, a political consciousness of gender may also stem from experiences with race, ethnicity, and sexuality and may be interconnected with a consciousness of other forms of inequality. This study analyzes data from a recent national survey to investigate how race, ethnicity, and sexuality intersect with women's gendered political consciousness. Analyses reveal no support for the proposition that membership in racial, sexual, and ethnic minority groups significantly reduces women's gendered political consciousness. In addition, women who perceive high levels of racial, ethnic, or sexuality-based discrimination are more likely than other women to hold a strong political consciousness of gender. Results challenge the idea that gendered political consciousness emerges primarily from perceived similarity and highlight the need to conceptualize gendered political consciousness within the context of multiple inequalities.

T1  - A More Perfect Union? Christian Nationalism and Support for Same-sex Unions
AN  - 1752995704; 201600229
AB  - How do overlapping social identities shape Americans' views toward contemporary social and moral issues? Drawing upon national-level data and employing the theoretical construct of social identity complexity, we examine the link between Christian nationalism-representing a convergence of national and religious identities-and Americans' views toward same-sex marriage and civil unions. Multivariate analyses reveal that greater adherence to Christian nationalism is strongly and negatively related to support for both same-sex marriage and civil unions, even after controlling for political ideology, religious controls, attribution of homosexuality, and other relevant correlates. We argue that Christian nationalists, who by definition internalize a high degree of overlap between political and religious identities, are more likely to see gays and lesbians as out-groups and same-sex unions as a threat to their sense of self and community. We conclude by discussing the implications of this study for future research on political and religious identities and intolerance toward socially marginalized populations.

T1  - Assumed race moderates spontaneous racial bias in a computer-based police simulation
AN  - 1728660561; 201533975
AB  - We demonstrated that playing the roles of different outgroup races can elicit extrapersonal racial bias associated with respective racial groups. In a modified version of a computer-based police simulation, the police officer's race was visually manipulated to be either Black or White. Korean participants made quick decisions whether to shoot targets (Black or White, armed or unarmed) on screen. Comparison of behavioral bias in the task revealed that, as expected, playing the role of a White police officer was associated with a stronger bias against Black targets compared to playing a Black police officer's role. The result suggests that when a social category is activated, one's race-related behavior can reflect one's beliefs about the biases that members of that category hold.

T1  - Does Anti-Hispanic Bias Motivate Opposition to Non-English Languages?*
AN  - 1696068658
AB  - Contemporary political debates about language policy in the United States focus on three primary policy issues: bilingual education in public schools, English-only legislation, and the access of non-English speaking citizens to political rights. Using the "Multi-Ethnic United States" module from the 2000 General Social Survey (GSS), this article tests multiple attitudinal, behavioral, demographic, and contextual hypotheses for how Anglos and African Americans view bilingual policy issues. We examine the role of linguistic contact, self-interest, group threat, and discriminatory views of Latinos, finding that the latter--as measured by the "Three Ds" (Derogation, Disrespect, and Distance)--are the strongest predictors of attitudes toward bilingualism. Distance (social distance from Latinos) is consistently significant, disrespect (doubts about Latino contributions to the United States.) is mostly significant, and derogation (Latino stereotypes) is occasionally significant. Also, political ideology and knowledge of a non-English language play important roles in the formation of favorable bilingualism opinions. However, the self-interest and group threat variables were largely insignificant. Taken together, these findings indicate the importance of understanding how policy views may be structured by opinions about out-group individuals and cultures. Language can serve as a proxy for immigrants themselves, as negative attitudes toward Latinos are associated with negative attitudes toward bilingualism.

T1  - Applying individuation to conflicting social categories: GPIR
AN  - 1933572558
AB  - The ability to differentiate individuals from their group memberships (individuation) is useful in forming impressions when social categorization fails to do so. This method is particularly valuable when encountering incongruent social category conjunctions (e.g., female bricklayer). We tested the notion that individuation is initiated when applying cognitively effortful explanatory, emergent attributes to incongruent conjunctions. Incongruent category conjunctions were more likely to be comprised of emergent attributes and individuation moderated the application of these attributes in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, individuation again moderated emergent attribute application for incongruent conjunctions, but cognitive load attenuated the relationship. Allowing or preventing the generation of attributes did not affect individuation for incongruent conjunctions in Experiment 3. This ruled out the possibility that emergent attributes cause increased individuation, but does not rule out the notion that individuation precedes such explanatory attributes. Together these findings suggest that individuating those whose category memberships clash may be applied in the effortful application of explanatory emergent attributes.

T1  - Social Isolation Among Racial/Ethnic Minority Immigrant Youth
AN  - 1735658429; 201536844
AB  - Despite the long sociological tradition that focuses on the social adaptation of racial/ethnic minority immigrant youth, little work investigates whether these groups are socially isolated. However, existing research provides a strong foundation from which researchers can further explore this important topic. This article begins by discussing relevant theories and ongoing debates regarding minority immigrant youth's social relationships. Next, the article surveys literature across social science disciplines that describes relationships minority immigrant youth have (or in some cases, do not have) with three important social actors: their peers, teachers, and parents. The article concludes by providing recommendations for future research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Compensation in intergroup relations: An investigation of its structural and strategic foundations
AN  - 1700676238; 201524939
AB  - Recent work in intergroup relations stresses the role of two fundamental dimensions, competence and warmth, which organize the perception of social groups. A pattern often encountered in people's ratings is one of compensation in that a group that is evaluated higher than another group on one of the two fundamental dimensions is also judged lower on the other fundamental dimension. Based on Social Identity Theory, the present work extends previous research on compensation by examining boundary conditions as well as underlying psychological processes. Two studies involving experimental and correlational evidence, minimal and real groups, and different kinds of conflict, reveal that compensation is more likely when the groups are in asymmetrical relation and share a cooperative view of the intergroup setting. Our data also suggest that, among members of low status groups, compensation is associated with social creativity. In contrast, and in line with the 'noblesse oblige' effect, members of the high status group would seem to rely on compensation as a means to appear non-discriminatory.

T1  - Legitimating Contexts, Immigrant Power, and Exclusionary Actions
AN  - 1728660709; 201534085
AB  - In multi-ethnic nation-states, opposition to immigration has manifested itself in attitudes and behaviors. Past research has typically focused on anti-immigrant attitudes, and relied on threat and competition theories to explain patterns in such attitudes. These theories suggest that perceived threats stemming from new influxes or large concentrations of immigrants should prompt dominant groups to protect their interests, leading to anti-immigrant attitudes. We extend the literature with a focus on anti-immigrant activity, and introduce the legitimating contexts model, which argues that dominant groups may actually hesitate to engage in exclusionary public actions in places where the political and demographic strength of immigrant and ethnic groups is strong. In contrast to theories of group threat, we contend that in contexts with low levels of immigrant political power and demographic strength, anti-immigrant activity is less likely to be noticed, let alone challenged, and thus more likely to become part of the status quo. Extending political opportunity theory, we also claim that conservative elites and voters in local areas coupled with low levels of threat further legitimate anti-immigrant activity. We test these ideas using a new data set of exclusionary action targeted at immigrants in over 50 U.S. metropolitan areas. In support of the legitimating contexts model, we find that low levels of demographic and political threat - when immigrants enjoy less power - alone and coupled with a higher share of conservative voters act to legitimate and encourage restrictive events on the part of noninstitutional actors.

T1  - 'We have no quarrel with you': Effects of group status on characterizations of 'conflict' with an outgroup
AN  - 1700676237; 201525034
AB  - In three studies, we examined the effect of intergroup status on group members' tendencies to characterize the ingroup's relationship with an outgroup as conflictual following outgroup action. Findings from all three studies supported the prediction that the intergroup relationship would be characterized as less conflictual when the ingroup had relatively high rather than low status. Consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of status reflects strategic concerns, it was moderated by the perceived relevance of the outgroup's action to intergroup status relations (study 1), it was sensitive to audience (study 2), and it was partially mediated by status management concerns (study 3). The role of strategic, status-related factors in intergroup relations is discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Hate groups targeting unauthorized immigrants: discourses, narratives and subjectivation practices on their websites
AN  - 1722763439
AB  - The narratives and images on websites of US hate groups that oppose undocumented immigrants represent and reproduce discourses that contribute to the subject formation of group members, who feel ethically obliged to counter unauthorized immigration. Left alone by the government, which is seen as unreliable and uncaring of patriotic values, they position themselves as heroic saviours of the nation. We argue that these hate groups' 'games of truth' develop in response to the perception that irregular immigration threatens specific social orders and values, for instance about citizenship, national identity and otherness. This article helps to understand the ways in which anti-immigrant narratives serve the functions of countering these threats and of asserting the group members' ethical obligation as a form of care of the self. In other words, from a Foucaultian viewpoint, we interpret the problematizations of 'illegal' immigration as discursive practices for the subject formation of hate group members.

T1  - The work of Sisyphus: Squaring the circle of Roma recognition
AN  - 1700674320; 201525334
AB  - Most special issues on Roma minorities want to alert readers to the devastating consequences of racist public attitudes and misdirected public policy. Here we don't shy away from such issues, but we also want to challenge our own scholarship and ask some fundamental questions about how we, as academics, are approaching such research. In this introduction the context of the special issue is explored, both in terms of the historic backdrop of an expanding European Union and the academic theoretical framework of minority integration. Major critical questioning - such as broader questions around migration, race and ethnicity discourses - are still lacking when it comes to research on or with Roma minorities. Our main aim is to move debates on from continually describing who Roma people are and what they are doing, to questioning: who defines who is Roma, when and why? What happens in policy-making, research, everyday interactions? This approach sees an understanding of recognition, representations and power dynamics as fundamental to understanding the positionings of minorities who can also be marginalised or feel disenfranchised. This introduction to the special issue highlights the importance of deeply conceptualising issues around minority integration alongside empirical knowledge of how Roma identities become implicated in and through different modalities of mobilisation. Contributions to this special issue speak to debates in minority politics and identity studies along with migration and race/ethnicity discourses. This indicates that the experiences of, and discourses surrounding Roma minorities reflect the fundamental concerns of social science research about identity, ethnicity, cohesion and change.

T1  - Order of actions mitigates hypocrisy judgments for ingroup more than outgroup members
AN  - 1700674490; 201524880
AB  - Compared to the conventional order of hypocritical actions-saying one thing and then doing another-merely reversing the order of these actions can mitigate whether an individual is judged to be a hypocrite (Barden, Rucker, & Petty, 2005). The present research examines how factors extraneous to a target's own actions-specifically, group membership-influence hypocrisy judgments. Three experiments provided consistent evidence that reversing the order of statement and behavior mitigated hypocrisy judgments to a greater extent when observers judged ingroup targets compared to outgroup targets. This pattern was observed across two distinct groups (i.e., gender and political party). In addition, mediational evidence suggested that the greater mitigation for ingroup targets stemmed from the observer's greater tendency to make attributions that ingroup targets had genuinely changed for the better.

T1  - 'Telling the Brown Stories': An Examination of Identity in the Ethnic Media of Multigenerational Immigrant Communities
AN  - 1551001354; 201429092
AB  - Ethnic media models tend to categorise ethnic news media as alternative, diasporic, community or ethnic minority language media. This paper argues for a different way of looking at Pasifika news media that recognises identity as a dominant force in their construction and practice. Through analysis of the producers' discursive practices and the texts of two major Pasifika media in Aotearoa/New Zealand-Tagata Pasifika and Spasifik-this paper finds that identity work lies at the heart of what Pasifika news media do. Producers deliberately set out to do Pasifika identity and be the Pasifika voice: about and for all Pasifika. Yet, the texts studied here suggest that by emphasising identity, Pasifika news media risk falling back on well-established, often racialised, versions of Pasifika identity that misrepresent the diverse and shifting identities of New Zealand's Pasifika population, especially its New Zealand-born youth. An examination of ethnic minority news media in identity terms, then, can usefully illuminate powerful production forces, including the influence of minority communities and their elites on ethnic minority media.

T1  - Self-representation and ethnic minority rights in China
AN  - 1551002553; 201429095
AB  - Proposals to reform along liberal lines China's system of discrete minority rights, such as ethnic regional autonomy and preferential policies, seek to 'depoliticize' minorities by treating them as cultural groups whose members have individual, but not collective, rights. Beyond the binary of only individual rights or no change, a third option is to expand minority rights, including through their self-representation. Not self-determination, which is inapplicable to minorities, self-representation can be based on structures that allow minority people to take up their histories and cultures, ethnic disparities, and their position in China's political leadership. Organizations of self-representation need not be counterposed to the state and can address non-elite concerns in ways that promote minority participation in China's governance and minority integration, not assimilation.

T1  - The Importance of Image Management for a Good Society
AN  - 1665210261
AB  - The paper deals with the importance of managing the image of a private or public organization and of any government, especially. There are underlined two important matrix used in the image and communication field and in the management field. The paper shows how these two matrices can be applied by a Government that wants to lead the mass people to a good society. Comparison and analogy are used as scientific methods together with the direct experience of the author as a private manager of the first private television after 1989, SOTI TV. For a good society, the Government must search continuously the needs, expectations, desires and aspirations for the mass people and find the dynamic ratio between individual and collective mind together with the signals of changing between different ways of thinking: PRO, AGAINST and NEUTRAL. The result is that in the end, the public opinion is moving from AGAINST to PRO, regarding the Government's decision, even it is an unpopular decision. Why this paper? As politician, as civil servant working within a public organization and as a member of the government, all must know the difference between myth and reality and all must improve the power to manage the image in order to become more consciousness about their own free will against so easily manipulation in a consumer society..

T1  - Defining difference: the role of immigrant generation and race in American and British immigration studies
AN  - 1531932706; 201423397
AB  - This article reviews the ways in which Britain and the USA classify and analyse the integration of immigrants and their descendants. While both societies recognize racial differences in their official statistics and in the academic analyses of change over time, the USA tends to classify immigrants and their descendants by immigrant generation much more than Britain does. The importance of the concept of generation in American immigration research is highlighted and it is suggested that studies built on the importance of generation can illuminate social processes of integration in Britain. The complexities of defining and measuring immigrant generation are reviewed, including new developments in the measurement of generation that take into account age at migration, and historical period and cohort effects. Racial and ethnic minority groups formed through immigration may have very different characteristics depending on the average distance of their members from immigration -- including the possibility of 'ethnic leakage', as more assimilated, later-generation individuals no longer identify with the group.

T1  - Constructing racial difference through group talk: an analysis of white focus groups' discussion of racial profiling
AN  - 1512220677; 201408748
AB  - Overtly racist statements are socially and politically unacceptable in the USA. Yet black people in the USA continue to experience discrimination and prejudice at both the individual and institutional levels. This paper examines white people's talk about race in focus groups from the North Carolina Traffic Violation Study. The participants discussed race obliquely, by talking about hypothetical behaviour related to crime and police profiling while largely avoiding direct mention of race. At the same time focus group members voice different expectations for white people and black people. By differentiating between behaviours expected from individuals perceived to belong to different racial groups, they reproduced racial difference. Focus group members legitimized racial profiling and did so using language that was largely 'colour-blind' and socially acceptable by attributing the disproportionately high rate of stops for black drivers to ostensibly non-racial factors. The groups used mostly colour-blind language, but the result was racializing discourse. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Assessing the effect of social desirability on nativism attitude responses
AN  - 1559007195; 201431977
AB  - Attempts to measure and analyze public opinion attitudes toward racial/ethnic minorities often confront the 'social desirability' problem: those who have prejudiced attitudes are rarely willing to admit them to surveyors. Instead, they may be more likely to give a socially acceptable answer rather an accurate reflection of their views. Previous research has clearly established that this effect presents a challenge for accurately measuring self-reported racial and policy attitudes that primarily affect African-Americans. It is less clear, however, how it might affect self-reported responses to attitudes dealing with Latinos and immigration. This study thus seeks to analyze the extent to which social desirability may affect survey measures of perceived levels of cultural threat (nativism). Results from two separate analyses using the Crowne-Marlowe 'social desirability scale' and a survey 'list experiment' demonstrate that social desirability is indeed a concern for accurately measuring nativism in the American public, but that it exerts an opposite effect from what has previously been observed: nativist attitudes tend to be over-reported in opinion surveys.

T1  - National identification, perceived threat, and dehumanization as antecedents of negative attitudes toward immigrants in Australia and Canada
AN  - 1433108488
AB  - The interplay of nationalistic threat perceptions, dehumanizing beliefs and intergroup emotions, and anti-immigrant sentiment is analyzed in a cross-national context with Australian (N=124) and Canadian (N=126) samples. National identification was linked to negative attitudes toward immigrants indirectly, via perceptions of immigrants as being in threatening zero-sum relationships with citizens. In turn, perceived zero-sum threat was associated with dehumanizing beliefs and emotions about immigrants. Significant baseline differences in hostility were observed across the samples, but the relationships among the variables were not moderated by participants' nationality. The study contributes to the literature examining how negative emotions and attitudes may serve to legitimize intergroup competition.

T1  - Understanding disagreement within the majority about action to atone for past wrongs
AN  - 1433108420
AB  - Policies atoning for past wrongs against minority groups are often contested within the majority. During the year after the apology to the Indigenous Australian Stolen Generations, predictors of non-Indigenous (majority) collective action intentions focusing on support or opposition to reform reconciliation policies (Study 1, N=206) and compensation to the Stolen Generations (Study 2, N=215; Study 3, N=298) were examined. Action was analyzed as a function of national identity, opinion-based group identity, group-based guilt, political orientation, and collective efficacy. Opinion-based group identification was an independent predictor of action for all groups except for anti-compensation, where efficacy strongly predicted action. Findings highlight opinion-based groups' role in capturing the fault lines of disagreement within majority groups.

T1  - An Intersectional Approach to Black/White Interracial Interactions: The Roles of Gender and Sexual Orientation
AN  - 1357005952
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Although researchers have long advocated taking an intersectional approach in order to better understand how race, gender, and other social identities influence social experiences, this approach is only beginning to take hold in the interracial interaction literature. This paper describes the importance of considering gender (as well as other social identities, such as sexual orientation) in addition to race in the context of Black/White interracial interactions in the United States. The role of prior experience is discussed (i.e., encounters with prejudice at the intersection of race and gender, gender differences in the content of racial stereotypes, and the sometimes-conflicting messages of racial and gender socialization). The ways in which gender and racial identities interact with situational aspects of interracial interactions are also considered. Finally, the current representation of gender in the interracial interaction literature is reviewed, and recommendations for future research are provided, including techniques for recruiting racial minority participants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Immigrant and Ethnic Minority Representation in Europe: Conceptual Challenges and Theoretical Approaches
AN  - 1567049000; 201435076
AB  - This article introduces the symposium on the representation of immigrant-origin and ethnic minorities in Europe. It argues for the importance of research on this topic, noting the large, established populations of immigrant-origin citizens and their descendants across Western European countries and these minorities' underrepresentation in elected bodies. Current research gaps concern both empirical knowledge and the theoretical conceptualisation of immigrant and ethnic minority political involvement. The article argues that existing research on representation needs to be extended to suit the cases of immigrants and ethnic minorities. It ends by providing a brief overview of each contribution to the symposium. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Essentializing race: Its implications on racial categorization
AN  - 1347782536; 201318687
AB  - Racial classification has drawn increasing attention in public discourse; it intertwines with issues related to racialized perceptions. However, few social psychological studies have systematically examined racial categorization processes and their implications for interracial relations. In 5 studies, we investigated the role of racial essentialism in influencing several important psychological aspects of racial categorization. Results linked the belief in racial essentialism to an increased tendency to engage in race-based categorization (Studies 1-3) and greater sensitivity in discerning racial group membership (Studies 4-5). These results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding and managing interracial relations in the United States. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - "Too Asian?" or the Invisible Citizen on the Other Side of the Nation
AN  - 1322723690; 201310739
AB  - In November 2010, Maclean's magazine published a provocative article "Too Asian?" which aroused hot debate and critique from various social groups. However, its racist nature and the role of media in reinforcing racial stereotypes, manufacturing consent, and naturalizing unequal power relations has not been examined in a systematic way. Using critical discourse analysis, this paper aims to reveal its ideological and hegemonic function in constructing unequal social identities and social relations which consequently prevents racialized minorities from accessing post-secondary educational opportunities. Four themes are identified and discussed here. First, the "Too Asian?" article reinforces an Us/Them division and a "forever foreigner" identity of racialized minorities. Second, it essentializes ethnic culture and identifies culture rather than structural constraints as an explanation for individual social behaviors. Third, it represents "Asian" students as self-segregationists who should be blamed for their own exclusion. Last, but most important, it aims to justify white privilege in the field of post-secondary education by questioning the idea of meritocracy as university admission criteria and suggests maintaining "WASP Credentials.".

T1  - Health Status among Black Canadians: Results from a National Survey
AN  - 1494300595; 201402070
AB  - This study obtained nationally representative estimates of health-related indicators among native-born Black Canadians, and compared these estimates with those of native-born White Canadians. Data came from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2003-2008). Outcomes included smoking status, general health status, body mass index, and chronic conditions (i.e., asthma, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to obtain unadjusted and adjusted period prevalence estimates for Black and White survey participants, and to determine the magnitude of health inequalities between racial groups. Estimates were adjusted for various socio-demographic factors to account for potential confounding. After adjustment, Blacks had about 50% lower odds of being current or former smokers (p < 0.0001 for both), 60% lower odds of having cancer (p < 0.01), and 70% lower odds of having heart disease (p < 0.0001), relative to Whites. There were no statistically significant differences across the two racial groups for the remaining health status indicators. Native-born Black Canadians report comparable or better health status relative to their White counterparts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Boomerang Effects in Science Communication: How Motivated Reasoning and Identity Cues Amplify Opinion Polarization About Climate Mitigation Policies
AN  - 1463014786; 201346375
AB  - The deficit-model of science communication assumes increased communication about science issues will move public opinion toward the scientific consensus. However, in the case of climate change, public polarization about the issue has increased in recent years, not diminished. In this study, we draw from theories of motivated reasoning, social identity, and persuasion to examine how science-based messages may increase public polarization on controversial science issues such as climate change. Exposing 240 adults to simulated news stories about possible climate change health impacts on different groups, we found the influence of identification with potential victims was contingent on participants' political partisanship. This partisanship increased the degree of political polarization on support for climate mitigation policies and resulted in a boomerang effect among Republican participants. Implications for understanding the role of motivated reasoning within the context of science communication are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The importance of group identity processes in involvement in social movement organizations: the case of Attac France and Germany
AN  - 1173140564
AB  - This research evaluates the relative and absolute importance of group identity processes in an individual's decision to become and remain active in a social movement organization (SMO). Mainly through interview research with the members of Attac Germany and France, I discover that the presence of a comfortable and communicative group atmosphere is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for movement activity. Individuals are primarily involved in SMOs because they want to change policy and public opinion or to give meaning to their lives. However, this does not imply that the activists devalue communal bonds and a welcoming group atmosphere. Rather, they take both as a prerequisite for engagement. Yet, rifts and atmospheric disruptions can be a sufficient cause for which people leave an organization. In particular, those members who seek policy change are quick to desert a group once it is shattered by internal disharmony. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'Rallying around the flag': Can an intergroup contact intervention promote national unity?
AN  - 1283641768; 201303110
AB  - A longitudinal study evaluated the success of a contact-based nation-building intervention (the Malaysian National Service Programme) in promoting various facets of national unity. The study assessed how post-test measures of quality of intergroup contact, outgroup evaluations, and levels of identification changed compared to their respective pre-test levels, for both National Service and control group participants. The intervention did not lead to a worsening of any of the constructs related to intergroup relations, which is noteworthy given the novelty for many participants of mixing in a multi-ethnic setting. Furthermore, all rater groups (Malays, Chinese, and Indians) maintained their ethnic identity, even in the presence of high levels of national identity, which we discuss with respect to past research on the effects of positive intergroup contact on minority group identification. However, the changes associated with the intervention yielded only small effect sizes, and, on the whole, National Service participants did not show significantly greater improvement than that experienced by control participants. We discuss the value of intergroup contact in this novel setting, considering various features of this programme that may have limited its effectiveness and discuss how such interventions can more successfully meet their goals.

T1  - Who is a "Deserving" Immigrant? An Experimental Study of Norwegian Attitudes
AN  - 1081865429; 201235150
AB  - Previous research demonstrates that opposition to immigration increases when immigrant groups are seen as economically non-viable and burdened with distinctive and unassimilable cultural practices. However, no research to date has investigated the parallel relationship between attributes of individuals and willingness to admit these individuals as legal immigrants. This study examines Norwegians' evaluations of individual immigrants. Using an experimental design, specific attributes of immigrants are manipulated, making them appear more or less likely to make an economic contribution and more or less likely to assimilate into Norwegian culture. It is found that the decision to admit individuals is predominantly influenced by the immigrant's economic background. Norwegians are especially supportive of highly skilled immigrants. The immigrant's race is also relevant, but the effect of racial cues varies between men and women. Immigrants with an Afrocentric appearance are more likely to be rejected by men, but accepted by women. The article recommends that immigration researchers measure public support for immigration at both the policy and individual immigrant levels. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Latinos' Perceptions of Interethnic Couples
AN  - 1023026942; 201223847
AB  - Numerous survey findings indicate that the majority of White Americans are accepting of interracial romantic relationships. However, relatively few studies have looked at how different American ethnic minority groups view such relationships. The current research examined Latinos' evaluations of intraethnic and interethnic couples. Latino participants (N = 207) read information about either a Latina-Latino, Latina-White, or Latina-Black romantic couple. The results indicate that the Latina-Black couple was evaluated less positively than the Latina-White couple on relationship quality and less positively than the other two couples on perceptions of social support. Latino men were especially likely to express negative emotions toward the Latina-Black couple compared with Latina women. The results are discussed in the context of intergroup relationships.

T1  - Ethnic Minorities and Integration Process in France and the Netherlands: An Institutionalist Perspective
AN  - 1023027635; 201223835
AB  - This article examines the ethnic minorities integration policies as implemented in France and the Netherlands. This study will be based on an institutionalist approach relying on North's analytical framework in order to explain the recent changes in these policies. I emphasize the existence of four patterns of social integration: reciprocity, redistribution, exchange, and coercion. I will also be insisting on the importance of ideology and the way it has evolved over time. This theoretical framework is then used to "tell the story" of the two countries. While France's historical and ideological backgrounds have forced it to adopt a universalist view and fight against communautarisme, the Dutch position was quite different as it does not deny the ethnic minorities cultural and religious freedom. Nevertheless, there is a hardening of the dominant ideology taking place in France. As to the Netherlands, there is a noticeable shift in the government's attitude toward ethnic minorities.

T1  - Racialized Customer Service in Restaurants: A Quantitative Assessment of the Statistical Discrimination Explanatory Framework
AN  - 1018359203; 201212827
AB  - Despite popular claims that racism and discrimination are no longer salient issues in contemporary society, racial minorities continue to experience disparate treatment in everyday public interactions. The context of full-service restaurants is one such public setting wherein racial minority patrons, African Americans in particular, encounter racial prejudices and discriminate treatment. To further understand the causes of such discriminate treatment within the restaurant context, this article analyzes primary survey data derived from a community sample of servers (N=200) to assess the explanatory power of one posited explanation-statistical discrimination. Taken as a whole, findings suggest that while a statistical discrimination framework toward understanding variability in servers' discriminatory behaviors should not be disregarded, the framework's explanatory utility is limited. Servers' inferences about the potential profitability of waiting on customers across racial groups explain little of the overall variation in subjects' self-reported discriminatory behaviors, thus suggesting that other factors not explored in this research are clearly operating and should be the focus of future inquires.

T1  - How intergroup friendship works: A longitudinal study of friendship effects on outgroup attitudes
AN  - 1018342788; 201212797
AB  - Cross-sectional research has shown that frequency of self-disclosure to outgroup members mediates the positive relationship between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. The current research investigated the relationship between self-disclosure and attitudes in more depth. New undergraduate students were asked to nominate an ingroup or outgroup friend and then report the intimacy of their disclosures to them, their anxiety and attitudes towards a series of social groups, in the first week of the semester and 6 weeks later. Intimacy of disclosure predicted more positive attitudes towards outgroups over time, but this association was only found among participants who nominated an outgroup friend. In the ingroup friend condition, a negative association was found. These associations were mediated by general intergroup anxiety. These relationships highlight the importance of integrating theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations when investigating intergroup contact. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Selectivity and destinations of ethnic minorities leaving the main gateway cities of Estonia
AN  - 1824080492
AB  - Changes in the spatial distribution of minority populations and factors responsible for such changes form an important research topic in the study of the contemporary immigrant societies of Europe and North America. This paper clarifies both the trends and determinants of the spatial redistribution of mainly Russian-speaking ethnic minorities in Estonia by focusing on out-migration from the gateway cities or the main minority concentration areas. We use individual data from the 2000 census. The main results show that the dominant flow of migration among members of ethnic minorities is out of the main gateway cities in Estonia, and this trend is very different from the situation during the Soviet period. All of the personal characteristics that measure intentional ties with the majority population and the host country, such as proficiency in Estonian, having an Estonian partner, and Estonian citizenship, exert a positive influence on both leaving these areas and settling in non-ethnic destinations, while the mere passage of time (generation replacement) has no straightforward influence on minority spatial redistribution.

T1  - An essay on social representations and ethnic minorities
AN  - 1010629876; 201210570
AB  - Persecution of ethnic minorities, social exclusion and racism are phenomena that cannot be studied as isolated variables. Popular forms of these phenomena arise from multitudes of beliefs, values and images with long histories. In discussing the separation of facts and values, the 'Eichmann experiment' and obedience and disobedience towards authority, it is shown here that a mechanical obedience corresponds to scientific and technical practices, and to the disenchantment of the world with modern technology. Racism highlights the separation of facts and values and can be viewed as the process of transformation of 'scientific' knowledge into common sense and vice versa. The theory of social representations regards these phenomena as processes of anchoring and objectification and as networks of indices and symbols with an imaginary reflection. Drawing on our notion of themata, it is shown that in the case of Roma, themata are articulated around the long historical narratives artistic/criminal. In contemporary situations Roma have a tendency more towards emancipation than towards assimilation. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Hillary Clinton effect: When the same role model inspires or fails to inspire improved performance under stereotype threat
AN  - 1910239628
AB  - If successful role models undo stereotype threat effects by providing reassurance that group members can "take care of themselves," then the same real-world role model might inspire those who think she deserved success, but fail to inspire those who think she did not. In a pilot study, some women participants listed Hillary Clinton high among women who deserved their success; others listed her high among women who did not deserve their success. The former participants, but not the latter, claimed her success came from internal and stable causes and would inspire them in difficult situations. In the main study, women rated how much Hillary Clinton deserved her success. One month later, they were placed under mathematics stereotype threat, read a factual biography of Hillary Clinton, and took a GRE-Q test. Those who had earlier claimed Clinton deserved her success scored as well as a test-only control group; those who had earlier claimed she did not deserve her success scored as poorly as a threat-only control group. The results are seen as contributing to theories of role models, stereotype threat, and attribution.

T1  - Evolution of parochial altruism by multilevel selection
AN  - 1030866760; 201229577
AB  - The evolution of parochial altruism is not well understood. We study this problem by considering a prisoner's dilemma game with four strategies: altruists who cooperate with everyone; parochialists who only cooperate with members of their own group; traitors who only cooperate with outgroup individuals; and egoists who never cooperate. We develop a model that allows for both assortment and conflict between groups. Individuals discriminate between in- and outgroup members. While assortment and conflict allow for the evolution of both indiscriminate and parochial altruism, discriminate behavior creates an advantage for parochialists over altruists, as the latter waste help on outgroup members. We use computer simulations to study the multilevel selection dynamics. The simulation model describes an absorbing Markov chain. We examine the absorption probabilities of altruists and parochialists. Three model versions are compared, with only assortment, with only group conflict, and with both mechanisms. We find that parochialism is selected for by group conflict as well as assortment. Discrimination allows for cooperation inside groups to withstand regular interactions with outgroup members.

T1  - Intergroup Conflict in Russia: Testing the Group Position Model
AN  - 907924802; 201124584
AB  - The group position model (Blumer 1958; Bobo and Than 2006) assumes that attempting to secure a privileged position for the ingroup is a main determinant of perceived intergroup conflict. This assumption is tested with survey data collected in 1999 and 2000 among eight titular groups in autonomous republics of the Russian Federation. The survey included an experiment that was aimed at disentangling the effects of perceived threat and the fear of outgroup encroachment (growing outgroup influence). The findings indicate that more conflict was perceived when the ingroup was larger (corresponding to stronger entitlement claims to privilege), especially among those who felt more threatened. This association was further strengthened among those whose fear of outgroup encroachment was made salient. This study shows the relevance of the group position model in understanding perceived intergroup conflict among national minority groups with a local privileged status.

T1  - Introduction -- Ethnic minorities in Asia: inclusion or exclusion
AN  - 1010631879; 201210566
AB  - This special issue, devoted to ethnic minorities in Asia, originated with the International Symposium on Ethnic Minorities in Asia: Subjects or Citizens, held at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore. As one of the most ethnically-diverse regions in the world, Asia is the site of large indigenous minority populations as well as non-indigenous minorities through ever-growing legal and illegal migrant flows. This article maps out some of the key themes explored by the contributors to this special issue in the processes and structures of accommodation for Asia's minorities. These themes revolve around the changing meaning of citizenship in Asian contexts, state models of accommodation, constructions and representations of identity and belonging, post-colonial legacies and nation-building, the legitimacy of minority rights claims, and questions of human security. This article provides an overview of the theoretical and empirical contributions that the essays in this special issue bring to the study of ethnic minority issues in increasingly heterogeneous and divided Asian societies.

T1  - Endorsement of Assimilationism among Ethnic Minority and Majority Youth in a Multination-Multiethnic Context: The Case of Brussels
AN  - 887498051; 201118207
AB  - This study examined attitudes towards weak and strong assimilation in a sample of 3,121 pupils from 70 secondary schools in Brussels with a multilevel linear analysis. Controlling for socio-demographic variables, members of some ethnic minority groups endorsed weak assimilation to a greater extent than the majority. Within members of the majority, the French-speaking Belgians held similar attitudes towards assimilation to the Dutch-speaking Belgians. Among ethnic minorities, the identification of pupils from some foreign-origin countries with the mainstream society was positively associated with the endorsement of strong assimilation, while their ethnic identification remained non-significant. Intergroup friendship among pupils of foreign origin was positively related to strong assimilation. Moreover, pupils of foreign origin who experienced institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities in favour of the majority endorsed strong assimilationism to a lesser extent. Among the majority, the perception that people of foreign origin are victims of discrimination was positively related to the endorsement of weak assimilation. However, this association was mediated by the experience by the majority of institutional discrimination against the majority and in favour of ethnic minorities. In-group identification among the majority was not associated with the endorsement of assimilation. The results and their implications for future research and policy makers are discussed.

T1  - Ethnic composition of school classes, majority-minority friendships, and adolescents' intergroup attitudes in the Netherlands
AN  - 881468154; 201117316
AB  - The relationships between the proportion of ethnic minority adolescents in school classes, the proportion and quality of majority-minority friendships and intergroup attitudes were examined using multi-level analysis (N = 2386 adolescents in 117 school classes in the Netherlands). In school classes with high proportions of ethnic minority adolescents, both ethnic majority and ethnic minority adolescents reported more negative out-group attitudes. Moreover, in these school classes, ethnic majority adolescents showed more positive in-group attitudes, whereas ethnic minority adolescents showed less positive in-group attitudes. The proportion of majority-minority friendships was related to less negative out-group attitudes for ethnic majority adolescents only. The quality of majority-minority friendships was related to less negative out-group and in-group attitudes for both the ethnic majority and ethnic minority adolescents. The results are discussed in the light of contact theory and ethnic competition theory. [Copyright Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - One ethnic minority, two cultural identities and more
AN  - 896188766; 201120134
AB  - Most of current research seems to proceed from a homogeneous conception of the Chinese ethnic minority in the North America and Europe. The present paper focuses on ethnic Chinese migrant children living in Northern Ireland whose parents come from Mainland China and Hong Kong, respectively, and examines their intra-ethnic and inter-generational experiences based on in-depth interviews and participant observations. The purpose is to identify and explain both historical dynamics and intra-ethnic diversities within these Chinese children's accounts. The research employs culturally grounded versions of explanations, argumentations, narratives, 'habitus', etc. as analytical tools. The research discovers the changes in and differences between these two Chinese sub-groups in views and values on self-concept, norms, country of origin, host society and life-style choices.

T1  - How Does Our Biological Belief in Race Relate to Our Feelings Towards In-Group and Out-Groups?: A Cognitive Dissonance Framework
AN  - 1018353967; 201212794
AB  - This study considered the effect of belief in race as a biological construct (RACEBIO) and intergroup anxiety (IGA) on in-group racial salience (IGRS) and out-group discomfort (OGD). Participants included 66 racially and ethnically diverse high school boarding students. As hypothesized, RACEBIO was positively related to both IGRS and OGD. In addition, the relationship between RACEBIO and IGRS was significantly stronger among participants with high IGA. The findings support a cognitive dissonance model suggesting that people with high IGA might rationalize their in-group racial salience by strengthening their belief that racial groups are biologically distinct and socially incompatible. Implications for integrating cognitive and affective experiences in educational and clinical interventions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The construction of the image of immigrants and ethnic minorities in two Portuguese daily newspapers
AN  - 925712457; 201204093
AB  - This article summarises a research project in communication, culture and information technologies, the object of study being the construction of the image of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the Portuguese press. A comparative analysis between two newspapers -- Publico and Correio da Manh -- was conducted, with each newspaper representing a different kind of journalism: one viewed as serious, the other as popular. We found that while immigration and ethnicity phenomena are important realities of Portuguese society, they are still perceived as threats by the popular press, while in the serious press we observed a greater interest in the social and political contextualisation of these phenomena and a more elaborate discourse.

T1  - Social cohesion and the transformation from ethnic to multicultural society: The Case of Denmark
AN  - 862595828; 201109627
AB  - Danish society used to have a very homogenous culture; everybody was Lutheran and there were only very small groups of ethnic minorities. However, since the 1960s the immigration of foreign workers and refugees has created substantial minority groups of people who are very different ethnically, religiously and linguistically. Becoming a multicultural country may be particularly problematic for such a formerly homogeneous society; formal and informal rules for the co-existence of different ethnic and religious segments of the society have until now not been necessary.

T1  - Prejudice among Peruvians and Chileans as a Function of Identity, Intergroup Contact, Acculturation Preferences, and Intergroup Emotions
AN  - 835111548; 201100491
AB  - A special Latin American acculturative context is currently developing in Chile in which native Chileans have contact with several immigrant groups, particularly newcomers from Peru. This study examines several intergroup variables including contact, national and Latino American identities, group distinctiveness, realistic threat, intergroup anxiety, and acculturation preferences as predictors of prejudice on the part of both Chilean natives and Peruvian immigrants. Three hundred Peruvian immigrants (194 females and 106 males) and 300 Chileans (199 females and 101 males) participated in the study. Acculturation preferences, perceived group distinctiveness, and especially intergroup contact were shown to be important predictors of prejudice toward out-group members. Intergroup anxiety and realistic threat mediated some of these effects. The pattern of these results also varied as a function of nationality. Theoretical as well as practical implications for further research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Asian American television activity: Is it related to outgroup vitality
AN  - 818801924; 201072799
AB  - Applying a uses and gratifications and social identity gratifications approach, the present study explores Asian American television viewing. Specifically, Asian Americans report on the quantity of television they watch, what shows they watch, why they watch, and whether their uses are related to their perceptions of Caucasian vitality. The data reveal that using television for entertainment and to escape/relieve boredom were the most important television uses for this group of Asian Americans. At the same time, these two uses were significant predictors of how vital Asian Americans perceived Caucasians. Although selecting and avoiding television for ethnic identity gratifications were not important relative to other gratifications, television selection for identity gratifications was important to Asian Americans who highly identify with their ethnic group.

T1  - Global support for the death penalty
AN  - 764426285; 201066182
AB  - The recently released Gallup International 2000 Millennium Survey Poll collected data from individuals residing in 59 countries. The focus of this research was to analyze these data to examine whether the abolition movement has ushered in a new 'collective sensibility' about the death penalty or whether global attitudes toward capital punishment are characterized by deep divisions. The research assumes that the long-term stability of abolition will be assured when the vast majority of the citizens of the world oppose the use of the death penalty. The findings reveal that there are deep cleavages in worldwide support for capital punishment. The article highlights five divides in support for capital punishment and then separately discusses the results from the human rights and minority group threat analyses.

T1  - Concerns about appearing prejudiced: Implications for anxiety during daily interracial interactions
AN  - 743047783; 201031481
AB  - We investigated the relationship between Whites' and ethnic minorities' concerns about appearing prejudiced and anxiety during daily interracial interactions. College roommate pairs completed an individual difference measure of concerns about appearing prejudiced at the beginning of the semester. Then they completed measures of anxiety and perceptions of their roommates' anxiety-related behaviors for 15 days. Results indicated that among interracial roommate pairs, Whites' and ethnic minorities' concerns about appearing prejudiced were related to their self-reported anxiety on a daily basis; but this was not the case among same-race roommate pairs. In addition, among interracial roommate pairs, roommates who were concerned about appearing prejudiced began to 'leak' their anxiety towards the end of the diary period, as indicated by their out-group roommate who perceived their anxious behaviors as increasing across time, and who consequently liked them less. The implications of these findings for intergroup relations are discussed in this article. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Perceptions Of Race Relations In Contexts Of Ethnic Diversity And Change
AN  - 743046005; 201031601
AB  - Examining public opinion data from a 2007 survey of Los Angeles, the authors consider racial and ethnic variation in perceptions of race relations across neighborhoods in various contexts of demographic composition and change. Using several measures of ethnic diversity, the authors examine whether racial attitudes differ depending on the demographic mix at the census tract level, and if the relative importance of ethnicity and other individual characteristics varies depending on the proportion, ratio, or diversity of ethnic groups within tracts. Only among African Americans do they find a consistent impact of racial/ethnic identity on perception of race relations, although such attitudes do not vary within various measures of neighborhood diversity. The results suggest limitations to the assumed significance-either positive or negative-of neighborhood diversity on individuals of various races and ethnicities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Workplace Discrimination and Depressive Symptoms: A Study of Multi-Ethnic Hospital Employees
AN  - 868013627; 201112953
AB  - Workplace discrimination reports have recently increased in the U.S. Few studies have examined racial/ethnic differences and the mental health consequences of this exposure. We examined the association between self-reported workplace discrimination and depressive symptoms among a multi-ethnic sample of hospital employees. Data came from the prospective case-control Gradients of Occupational Health in Hospital Workers (GROW) study (N = 664). We used the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to assess depressive symptoms and measured the occurrence, types, and frequency of workplace discrimination. African Americans were more likely than other racial/ethnic employees to report frequent and multiple types of discrimination exposure. Multivariate relationships were examined while controlling for socio-demographic factors, job strain, and general social stressors. After adjustment, workplace discrimination occurrence and frequency were positively associated with depressive symptoms. The positive association between workplace discrimination and depressive symptoms was similar across racial and ethnic groups. Reducing workplace discrimination may improve psychosocial functioning among racial/ethnic minority hospital employees at greatest risk of exposure. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic Chinese Muslims in Indonesia: An Unfinished Anti-Discrimination Project
AN  - 743066650; 201043323
AB  - Indonesia is a nation with the world's largest Muslim population. However, ethnic Chinese Muslims constitute a very small minority since the population of ethnic Chinese themselves is very small in Indonesia. For over three decades, Chinese identity in Indonesia has been on the decline, and almost lost due to state repression. There was little room for the Chinese to articulate and express their socio-political interests and identity, including their traditional culture. This paper is an attempt to investigate state discrimination practices against ethnic Chinese, including the Muslims in particular, as a minority group in Indonesia in the post-enactment of the new Citizenship Bill No. 12/2006. The paper argues that even though all ethnic groups are constitutionally guaranteed equal citizenship status, the enactment of the Bill did not automatically eliminate state discriminatory practices at all levels of the bureaucracy from national to local against the Chinese, including particularly the ethnic Chinese Muslims. To guarantee their socio-political security, Chinese Muslims therefore adopted cultural approaches, intensively coordinating with religion-based organisations, including Muslim mass organisations and Islamic non-governmental organisations. Ethnic Chinese Muslims find these cultural approaches important and effective for protecting themselves from any possible anti-Chinese sentiments and discriminations as well as exploitation from either the local communities or the state bureaucracy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Inter-ethnic friendships in post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina: Sociodemographic and place influences
AN  - 1928317232
AB  - International concerns about the continued ethnicization of Bosnian social and political life are both validated and challenged by the December 2005 public opinion study. Ordinary Bosnians are willing to consider cross-ethnic friendships and cooperation. The gap between ethnic elites and entrepreneurs and their constituents is evident still in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). The optimistic note of this study is sounded by the fact that half of respondents in BiH want more friends from different nationalities. The differences between the three ethnic groups are not dramatic. However, 41 percent of respondents stated that all or most of their friends were from their own nationality. Analysis of the responses by geographic location and by explanations related to modernization, ethnic competition and war experiences, indicated that all proved useful in understanding the distributions. The geographic distributions indicated the primacy of the urban--rural factor for questions on current friendship networks and preferences for friends in other ethnic groups.

T1  - Culturally Distinctive and Academic Socialization: Direct and Interactive Relationships with African American Adolescents' Academic Adjustment
AN  - 204636738; 20084565
AB  - Theories of ethnic minority development have largely suggested that African American parents engage in a combination of practices that include culturally distinctive socialization as well as behaviors that are characteristic of more universal forms of academic socialization. However, few studies have examined how these socialization dimensions interact to influence the academic adjustment of African American adolescents. The current study explored the independent and interactive roles of parental academic and culturally distinctive socialization on the academic adjustment of African American adolescents. The sample was comprised 144 African American adolescents (M = 12.4; SD = 1.14; 56% female). Findings provided partial support that cultural and academic socialization were independently associated with indicators of academic adjustment. However, the interaction between these dimensions also was associated with youths' adjustment in the academic domain. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
