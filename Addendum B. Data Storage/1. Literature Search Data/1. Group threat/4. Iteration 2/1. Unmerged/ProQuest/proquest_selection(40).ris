T1  - Future research avenues to facilitate social connectedness and safe collective behavior at organized crowd events: GPIR
AN  - 2497530623
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, organizers of crowd events must facilitate physical distancing in environments where attendees previously enjoyed being close with ingroup members, encourage accurate perception of health risks and close adherence to safety guidance, and stop expected normative behaviors that may now be unsafe. Research from crowd psychology demonstrates how group processes are integral to each of these issues. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has created an extreme case environment in which to evaluate the collective findings from previous research and identify future research directions. This paper outlines how organizers of crowd events and researchers can work together to further develop our understanding of social connectedness in crowds, reasons for risk-taking behavior, and level of engagement in new collective behaviors. By working together to address these issues, practitioners and researchers can develop our understanding of crowd processes and improve safety at future crowd events.

T1  - Group identity, empathy and shared suffering: Understanding the ‘community’ impacts of anti-LGBT and Islamophobic hate crimes
AN  - 2401627948
AB  - This article examines the indirect impacts of hate crimes on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Muslim communities in the United Kingdom. Based on 34 qualitative interviews, we explore both the perceived meaning of ‘community’ in the context of targeted victimization and the emotional and behavioural effects that anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Islamophobic hate crimes have on other members of the victim’s group. Building on previous quantitative data undertaken as part of a larger programme of research, this study helps to explain how and why hate crimes have significant indirect consequences on two distinct but commonly targeted communities. The focus on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Muslim communities allowed us to draw out similarities and commonalities across different groups, further enhancing the understanding of the impacts of hate crime. In particular, the article highlights how for many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Muslim people feelings of anger and anxiety about hate crimes were linked to enhanced levels of empathy towards those that they share a group identity with. These empathic bonds often gave rise to a sense of ‘shared suffering’, with participants frequently feeling connected to group members worldwide through their common experiences of hate and prejudice. Although group identity was important to many participants’ sense of belonging to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender or Muslim communities, it was clear that the most profound impacts of hate crime were experienced when incidents occurred within someone’s local area. This highlighted the importance of location as a key variable in understanding both the meaning of ‘community’ and the indirect impacts of hate crime.

T1  - Who is fighting with whom? How ethnic origin shapes friendship, dislike, and physical violence relations in German secondary schools
AN  - 2331214018
AB  - This study examines the role of ethnic background for friendship, dislike, and violence networks in secondary school. We analyze data on multiple networks from a large-scale study of more than 2500 seventh-graders in Germany. In addition to ethnic homophily in friendship networks, our results reveal a tendency among students to dislike ethnic outgroup members (ethnic heterophobia). However, students are more likely to engage in violence towards same-ethnic peers than outgroup members. This is partly due to the greater prevalence of violence among students who are close in the friendship network and students who spend time together outside of school. Moreover, schools marked by stronger ethnic homophily in friendships tend to display higher levels of ethnic heterophobia but exhibit higher levels of intra-ethnic rather than inter-ethnic violence.

T1  - THE TRANSFORMATIVE CAPACITY OF COMMEMORATION: COMPARING MNEMONIC ACTIVISM IN PHILADELPHIA, MISSISSIPPI
AN  - 2333594743
AB  - Much attention has centered on the causes and composition of commemorations, yet research on commemorations' causal consequences remains relatively unexplored. This study examines the relationship between commemorative events and subsequent mnemonic activism through a comparative historical study of two seemingly similar mnemonic projects with divergent outcomes: the twenty-fifth and fortieth anniversary commemorations in Philadelphia, Mississippi, the city notorious as the site of the 1964 "Mississippi Burning" murders. Drawing insights from the social psychological literature on intergroup contact clarifies how members of the 2004 commemoration task force developed a distinct collective identity across significant social divides through personal storytelling, a development that encouraged local mnemonic activism beyond the commemoration itself. More generally, this research suggests that commemorations both emerge out of and catalyze associated memory movements, and that a commemoration's transformative potential lies in its planning process.

T1  - Family Communication and Messages about Race and Identity in Black Families in the United States
AN  - 2283393895
AB  - Racial minority families engage in "racial socialization," the process by which individuals develop meaning and understanding of what race is, and its implications. While parents are often seen as the site of this socialization, we wanted to explore which racial socialization messages were salient for young adults, and from whom they received these messages. This paper utilized focus groups to explore messages that young Black adults received about race, and what this means for their racial identity. We identified three dominant themes in our analyses: (a) the content of familial messages regarding race, identity, and prejudice, (b) critical incidents that shaped individuals' understandings of Black racial identity, and (c) familial sources. Each of these themes is constituted by various experiences and examples that shed light on racial socialization in today's social climate. Overall, parents, extended family members, and community members were sources of socializing what race meant to young Black adults. We discuss implications for research on racial socialization and family communication.

T1  - When nonactivists care: Group efficacy mediates the effect of social identification and perceived instability on the legitimacy of collective action: GPIR
AN  - 2229907808
AB  - In recent years, multiple social movements have emerged around the world. In addition, public surveys indicate the highest recorded levels of support for protest. In this context of acceptance of collective action, we examine the role of nonactivists in the perceived legitimacy of social movements, as this “passive” support can contribute to social change. Given that antecedents of legitimacy have been neglected in the literature, we carried out a survey (N = 605) among a general sample of the population in Chile to shed light on this issue. We found that social identification with movements and perceived instability predicted the perceived legitimacy of protests by social movements, and that both variables had only indirect effects through group efficacy. This suggests that perceiving social movements as able to achieve success can lead nonactivists to perceive their actions as legitimate, highlighting the importance to movements of being seen to be effective.

T1  - The Politics of Homosexuality: Perseverance of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Community in a Repressive Social Milieu in Afghanistan
AN  - 2239162573
AB  - In Afghanistan, minorities are subjected to harassment, intimidation and even death by Islamic fanatics and conservative leaders as they try to impose their own interpretation of religious scriptures and punish those who do not agree with their interpretation of religious precepts and follow their rulings. Application of such measures has impacted the safety and security of the gender-minority community, as its members are forced to hide their identities, and cannot speak about their sexual orientation. Government agencies and civil society organizations do not advocate for the rights of this community, and deliberately avoid any discussion about them, fearing a backlash from religious vigilantes, conservative religious leaders and clerics. A lack of public education and social awareness programs about the gender-minority community has contributed to the perpetuation of discrimination, hatred and bigotry toward them − a community that is part and parcel of the social fabric of modern Afghanistan.

T1  - Do young female candidates face double barriers or an outgroup advantage? The case of the European Parliament
AN  - 2166642301
AB  - While intersectionality is a recurrent theme in the literature on women's political representation, few studies empirically disentangle who are the women who get elected to parliaments. An argument on biases in recruitment practices suggests that those who are members of more than one outgroup, such as young women, benefit from an ‘outgroup advantage’. In elections, a candidate with two outgroup features might attract more voter support than a candidate with just one outgroup feature. Hence, nominating a candidate that is both young and female could be a rational move by (male) elites in political parties that allows them to open fewer seats to newcomers. These expectations are tested on data for all members of the European Parliament since 1979. Not only is it found that women's presence increased steadily throughout the parliament's history, but also that women's representation is consistently highest among the group of young representatives, lower among middle‐aged Members of the European Parliament and lowest among older representatives.

T1  - Provider Perceptions of the Effects of Current U.S. Immigration Enforcement Policies on Service Utilization in a Border Community
AN  - 2295418901
AB  - Restrictive U.S. immigration policies and enforcement have led to concerns among providers about how these changes affect service utilization among Latinx and immigrant communities. This study outlines perceptions from twenty service providers in health care, mental health, legal affairs, and immigrant advocacy in El Paso, Texas. Nearly all respondents stated that their work has been negatively affected by immigration enforcement policies under the current federal administration. Most reported changes in utilization among undocumented immigrants and families of mixed immigration status, as well as legal permanent and temporary residents, refugees or asylum seekers, and U.S. citizens. Negative effects were related to immigration-related fear and uncertainty in the community, a need for public education about policies and individuals' rights, and changes in immigration policy enforcement. Further research about the impacts of immigration enforcement policies on service utilization is needed. To protect the well-being of immigrant communities, policy makers should be aware of the human rights implications of immigration enforcement policies with regard to service utilization. In a global environment of increasing nationalism and xenophobia, nations must carefully consider the implications of harsh anti-immigrant narratives and strict immigration enforcement on the well-being of minority and immigrant populations.

T1  - Perceptions and Experiences of Non-Muslim Minority Students on the Muslim Image
AN  - 2331235369
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore non-Muslim minority students attending a minority-serving university in a rural community on their knowledge and experiences of the Muslim image. Research is dominated by majority-minority interactions and perspectives regarding subjective reports of controversial issues, especially the heightened awareness of Muslim image in the United States over the past two decades. This trend has perpetuated a growing gap in knowledge of understanding the unique minority-minority perceptions and the development of minority cultural awareness; therein, generating the motivation for this study. The researchers applied a qualitative assessment exploring non-Muslim understanding of foundational components associated with the Muslim image, such as basic Islamic vocabulary competencies and additional open-ended questions regarding experienced social interactions. From the responses of the participants stemmed five emerging themes: enculturation, geographic association, stigmatization, influencers, and empathy. These results demonstrate a general openness toward the Muslim identity but also include consistent misconceptions that may be easily rectified by interactive-educational interventions. The findings acknowledge the propensity of non-Muslim minority students' willingness to learn from authentic Muslim image, despite the influence of disingenuous Muslim images depicted by current media outlets.

T1  - "Your name does not tick the box": the intertwining of names, bodies, religion and nationality in the construction of identity within the UK asylum system
AN  - 2017951141
AB  - This article draws on research with Pakistani Christians seeking asylum in the UK, focusing on those with English/biblical names, exploring, firstly the relationship between names and religious persecution in the country of origin, and secondly the complex interaction between names, bodies, religion and nationality within the UK asylum system. It argues that in responding to the perceived threats of immigration and terrorism, British immigration officials tend to use Pakistani as a proxy for Islam, with those Christians who possess English/biblical names often perceived to be a more suspicious group. It concludes by highlighting the need to take religious identities seriously in immigration policies and practices, especially in the context of the current refugee crisis.

T1  - For Colored Girls Who Loved Prince Rogers Nelson: Issues of Colorism and Identity
AN  - 1945566336
AB  - This article carefully examines the women with whom the artist, Prince Rogers Nelson, was most closely associated and the potential messages about colorism those relationships suggest. The author examines the issue from a personal perspective, as one who grew up idolizing Prince and as someone whose appearance did not reflect that of the women Prince flaunted. One overarching question asks: Was Prince a victim of colorism, as well as a perpetrator of it?

T1  - A Conceptual Falsetto: Re-imagining Black Childhood Via One Girl’s Exploration of Prince
AN  - 1945565068
AB  - A young Prince scoffed at a single story of identity, i.e., dominant social constructions of race, class, gender, and youth associated with inadequacy and confinement. Inspired by Prince, this autoethnography introduces a conceptual falsetto framework (CFF). Like Prince’s falsetto which resists the constraints of his tenor voice, CFF resists the tenor of a single story of Black childhood—it goes higher. CFF calls Black scholars to (re)imagine Black childhood into ideologies of love (Delgado 1995 in The Rodrigo Chronicles; Dumas and Nelson, 86(1), 27–47, 2016 ; Duncan, 8(1), 85–104, 2002 ), by using reflexive practices to write about one’s own childhood on multiple tracks. Identifying and examining the social/cultural and political material of their childhoods, Black scholars can produce new ideas and approaches to research on Black childhood more generally—swelling a new discourse on Black childhood from the margins of society into the public discourse. “Many feminist writers advocate starting research from one’s own experience… using personal knowledge to help them in the research process” (Ellis 2004 :48). I illustrate CFF by analyzing my childhood journal (1986–1988) which examines and emulates Prince’s artistry. Findings reveal Black childhoods are spent resisting, creating symbolic universes, being in relationship, bonding around intellectuality and abstract ideas—choosing to love something and being in pursuit of it.

T1  - Is ethnicity a meaningful category of employment policies for Roma? A comparative case study of Hungary and Spain
AN  - 1934044776
AB  - This paper aims to inquire into the potential of active labour market policies (LMP) to reach out to unemployed Roma population in Hungary and in Spain. While in Hungary unemployed Roma people are mainly thought to be reached through mainstream measures, Spain represents a more complex regime with an emphasis on ethnically targeted programmes. Our analysis draws on a wider comparative research project (NEUJOBS) conducted in 2012/2013 and provides an insight into how LMP function locally for unemployed Roma. We conclude that there are two intersecting challenges regarding the success of LMP that aim to influence the employment situation of the Roma: the targeting strategies and the quality and complexity of the programmes' design. Our empirical data suggest that both aspects need to be given equal attention in order to promote the inclusion of the Roma into the labour market.

T1  - Welland Ontario's Springfield Plan: Post-War Canadian Citizenship Training, American Style?
AN  - 2032478903
AB  - After World War II, minority activists and their Anglo-Canadian allies convinced the Ontario Ministry of Education to bring the Springfield Plan to Welland, Ontario, as a pilot project to combat racist and religious prejudice through the public school system. Pioneered in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Plan taught children the importance of tolerance by stressing that minority groups had made important contributions to the local community, the nation, and the world beyond. In Welland, however, the Plan only lasted for a few years because many influential Canadians failed to recognize the pervasiveness of discrimination, while non-British immigrants tended to see new industrial unions as better vehicles for claiming their rights. In addition, the Plan was unsuited to the understanding of Canada as a “bi-racial” country founded by the English and French.Alternate abstract:Après la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, des militants issus des minorités et leurs alliés anglo-canadiens convainquirent le ministère de l’Éducation de l’Ontario d’introduire le Plan de Springfield à Welland (Ontario), à titre de projet pilote destiné à combattre le racisme et les préjugés religieux par l’intermédiaire du réseau d’écoles publiques. Lancé à Springfield (Massachusetts), celui-ci enseignait aux enfants l’importance de la tolérance en soulignant que les groupes minoritaires avaient apporté d’importantes contributions à la collectivité locale, au pays et au monde extérieur. À Welland, toutefois, le Plan ne dura que quelques années parce que bon nombre de Canadiens influents refusèrent de reconnaître l’omniprésence de la discrimination et que, de leur côté, les immigrants non britanniques eurent tendance à voir les nouveaux syndicats industriels comme de meilleurs outils pour faire valoir leurs droits. De plus, le Plan n’était pas conçu pour faire comprendre le Canada comme étant un pays « biracial », fondé par les Anglais et les Français.

T1  - Role of diasporas in homeland conflicts, conflict resolution, and post-war reconstruction: the case of Tamil diaspora and Sri Lanka
AN  - 1922922098
AB  - The case of Sri Lanka and the Tamil diaspora can be cited as a classic case of participation by a diaspora in the homeland conflict and to some extent also in conflict resolution. Influenced by lived experiences of discrimination and suffering in an ethnocentric homeland and a range of racial prejudices and economic deprivation, in the host lands, the diaspora Tamils developed a strong sense of Tamil identity and ethno-nationalism which the LTTE could successfully harvest on. However, with the devastating civil war coming to an end, and a new government in power, numerous opportunities have opened up for diaspora participation in the development and reconstruction of the war-torn regions. All that is required is a pragmatic and reconciliatory approach by both sides - by the diaspora as well as by the Sri Lankan state.

T1  - Divides and dialogue in the diaspora during Sri Lanka's civil war
AN  - 1922922049
AB  - In the armed conflict in Sri Lanka (1983-2009), the diaspora was actively involved, most importantly through its financial and political support to the Tamil separatists. This article explores the dynamics within the diaspora itself, looking at how conflict divides were maintained and reshaped outside Sri Lanka, but also at the possibilities for dialogue. It studies both Sinhalese and Tamils in the diaspora and enquires into their experiences of interaction with the ethnic other. Based on multi-sited fieldwork carried out during the latter phase of the war, it maps meeting spaces in the host countries and discusses how divides were entrenched or bridged in these spaces. The reversed majority-minority relations between the two groups are discussed, as are the perceptions that dialogue attempts can be a way of co-optation and an activity in which divides are confirmed rather than overcome.

T1  - Doubly estranged: racism, the body and reflection
AN  - 1864677590
AB  - This paper introduces the concept of "double estrangement". Drawing on a large qualitative dataset it will argue that young migrant group boys in Dublin's north inner city suffer from a break with their embodied selves as they are pushed between habitual and reflective action. The dual elements of "double estrangement" will be outlined, firstly, through the contention that visible difference and dispositions of the body mark minority boys out as not belonging within peer exchanges in three primary schools. Secondly, by arguing this has the effect of heightening a boy's self-consciousness of their body as an object of value estranging them from their habitual embodied being.

T1  - When school meets the Other: intercultural policies in the Basque inclusive school
AN  - 1862143788
AB  - Gatti, Irazuzta and Martinez address the intercultural public policies implemented in the education system of the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country (Spain). Focusing on the education system allows them to reconstruct the historicity of identity-alterity production in a region in which language has been central for the establishment of ethnic frontiers. More specifically, they examine the implementation of these policies in three pre-school and primary educational institutions in a multicultural neighbourhood of the city of Bilbao. They look at Euskara-the Basque language-as a key element of the us-them distinction. The various education models regarding language and the teaching in/of Euskara or Spanish pave the way for the specialization and spatialization of the schools analysed. 'Integration' policies are implemented in ethnically marked schools only, based on a rhetoric of interculturality that assumes that any 'racial or ethnic discrimination' can be overcome through knowledge of the Other. Moreover, the assessment of public policies through 'interculturality figures and best practice' developed to address the so-called 'immigration issue' promotes a protectionist intervention on behalf of the assumed social vulnerabilities of immigrant schoolchildren and their families, which are read as 'problematic characteristics'. The article argues that, as a result of the approach based on the social conditions of immigrant children and their families in the Basque Country, the race issue evaporates.

T1  - Tell me what you remember and I will know who you are: The link between collective memory and social categorization: GPIR
AN  - 1854785002
AB  - The present article aims to show that collective memories could serve as a criterion in social categorization. We predicted that a target person who shares common collective memories will be perceived as similar (to the self), relatively more favorably and categorized as an ingroup member. We conducted four studies using memories of historical events or childhood objects. These studies consistently showed that a target who shares common memories is more likely to be perceived as an ingroup member than someone who does not. This effect is mediated by perceived similarity to the self. Finally, individuals who share common memories are perceived more favorably than when they do not. However, according to the type of collective memories (historical events vs. childhood memories) sharing memories impacts either perceived competence or perceived warmth. The current sets of studies support the idea that collective memory influences social categorization processes, exemplifying its group identity-defining function.

AN  - 1866457366
AB  - When identifying the language/-s spoken by different members of a community, we first categorise and then further merge it/them into definitions. The author discusses some such definitions often used in discourse on the Slovenian language in Italy. The author gathered and analysed these definitions using the method of critical analysis of media discourse on language. She discusses the material from an epistemological perspective that transcends the linguistics field and reaches to other fields of humanities and social studies. Namely, the social dynamics and cultural paradigms of a language-speaking community are reflected in the perceptions of languages, their practices, and language policies. In this article, the author shows examples of language definitions found in the analysed material and explains when and why these definitions could be problematic.Alternate abstract:Ko ¿elimo opredeliti jezik/-e, ki ga/jih uporabljajo razlicni govorci neke skupnosti, ga/jih po navadi razvrstimo v kategorije, ki jih nadalje strnemo v definicije. V nadaljevanju clanka avtorica obravnava nekatere take definicije, ki se pogosto pojavljajo v diskurzu o slovenskem jeziku v Italiji; definicije so bile zbrane in analizirane s kriticno analizo medijskih diskurzov o jeziku, v tem prispevku pa gradivo obravnava kot epistemolosko vprasanje, ki ne sega samo na podrocje jezikoslovnih ved, ampak tudi na druga podrocja humanistike in druzboslovja. Skozi percepcije jezika terprakse in politike, ki so z jezikom povezane, se namrec odrazajo druzbene dinamike in kulturne paradigme skupnosti govorcev. V clanku avtorica ob primerih definicij jezika, ki jih je zasledila v analiziranem gradivu, pokaze, kdaj in zakaj so lahko te definicije sporne.

T1  - Explaining Asian American achievement
AN  - 1817595785
AB  - Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou's The Asian American Achievement Paradox is a remarkable analysis of the educational upward mobility of Chinese and Vietnamese Americans in Los Angeles. It also provides important insights about the status of contemporary Asian Americans more generally. While critical of the 'model minority' thesis, the authors take seriously the role of culture in fostering educational attainment. However, their emphasis on immigrant selectivity and individual psychology may be misplaced when it comes to understanding the achievement of second-generation groups.

T1  - Membership role and subjective group dynamics: Impact on evaluative intragroup differentiation and commitment to prescriptive norms: GPIR
AN  - 1853502110
AB  - Two studies examined participants' evaluations of ingroup or outgroup normative and deviant members and changes in agreement with a prescriptive norm. In Experiment 1 (N = 51), the normative target was either a full or marginal ingroup or outgroup member, and the deviant was a full member. In Experiment 2 (N = 113), both targets were full or marginal members, or one was a full member and the other was marginal. As predicted, maximal upgrading of normative members and downgrading of deviant members, as well as endorsement of the norm, occurred when both targets were full ingroup members. In contrast, the deviant was derogated least and the deviant's position was endorsed most when the deviant target was a full ingroup member and the normative target was a marginal ingroup member. Evaluations of normative and deviant ingroup members mediated the effects of their role on participants' agreement with the norm.

T1  - Different Origins of Xenophile and Xenophobic Orientations in Human Personality Structure: A Theoretical Perspective and Some Preliminary Findings
AN  - 1817457866
AB  - Building on an integration of research findings on proactive intergroup behavior from multiple fields of inquiry (biology, paleoanthropology, social psychology) as well as research on the HEXACO personality framework, a prospective study among adolescents investigated the relations between personality traits and xenophile and xenophobic orientations (Total N = 455, 219 males, Mage = 17.66 years). Path models corroborate that xenophile orientations and xenophobic orientations were predicted by two distinct subsets of major personality traits: High scores in endeavor-related traits (i.e., Openness to Experience, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness) predicted greater xenophile orientations, whereas low scores in altruism/cooperation-related traits (i.e., Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, and Emotionality) predicted greater xenophobic orientations. Conclusions on the effects of personality traits were complemented by a distinct pattern of gender effects suggesting higher levels of xenophobic orientations among male adolescents and higher levels of xenophile orientations among females. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - 'It's a part of me, I feel naked without it': choice, agency and identity for Muslim women who wear the niqab
AN  - 1801901923
AB  - In the context of heightened suspicion and anti-Muslim stereotypes in a post-9/11 and 7/7 era, Muslim women who wear the niqab (face veil) are stigmatized, criminalized and marked as 'dangerous' to British/Western values. While the wearing of the niqab has elicited a good deal of media, political and public debates, little attention has been paid to the opinions of Muslim women who wear it. Drawing on individual and focus group interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab in the UK, this article places at the centre of the debate the voices of those women who do wear it, and explores their reasons for adopting it. The findings show that the wearing of the niqab emerges as a personal choice, an expression of religious piety, public modesty and belonging to the 'ummah'. It is also perceived as a form of agency, and non-conformity to Western consumerist culture and lifestyle.

T1  - Shifting linkages in ethnic mobilization: the case of RMDSZ and the Hungarians in Transylvania
AN  - 1805242715
AB  - The Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (RMDSZ) has been the most stable actor in the Romanian party system over the past two decades. However, in this article, we argue that beyond this apparent stability, the linkages between RMDSZ and its voters have undergone a gradual, yet significant shift. The ethnic block voting of Transylvanian Hungarians was closely connected to the concept of a self-standing and parallel "Minority Society," and to the practices of institution building that the minority elites engaged in in the early 1990s. However, since its first participation in the Romanian government in 1996, RMDSZ has gradually departed from this strategy, a phenomenon that was also closely connected to a process of elite change within the organization. The present RMDSZ leadership puts less and less emphasis on policy programs that could reinforce the institutional system of the minority; consequently, it is unable (and unwilling) to organizationally integrate the community activists of the minority society who previously had played a key role in the process of (electoral) mobilization. At the rhetorical level, RMDSZ did not abandon the goal of building a parallel Hungarian minority society, but in its linkages to the Hungarian electorate, clientelistic exchanges have become predominant.

T1  - Racism and the Experiences of Latina/o College Students at a PWI (Predominantly White Institution)
AN  - 1800514435
AB  - This study explored Latina/o American college students at a predominantly white university in the South. The authors assessed how 12 Latina/o American college students understood racism and racial microaggressions, and developed counter-spaces to navigate the white college milieu. Qualitative analysis revealed instances of racism were dealt with through assimilation and working hard to excel. Additional responses involved aligning themselves with same-race groups and maintaining a high grade point average. Our findings demonstrated that Latina/o students often utilized counter-spaces and determination to excel in college. Finally, a major contribution of our research was that it provided an example of a small case study of Latinas/os, primarily consisting of males, a group that has traditionally been underrepresented in higher education, who performed very well academically at a PWI.

T1  - Latino/a professionals as entrepreneurs: how race, class, and gender shape entrepreneurial incorporation
AN  - 1795968004
AB  - This paper examines how race, class, and gender intersect to shape professional Latinos' entrepreneurial incorporation, as observed by the conditions that prompt professional Latinos to start a business, including access to capital and experiences with discrimination. In-depth interviews with professional Latino business owners in Los Angeles reveal that individual human capital - via resources and wealth accrued through corporate careers - facilitates entrepreneurial activity. Race, ethnicity, and gender, as intersectional social group identities, combine with class to shape variegated impacts on access to capital and business experiences by gender and target market. Ethnicity is a resource for those serving the coethnic community and is more significant in shaping business ownership experiences for men who target a racially/ethnically diverse clientele, whereas gender and race are more salient for women outside the coethnic community. This study contributes to the ethnic enterprise literature by going beyond ethnicity to demonstrate that multiple dimensions of identity shape professional Latino/as' entrepreneurial incorporation.

T1  - The Evolution and Development of Inferential Reasoning about Ethnic Markers: Comparisons between Urban United States and Rural Highland Peru
AN  - 1826414177
AB  - Social scientists have long argued about the relationship between ethnic phenomena, symbolic markers, and cultural traits. In this paper, we illustrate the potential of functionalist cultural and genetic evolutionary models to reconcile these debates. Specifically, we argue that we must take seriously the role of cultural similarity in delineating certain category boundaries if we are to understand the origins and development of ethnic stereotyping. We examine whether symbolic markers -- namely, sartorial ones -- are privileged in the development of social stereotypes by comparing how children and adults in the urban United States and rural highland Peru perform a categorization task. We find that arbitrary sartorial markers motivate generalizations about novel traits in all samples except among US children, even when they crosscut body morphology, emotional expression, and socioeconomic cues. Unlike children in the United States, children in the Peruvian sample demonstrate an even stronger reliance on sartorial and work site cues than do adults of the same community. This suggests a role for early-developing evolved biases that guide learning and require appropriate cultural inputs or different niches for adults and children. We document further cross-cultural variation, in that US participants privilege socioeconomic cues to occupational status more than other cues, whereas Peruvian participants rely on sartorial cues more than other cues, indicating the importance of cognitive rules for learning locally relevant social taxonomies.

T1  - "Success Is Relative": Comparative Social Class and Ethnic Effects in an Academic Paradox
AN  - 1792792729
AB  - Previous studies have pursued whether there is an inverse relationship between levels of achievement and students' perceptions of their success. We find that these academic paradoxes exist but that they need to be analyzed in a manner that does not look only at structure or culture and that remaps what falls under both of these categories. Comparing in-depth interview data of middle-class Korean American and Mexican American college students who have realized a similar outcome, enrollment in a higher tier University of California school or rough equivalent, this study examines how the interplay of structural dimensions -- class and ethnic factors such as social location and social capital -- as well as cultural dimensions -- ethnic expectations, reference groups, and emotional support -- shapes the modes and mechanisms by which students feel "successful." Our study reveals that meaning-making processes influenced by this structural-cultural interplay yield paradoxical outcomes when analysts move beyond a single or objective focus on academic achievement. We conclude with a discussion of how scholarship on immigration, race/ethnicity, and education can move in this direction of complicating the definitions and measures of academic success.

T1  - "You Should Have Told Me That Earlier": Ethnic Return Migrants' Accounts of Discrimination
AN  - 1792585476
AB  - In this article, we take a discursive psychological approach to study how ethnic return migrants discuss and account for episodes of discrimination, with a special focus on discursive strategies employed to deal with discrimination. The data come from nine focus group discussions held with ethnic Finnish migrants who have moved to Finland in adulthood from Russia, Canada, or the United States. Results of the analysis show two distinct ways of dealing with discrimination: problematising discrimination and downplaying discrimination. Problematising was accomplished by showing the critical difference between being categorised as Finnish or non-Finnish and challenging the criteria of Finnishness. Strategies of downplaying included normalising discrimination and emphasising positive experiences. The findings are discussed in relation to ethnic return migrants' identity work and belonging to broader society. [web URL: http://jls.sagepub.com/content/35/3/268.abstract]

T1  - Putting flesh to the bone: looking for solidarity in diversity, here and now
AN  - 1789875032
AB  - In many Western European countries, concern rises that both formal mechanisms of redistribution and informal acts of charity, reciprocity and support are challenged by ethnic and cultural diversity. Against such gloomy perspectives, this paper draws on insights from sociology, geography, pedagogy and political science to argue that four traditional sources of solidarity (interdependence, shared norms and values, struggle and encounter) remain relevant, but require a rethinking of their spatial and temporal framing to capture today's intricate engagements of solidarity. More specifically, we draw on theories from the aforementioned disciplines to claim that our understanding of solidarities grounded in the spatial boundedness of territorial states and the intergenerational continuity of supposedly culturally homogeneous nations should be complemented and enriched with an in-depth knowledge of solidarities developing in an entirely different spatio-temporal register, namely that of the everyday places and practices in which people engage across ethnic and cultural boundaries.

T1  - Retirement migration and transnationalism in northern Mexico
AN  - 1784150992
AB  - This article examines the phenomenon of transnationalism among retired immigrants living in border areas of northern Mexico. Using in-depth interviews conducted with US retirees residing in Baja California, Mexico, we seek to examine how transnational aging is constructed through different practices, relationships, networks and exchanges between both cultures and countries. We analyse several analytical dimensions of transnationalism including social, economic, cultural, identity and belonging conditions. In particular, networks and exchanges among these elderly migrants are most frequently constructed across social and family networks, economic transfers, access to healthcare, and culture. Additionally, we find that these maintained transnational practices in northern Mexico parallel those of international retired migrants living in other parts of the world. However, we argue that the proximity to the US border enables and encourages many types of connections of varying intensities. Finally, we discuss the implications for future research linking transnationalism with international retirement migration.

T1  - The Influence of the Expression of Subtle and Blatant Sexual Prejudice on Personal Prejudice and Identification With the Expresser
AN  - 1754143171
AB  - Although the negative consequences of subtle and blatant prejudice for the targets of prejudice are clear in the psychological literature, the impact of exposure to subtle and blatant prejudice on non-targets remains unclear. The current work examines how exposure to blatant and subtle sexual prejudice affects non-targets' personal endorsement of prejudice and their identification with the prejudice expresser. Results suggest that relative to exposure to blatant or neutral expressions of prejudice, exposure to subtle prejudice increased prejudice levels. Individuals were also more likely to distance from the prejudice expresser when exposed to blatant compared to subtle prejudice. The implications are discussed.

T1  - Post-Colonial Consciousness and the Erotic in Iracema: Uma Transa Amazônica and Caballero: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1824184250
AB  - Borders have been commonly popularized as a space where illegal acts and perversions occur. As an area of political instability and representative of constant corporal movement, they are imagined as the impossibility of cultural development. Typical representations of the people on the border imitate an incomplete reality and, as a result, the alienation of these groups by the pre-established norms of both surrounding societies. This article reconsiders the border experience of the Amazon and Texas with the purpose of comparing and recuperating pieces of the inhabitant's bodies and experiences. In particular, the film Iracema: Uma Transa Amazônica and the historical novel Caballero will be examined. Besides their evident differences, an analogy can be constructed to show the similarities between the Amazon in the 1970s and the Mexican experience in Texas in the 1800s. These two distinct histories will demonstrate the importance of a discourse on resistance on the border and contribute to mapping the dynamic intersections of sex and gender.

T1  - Profile of Small Businesses Among Chinese in Vancouver
AN  - 1815479363
AB  - Historically, both market conditions and ethnic resources explain why the Chinese in Canada thrived in retailing and food services. More recent theories stress how changes in opportunities and relations under globalization shape immigrant business formation and practices. Canada revamped its immigration policy in response to the need for capital and skilled labour in the global age. Increased Chinese immigration in the 1980s from Hong Kong, and in the 1990s and after from PRC, substantially expanded the Vancouver Chinese population and the Chinese consumer market. By the 1980s, Chinese small businesses in Vancouver had proliferated beyond Chinatown-based retailing and food services to include professional firms and upscale restaurants. Using advertisements in The Sing Tao Daily, this study found that a new niche of small Chinese businesses in trades and construction has emerged, accounting for 85 percent of advertising in the Small Business Advertisement Section, and 15 percent of all advertisements in the Daily. The analysis suggests that the development of this new niche has been prompted by economic opportunities that are best seen as driven by demographic and market forces in the age of global migration. Alternate abstract:Historiquement, les conditions du marché et les ressources ethniques expliquent conjointement pourquoi les Chinois au Canada ont prospéré dans les services de vente au détail et des produits alimentaires. Les théories les plus récentes démontrent comment, sous le modèle de la mondialisation, ces changements ont influencé les opportunités de la formation des immigrants et des pratiques commerciales. Le Canada a remanié sa politique d'immigration pour l'adapter au besoin du capital et des compétences professionnelles à l'ère mondiale. L'accroissement de l'immigration chinoise dans les années 80 en provenance de Hong Kong et dans les années 90, ainsi qu'après la RPC, a considérablement augmenté la population chinoise de Vancouver et le taux de consommateurs chinois sur le marché. Vers les années 1980, les petites entreprises chinoises ont proliféré au-delà de la vente au détail et des produits alimentaires au niveau Chinatown, pour s'étendre aux entreprises professionnelles et restaurants haut de gamme. Se servant du record des publicités dans The Sing Tao Daily, cette étude a révélé qu'un nouveau créneau des entreprises chinoises dans les métiers et la construction a vu le jour ; ce qui représente 85 pourcent de l'espace publicitaire dans la section « Petites entreprises chinoises » de ce quotidien ; alors que 15 pourcent sont réservés à toutes les autres publicités. La présente analyse suggère que le développement de ce nouveau créneau a été incité par les opportunités économiques qui sont les mieux considérés comme entraîné par les forces démographiques et du marché à l'ère de la migration mondiale.

T1  - "There's Hardly Anything Left": Poverty and the Economic Insecurity of Elderly Filipinos in Toronto
AN  - 1815477165
AB  - As the Canadian population becomes more racially diverse, so does its elderly population. This article focuses on elderly Filipinos, whose country of origin has become the largest source of immigrants to Canada since 2006. It draws from a university-community partnership and a mixed method research of surveying 250 and interviewing 20 elderly Filipinos in Toronto to document their economic condition. With seven out of ten living in poverty, our research reveals that economic insecurity is a fact of life for most elderly Filipinos in Canada. We elaborate on their impoverished living situation by delineating three major themes from our literature review (understanding poverty, factors contributing to poverty, and outcomes of poverty) and by foregrounding particular experiences of elderly Filipinos that illustrate and extend these themes. Taking intersectionality as our analytical paradigm, we consider the poverty of elderly Filipinos as shedding light on the interlocking ways in which later life circumstances are intricately shaped and impacted by class, race, gender, and immigration. Their economic insecurity is also intimately connected to the deskilling and deprofessionalization of Filipinos in Canada, a major structural condition that has produced and reinforced the ongoing marginalization of this racialized minority community. Alternate abstract:Comme la population canadienne affiche de plus en plus une diversité raciale, il en va ainsi de ses aînés. Cet article met l'accent sur les personnes âgées de race philippine, dont le pays d'origine représente la plus grande source d'immigrants au Canada depuis 2006. Afin de documenter leur condition économique, l'étude adopte une recherche partenariale université-communauté ainsi qu'une approche mixte de sondages sur 250 aînés philippins habitant à Toronto, et d'interviews sur 20 d'entre eux. Avec sept candidats sur dix vivant sous le seuil de la pauvreté, notre recherche révèle que l'insécurité économique est une réalité quotidienne pour la plupart des aînés philippins au Canada. Nous nous penchons sur leur situation précaire en délimitant trois thèmes majeurs propre à notre analyse documentaire (la compréhension de la pauvreté, les facteurs qui contribuent à la pauvreté, et les effets de la pauvreté) et en mettant de l'avant les particulières expériences des aînés philippins qui illustrent les thèmes en question. En utilisant la notion d'intersectionnalité comme point de vue analytique, nous considérons que la pauvreté des aînés philippins met la lumière sur les façons dont les circonstances de la vie à un âge avancé sont intrinsèquement moulées et influencées par la classe sociale, la race, le sexe et l'immigration. En outre, leur insécurité économique est intimement liée à la déqualification et à la déprofessionnalisation des Philippins au Canada, des composantes majeures qui ont entraîné, puis renforcé la marginalisation continue de cette communauté minoritaire racialisée.

T1  - The Tibetanization of Henan's Mongols: ethnicity and assimilation on the Sino-Tibetan frontier
AN  - 1784139266
AB  - The Sino-Tibetan frontier is typically portrayed as a large, complex, and diverse transitional region between Tibetan and Chinese cultural realms. The concept of Tibetanization is often deployed to classify the ethnically ambiguous 'interstitial' populations of this area. This article critically examines the concept of Tibetanization through a study of the Mongols of Henan County, Qinghai Province, a population repeatedly described as Tibetanized. A survey of local folkways reveals that Henan Mongols do, indeed, share many cultural practices with neighboring Tibetans. However, an examination of the historical processes underlying these similarities fails to identify anything that could be described as Tibetanization. Based on this finding, I problematize some of Tibetanization's unexamined theoretical assumptions relating to concepts of ethnicity and assimilation. I conclude by asking what a critical reading of Tibetanization and the Sino-Tibetan frontier tells us about contemporary ethnopolitics in China and the academic practices that strive to represent them.

T1  - Neither bridging nor bonding: A test of socialization effects by ethnically diverse voluntary associations on participants' inter-ethnic tolerance, inter-ethnic trust and intra-ethnic belonging
AN  - 1764861324
AB  - The distinction between bridging and bonding associations is a cornerstone of social capital research. Nevertheless, this study is the first to provide a direct test of the socialization mechanism that supposedly causes ethnically mixed (bridging) associations to generate interethnic tolerance and trust, and homogenous (bonding) associations to cement self-affirming identities. This multilevel analysis of the Citizenship, Involvement & Democracy (CID) 1999/2000 survey data on Mannheim (Germany), Enschede (the Netherlands), and Aberdeen (Scotland) covers 3166 active participants in 645 associations. The CID includes objective, exogenous measures of each association's composition and aim. Socialization and self-selection effects are pulled apart through interactions with detailed measures of associational involvement. The results display no evidence for (diverse and homogenous) associations as socializing agents. Although inter-ethnic tolerance is higher in ethnically diverse associations, this should be attributed to self-selection effects.

T1  - Social justice and affirmative action
AN  - 1759163786
AB  - While the concept 'justice' undergirds every discourse on affirmative action, its meaning is feverishly contested with contradictory definitions wielded as battling swords in a zero sum struggle over the distribution of scarce material resources and symbolic goods. In part, the issues have become even more important since the number of states that have now embarked on affirmative action policies have been growing and the results have been diverse. Affirmative action policies have occurred most frequently in internally heterogeneous societies marked by deep ethno-cultural divisions in which one ethnic community has tended to dominate the rest. To overcome inequalities and ingrained segmental prejudices in these multi-ethnic countries that witnessed over the years the cementing of advantages and privileges among certain ethnic groups has been the primary aim of affirmative action policies. Upheavals and ongoing conflicts have generally dogged these experiences, attesting to some successful societal changes in institutions and practices, to winners and losers. In this paper, we examine some of the controversies, especially in relation to two paradigms and perspectives of social justice.

T1  - The motivation to express prejudice
AN  - 1767329637; 201605487
AB  - Contemporary prejudice research focuses primarily on people who are motivated to respond without prejudice and the ways in which unintentional bias can cause these people to act in a manner inconsistent with this motivation. However, some real-world phenomena (e.g., hate speech, hate crimes) and experimental findings (e.g., Plant & Devine, 2001, 2009) suggest that some prejudice is intentional. These phenomena and findings are difficult to explain solely from the motivations to respond without prejudice. We argue that some people are motivated to express prejudice, and we develop the Motivation to Express Prejudice Scale (MP) to measure this motivation. In 7 studies involving more than 6,000 participants, we demonstrate that, across scale versions targeted at Black people and gay men, the MP has good reliability and convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity. In normative climates that prohibit prejudice, the internal and external motivations to express prejudice are functionally nonindependent, but they become more independent when normative climates permit more prejudice toward a target group. People high in the motivation to express prejudice are relatively likely to resist pressure to support programs promoting intergroup contact and to vote for political candidates who support oppressive policies. The motivation to express prejudice predicted these outcomes even when controlling for attitudes and the motivations to respond without prejudice. This work encourages contemporary prejudice researchers to give greater consideration to the intentional aspects of negative intergroup behavior and to broaden the range of phenomena, target groups, and samples that they study.

AN  - 1747610091
AB  - Interest in examining the circumstances behind Russia's 2008 attack on Georgia has grown in light of recent developments in Ukraine. The international condemnation by the international community for Russia's 2008 attack on the Republic of Georgia -- as well as the concomitant assaults by Abkhazians and South Ossetians against ethnic Georgians within their territories -- was in large part appropriate. The self-righteous posturing coming out of Washington, however, should have been tempered by a sober recognition of the ways in which the US contributed to the crisis.

T1  - Representing harmony and diversity: media representations of multiculturalism and ethnicity in Singapore
AN  - 1784139648
AB  - This article investigates multiculturalism and ethnicity in Singapore. The study conducted a qualitative content analysis of articles appearing in the Straits Times newspaper over a three month period in 2010. It was found that multicultural harmony tended to be represented as unnatural, fragile, and requiring government intervention. There also tended to be a focus on distinct and fixed ethnic identities, reflecting an essentialist understanding of ethnicity. These beliefs about the nature of multiculturalism and ethnic identity were reflected in the coverage of three major social issues. These were the perceived needs to maintain the ethnic composition of Singapore's population, efforts to prevent cultural corruption or neglect, and concerns about the impact of immigration on multicultural harmony.

T1  - Cultural Inclusiveness Contributing to International Students' Intercultural Attitudes: Mediating Role of Intergroup Contact Variables
AN  - 1728660634; 201533989
AB  - This study sought to examine the relationships among Asian-born international students' perceived cultural inclusiveness and intercultural contact, along with the contributions these variables made to the students' attitudes towards culturally different domestic students. Based on Pettigrew's (1998) intergroup contact theory and previous research on educational cultural climate, we hypothesised that more positive intercultural attitudes would be associated with perceptions of a culturally inclusive educational environment and higher levels of intergroup contact as indicated by quantity of contact, quality of contact, and extent of intercultural friendships. Anonymous survey participants were 190 (76 male and 113 female) Asian-born international university students at an Australian university. Results showed small to moderate relationships among perceived cultural inclusiveness, all the dimensions of intercultural contact, and intercultural attitudes, except for an unexpected insignificant association between intercultural friendship and attitudes. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that cultural inclusiveness and quality of contact were the only significant predictors of intercultural attitudes. Mediation analysis indicated that quality of contact partially mediated the relationship between cultural inclusiveness and intercultural attitudes. The importance of an inclusive educational environment on intergroup contact and attitudes, from international students' viewpoint, is discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Identity and belonging: Saudi female international students and their use of social networking sites
AN  - 1661535605
AB  - This article explores the ways in which Saudi female international students (SFIS) in Australia use social networking sites (SNS) to help them form social networks and present their online identity. Based on themes derived from five in-depth interviews, findings suggest that SFIS use SNS in a way that helps them foster a sense of belonging and connectivity regardless of their location. Currently SFIS use Facebook mainly to keep in touch with friends and family that are both local and international; gain knowledge of the various social and political events happening around them; and have 'fun'. Similar to findings in the literature on social media use by students, SFIS form distinct virtual social networks made up not only of their conational Saudi friends, but also international Saudi as well as Australian and international friends whom they have face to face contact within Australia. As their main purpose of using SNS was to keep in touch with friends, SFIS reported using their real and accurate identity to make it easy for friends to find them. However, when it comes to the online sharing of personal photos SFIS showed a negative attitude towards posting their personal photos due to cultural considerations. Overall, findings of the study align with the literature in which SNS such as Facebook are instrumental for SFIS in maintaining a strong sense of connectivity and bonding while they are temporarily out of their home country.

T1  - Beyond "Model Minority," "Superwoman," and "Endangered Species": Theorizing Intersectional Coalitions among Black Immigrants, African American Women, and African American Men
AN  - 1929902152
AB  - This essay brings an intersectional framework to the academic and popular discourse regarding relations of power among African American men, African American women, and Black immigrants. I demonstrate that African American women and Black immigrants are not necessarily and always more successful than African American men. Instead, all three groups share an experience of gendered and ethnicized racism that situates them differently in the labor force, the classroom, and beyond. Most importantly, African American men, African American women, and Black immigrants can forge feminist, anti-racist, and anti-nativist coalitions if and when they recognize that what it means to experience gendered and ethnicized racism is the result of rather than the reason for their politics.

T1  - A post-genomic surprise. The molecular reinscription of race in science, law and medicine
AN  - 1700673573; 201525194
AB  - The completion of the first draft of the Human Genome Map in 2000 was widely heralded as the promise and future of genetics-based medicines and therapies - so much so that pundits began referring to the new century as 'The Century of Genetics'. Moreover, definitive assertions about the overwhelming similarities of all humans' DNA (99.9 per cent) by the leaders of the Human Genome Project were trumpeted as the end of racial thinking about racial taxonomies of human genetic differences. But the first decade of the new century brought unwelcomed surprises. First, gene therapies turned out to be far more complicated than any had anticipated - and instead the pharmaceutical industry turned to a focus on drugs that might be 'related' to population differences based upon genetic markers. While the language of 'personalized medicine' dominated this frame, research on racially and ethnically designated populations differential responsiveness to drugs dominated the empirical work in the field. Ancestry testing and 'admixture research' would play an important role in a new kind of molecular reification of racial categories. Moreover, the capacity of the super-computer to map differences reverberated into personal identification that would affect both the criminal justice system and forensic science, and generate new levels of concern about personal privacy. Social scientists in general, and sociologists in particular, have been caught short by these developments - relying mainly on assertions that racial categories are socially constructed, regionally and historically contingent, and politically arbitrary. While these assertions are true, the imprimatur of scientific legitimacy has shifted the burden, since now 'admixture research' can claim that its results get at the 'reality' of human differentiation, not the admittedly flawed social constructions of racial categories. Yet what was missing from this framing of the problem: 'admixture research' is itself based upon socially constructed categories of race. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Contact, Prejudicial Attitudes, and Policy Preferences: The Case of the U.S. Military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Policy
AN  - 1667948910; 201509178
AB  - Data from 115,052 active United States military personnel were analyzed to explore links between contact with gay people and attitudes about repealing 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' Results showed that prejudice against homosexuals significantly mediated the association between contact and supporting repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'; quality of contact in the military was a stronger predictor than other measures of contact. Quality and quantity of contact interacted: more contact quantity had opposing statistical effects on policy attitudes for people experiencing high versus low quality contact. Findings are discussed in terms of contact theory, the association between intergroup attitudes and policy preferences, and practical implications for situations in which groups' access to new positions or roles is limited, and hence contact opportunities are rare. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This paper discusses the coverage given to Ukrainian Canadian topics in two Alberta newspapers, the Edmonton Journal and the Edmonton Bulletin, during the World War II years. Examples of the subjects included in the essay are Ukrainian Canadian participation in the war effort through enlistments in the Canadian armed forces and other ways, the banning of the Ukrainian Labour-Farmer Temple Association, the formation of the Ukrainian Canadian Committee, the raising of the matter of Ukrainian independence, and the Canadian conscription plebiscite of 27 April 1942. The two newspapers published in the provincial capital accorded significant attention to Ukrainian Canadian issues, a coverage that was paralleled by the many stories that related to Ukraine, a major battleground in the war.Alternate abstract:Cet article porte sur la couverture donnée à des sujets concernant les Canadiens ukrainiens dans deux journaux albertains, le Edmonton Journal et le Edmonton Bulletin, pendant la deuxième guerre mondiale.

Les deux journaux, publiés dans la capitale provinciale, ont porté une très grande attention à tout ce qui touche les Canadiens ukrainiens. Ils leur accordèrent une couverture équivalente à celle des nombreux reportages sur l’Ukraine, un champ de bataille majeur pendant la guerre.

T1  - Collecting Ukrainian Heritage: Peter Orshinsky and Leonard Krawchuk
AN  - 1749278695
AB  - Most discussions about collectors of folk art focus on financial issues, examining what makes an object valuable and worth collecting. But financial gain is not the primary motivation of all collectors. When it comes to folk art associated with heritage, collectors are driven by a desire to connect to a past. Often this is a past with which the collectors themselves had no direct contact, but one which they feel they need to understand in order to make sense of their own identity. Folk art objects make the past tangible; they allow a physical link to something that needs to be grasped to be understood. Peter Orshinsky and Leonard Krawchuk are two important collectors of Ukrainian folk art. Their lives provide instructive case studies that help us understand heritage collecting.Alternate abstract:La plupart des travaux sur les collectionneurs d’art populaire sont focalisés sur les problèmes financiers; on y étudie ce qui rend un objet précieux et digne d’être acquis. Mais le profit n’est pas la motivation principale des collectionneurs. Quand il s’agit d’art populaire associé à un patrimoine, c’est plutôt le désir de se connecter à un passé qui les y pousse. Il n’y a souvent rien de commun entre eux et ce passé, mais ils éprouvent le besoin de le comprendre afin de donner du sens à leur propre identité. Les objets d’art populaire donnent au passé une réalité que l’on peut toucher, ils permettent d’avoir un lien physique avec quelque chose que l’on doit saisir pour le comprendre. Peter Orshinsky et Leonard Krawchuk sont deux collectionneurs importants d’art populaire ukrainien. Leur vie nous fournit une étude de cas fort instructive qui nous aide à comprendre l’acquisition d’objets patrimoniaux.

T1  - Entrapped transnationalism: West Bank and Israeli Palestinians between closeness and distance
AN  - 1722763422
AB  - Studies of transnationalism typically frame it in opposition to the entrapping effects of borders. Yet, for many people, transnationalism is negotiated in contexts marked by forced separation and differential mobility. Drawing on long-term fieldwork among West Bank and Israeli Palestinians, this article explores transnational ties and orientations in relation, not in opposition, to the entrapping effects of borders. Specifically, I examine the two-way traffic in emotions and perceptions that marks family, social and symbolic relationships between West Bank and Israeli Palestinians. I show how entrapping and transnational processes combine to generate a tense interplay between closeness and distance, solidarity and estrangement. The paper calls attention to complex transnational formations among people prone to entrapment such as detained and deported migrants, refugees and minorities divided by rigid borders, and it suggests that a focus on emotions and perceptions is critical if we are to understand such formations.

T1  - National ethics in ethnic conflicts: the Zionist 'Iron Wall' and the 'Arab Question'
AN  - 1680151103; 201513877
AB  - Ethnic conflicts often involve a delegitimation of the rival ethnic community and its national aspirations. This, I suggest, can impel the community in question to legitimate its politics through ethical principles, which in turn may affect its policies. An abiding non-recognition of the ethnonational movement from within and without may engender ethical transformation and policy reorientation. Empirically, I trace the emergence, evolvement and possible effects of the Zionist 'Iron Wall' ethics. The original concept comprised the horizon of Arab recognition and peace, the strategy of containment, and the moral pillars of reciprocal self-determination and the lesser injustice. Iron Wall ethics, while constantly challenged, predominated much of Zionism's history, culminating in the 1990s peace process. However, in the wake of the Second Palestinian Intifada, a prevailing assertion that the Arabs would never accept Israel's right to exist has undermined the Iron Wall's original ideals, rewriting its strategic prescription.

T1  - Do Ethnically Mixed Classrooms Promote Inclusive Attitudes Towards Immigrants Everywhere? A Study Among Native Adolescents in 14 Countries
AN  - 1728660421; 201535515
AB  - This article examines attitudes among 14-year-old native students in 14 Western countries to assess how out-group size, as measured by the proportion of first- and second-generation migrant children in a class, is related to inclusive views on immigrants. It develops three competing hypotheses: (i) higher proportions of immigrants contribute to inclusive views everywhere; (ii) higher proportions have a negative effect on inclusive views everywhere; (iii) the effect of out-group size depends on the ratio of first- to second-generation migrant children: the higher this ratio, the weaker the effect. It discovers that out-group size is positively related to inclusive views on immigrants in countries where second-generation outnumber first-generation migrant children (i.e., the old immigration states), and that there is no significant link with such views in countries where the reverse is the case (i.e., the new immigration states). The same regularity applies at the classroom level: in classes with more second than first generation students, out-group size enhances inclusive views while it shows no relationship to such views in classes with more first than second generation students. The results thus support the third hypothesis. The non-relation in contexts with many first generation students may well be a temporary phenomenon, however. Once immigrant communities have become more settled and integrated in the destination countries, positive effects of ethnic mixing could well emerge everywhere. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Impact of Ethnic Diversity on Participation in European Voluntary Organizations: Direct and Indirect Pathways
AN  - 1718064655; 201531184
AB  - In this study, we test whether Putnam's general claim of a negative effect of ethnic diversity holds for (active and passive) involvement in three types of voluntary organizations: leisure, interest, and activist organizations. Using data from the European Social Survey (wave 1), we applied multilevel analyses distinguishing individuals, regions, and countries. Only at the regional level, did we find that ethnic diversity reduced involvement in interest organizations. Yet, ethnic diversity induced passive involvement in activist organizations. Subsequently, we included mechanisms derived from conflict and contact theory to disentangle the indirect effects of ethnic diversity. Ethnic threat perceptions influenced participation in all voluntary associations negatively, while intergroup contact turned out to have positive influences. Our findings stress the necessity of distinguishing different types of voluntary organizations and modes of involvement and underline the importance of incorporating indirect effects of ethnic diversity.

T1  - Purpose in Life as a Resource for Increasing Comfort With Ethnic Diversity
AN  - 1708525508; 201528609
AB  - Emerging demographic trends signal that White Americans will soon relinquish their majority status. As Whites' acclimation to an increasingly diverse society is poised to figure prominently in their adjustment, identifying sources of greater comfort with diversity is important. Three studies (N = 519) revealed evidence that purpose in life bolsters comfort with ethnic diversity among White adults. Specifically, dispositional purpose was positively related to diversity attitudes and attenuated feelings of threat resulting from viewing demographic projections of greater diversity. In addition, when primed experimentally, purpose attenuated participants' preferences for living in an ethnically homogeneous-White city, relative to a more diverse city when shown maps displaying ethno-demographic information. These effects persisted after controlling for positive affect and perceived connections to ethnic out-groups, suggesting the robust influence of purpose. Potential benefits of situating purpose as a unique resource for navigating an increasingly diverse society are discussed.

T1  - Stereotypes as Stumbling-Blocks: How Coping With Stereotype Threat Affects Life Outcomes for People With Physical Disabilities
AN  - 1708527322; 201528681
AB  - Stereotype threat, the concern about being judged in light of negative stereotypes, causes underperformance in evaluative situations. However, less is known about how coping with stereotypes can aggravate underperformance over time. We propose a model in which ongoing stereotype threat experiences threaten a person's sense of self-integrity, which in turn prompts defensive avoidance of stereotype-relevant situations, impeding growth, achievement, and well-being. We test this model in an important but understudied population: the physically disabled. In Study 1, blind adults reporting higher levels of stereotype threat reported lower self-integrity and well-being and were more likely to be unemployed and to report avoiding stereotype-threatening situations. In Study 2's field experiment, blind students in a compensatory skill-training program made more progress if they had completed a values-affirmation, an exercise that bolsters self-integrity. The findings suggest that stereotype threat poses a chronic threat to self-integrity and undermines life outcomes for people with disabilities.

T1  - The Woking Mosque Muslims: British Islam in the Early Twentieth Century
AN  - 1667951819; 201509626
AB  - This paper discusses the views and social character of the group of British Muslims, centred round the Woking Mosque in the period immediately following the First World War. It argues that this group had four distinctive characteristics. First, it formed its own cultural community, rather than joining a pre-existing ethnic community. Second, it espoused an orthodox but modernistic Islam, influenced by-while not sharing the distinctive doctrines of-the Lahore Ahmadiyya. Third, it faced a leadership problem. Other than Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din (who played a key role in the group's early days, and who was a leading member of the Lahore Ahmadiyya, but had been given a specific brief not to spread their distinctive doctrines), the group was in many ways thrown upon its own resources. Here, Marmaduke Pickthall-subsequently the author of The Meaning of the Glorious Quran-played a major role. But while he had good colloquial and subsequently classical Arabic, his knowledge of Islam was largely self-taught. A final problem here was posed by the fact that the group attracted some converts-including Lord Headley-who exercised considerable influence because of their social standing, but whose knowledge of Islam was limited.

T1  - Xenophobia online: unmasking Singaporean attitudes towards 'foreign talent' migrants
AN  - 1667950880; 201509509
AB  - In recent years, Singaporeans have become highly anxious about the future of their country and their own personal livelihood due to the influx of educated and professional migrants known as 'foreign talent' and express their ire at the presence of these migrants through xenophobic posts online. This article suggests that such comments, however, are indicative of the feelings of disillusionment and abandonment Singaporeans have towards the People's Action Party - the only government Singaporeans have ever known. While Singaporeans have been critical of their government on economic issues that impact their lifestyle and existence, it is the presence of foreign talent migrants that have pushed Singaporeans into using the migrant situation to emotively express their opinions of disappointment in the government and its policies online like no other issue, functioning as the unlikely glue that has galvanised and united an ethnically disparate Singaporean population.

T1  - Russians in post-Soviet Central Asia: more 'cold' than the others? Exploring (ethnic) identity under different sociopolitical settings
AN  - 1512218827; 201408837
AB  - This paper explores the identity and the social/political behaviour of Russians in post-Soviet Central Asia through a comparison with the Baltic countries via a 'hot and cold ethnicity' paradigm. Central Asian Russians are more likely, ceteris paribus, to be found at the 'cold' end of the spectrum of 'ethnic temperatures'. The article starts with outlining the historical roots of a specific Russians' self-designation in the 'imperial peripheries' -- that is, a lowered attachment to their ethnic group as compared with loyalties towards the state. However, patterns of imperial penetration into different territories of the former USSR (FSU) were different, and so were the sociopolitical conditions under which Russians have found themselves after the collapse of the FSU. Due to this, patterns of Russians' self-designation turned out to be quite divergent: Central Asia represents a contrasting pattern in comparison with the Baltics. Subsequent parts of the paper contain a more detailed analysis of the reasons behind a relatively 'cold' ethnic stance of Russians in Central Asia. These reasons include the salience of sociocultural boundaries versus ethnic ones, the nature of local political regimes, the role of Russian language and culture, official and popular interpretation of the Soviet past and attitudes towards the present-day Russia.

T1  - Playing Violent Video Games Increases Intergroup Bias
AN  - 1494750769; 201401881
AB  - Previous research has shown how, why, and for whom violent video game play is related to aggression and aggression-related variables. In contrast, less is known about whether some individuals are more likely than others to be the target of increased aggression after violent video game play. The present research examined the idea that the effects of violent video game play are stronger when the target is a member of an outgroup rather than an ingroup. In fact, a correlational study revealed that violent video game exposure was positively related to ethnocentrism. This relation remained significant when controlling for trait aggression. Providing causal evidence, an experimental study showed that playing a violent video game increased aggressive behavior, and that this effect was more pronounced when the target was an outgroup rather than an ingroup member. Possible mediating mechanisms are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.]

T1  - Stereotype Threat and Lift Effects in Motor Task Performance: The Mediating Role of Somatic and Cognitive Anxiety
AN  - 1559005303; 201431837
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to replicate the stereotype threat and lift effects in a motor task in a neutral sex-typed activity, using somatic and cognitive anxiety as key mediators of these phenomena. It was hypothesized that an ingroup/outgroup social categorization based on gender would have distinctive effects for female and male participants. A total of 161 French physical education students were randomly assigned to three threat conditions-no threat, female threat, and male threat-thus leading to a 3 * 2 (threat by gender) design. The analyses revealed a stereotype lift effect on the performances for both male and female participants, as well as a stereotype threat effect only for female participants. They also indicated that somatic anxiety had a mediating effect on the performance of female participants targeted by a negative stereotype, but that it had a facilitating effect on their performance. The stereotype threat and lift effects on motor tasks were replicated in a neutral sex-typed activity and somatic anxiety seems to have a facilitating mediating effect of the relationships between the gender-conditions (control or female threat) interaction and free-throw performance. The model used to distinguish somatic and cognitive anxiety appeared to be a relevant means of explaining the stereotype threat and lift mechanisms. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - CIRCLING BACK: RECONSTITUTING ETHNIC COMMUNITY NETWORKS AMONG AGING FILIPINO AMERICANS
AN  - 1504422341; 201405542
AB  - Although there is an expansive literature on the assimilation and transnational experiences of middle-aged immigrants and their second generation children, little work examines the experiences of immigrant elderly, particularly Asian Americans. Existing scholarship on segmented assimilation has generally assumed that elderly immigrant experiences continue the trajectories of middle age. Drawing on in depth interviews with elderly Filipino American immigrants, the author finds a shift from the white middle-class mainstream path to an ethnic networks path of incorporation. Although middle-class immigrants may exhibit patterns and living situations similar to native whites throughout most of their lives, their experiences as racialized Americans may prompt desires to reconnect with ethnic networks in later life. This pattern, in which groups that have ostensibly assimilated throughout their life course recreate ethnic communities near the end of it, is rendered visible through a framework the author terms life course assimilation, which emphasizes the need to study assimilation processes at all life stages.

T1  - No Doubt About It: When Doubtful Role Models Undermine Men's and Women's Math Performance Under Threat
AN  - 1559005250; 201431848
AB  - Past work has shown that female role models are effective buffers against stereotype threat. The present research examines the boundary conditions of this role model effect. Specifically, we argue that female role models should avoid expressing doubt about their math abilities; otherwise they may cease to buffer women from stereotype threat. For men, a non-doubtful male role model should be seen as threatening, thus harming performance. A doubtful male role model, however, should be seen as non-threatening, thus allowing men to perform up to their ability in math. To test this reasoning, men and women were exposed to either an outgroup or ingroup role model who either expressed doubt or did not. Participants then took a math exam under stereotype threat conditions. As expected, doubtful ingroup role models hurt women, but helped men's performance. Outgroup role models' expressed doubt had no differential effect on performance. We also show that expressions of doubt take on a different meaning when expressed by a female rather than a male role model. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Occupational status differences in attributions of uniquely human emotions
AN  - 1504422984; 201405348
AB  - Infrahumanization theory has claimed that groups tend to infrahumanize, and thus denigrate, each other irrespective of group status. However, research on infrahumanization has mainly addressed status in the context of national, ethnic, and regional divisions. The present studies tested the effect of group status in infrahumanization by employing occupational groups of varied status, both in abstract (blue-collar vs. white-collar workers) and specific terms (lawyers vs. shopkeepers, and high school teachers vs. university faculty members and primary school teachers). The results showed that only relatively higher status groups always attributed uniquely human emotions more to their in-group than to lower status out-groups. In contrast, lower status groups showed no bias in attributions of uniquely human emotions, or were biased in favour of the higher status out-group. The discussion of these results points to the role of consensus in the distribution of social value amongst groups of asymmetric status. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Passing" as (Non)Ethnic: The Israeli Version of Acting White
AN  - 1463011683; 201345863
AB  - This article offers a cultural analysis of the practice of "acting white" in a society where the distinction between black and white is vague and primarily symbolic and where the hegemonic discourse denies the existence of ethnic inequality and encourages ethnic integration. In the Israeli context, acting white or passing (in Hebrew, hishtaknezut or "Ashkenazification") refers to mimicking the habitus of the dominant (European) ethnic group. Based on qualitative research, we argue that hishtaknezut is the cultural script offered by Israeli society in response to both the national discourse of the "ingathering of the exiles" and the neoliberal demand for identities devoid of ethnic markers as a precondition for economic mobility. However, the concept of hishtaknezut functions as a shaming interpellation highlighting both the act of mimicry and its inherent failure. Passing as "white" in Israel entails a twofold sense of shame, over both one's ethnic origin and the concealment of that origin by mimicking another group. This practice carries with it an individual, apolitical stigma that reaffirms the neoliberal, non-ethnic perception of Israeli society. The prevalence of Ashkenazification, along with its signification of imperfection, attests to the perpetuation of the ethnic order in Israel, which relies on an Orientalist discourse that distinguishes between "worthy" social positions and "unworthy" ones from which one must escape to achieve social privileges.

T1  - Community cohesion without parallel lives in Bradford
AN  - 1448995672; 201342930
AB  - The concept of community cohesion is the centrepiece of the policy that was formulated by the British government in response to the urban disturbances in northern English towns during 2001. A number of official reports identified lack of community cohesion as the critical factor. The central argument for community cohesion, the self-segregation thesis, was based on evidence from Bradford. The core idea, parallel lives, was first articulated in the Ouseley Report and incorporated into the Cantle Report and subsequent government reports into the 2001 disturbances. The Commission for Integration and Cohesion widened the concept of community cohesion, which encompassed faith and ethnic groups, to include income and generation, suggesting that the concept was more complex than earlier definitions allowed. However, the increasing concern with terrorism has meant that Muslims remain the focus of debates on cohesion, and a conflation of the community cohesion programme with the government's anti-terrorism strategy is evident in the policy literature. Samad's article is based on research carried out in Bradford to unearth and explore the factors that enhance or undermine community cohesion in those areas where there are established Muslim communities and, additionally, those in which Muslim migrants have recently arrived. It scrutinizes the debate on a number of issues: the difficulties in defining and implementing community cohesion policy, and the issues of segregation, social capital, transnationalism and belonging. This data-driven analysis takes the main areas of debate and tests them with evidence from Bradford. The research findings challenge some of the fundamental assumptions that have informed government policy by providing new evidence that throws light on central aspects of the debate. The need to reflect on these assumptions became more relevant after the English riots of 2011, centred in London, and the subsequent necessity to develop an effective strategy that engages with their root causes.

T1  - Determinants of life satisfaction among race groups in South Africa
AN  - 1438556080; 201340208
AB  - Economic indicators, like gross domestic product per capita, are commonly used as indicators of welfare. However, they have a very limited and narrow scope, excluding many potentially important welfare determinants, such as health, relative income and religion -- not surprising since they were not designed to fill this role. As a result, there is growing acceptance, and use of, subjective measures of well-being (called 'happiness' or 'life satisfaction', often used interchangeably) both worldwide and in South Africa. Happiness economics does not propose to replace income-based measures of well-being, but rather attempts to complement them with broader measures, which can be important in making policy decisions that optimise societal welfare. This paper tests for differences in subjective well-being between race groups in South Africa, and investigates the determinants of self-rated life satisfaction for each group. Using the 2008 National Income Dynamics Study data, descriptive methods (analysis of variance) and an ordered probit model are applied. Results indicate that reported life satisfaction differs substantially among race groups, with black South Africans being the least satisfied group despite changes since the advent of democracy in 1994. Higher levels of educational attainment increased satisfaction for the whole sample, and women (particularly black women) are generally less satisfied than men. As found in many other studies, unemployed people have lower levels of life satisfaction than the employed, even when controlling for income and relative income. The determinants of life satisfaction are also different for each race group: white South Africans attach greater importance to physical health, whereas employment status and absolute income matter greatly for black people. For coloured people and black people, positional status (as measured by relative income) is an important determinant of well-being, with religious involvement contributing significantly to the well-being of Indian people.

T1  - A BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED URBAN WATERS
AN  - 1429636528; 201335744
AB  - Generating new understandings of the contributions of W. E. B. Du Bois's The Philadelphia Negro for sociology and social science more generally, this article posits that the urban analysis provided in the book demonstrates how interwoven cultural and economic factors undergird the social organization of urban communities more so than any pragmatic economic pattern or logic. It is the interwoven nature of these factors (defined in this article as the counterintuitive economic logics of the study) that have been insufficiently acknowledged in recent decades of social scientific urban studies research. Exploring the interwoven nature of cultural and economic factors in the sustenance of Philadelphia's Black Seventh Ward, this article suggests that the agency of African Americans is a critical, yet undervalued, aspect of their urban living. This article situates W. E. B. Du Bois as the first of some later voices (mostly within urban ethnography) that offer a corrective and alternative to urban spatial conceptual frameworks that did not and do not fully account for the persistent influence of race and the agency of racial minorities on the landscape of American cities.

T1  - I'm like you and you're like me: Social projection and self-stereotyping both help explain self-other correspondence
AN  - 1347784821; 201318415
AB  - Social projection and self-stereotyping are rival explanations for self-other correspondence, in which people tend to perceive a high degree of similarity between themselves and others. The present research shows that both accounts are correct -- that is, that knowledge of the self and knowledge of others are mutually constraining. In Study 1, participants whose self-views were experimentally manipulated revised their judgments of an immediate ingroup. In Study 2, an analogous manipulation of ingroup traits altered participants' self-views. In Study 3, participants who were ascribed a trait readily projected to and stereotyped from their relevant ingroup, but not to or from an outgroup. Finally, Study 4 provides reaction-latency evidence for social projection and self-stereotyping as judgmental processes leading to self-other correspondence. In this task, participants referenced self-knowledge when reaching ingroup-descriptiveness judgments (evidence for social projection) and ingroup knowledge when judging the self (evidence for self-stereotyping). Implications for the debate between protocentric and egocentric accounts of person perception are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Silver and Hotcakes and Beer: Irish Montreal in the 1840s
AN  - 1494299921; 201402108
AB  - The papers of Bartholomew O'Brien, innkeeper and broker of silver, offer a fresh look at Montreal's Irish Catholic community in the 1840s. His interventions illustrate the way an individual navigated an "ethnicized" social network and circulated resources between the market economy and the gift economy, spheres that Ferdinand Tonnies termed the Gesellschaft and the Gemeinschaft (1887). In a city embarked on the revolution of steam power, the two circuits were braided together, and, despite the obsolescence of Tonnies' original formulation, the distinction reveals some persistent features of the invasive nature of capital and human responses to its perennial re-structuring of the urban economy. When the market faltered, each of the several ethnic communities worked to buffer its members through a personal web of trust. The evidence is based on archival sources: O'Brien's own correspondence and daybook, parish registers, and leases and loans conserved in notaries' repertories. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Total policing: reflections from the frontline
AN  - 1373427811; 201328571
AB  - Drawing on discussions at a symposium in June 2012, on 'Policing communities: race, class and the state' (organised by the Institute of Race Relations and the Power, Conflict and Justice Research Group, Edge Hill University, in conjunction with the Tottenham Defence Campaign), the author reflects on public order policing, past and present, and traces the ways in which strategies used in Northern Ireland were and are transferred to Britain, especially in relation to black and minority ethnic communities. She draws attention to the ways in which emergency anti-terror legislation and numerous new laws further criminalise and control poor and marginalised communities today. It is only through showing solidarity that a new 'frontline' can be established to protect those communities no longer policed 'by consent', but 'by enforcement'. Further analysis on the implications of policing following the Good Friday Agreement is presented by Daniel Holder in his commentary, 'Police accountability, the Irish peace process and the continuing challenge of secrecy', in this issue.

AN  - 1266146297; 201300411
AB  - The authors studied the entrepreneurial culture among Albanian smugglers and traffickers using 43 Albanian judicial files in Belgium from 1995-2005. They analyse the niches that these "entrepreneurs" created as well as the way they invested profits. The authors also analyse the personal agency of the smuggled and trafficked clients, and practices that may help to explain the specific entrepreneurial culture. Short comparisons are made with other ethnic criminal groups engaged in similar activities during the same period in Belgium. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Disadvantage, Ethnic Niching or Pursuit of a Vision
AN  - 1322723965; 201310763
AB  - As immigrant groups grow older, host societies are faced with new challenges of integration. In a labor market that is structured by ethnicity and gender, the demand for culturally competent care provides immigrant women with the opportunity to become entrepreneurs within the care sector. This article analyzes 20 in-depth interviews with immigrant women from 13 countries who are entrepreneurs in home-help services for elderly people. The article analyzes the complex motives behind the women's entrepreneurship. Ethnic entrepreneurship has mainly been approached as a way for immigrants to survive in the labor market-the disadvantage theory-or as a means to create job opportunities for co-ethnics within ethnic economies. Opposed to this, three main motives appear in the analysis: first, the processes of ethnic and gender sorting in the care sector; second, ethnic strategies in the labor market; and third, the wish to gain independence and improve the quality of care. Only in a few cases is ethnic entrepreneurship practiced within ethnic economies; instead, it is mainly found within cross-cultural economies, consisting of employees and customers of mixed origin who are embedded in a majority society. The women construct their ethnic identities to compete in the segmented Swedish labor market by creating ethnic identities of care that are adjusted to meet the needs of their customers in a cross-cultural society.

T1  - Cross-ethnic Labour Solidarities among Myanmar Workers in Thailand
AN  - 1315602236; 201307512
AB  - With a prominent focus on military conflicts in Myanmar, international media coverage has tended to emphasize the divisiveness of ethnicity in the country. This article, by contrast, looks at interpersonal ties and formations of solidarity amongst an ethnically and religiously diverse body of workers from Myanmar, now residing in Thailand. Drawing on in-depth interviews conducted with Myanmar workers, the central argument of this article is that shared socio-economic grievances have served as salient bases of cohesion and collective action within this multi-ethnic, multi-religious migrant labour context.

T1  - Generational differences in young adults' life goals, concern for others, and civic orientation, 1966-2009
AN  - 1347785778; 201318560
AB  - Three studies examined generational differences in life goals, concern for others, and civic orientation among American high school seniors (Monitoring the Future; N = 463,753, 1976-2008) and entering college students (The American Freshman; N = 8.7 million, 1966-2009). Compared to Baby Boomers (born 1946-1961) at the same age, GenX'ers (born 1962-1981) and Millennials (born after 1982) considered goals related to extrinsic values (money, image, fame) more important and those related to intrinsic values (self-acceptance, affiliation, community) less important. Concern for others (e.g., empathy for outgroups, charity donations, the importance of having a job worthwhile to society) declined slightly. Community service rose but was also increasingly required for high school graduation over the same time period. Civic orientation (e.g., interest in social problems, political participation, trust in government, taking action to help the environment and save energy) declined an average of d = -.34, with about half the decline occurring between GenX and the Millennials. Some of the largest declines appeared in taking action to help the environment. In most cases, Millennials slowed, though did not reverse, trends toward reduced community feeling begun by GenX. The results generally support the "Generation Me" view of generational differences rather than the "Generation We" or no change views. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Symbolic Boundaries and Ideology in the Norwegian Multicultural Society: A Longitudinal Study of Public Discourse
AN  - 1023026791; 201223736
AB  - Group boundaries between immigrant minority and majority members are currently undergoing considerable and complex changes in European multicultural societies due to migration. In this paper, we present a descriptive, longitudinal investigation of the usage of linguistic expressions in Norwegian media discourse that describe symbolic boundary developments between immigrant minority and majority members, and their multicultural context. Seventy-two expressions are analyzed, and three temporal usage patterns are described (increasing, decreasing, and 'mountain') as central to understanding current symbolic boundaries and how they may both frame and be shaped by ideologies. Expressions describing immigrant minorities have increasingly focused on their establishment in the Norwegian multicultural society and have also shifted from general boundaries of outsiderness to increasingly specified boundaries of origins, visibility, and immigrant otherness. Norwegian majority expressions have mostly shifted toward a focus on origins. Our analysis suggests that symbolic boundaries in the Norwegian multicultural society have been changing rapidly. They seem to be shaped by complex ideological patterns constructing both similarities and differences, and which simultaneously seem to promote both inclusion and exclusion for certain immigrant minorities.

T1  - Social Energy and Racial Segregation in the University Context
AN  - 1221414187; 201245519
AB  - Objectives: Universities often promote their diversity as a selling point, but are students of different races at these universities integrated socially? Using theories on social energy, I examine racial segregation among university students. Methods: Quantitative data were collected on student residence patterns and social groupings formed at lunch tables at a case study university. In addition, interviews were conducted with 25 students. Results: Students are substantially more segregated than chance predicts. Blacks and Hispanics are particularly segregated. Interviews reveal that these students spend large amounts of social energy coping with prejudice and discrimination as well as functioning in a student culture they find unwelcoming and foreign. Conclusions: Social energy drains on minority students from discrimination and an unwelcoming campus culture reduce energy left for interracial interaction, making these racial groups more segregated. The study highlights the need for understanding segregation as a function of the interaction of out-group preferences, in-group preferences, and the larger social context.

T1  - Resources, Social Networks, and Collective Action Frames of College Students Who Join the Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement
AN  - 1283641969; 201303473
AB  - This article explores the reasons why some college students join the gay and lesbian rights movements. After addressing the frequency of students joining this social movement, the article then considers the contexts and motivations behind such actions. To explore the catalysts to gay and lesbian rights activism, this study utilizes variables from resource, mobilizing, and framing theories of political participation. Using data from 820 heterosexual, lesbian, gay, and bisexual students, we found that economic and educational resources failed to explain participation in gay and lesbian politics. Instead, predictors of gay and lesbian activism were more closely aligned to four key variables: the political orientations of trusted peers, knowing full-fledged activists, an ability to recognize heterosexism, and participants' maintenance of activist identities.

T1  - Behavioural consequences of imagining intergroup contact with stigmatized outgroups
AN  - 1023028878; 201223706
AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an outgroup member would change intergroup behaviour. Participants who had imagined a positive interaction with an outgroup member or an unspecified stranger were told that they were about to take part in a discussion task with an outgroup member. They were taken to a room and asked to set out two chairs ready for the discussion while the experimenter left, ostensibly to find the other participant. The distance between the two chairs was then measured. Undergraduate students who imagined talking to an obese individual (Experiment 1) or a Muslim individual (Experiment 2) placed the chairs significantly closer than those in the control condition. They also reported more positive feelings and beliefs regarding Muslims. These findings highlight an important practical application of imagined contact: preparing people for successful face-to-face contact.

T1  - Travel Behavior among Latino Immigrants: The Role of Ethnic Concentration and Ethnic Employment
AN  - 1018359511; 201212867
AB  - This article investigates the determinants of Latino immigrants' travel mode choices (auto alone, carpool, transit, and other modes) from six different immigrant gateways: Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of living in ethnically concentrated locations and working in ethnically concentrated employment sectors in shaping their choices. The results indicate that living in areas with higher ethnic concentrations increases both the likelihood of carpooling and of taking public transit. Furthermore, working in an ethnic niche is a strong predictor of carpooling versus driving alone in five metropolitan areas, and of taking transit versus driving alone in four metropolitan areas.

T1  - Going and Coming and Going Again: Second-Generation Migrants in Dubai
AN  - 1531932458; 201423226
AB  - The government of the United Arab Emirates requires all foreign migrant workers to reside on temporary visas. This affects transnational mobility patterns among the one class of residents whom we should expect to show the least degree of transnationalism: second-generation migrants. While the degree of transnationalism varies, a very high number of these migrants leave, then return and then leave again from Dubai. Drawing on 51 semi-structured interviews conducted in Dubai amongst second-generation migrants, most of them of South Asian origin, I argue that the state's policy towards migrants is important, and more determining than other factors such as ethnic/nationality communities in understanding these migrants' transnational behaviour.

T1  - Children's social groups and intergroup prejudice: Assessing the influence and inhibition of social group norms
AN  - 1081866998; 201235092
AB  - A simulation group study examined whether the effects of group norms on 7- and 9-year-old children's intergroup attitudes can be moderated by a contrary school norm. Children learnt that their school had an inclusion norm, were assigned to a group with an outgroup inclusion or exclusion norm, and indicated their ingroup and outgroup attitudes under teacher surveillance or not. Results revealed reduced outgroup liking when the group had an exclusion norm, but that the effect was moderated when the school had an inclusion norm, especially among the older children. The participants' ingroup liking was also reduced, but teacher surveillance had no effect on attitudes. The findings are discussed in relation to possible strategies to moderate social group norm effects. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Representing Race: Ongoing Uncertainties about Finnish American Racial Identity
AN  - 925714536; 201204156
AB  - The racial identity of Finns has been ambiguous from a very early point in their history in the United States up to the present. One thing is certain: they were not conclusively white on arrival. The John Svan court case from 1908 is a reflection of the ways that an uncertain racial identity can be parlayed into a politicized agenda to deny citizenship rights to a particular group of immigrants, in this instance due to their radical political activities. A book commissioned by the Knights of Kaleva and published in 1957 by the Suomi Synod offers testimony that a half-century later, certain segments of the ethnic community remained concerned about their place in the nation's racial formation. And most recently, Alex Ross's 2007 article "Apparition in the Woods" reflects the persistence of the view that Finns are somehow racially different, though what it means in the twenty-first century for both people of Finnish ancestry and others is by no means clear.

T1  - How General Is Trust in "Most People"? Solving the Radius of Trust Problem
AN  - 1266145391; 201300279
AB  - Generalized trust has become a paramount topic throughout the social sciences, in its own right and as the key civic component of social capital. To date, cross-national research relies on the standard question: "Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?" Yet the radius problem -- that is, how wide a circle of others respondents imagine as "most people" -- makes comparisons between individuals and countries problematic. Until now, much about the radius problem has been speculation, but data for 51 countries from the latest World Values Survey make it possible to estimate how wide the trust radius actually is. We do this by relating responses to the standard trust question to a new battery of items that measures in-group and out-group trust. In 41 out of 51 countries, "most people" in the standard question predominantly connotes out-groups. To this extent, it is a valid measure of general trust in others. Nevertheless, the radius of "most people" varies considerably across countries; it is substantially narrower in Confucian countries and wider in wealthy countries. Some country rankings on trust thus change dramatically when the standard question is replaced by a radius-adjusted trust score. In cross-country regressions, the radius of trust matters for civic attitudes and behaviors because the assumed civic nature of trust depends on a wide radius. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - White Attitudes toward Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action
AN  - 907928632; 201125317
AB  - White attitudes toward equal opportunity and affirmative action are explored through semi-structured interviews with 246 middle and working class respondents from three areas of the USA. Both working and middle class interviewees espouse a consistent and coherent view: that opportunity is widespread for anyone willing to take advantage of it, that facing adverse conditions or obstacles is not a sufficient excuse for lack of success, and that government help in the form of affirmative action gives women and/or minorities unfair advantage over men and/or whites. In the responses, however, we also find that whites apply standards to others about being the 'best person for the job' that they do not apply to themselves in their own career histories. Using the interviews with these respondents, we explore the implications of this inconsistency in how whites apply normative standards about what constitutes merit and fairness. This research helps elucidate the meaning of previous research on white racial attitudes. [Reprinted by permission; copyright Sage Publications Inc.]

T1  - New majorities' abuse of power: Effects of perceived control and social support
AN  - 919903929; 201201487
AB  - Two studies examined how new majorities (minorities-turned-majorities) abused power by claiming privileges (in-group favoritism) and disparaging new minorities (out-group hostility). Study 1 found that new majorities low in perceived control showed significantly more in-group favoritism than new majorities high in perceived control and stable majorities. The effect of control on new majorities' in-group favoritism was mediated by certainty about status stability. Study 2 replicated the effect of control on new majorities' in-group favoritism. In addition, Study 2 found that new majorities were most likely to engage in out-group hostility when they were low in perceived control and received social support for such discrimination. Our studies suggest that power abuse is most egregious among minorities who rise to majority status without a sense of control in the context where abuse is socially endorsed.

T1  - The Yellow Press: Asian American Radicalism and Conflict in Gidra
AN  - 907925527; 201124722
AB  - This article analyzes the highly politicized Asian American newspaper Gidra as a way of expanding our conception of ethnic media beyond mainstream publications to include radical ethnic media. In contrast to the notion that ethnic communities might shy from exposing the internal conflicts that jeopardize their own community's stability, Gidra demonstrates three different kinds of conflict: external conflict, internal conflict, and conflict that is produced by the paper itself. Through this exploration, the different ways that Asian American identities were created and discussed during the late 1960s and early 1970s are also assessed, as the radical contingent of the Asian American Movement used print publications to redefine what it meant to be Asian in America.

T1  - Differentially dangerous? Phenotypic racial stereotypicality increases implicit bias among ingroup and outgroup members: GPIR
AN  - 1910239686
AB  - This article investigates whether within-group differences in perceived phenotypic racial stereotypicality can exacerbate implicit racial stereotyping for Blacks among both ingroup and outgroup members. Two studies with non-Black (Study 1) and Black (Study 2) participants confirmed that high stereotypical (HS) Black targets (i.e., those with darker skin, broader noses and fuller lips) elicited stronger implicit bias in split-second "shoot/don't shoot" situations than low stereotypical (LS) Black targets or White targets. Specifically, a lower shooting criterion was adopted for HS Black targets, indicating a greater willingness to shoot HS Black targets, resulting in more pronounced bias. Results suggest that the perceived phenotypic racial stereotypicality of Black targets can increase the accessibility of stereotypes linking Blacks with danger, which intensifies racial bias. Further, the article provides the first empirical evidence that stereotypicality biases operate at implicit levels among Blacks when evaluating ingroup members. The implications for stereotypicality research and policing are discussed.

T1  - Making Bengali Brick Lane: claiming and contesting space in East London
AN  - 914767210; 201200131
AB  - Based on a recent empirical project on 'the Bengal diaspora', the paper explores the construction and contestation of meanings around the iconic East London street, Brick Lane. Taking the 2006 protests around the film Brick Lane as its starting point, the paper draws on original interviews conducted in 2008 with a range of Bengali community representatives, to examine the narratives of space, community and belonging that emerge around the idea of Brick Lane as the 'cultural heartland' of the British Bangladeshi community By exploring the representation, production and contestation of 'social space' through everyday practices, the paper engages with and contests the representation of minority ethnic 'communities' in the context of contemporary multicultural London and examines the process of 'claiming' and 'making' space in East London. In so doing, the paper contributes to a critical tradition that challenges essentialising and pathologizing accounts of ethnic communities and racialized spaces, or that places them outside of broader social and historical processes -- redolent, for example, in contemporary discussions about 'parallel lives' or 'the clash of civilizations'. By contrast, this paper views social space as made through movement and narration, with a particular emphasis on the social agency of local Bengali inhabitants and the multiple meanings that emerge from within this 'imagined community'. However, rather than simply stressing the unfinished and processual nature of spatial meanings, the paper insists on the historical, embodied and affective dimensions of such meaning making, and a reckoning with the broader social and political landscape within which such meanings take shape. The focus on Brick Lane provides an empirically rich, geographically and historically located lens through which to explore the complex role of ethnicity as a marker of social space and of spatial practices of resistance and identity. By exploring Bengali Brick Lane through its narratives of past, present and future, these stories attest to the symbolic and emotional importance of such spaces, and to their complex imaginings.

T1  - Children's Responses to Group-Based Inequalities: Perpetuation and Rectification
AN  - 1347784686; 201318853
AB  - The current studies investigate whether, and under what conditions, children engage in system-perpetuating and system-attenuating behaviors when allocating resources to different social groups. In three studies, we presented young children with evidence of social group inequalities and assessed whether they chose to perpetuate or rectify these inequalities. Children (aged 3.5-11.5 years) heard about two social groups (i.e., racial or novel groups) whose members received resources unequally (two cookies versus one). Participants were then given the opportunity to distribute additional resources to new members of the same groups. In Experiment 1, when children were presented with inequalities involving groups of Blacks and Whites, older children (aged 7.5-11.5 years) rejected the status quo, providing more resources to members of groups with fewer resources (White or Black), whereas younger children (aged 3.5-7.5 years) perpetuated the status quo. In Experiments 2 and 3, the inequalities involved Asians and Whites and novel groups. Children of all ages perpetuated inequality, with rectification strategies applied only by older children and only when Black targets were involved in the inequality. Equal sharing occasionally occurred in older children but was never a common response. These findings provide evidence that system-perpetuating tendencies may be predominant in children and suggest that socialization may be necessary to counter them. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Group heterogeneity and social validation of everyday knowledge: The mediating role of perceived group participation
AN  - 1910227169
AB  - Studies presented in this article show that participants attribute greater validity to opinions supported by heterogeneous groups than by homogeneous ones, that this effect occurs whether participants anticipate group belonging or not and that the relationship between heterogeneity and the attribution of validity to opinions is mediated by the perception of participation within heterogeneous groups. More specifically, an experimental scenario was tested in a pilot study (N = 299): group heterogeneity was manipulated and perceived group participation as well as perceived validity of group opinions was measured. Results show the expected effect of heterogeneity on the validation of opinions and also a mediating effect of perceived participation. The main study (N = 336) shows that the effect of heterogeneity occurs not only when participants are mere observers of groups but also when they anticipate group belonging. Furthermore, this study shows that whereas the effect of group heterogeneity was mediated by perceived participation, the effect of group belonging on perceived validity of group opinions was mediated by trust.

T1  - The Immigration of Slovene Populations from the Present Territory of the Republic of Slovenia to Pula until 1918
AN  - 902083439; 201122311
AB  - The article deals with problems of Slovene populations who immigrated from the present territory of the Republic of Slovenia to Pula during the period from the time of the first immigrations in the 17th century until 1918, when Austria-Hungary ceased to exist. Frequent migrations and immigrations have marked the history of both Istria and Pula and resulted in an ethnically uneven region, whereby immigrants from the present Slovene territory have played an important role. The article portrays the continuous immigration of Slovene populations from the 17th century until the beginnings of the 20th century and the integration of the newcomers into the preexisting society. It also records the reasons for immigration and describes the self-organization and activities of Slovene cultural clubs in Pula. It shows that those processes were not solely tied to the immigrants from the present territory of the Republic of Slovenia but were also characteristic of the inhabitants of other parts of central Europe and that some of them have survived into our own times.

T1  - The Croatian Political Community in Institutional Engineering
AN  - 902083435; 201122210
AB  - The article presents the concept of the Croatian nation as established on the institutional level, at two stages: in the 1990s and in the past decade. Operating with the dominant classifications describing the character of contemporary nations (as defined in the framework of legal norms and practical policies), the paper finds two distinctive typological samples. Whilst the first phase consistently works with the logic of ethnicity and descent-based values, the second stage reveals some novel developments occurring within a still-preserved, ethnically defined framework. Adjustments are taking place in the environment of the altered political climate, yet at the same time in relation to rather simplified political needs and daily pragmatics. As such, the new ethics challenge some of the established values; they do so, however, in a quite inconsistent and unclear manner. While the analysis demonstrates an amount of discontinuity in the way that political institutions operate with the founding notions of national community these changes work against the logic of popular typological patterns. As the paper concludes, the matters investigated here point also to some limitations of the available classifications, but even more noticeably to the peculiarities of the case in question.

T1  - From Minority to Mainstream Politics: The Case of Mauritian Muslims
AN  - 862595995; 201109663
AB  - The slow development of political consciousness among the Mauritian Muslims who immigrated mostly as indentured labourers and rose to small land-owning class in late 19th Century was articulated upon the socio-religious idioms of "Jamaats" and "Ummo". Re-islamisation became the cornerstone for a rise on the socio-economic scale as well as for personal and cultural emancipation. It also marked a separate identity for Muslims, distinct from the Hindu "Jahaji bhais" who had shared with them the legacy of indentured labour on the plantations. Since the 1950s the Muslims realised their minority position in the country (17% of the population), and the political options opened to them: team up with the Hindu majority (50% of the population) or build alliances with other minorities to form a counter power and oppose Hindu "hegemony". Either choice made it necessary to build a strong ethnic identity so as to negotiate in strength with those who wielded power. In fact, the political system adopted in Mauritius after the second World War is Westminster style majoritarian system mitigated by elements favouring power-sharing democracy. Over the years it exacerbated ethnic, racial and cultural differences among the various groups in the Mauritian population. My observation is that although the local political system has brought political stability it has not necessarily increased democracy in the island-state. Leaning on theories of consensus democracy for multi-ethnic societies developed by Lijphart and discussed by other authors' I demonstrate that the power-sharing among elites, in effect, tends to reinforce majoritarian domination by an alliance of a few ethnic groups in the Mauritian context.

T1  - Race, Risk, and Pathology in Psychiatric Culture: Disease Awareness Campaigns as Governmental Rhetoric
AN  - 818800966; 201072672
AB  - In 2006, the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the National Urban League, along with five other organizations, introduced the Depression is Real Campaign, a disease-awareness campaign targeting racial minorities. I trace the ways in which the Depression is Real Campaign frames the expansion of the depression diagnosis and pharmaceutical consumption as shared goals for racial justice advocacy groups and pharmaceutical corporations, focusing on the campaign's attempts to target African Americans. Although the campaign is framed as an antistigma, prorecovery intervention in the name of racial empowerment, it articulates racial and cultural differences as 'risks' in the context of illness that must be eradicated through individual initiatives via the agency of medical science. Highly visible appeals to race are ultimately neutralized in the campaign's affirmation of a mobile neoliberal subjectivity unencumbered by the 'weight' of racial history, structural inequality, or collective identification.

T1  - System-perpetuating asymmetries between explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes among indigenous and non-indigenous Chileans
AN  - 758124405; 201056774
AB  - The present research demonstrates a dissociation between explicit and implicit intergroup evaluation in the reciprocal attitudes between indigenous (Mapuche) and non-indigenous Chileans. In both social groups, the explicit measures of attitudes towards the respective in-group and out-group were compared with the Implicit Association Test scores. The results indicate that the members of the low-status minority might explicitly express a moderate evaluative preference for their in-group but might implicitly devalue it. Conversely, the members of the high-status majority might implicitly devalue their out-group but might explicitly express no bias. These results are theoretically framed in terms of system justification, conventional stereotypes and motivated correction processes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Does the correlation between self and ingroup/outgroup depend on group favorability?: GPIR
AN  - 1928217218
AB  - There is considerable evidence that predictions about others' behavior are anchored to comparable judgments about the self. There is also strong evidence that while self-judgments predict ingroup members' behavior more strongly than outgroup members, the correlation between self and group remains positive for both ingroups and outgroups (Robbins & Krueger, 2005). The present study examined two related questions. First, could the differences in correlation between self and ingroup versus outgroup be attributed to differences in group favorability? Second, would a negative correlation between self and outgroup be found for intensely disliked outgroups? Using an idiographic design that assessed self--group correlations for ingroups and outgroups ranging in favorability from highly disliked to highly liked, we found: (1) group favorability did not explain ingroup--outgroup differences; and (2) there was no evidence for a negative correlation between self and outgroups, even highly disliked outgroups. Discrepancies with earlier research are discussed.

T1  - Inter-ethnic relations in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia
AN  - 754046068; 201053306
AB  - The article deals with the development of minority policies in Mongolia since independence from China, and focuses on the effects that these policies have had on inter-ethnic relations. The main groups studied are the Khalkha Mongols, the Kazakhs, the Tuvans and the Han Chinese. The definitions of these groups as either undesten or yastan have also varied over time, which has created theoretically interesting complexities. The article contains a sociolinguistic study of the inter-ethnic relations, with particular emphasis on education, culture, media and publishing. Furthermore, the tendency of the Tuvans to identify ethnically with the Mongols rather than with the Kazakhs is analyzed from the point of view of a sub-minority-majority identification theory. In Inner Mongolia, the inter-ethnic relations are problematic, and there are also severe tensions between the Mongols of Inner Mongolia and those of Mongolia. These ethnic policies have also played an important role in the development of the inter-state relations between Mongolia and the People's Republic of China. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Appalachian Identity And Policy Opinions
AN  - 964197335; 201207411
AB  - Many of the people who live in Appalachia do not identify with the region. In this paper, we use a unique survey instrument to investigate the types of people who are more likely to identify with Appalachia as well as the consequences of this identification for policy opinions. Our findings show that Appalachian identifiers are older, tend to have spent a larger percentage of their life in the region, and are more highly educated than non-identifiers. We also demonstrate that Appalachian identity is strongly related to opinions on growth and development policies. These findings should be of interest to students of Appalachian culture and politics as well as those interested in regional identity more generally. In a February 13, 2009 FOX News program, conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly blasted the "culture of poverty" and "culture of ignorance" in Appalachia. He complained that Appalachian culture "harms the children almost beyond repair" and argued that the "parents are screwed up. . .kids get married at 16 and 17. . .their parents are drunks. . .there is a lot of meth. . .there is a lot of irresponsibility." This rant is yet another example of the ways in which popular culture stereotypes the people of Appalachia. Fortunately, the scholarly community has provided a number of thoughtful challenges to these negative stereotypes. As an example, the edited volume, Back Talk From Appalachia: Confronting Stereotypes, showcases the work of academics, activists, writers, and storytellers as they demonstrate the rich cultural heritage of the region (Billings, Norman, and Ledford 1999). Missing from the literature, however, is a large-scale effort to investigate Appalachian identity. Given the overwhelmingly negative portrayals of Appalachia in popular culture, it makes sense that some Appalachians may shun their Appalachian identity while others view themselves as part of an important and oft-maligned in-group. In addition, there is very little known about whether migrants to the region identify with Appalachia. It is also likely that the choice of whether to identify with Appalachia will structure broader world views and policy opinions. In this study, we investigate who is more likely to identify with Appalachia as well as the policy consequences of Appalachian regional identity. Adapted from the source document.
