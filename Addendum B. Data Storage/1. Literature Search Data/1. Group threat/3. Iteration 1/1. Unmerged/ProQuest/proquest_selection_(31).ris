T1  - Does State Tightness-Looseness Predict Behavior and Attitudes Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the USA?
AN  - 2662429404
AB  - We investigated how tightness-looseness, reflecting strictness of social norms, of state of residence in the USA predicts behaviors and attitudes related to COVID-19. Because individual-level tightness may better capture current attitudes during the pandemic, whereas state-level archival measures reflect historical factors, we assessed the extent to which tightness-looseness at both levels predicted adherence to public health guidelines and biases toward outgroups related to COVID-19. In Spring 2020, 544 mTurk participants, primarily from the 13 tightest and 13 loosest states, completed survey questions about health behaviors in response to COVID-19, endorsement of future policy changes, feeling of responsibility for lives, and attitudes toward groups marginalized during the pandemic (i.e., Asians, older adults). State-level results indicated some associations with attitudes toward Asians and older adults, but effects were not robust. Results based on individuals’ ratings of the tightness of their state indicated that higher levels of perceived tightness were associated with higher levels of protective self-reported public health behaviors (e.g., mask wearing, handwashing) during COVID-19, more endorsement of future policy changes to contain the pandemic, higher reported feelings of responsibility for one’s life, and stronger negative attitudes toward Asians. The relations between tightness and health outcomes persisted after controlling for political attitudes and demographics. Thus, individual, more than state, tightness-looseness accounted for some degree of public health behaviors (unique contribution of individual tightness: R2 = .034) and attitudes toward marginalized groups (R2 = .020) early during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications of these findings for interventions to support behavior change or combat anti-Asian bias are discussed.

T1  - Welcome to Be Like Us: Expectations of Outgroup Assimilation Shape Dominant Group Resistance to Diversity
AN  - 2623665533
AB  - We propose a theoretical framework for when and why members of dominant groups experience threat and express intolerant attitudes in response to social change. Scholarship on symbolic threat suggests that the detection of intergroup differences in values and norms is sufficient to elicit negative intergroup attitudes. Building on this theory, we argue that the experience of threat is actually shaped by prospective beliefs about difference (i.e., expectations of whether outgroups will assimilate to ingroup norms over time or not). Across two studies and two accompanying pilots, we show how outgroup assimilation expectation shapes dominant groups’ experiences of threat, specifically as it relates to their ability to define the norms of their superordinate category (prototypicality threat). We observe that members of dominant groups are surprisingly tolerant of both social change and intergroup difference in the present, so long as they expect outgroup assimilation in the future.

T1  - Transformation of National Identity, Geo-politics and Nation Building in Post-colonial African States: The Cases of Cameroon and Senegal
AN  - 2582979407
AB  - This article examines the evolving nature of national identity and its significance to geo-politics and nation-building in post-colonial African states, specifically Cameroon and Senegal. Within the current global context, previous theories and scholars failed to explain how recent changes in national identity inform the choice of geo-politics in post-colonial Cameroon and Senegal. It is against this backdrop that this article examines the extent to which changes in elite and public perception on national identity transcended national borders and spilled over to the geo-political landscape. The paper relied on a mixed-method research design that combines elements of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The mixed-method approach is anchored on comparative case study techniques. The data were largely drawn from both primary and secondary sources; the primary sources included semi-structured interviews, and public statements, while the secondary sources comprised educational curriculums, Afrobarometer, World Bank data and the Swiss Economic Globalization Index. The outcome of the analysis showed that in recent years changes in national identity have transcended national borders and spilled over to the geo-political landscape. Findings revealed the extent to which the underlying features of national identity have been indigenized, Africanized and globalized to symbolize what it means to be a Cameroonian and Senegalese Citizen. Comparatively, it was established that Senegal has assumed a more dynamic image and position in geo-politics than Cameroon. Nonetheless, Cameroon’s and Senegal’s recent dynamic and versatile image accounts for the new type of national identity theorized in this paper as a form of strategic identity. The paper also highlighted the challenges and significance of strategic identity to issues of growth, nation and peace-building.

T1  - Roma undercount and the issue of undeclared ethnicity in the 2011 Romanian census
AN  - 2597935854
AB  - Romania is home to the largest Roma population in Europe. Exactly how large is a matter of intense debate, with estimates ranging between .62 and 1.85 million. The last Romanian census made the ethnic affiliation question unequivocally optional and it counted 1.24 million citizens with undeclared ethnicity, a huge increase from the 1941 cases recorded by the previous census round. Since the Roma are the only ethnic group expected to avoid disclosing ethnic affiliation, previous analyses of this idiosyncratic result attributed it exclusively to Roma discrimination led reticence. The current article corrects this view by analyzing the important role played by a previously ignored methodological change (i.e. recording as ‘undeclared’ the temporary absent citizens for whom their neighbors could not provide any information about ethnic affiliation) and revealing that lack of information about neighbors played a dominant role in urban municipalities.

T1  - The psychology of justice buildings: A survey experiment on police architecture, public sentiment, and race
AN  - 2509311821
AB  - Empirical investigations examining how the architectural design of justice buildings impacts the public is scant and heavily skewed toward the design of penal institutions. Applying theories of hostile and welcoming building design, this study uses a survey experiment to investigate the impact that welcoming and hostile police station designs have on public affect and behaviorally relevant perceptions. Findings reveal main and interactive effects of architectural design on positive affect. Specifically, building design becomes a significant predictor of perceptions depending on an individual's self-identified racial or ethnic group, where Black and Latino respondents report greater positive emotional responses when presented with hostile as compared to welcoming building designs. However, there was no impact of building design on negative affect or behaviorally relevant perceptions to report crime. The results of this study have potential implications for impacting public perceptions about policing and improving service delivery experiences.

T1  - Intergroup Dialogues in the Landscape of Digital Societies: How Does the Dialogical Self Affect Intercultural Relations in Online Contexts?
AN  - 2576497584
AB  - The effects of intergroup dialogues on intercultural relations in digital societies and the growing conflict, inflammatory and hate speech phenomena characterizing these environments are receiving increasing attention in socio-psychological studies. Based on Allport’s contact theory, scholars have shown that online intercultural contact reduces ethnic prejudice and discrimination, although it is not yet clear when and how this occurs. By analyzing the role of the Dialogical Self in online intercultural dialogues, we aim to understand how individuals position themselves and others at three levels of inclusiveness—personal, social, and human—and how this process is associated with attitudes towards the interlocutor, intergroup bias and prejudice, whilst also considering the inclusion of the Other in the Self and ethnic/racial identity. An experimental procedure was administered via the Qualtrics platform, and data were collected among 118 undergraduate Italian students through an anonymous questionnaire. From ANOVA and moderation analysis, it emerged that the social level of inclusiveness was positively associated with ethnic/racial identity and intergroup bias. Furthermore, the human level of inclusiveness was associated with the inclusion of the Other in the Self and ethnic/racial identity, and unexpectedly, also with intergroup bias. We conclude that when people interact online as “human beings”, the positive effect of online dialogue fails, hindering the differentiation processes necessary to define one’s own and the interlocutor’s identities. We discuss the effects of intercultural dialogue in the landscape of digital societies and the relevance of our findings for theory, research and practice.

T1  - “You wouldn’t celebrate September 11”: Testing online polarisation between opposing ideological camps on YouTube: GPIR
AN  - 2447807627
AB  - Online communication is increasingly associated with growing polarisation in society. In this research, we test a dual-pathway model of online polarisation via intergroup and intragroup interaction of supporters of opposing ideological camps on YouTube. The interaction occurs over a video parody promoting a campaign to change the date of Australia Day celebrations, a divisive issue entailing contrasting narratives about Australian identity, meanings of Australia Day, and interpretations of colonial history. To capture ideological polarisation, we conducted computerised linguistic analysis of polarised talk in the form of comments and replies (N = 1,027) from supporters and opponents of the campaign. The indicators used to capture polarisation are social identification, position certainty, and psychological distance (as reflected by increased anxiety and hostility). Our results show that most polarisation (in the form of increased hostility) occurs in conditions of expression of outgroup dissent (the intergroup interaction pathway) and the most debated content on the online forum revolves around themes relevant to group identity. In addition to contributing to the understanding of group process in an online context, another key contribution of this research is providing a theory-driven method and blueprint to detect polarisation in social media data.

T1  - The impact of the financial crisis on European attitudes toward immigration
AN  - 2430230498
AB  - This paper studies changes in attitudes toward immigration over a 10-year period, with an examination of the long-term effects of economic downturn.The focus is on changes before and after the financial crisis. I use data from the European Social Survey (2002–2014), combined with economic indicators at the country level. This intends to observe links between economic performance and attitudes with a comparative analysis of data from 25 European countries. Overall, European public appear to become less positive toward immigration during economic crisis, although there are notable variations among the countries. The results show more pessimistic attitudes toward the immigrations’ contribution to the economy, especially in countries where the crisis had the most severe economic impact. Overall, the findings suggest that a downward economic spiral correlates with more negative attitudes towards immigration.

T1  - From uncertain boundaries to uncertain identity: Effects of entitativity threat on identity–uncertainty and emigration
AN  - 2303011449
AB  - When people feel uncertain about their national identity, they may want to emigrate from their nation. This uncertainty can arise when people are exposed to an alternative historical narrative about their own national (ingroup) origins promoted by a neighboring nation (outgroup). Drawing on uncertainty–identity theory we propose that the conditions that promote this process would include when: (a) a revised history threatens the entitativity of national identity, (b) people identify strongly with their nation, (c) a neighboring nation is numerically large enough to transform its own view into a new shared reality, and (d) a new interpretation of history is considered credible. We conducted an experiment in the context of historical disputes between China (outgroup) and Korea (ingroup) (N = 160). We measured Korean identification and manipulated a type of identity threat (valence threat vs. entitativity threat), relative group size (not salient vs. salient), and source credibility (low vs. high). Then, we measured identity–uncertainty and emigration as dependent variables. As predicted, hierarchical regression analyses yielded a significant four‐way interaction on identity–uncertainty. Simple slopes analyses revealed that entitativity (vs. valence) threat significantly increased identity–uncertainty among high identifiers when the outgroup's relative size was salient and its view was credible. Further, the elevated identity–uncertainty strengthened intentions to emigrate from the ingroup. Implications for intergroup communications and identity validation are discussed.

T1  - Existence in Black and White: Theatrical Representation of the Varieties of Racism in Amiri Baraka’s Select Plays
AN  - 2234286265
AB  - Racial stereotyping implies a form of racist thought which finds its justification in certain biological and phenotypical characteristics. Insults and slurs are indexical of the racism embedded in the characters’ interactions. Various insinuations and expressions are loaded with racist import. Plays such as Dutchman and The Slave show how racial stereotyping in Baraka’s plays undercuts images of the sambo and the brute, and concentrates on the utmost obvious physical characteristics and skin color. Racism and racialism are both components of the racial attitudes of Baraka’s characters. Racism assumes that members of each race possess qualities specific to that race, so as to distinguish it as superior or inferior to another race. Racism draws a detailed map of differences in terms of physical, moral, and mental properties. In Baraka’s drama, racism has two main forms: one is propositional and the other is dispositional. Propositional (extrinsic) racism conveys fierce racist behavior. Dispositional (intrinsic) racism is the expression of loyalty to the ethnic group and belonging to the community. Propositional racism supposes the salience of the racial character and essence. The belief in a racial essence steers toward racial differentiation, and fosters expansive racialization and classification. The objective of this article is to address the construct of propositional racism and delineate its manifestations. It will also tackle the concept of dispositional racism, and highlight how dispositional racism is connected to principles germane to morality and relevant to community.

T1  - Whose Side Are You On? Asian Americans’ Mistrust of Asian–White Biracials Predicts More Exclusion From the Ingroup
AN  - 2220161498
AB  - We investigated Asian Americans’ perceptions of Asian–White biracials. Because the Asian/White boundary may be more permeable than other minority/White boundaries, we reasoned that Asian Americans are more likely than Black Americans to be skeptical of biracials, perceiving that biracials would prefer to identify as White and would be disloyal to Asians, consequently categorizing them as more outgroup. We further reasoned that Asian Americans’ concerns about and exclusion of biracials would be predicted by greater perceived discrimination against Asian Americans, which increases the incentive for biracials to pass into the higher status racial group. Studies 1 and 2 provided correlational support for these theorized relationships among Asian Americans. Study 2 showed that perceived discrimination did not increase Black Americans’ concerns about biracials’ identity preferences and loyalty. Studies 3 and 4 provided causal evidence for the roles of perceived discrimination and biracial identity preferences, respectively, in Asian Americans’ exclusion of biracials.

T1  - Ethnic solidarity and the vote: Mapuche candidates and voters in Chile
AN  - 2071272714
AB  - In this article, we evaluate ethnic solidarity and the vote in Chile with reference to the Mapuche, the largest and most traditional ethnic group in the country. We use electoral data from the mayoral elections of 2012, drawn from all the municipalities of the Araucanía, the region with the largest percentage of Mapuche population. Using a multi-level linear regression model and controlling for poverty and rurality, we found that Mapuche candidates, regardless of their political orientation, were indeed more successful than non-Mapuche candidates in areas with the greatest concentration of Mapuche voters. Additionally, we used results from an unpublished opinion survey conducted in three municipalities of the Araucanía. We concluded that after controlling for other variables ethnic solidarity prevails as a robust predictor of electoral behaviour, albeit more strongly in rural areas than urban ones. The Chilean case, moreover, is useful for studying the strategies used by the traditional parties that promote this solidarity - that is, by presenting candidates with Mapuche surnames in their lists.

T1  - The role of retributive justice and the use of international criminal tribunals in post‐conflict reconciliation
AN  - 2011520592
AB  - Four experiments examined people's responses to intergroup violence either committed or suffered by their own group. Experiment 1 demonstrated that Serbs who strongly glorified Serbia were more supportive of future violence against, and less willing to reconcile with, Bosniaks after reading about Serbian victimization by Bosniaks rather than Serbian transgressions against Bosniaks. Replicating these effects with Americans in the context of American–Iranian tensions, Experiment 2 further showed that demands for retributive justice explained why high glorifiers showed asymmetrical reactions to ingroup victimization vs. perpetration. Again in the Serb and the American context, respectively, Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that post‐conflict international criminal tribunals can help satisfy victim group members' desire for retributive justice, and thereby reduce their support for future violence and increase their willingness to reconcile with the perpetrator group. The role of retributive justice and the use of international criminal justice in intergroup conflict (reduction) are discussed.

T1  - RACE, CRIMINAL INJUSTICE FRAMES, AND THE LEGITIMATION OF CARCERAL INEQUALITY AS A SOCIAL PROBLEM
AN  - 2027577030
AB  - Michelle Alexander argues that carceral inequality and mass incarceration together have created a "new racial caste system" in America (2010, p. 11). She contends that only a race-conscious social movement that engages both legal actors and the public can dismantle this system of racial control. Unfortunately, very little research has examined views about carceral inequality. Little is known about the attitudes of juvenile and criminal justice workers. We build on and integrate three literatures--scholarship on the framing perspective, comparative conflict theory, and group position theory and racial ideology--to develop a theoretical model of attitudes toward carceral inequality. We hypothesize that race influences the resonance of attributional frames, especially criminal injustice frames, but endorsement of these frames represents the primary factor shaping judgments about whether carceral inequality is a social problem (propriety, urgency, severity and policy frames). For several decades, framing efforts have been underway aimed at mobilizing JCJW to reduce racial disparities in the juvenile justice system. And most offenders first have contact with the state as juveniles. Accordingly, to test our theory, we analyze data on views about carceral inequality in the juvenile justice system--or disproportionate minority contact--among a nationwide sample of justice workers (N = 543). The findings show that race is strongly associated with attributional frames about carceral inequality, and is indirectly related, through attributional frames, to endorsement of propriety, urgency, severity, and policy frames about carceral inequality.

T1  - The Interaction of Same-Sex Marriage Access With Sexual Minority Identity on Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing
AN  - 1875136739
AB  - Previous psychological and public health research has highlighted the impact of legal recognition of same-sex relationships on individual identity and mental health. Using a sample of U.S. sexual minority (N = 313) and heterosexual (N = 214) adults, participants completed a battery of mental health inventories prior to the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) examining identity revealed sexual minority participants living in states where same-sex marriage was banned experienced significantly higher levels of internalized homonegativity than sexual minority participants living in states where same-sex marriage was legal, even after controlling for state-level political climate. Mental health ANCOVAs revealed sexual minority participants residing in states without same-sex marriage experienced greater anxiety and lower subjective wellbeing compared to sexual minority participants residing in states with same-sex marriage and heterosexual participants residing in states with or without same-sex marriage. Implications for public policy and future research directions are discussed.

T1  - Introduction
AN  - 1855722260
AB  - The goal of this special issue is to explore the range of religious cultures among diverse ethnic groups of Southwest China, particularly the factors that have helped shape their development. In researching this topic, the papers below have focused on a number of key questions, including: (1) The interplay between state and society, including the roles of local elites; (2) The ways in which organized religions such as Buddhism, Daoism, and Christianity have interacted with indigenous ritual traditions; (3) The importance of gender and gender roles; (4) Spatial commonalities and differences throughout the region. Despite the great diversity of beliefs and practices examined below, all authors have treated religion as a key arena for mutual borrowing and accommodation that has enabled indigenous people to maintain elements of their ritual traditions despite the presence of external hegemonic cultures.

T1  - The making of tribes: The Chang and Chakhesang Nagas in India's Northeast
AN  - 1873923375
AB  - Highlighting 'pre', 'trans' and 'new' tribal formations amongst upland Nagas in India's Northeast, this article formulates both a historical critique against dominant categorisations of the region's social landscape and posits alternative ways of 'seeing' local patterns of kinship, identity and belonging. Drawing on ethno-historical perspectives from the Chang and Chakhesang Nagas, I illustrate the problematic cultural transitivity of the idea and idiom of 'tribe' which conceals the social formations that existed--and occasionally persist--before, beneath, betwixt and between categories of 'tribe'. This realisation brings us to a dilemma which, I think, ought to be at the heart of the anthropology of Nagas and of India's Northeast more widely--namely, how to account for the ethnographic observation that social organisation--both past and present--is based on interpersonal, village and clan networks which cut across tribal and ethnic groups with clearly permeable boundaries and yet most people maintain a view of the whole society as made up of partitioned, culturally coherent and historically immutable entities.

T1  - Who We Are Is What We Believe? Religion and Collective Identity in Austrian and German Immigrant Integration Policies
AN  - 1908432871
AB  - Immigrant integration is a contested policy field in which boundaries of membership are drawn and re-negotiated whereby groups of immigrants are partially included and excluded. Building on the concept of collective identity and theories of boundary making, this paper illustrates how religion functions as a category to mark and fill notions of self and otherness. As several studies have shown, immigrants in Europe are increasingly addressed as Muslims, a development that also serves the promotion of a Christian 'us'. Focusing on Austria and Germany, two countries where this is especially observable, the paper outlines the functioning of religion as symbolic boundary. The empirical study on national integration policies demonstrates how-within the relational process of boundary drawing against Muslims-a Christian identity narrative is established, how it functions as a marker of unity and how it relates to liberal and secular notions. Results from the qualitative content analysis of governmental policy programs from 2005 onwards show different patterns of boundary drawing on religion and the way they shape and limit the possibilities of inclusion. To understand this development, we have to look at Christian-democratic policy-makers, who currently dominate the political struggle for the power to define features of collective identity in immigrant integration policies.

T1  - Racial bias is associated with ingroup death rate for Blacks and Whites: Insights from Project Implicit
AN  - 1843008660
AB  - Rationale Research suggests that, among Whites, racial bias predicts negative ingroup health outcomes. However, little is known about whether racial bias predicts ingroup health outcomes among minority populations. Objective The aim of the current research was to understand whether racial bias predicts negative ingroup health outcomes for Blacks. Method We compiled racial bias responses from 250,665 Blacks and 1,391,632 Whites to generate county-level estimates of Blacks' and Whites' implicit and explicit biases towards each other. We then examined the degree to which these biases predicted ingroup death rate from circulatory-related diseases. Results In counties where Blacks harbored more implicit bias towards Whites, Blacks died at a higher rate. Additionally, consistent with previous research, in counties where Whites harbored more explicit bias towards Blacks, Whites died at a higher rate. These links between racial bias and ingroup death rate were independent of county-level socio-demographic characteristics, and racial biases from the outgroup in the same county. Conclusion Findings indicate that racial bias is related to negative ingroup health outcomes for both Blacks and Whites, though this relationship is driven by implicit bias for Blacks, and explicit bias for Whites.

T1  - Race, prejudice and attitudes toward redistribution: A comparative experimental approach
AN  - 1827231461
AB  - Past work suggests that support for welfare in the United States is heavily influenced by citizens' racial attitudes. Indeed, the idea that many Americans think of welfare recipients as poor Blacks (and especially as poor Black women) has been a common explanation for Americans' lukewarm support for redistribution. This article draws on a new online survey experiment conducted with national samples in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, designed to extend research on how racialised portrayals of policy beneficiaries affect attitudes toward redistribution. A series of innovative survey vignettes has been designed that experimentally manipulate the ethno-racial background of beneficiaries for various redistributive programmes. The findings provide, for the first time, cross-national, cross-domain and cross-ethno-racial extensions of the American literature on the impact of racial cues on support for redistributive policy. The results also demonstrate that race clearly matters for policy support, although its impact varies by context and by the racial group under consideration.

T1  - Barter Fairs, Ethnic Configuration and National Multiculturalism in the Argentinean Andes
AN  - 1808775966
AB  - In the Argentinean Andes, fairs constitute the main setting where lowland and highland Kolla peasants barter their agricultural production. In order to preserve these encounters - seen as traditional - in a context of peasants' growing participation in capitalist economy, public organizations invest money for boosting old fairs and instituting new ones. The author proposes to qualify these fairs as 'institutional', compared with the 'spontaneous' ones that come along with religious celebrations. Alluding to Bourdieu's concept of institutional rituals, this expression enlightens how such meetings assert social categories, whose boundaries are otherwise blurred. Drawing on an analysis of institutional fairs' social and symbolic performativity, the paper argues that rather than 'safeguarding ancestral customs', as claimed by the organizers, these specific festivals publically state the conditions for the ethnic group at play to be integrated within the nation state.

T1  - Racial Identity Contestation: Mapping and Measuring Racial Boundaries
AN  - 1901158420
AB  - Survey based research typically uses a single measure of racial self-classification to study racial inequality and to make group based comparisons. Race, however, is multidimensional; experienced not only in accord with how one self-identifies, but also in relation to how one is perceived racially by others. For example, an individual can self-identify racially as Black, but be perceived by most others as non-Black. We refer to this experience as racial identity contestation. We briefly review the growing set of literature on related topics, detail the divergent approaches to measuring racial identity contestation with survey data, and compare descriptive estimates of racial identity contestation across methodological approaches. Moreover, we seek to cull others into considering the analytic utility of racial identity contestation for research on racial boundaries. We argue that a focus on racial identity contestation can be leveraged as an analytical tool to better understand the topography of ongoing racial projects by mapping social definitions of who is and is not typically perceived as a member of a particular racial group.

The photographs and stories that followed celebrated the Titans' first state championship and the players who made it happen students from the newly integrated T. C. Williams High School. In one article, local newspaper reporter Mary Warren emphasized the team's success as a symbol of Alexandria's new "togetherness"--the school system's racial integration and the unification of local residents, both black and white, around the winning football team. For those interviewed, an integrated Alexandria was the City's present and future. Here, Moon discusses Alexandria YWCA, race, urban ethnic revival and the Scottish Christmas Walk in 1960s-70s.

T1  - South Tyrol: the importance of boundaries for immigrant integration
AN  - 1792708401
AB  - Using South Tyrol as a case study, this article analyses how boundaries between groups and their institutionalisation through power-sharing arrangements affect the politics of immigrant integration. Through a longitudinal qualitative analysis of party manifestos, the article focuses on the period between 1993 and 2013 to evaluate the immigration and integration discourses of political parties, claiming to represent the German and Ladin minorities. It is argued that these parties have deliberately framed immigration as a challenge to the strength of their respective cultures and languages, as well as the array of institutions that support the separate but equal coexistence of South Tyrol's linguistic groups. The consequence of this tendency to 'think in groups' is that the main political parties of the German and Ladin minorities are shoring up group boundaries and advancing an assimilationist model of immigrant integration.

T1  - Perceived moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination
AN  - 1796451720
AB  - This research investigated judgements of moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination, testing whether a wrongdoer's mental states - awareness and foresight - are central determinants of culpability. Participants read about and judged a target person who was described as consciously egalitarian, but harbouring negative attitudes that lead him to treat African Americans unfairly. Two studies showed that participants ascribed greater moral responsibility for discrimination when the target was aware of having negative attitudes than when he was unaware. Surprisingly, moral judgements were equally harsh towards a target who was explicitly aware that his bias could influence his behaviour as a target who was not. To explain this result, a second study showed that the path from awareness to moral responsibility was mediated by perceptions that the target had an obligation to foresee his discriminatory behaviour, but not by perceptions of the target's actual foresight. These results suggest that bias awareness influences moral judgements of those who engage in attitude-based discrimination because it obligates them to foresee harmful consequences. The current findings demonstrate that moral judges consider not just descriptive facts, but also normative standards regarding a wrongdoer's mental states.

T1  - Room at the top? Minority mobility and the transition to demographic diversity in the USA
AN  - 1765125285
AB  - We examine the ramifications of the demographic transition to diversity in the USA through an analysis of changes at the top of the occupational hierarchy, as glimpsed in recent census data. We find evidence that, among the incumbents of better-paid occupations, the percentage of non-Hispanic whites, the historically dominant majority, is sharply declining, while the proportion of immigrant-origin minorities, Asians, both foreign and US born, and US-born Hispanics, is growing. African Americans, or US-born blacks, are not so far sharing much in this growth. However, whites still retain important advantages in terms of occupational placement net of education and in terms of earnings net of occupational placement. We conclude overall that demographic shifts are highly likely to drive further diversification at the top of the US workforce; the question of whether whites can hold on to their advantages in the face of these changes cannot be answered yet.

T1  - Ethnic belonging of the children born out of rape in postconflict Bosnia-Herzegovina and Rwanda
AN  - 1787949562
AB  - Sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war in ethnic conflicts, and forced impregnations have been central to this strategy. Scholars however disagree on whether the cultural assimilation to the maternal group influences these children's identities, or whether they are perceived as belonging to the enemy group (Carpenter; Nikolic-Ristanovic). Drawing on preliminary qualitative findings collected in 2013 in Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina, this paper analyses the ethnic identification imposed by the enemy group, the mothers and their community on the children born out of rape. It first explores how the mothers' ethnic identities are often subordinated to their fathers' ethnic background, and how this then justifies their social exclusion from their maternal ethnic group. This paper suggests that sexual violence is extremely effective in ensuring the continuation of the ethnic conflict in the aftermath of the violence by attacking the children's senses of belonging.

T1  - Four Language Laws of Ukraine
AN  - 1855326229
AB  - Following the Soviet Union's dissolution, Ukrainian nation building was aided by the system of institutions inherited from the USSR, but made difficult by the Russian community in Ukraine which became a minority overnight. This presence has been felt primarily in Ukrainian-Russian language struggles. Some researchers and specialists have repeatedly pointed out that the question of languages is heavily politicised in Ukraine. The fact that it is not clearly settled can lead to the emergence of language ideologies as well as to conflicts of ethnic groups and languages. It is no coincidence that in Article 6, the Law on National Security regards the settling of the language issue as a priority among the country's national interests. Through the comparative analysis of four linguistic rights documents, this article shows how between 1989 and 2014, the Ukrainian political elite attempted to maintain social equilibrium through introducing legislation aimed to regulate language use.

T1  - The Turning Point of Tolerance: Ethnic Attitudes in a Global Perspective
AN  - 1855321096
AB  - Is diversity associated with ethnic aversion? To address this issue we employ a theoretical perspective to explain global patterns in individual ethnic attitudes. We suggest that there is a turning point of tolerance, and this could be why earlier studies differ in their conclusions. In short, we argue that up until a certain point more intergroup contact will lead to increased tolerance. However, when this threshold is reached, any further diversity will lead to less tolerance. This study applies data from all five waves of the World Values Survey, combined with the updated ethnolinguistical fractionalisation index and relevant controls. Our models reveal a threshold effect in non-Western societies, and that ethnically polarised societies are most tolerant. This finding supports the argument that conflicts taking place along ethnic lines are not caused primarily by ethnic hatred, indicating that ethnicity might be used as an instrument to create violent conflict.

T1  - Language as mechanism of systemic foundation: Tungus-speaking groups in the Far East
AN  - 1784138842
AB  - This article explores S. M. Shirokogoroff's critical approach to the study of language as a part of culture and a means of scientific classifications of mankind into a certain number of linguistic categories. The purpose of this article is to highlight a peculiar but rather underestimated contribution of Shirokogoroff to sociolinguistics, as his ideas were often stranded in critical relation to much that was dominant in social and linguistic thought in the first part of the twentieth century. Three dimensions of his work are mainly the focus of this article: the Ural-Altaic hypothesis, linguistic classifications, and the creation of standard languages in Soviet Russia. Finally, it discusses the applicability of Shirokogoroff's critique to the contemporary Russian nationalities' policy towards indigenous minorities.

T1  - Still a Nation of Immigrants? Effects of Constructions of National History on Attitudes toward Immigrants
AN  - 1750356050
AB  - In the United States, the phrase "nation of immigrants" is used to both promote and restrict immigration. Those who use the phrase to promote immigration point to the similarities between current and previous generations of immigrants, whereas those who use it to restrict immigration emphasize the differences between the two generations. The present study examined the effects of the different versions of this historical narrative (similarity-focused vs. difference-focused) on 210 U.S. residents' attitudes toward immigrants during the recent debate about immigration reform. Exposure to the similarity-focused nation of immigrants reduced perceptions of threat from Mexican immigrants but did not affect the already low level of perceived threat from Russian immigrants. The similarity-focused version of nation of immigrants exerted an indirect effect on perceived threat from both groups by inducing a sense of identity continuity, which reduced collective angst about the future of the people of the United States. The findings suggest that pro-immigration policy makers clearly articulate the meaning of nation of immigrants rather than use it as a cliché as the phrase has the potential to induce inclusive attitudes.

T1  - Immigrants' Sense of Belonging to the Host Country: The Role of Life Satisfaction, Language Proficiency, and Religious Motives
AN  - 1728124275
AB  - This paper focuses on a significant concept in migration studies: immigrants' sense of belonging to the host society. Drawing upon the literature of immigration and subjective well-being, we proposed a model in which life satisfaction is a major predictor of immigrants' sense of belonging, and is explained by background variables including religious affiliation, religious motivation, native language proficiency and ethnic segregation. The study was based on a survey of two groups of highly skilled migrants in Israel; immigrants from France and the Former Soviet Union who moved to Israel in the last two decades. The findings suggest that, as expected, life satisfaction had a significant influence on immigrants' sense of belonging and served as a mediator variable in the model. Whereas ethnic segregation was not found to be a significant parameter in the model, religious motivation and Hebrew language proficiency were found to be prominent. In light of the literature, we also discuss the importance of religious motivations to immigrants' subjective well-being, identity, and sense of belonging.

T1  - [Mis]Placing Race in Biomedical Clinical Context: Racial Categories, Medical Research, and the Reproduction of Health Disparities
AN  - 1735658593; 201536915
AB  - Notions of racial categories as biologically significant remain persistently salient to oppressive hegemonic ideas about race, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Biomedical and epidemiological researchers are both professionally socialized and institutionally mandated to utilize racial categories in their research design, implementation, and interpretation processes, under the premise that doing so can facilitate the development of measures to combat racial disparities in health outcomes and care. However, when aggregate data intended to illustrate racial disparities are inappropriately extrapolated to the individualized context of biomedical clinical practice, essentialist notions of racial difference are reified. This paper integrates interdisciplinary perspectives from the fields of sociology, medicine, public health, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, and biological anthropology to explore the ideological, historical, and structural contexts through which the conflation of racial categories as indicators of group-level inequities in health outcomes and care experiences with essentialized notions of biological differences between racial groups may inform disparate care at the level of individual patient encounter in biomedical clinical practice.

T1  - Toward a New Macro-Segregation? Decomposing Segregation within and between Metropolitan Cities and Suburbs
AN  - 1728662535; 201534160
AB  - This article documents a new macro-segregation, where the locus of racial differentiation resides increasingly in socio-spatial processes at the community or place level. The goal is to broaden the spatial lens for studying segregation, using decennial Census data on 222 metropolitan areas. Unlike previous neighborhood studies of racial change, we decompose metropolitan segregation into its within- and between-place components from 1990 to 2010. This is accomplished with the Theil index (H). Our decomposition of H reveals large post-1990 declines in metropolitan segregation. But, significantly, macro-segregation -- the between-place component -- has increased since 1990, offsetting declines in the within-place component. The macro component of segregation is also most pronounced and increasing most rapidly among blacks, accounting for roughly one-half of all metro segregation in the most segregated metropolitan areas of the United States. Macro-segregation is least evident among Asians, which suggests other members of these communities (i.e., middle-class or affluent ethnoburbs) have less resistance to Asians relocating there. These results on emerging patterns of macro-segregation are confirmed in fixed-effects models that control for unobserved heterogeneity across metropolitan areas. Unlike most previous studies focused on the uneven distribution of racial and ethnic groups across metropolitan neighborhoods, we show that racial residential segregation is increasingly shaped by the cities and suburban communities in which neighborhoods are embedded.

T1  - Exiles in a Foreign Land
AN  - 1698544858
AB  - Despite documentation of intergroup conflict between African Americans and Irish immigrants during the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries, few studies have comparatively considered the beneficence of religion as an adaptive, conciliatory mechanism for the two ethnic groups. Yet, literature supports the historic centrality of the Black Church for the former group and the indelible influence of Catholicism for the latter. This research examines common religious themes and organized efforts associated with these faith traditions for the two historically oppressed groups. Informed by Cultural Theory, this study compares and contrasts religious cultural dynamics to illumine adaptive features and activism. Exilic themes based on nationality, race, and/or ethnicity tied to biblical symbolism; social programs and self-help; as well as appropriation of Liberation Theology are common group patterns. Yet, findings also illustrate the inability of religion to foster substantial intergroup cooperation in light of other prevailing systemic forces.

T1  - Immigrants' Characteristics and the Croatian Labour Market: an Explorative Study
AN  - 1767325662; 201605851
AB  - Labour market outcomes of immigrant populations are interesting from different aspects, both as an academic question but also in terms of policy design. The potential research questions include whether immigrants face adverse prospects on local labour markets, what segment of the market do they fill and whether they contribute positively to the overall economic development of the host country. By relying mostly on the Labour Force Survey for the 1998-2012 period, this paper aims at providing additional insight into the labour market position of immigrants in Croatia. Several indicators of the immigrant population have been compared to those of the domestic population - age, educational attainment, occupational structure and unemployment. The data indicate that immigrants in Croatia do not belong to young and highly-skilled population subgroups - which are characteristics frequently associated with out-migration profiles - but are instead similar to an extent to the host country population. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This paper discusses the position of Romani minorities in the light of the state dissolution and further citizenship regime transformations after the disintegration of the former Socialist Yugoslavia. While observing closely the repositioning of the Romani minorities in the post-Yugoslav space, it explicates that in the case of state dissolution, the unevenness of citizenship does not only manifest in the rights dimension, but also in uneven access to citizenship with regard to new polities.

T1  - U.S. Immigrants in Dispersed and Traditional Settlements: National Origin Heterogeneity
AN  - 1708525278; 201528646
AB  - This paper uses confidential ACS data to compare the characteristics of immigrants from ten Asian and Latino origins and the total foreign born in traditional, emerging, and dispersed areas. The correlates of dispersed settlement were estimated for each group and the total foreign born using multinomial logistic regression. The findings show that the characteristics of immigrants in dispersed settlements differ both within and across national origin groups and also between national groups and the total foreign born. Several relationships, particularly those for education and occupation measures, differ significantly and call into question the homogeneity assumption commonly made by studies of the total foreign born or pan-ethnic groups.

T1  - Ethnic Boundaries in Core Discussion Networks: A Multilevel Social Network Study of Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands
AN  - 1680154361; 201514090
AB  - This study examines ethnic segregation of core discussion networks in the Netherlands. The analysis is based on Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study, a large-scale survey of the Dutch population aged 15-45 that contains an oversample of first- and second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Morocco, the two largest non-western immigrant groups in Holland. Results show that among Turks and Moroccans, more than 75% of the confidants are co-ethnic multilevel logistic models of these ego networks which suggest that ethnic closure in core discussion networks of Turks and Moroccans is stronger among women, foreign-born immigrants, those who live in immigrant concentration areas and those who are culturally more dissimilar to the Dutch to (i.e., who speak Dutch less well, who more strongly participate in Muslim practices and who identify stronger with their ethnic group). Results further suggest that the socio-economic gradient in ethnic boundaries is due to both cultural and economic homophily. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The “leaning song” – a weapon in organizational conflict
AN  - 2154278519
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present an insider ethnographic account of a series of social confrontations between two mutually opposed groups of officers that took place in an officers’ mess in a remote military garrison in the 1980s. The identity of one of these groups was expressed in a particular song that was sung frequently and noisily in the mess. The analysis of these incidents and their precursors provides an understanding of the social processes in which they were embedded, and the conclusions drawn are generalized into the wider context. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on insider ethnography, using rich description to present the incidents and their background. Analysis is conducted using other research by the author on the organizational culture of Service officers and wider scholarship not specifically related to the Military. Findings – The paper finds that in-groups and out-groups in joint Service populations do not necessarily run along traditional, Service, lines, and that cultural change in the groups concerned was associated with the rapid turnover of their members as they were replaced in the normal postings cycle. It demonstrates that a socially powerful shared cultural element can, if only temporarily, bring unity between rival groups. It also contributes to the scholarship on the power of song as a proclamation of group identity and the intensification of that identity. Originality/value – The main strength of this paper is that it provides an insider’s view of a British military social group, which is extremely rare in the literature, describing social processes that connect to the wider scholarship on song, in-group and out-group behaviour, and cultural change.

T1  - Reflexive Ethnicities: Crisis, Diversity and Re-Composition
AN  - 1786264692
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of how people reflexively relate to their ethnicity in the context of cultural and political crisis after the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005. Introducing a differentiated conception of reflexivity following Archer and Lash, the paper shows how cognitive, hermeneutic and aesthetic reflexivity (Lash) are expressed autonomously, communicatively and in a meta-reflexive manner (Archer) variably across and within ethnicities. Differentiated reflexive expressions of ethnicity are rooted in the politics and histories of ethnicities in relation to dominant discourses of whiteness and Britishness. The data is from a qualitative interview study of how different ethnic groups in West Yorkshire were affected by the 7/7 London bombings, with people of African-Caribbean, Black- African, Bangladeshi, Indian Pakistani and White backgrounds. The increased reflexivity of ethnic identity is seen to be rooted in the political crises generated by Britain's role in and response to, the war on terror, but also biographical experiences of contextual continuities, discontinuities and incongruities of migration.

T1  - SKIN COMPLEXION IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY: THE IMPACT OF COLORISM ON AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN
AN  - 1757045044
AB  - Skin completion has impacted the lives, life chances, and life choices of African American women for centuries. Skin complexion partiality has been an entrenched issue in the African American community. The authors investigate colorism and its effects on African American women's life outcomes. This article provides current data on young women's (between the ages of 18-23) perceptions of colorism. This article also examines the correlation between women with high self-esteem (regardless of their skin complexion) and high achievements in measures of social capital. The study was guided by four research questions: 1. Is skin tone a predictive factor for African American women's social outcomes? 2. To what extent do African-American women distinguish between light and dark complexions? 3. Is there a significant relationship between a woman's skin complexion and her self-esteem? 4. Is the issue of colorism still relevant in the twenty first century. Because colorism is further complicated by racism, classism, and sexism, its paradoxical consequences impact African American women's self-esteem, identity, and social capital.

T1  - Why Is There No Income Gap between the Hui Muslim Minority and the Han Majority in Rural Ningxia, China?
AN  - 1667949215; 201509516
AB  - Using a household sample survey for 2006, this article shows that the Hui population in the rural part of Ningxia Autonomous Region in China is disadvantaged compared to the Han majority as regards length of education and household per capita wealth. Yet, there is no gap in average disposable incomes between the two ethnic groups and poverty rates are very similar. This paradox is owing to members of Hui households earning more off-farm income than members of Han households. In particular, young Hui males living in poor villages have a remarkably high likelihood of migrating, thereby bringing back income to their households. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From Taboo to Tourist Industry: The Construction of Interracial Intimacies between Black Men and White Women in Colonial and Contemporary Times
AN  - 1667953068; 201509575
AB  - This literature review examines the role emotions play in the construction and regulation of commercialized heterosexual interracial intimacies between White women and Black men, beginning with the strict regulations of the colonial era, and moving to the development of 'romance tourism' in the contemporary era between Northern White women and Black men in the Caribbean. During colonialism, White men constructed a taboo against sexual relationships between White women and Black men in order to ensure their dominance over women in their own racial group and all 'Other' men. In contemporary times, relationships between White women and Black men have moved from taboo and marginalized to touristic attraction, as more middle class White women from the United States head to the Caribbean (and at times Africa) in search of romance with local men, demonstrating the importance that emotions like desire have in (re)producing globalization.

T1  - Political economy and work values: the case of Jews and Arabs in Israel
AN  - 1667949072; 201509624
AB  - Work values among Jews in Israel have been studied for several decades, while there has been no attempt to study work values among Arabs. This article examines and compares the centrality of work and the preferred work goals among Israeli Jews and Arabs and the effect of demographic factors on work values. In 2006 the Meaning-of-Working (MOW) questionnaire was conducted on a representative sample of the Israeli labour force that included Jews and Arabs. The findings reveal significant differences regarding the importance of work and most of the preferred work goals among Jews and Arabs. Overall, the demographic variables hardly explain the value differences among members of the two ethnic groups. The findings can be explained by cultural, social and economic factors and primarily by the Israeli-Arab/Palestinian conflict. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sub-regional conflicts and selective autonomy in J&K: Hill Councils in power
AN  - 1692287986; 201521454
AB  - The State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is examined here in terms of its unique history, geography and cross-cultural composition. Its three regions are not just historically and culturally distinct but each have sub-regions and religious minorities with their own claims to autonomy and devolved power. The author examines the diversity of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh and assesses, from a personal study tour, the successes and failures of Hill Councils that have been established in Leh and Kargil (Ladakh) and the prospect of creating others in the Jammu region. Sub-regionalism becomes a potent force in the absence of strong regional consciousness, he argues. Regionalism in general is a product of India's diversity; sub-regionalism the result of geographic, historical and socio-economic factors - J&K is a case in point.

This article explores the meanings of and reactions to Arab sounds in Israel - political struggles over muezzins, stereotypical representations of Israeli Palestinians as loud, and so on - in order to offer general insights into the role of the sonic (both actual sounds and their discursive representations) in the new 'cultural' racism, in the everyday ethnicized experience of one's body, and in shaping relations between ethnic and national groups.

T1  - Racial history, legacy and economic development
AN  - 1650148381; 201502156
AB  - For more than a century, white communities across the United States employed strategies to remain all-white, including violent acts, forcibly driving minorities out of town, and racist local ordinances. One particularly widespread and effective approach used by many towns to exclude certain groups of people from living there was the creation of a 'sundown town': towns that purposely signalled to African Americans and other non-white groups that they were not welcome within the city limits after dark. Crowe and Ceresola seek to understand how historical racial policies affect present-day community life and, in particular, one component of community with which many towns currently struggle: economic development. In exploring the effect of cultural legacy on perceptions of race and economic development in five mid-sized communities in central and southern Illinois-two former sundown towns and three without histories of racial exclusion-their study uses interviews, observation and content analysis to examine how historical legacy can carry over to the present and affect economic development. Overall, the findings suggest that the values and beliefs passed down through a community's legacy influences current local economic development. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Disrupting the dream: Undocumented youth reframe citizenship and deportability through anti-deportation activism
AN  - 1738476844; 201538504
AB  - This essay analyzes how undocumented 1.5 generation activists respond to, disrupt and challenge state definitions of citizenship and belonging. The authors look at the work of the Immigrant Youth Justice League (IYJL), an immigrant rights group led by undocumented organizers in Chicago, with a focus on how they frame responses to federal deportation policies and deportations. This activism takes place in the context of a movement led by undocumented 1.5 generation youth whose tactics have included first-person testimony and civil disobedience. This is significant because they place the undocumented body at the forefront of the national dialog on immigration. Through interviews with members of the organization, analysis of first-hand documents and one author's experience as an IYJL co-founder, we find that young undocumented activists increasingly fight for people who do not fit the nation-state's parameters for accessing citizenship or relief from deportation. The state regulates access to citizenship, rights and deportation based on moral and hegemonic frameworks, systematic prejudices and socio-economic conditions. When young undocumented activists challenge these frames, they disrupt the power of the nation-state to make these determinations, and expand the debate about and boundaries of citizenship.

T1  - Can We Measure Immigrants' Legal Status? Lessons from Two U.S. Surveys
AN  - 1660023380; 201505535
AB  - This research note examines response and allocation rates for legal status questions asked in publicly available U.S. surveys to address worries that the legal status of immigrants cannot be reliably measured. Contrary to such notions, we find that immigrants' non-response rates to questions about legal status are typically not higher than non-response rates to other immigration-related questions, such as country of birth and year of immigration. Further exploration of two particular surveys -- the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LAFANS) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) -- reveals that these data sources produce profiles of the unauthorized immigrant population that compare favorably to independently estimated profiles. We also find in the case of the SIPP that the introduction of legal status questions does not appear to have an appreciable 'chilling effect' on the subsequent survey participation of unauthorized immigrant respondents. Based on the results, we conclude that future data collection efforts should include questions about legal status to (1) improve models of immigrant incorporation; and (2) better position assimilation research to inform policy discussions.

T1  - Demotic or demonic? Race, class and gender in 'Gypsy' reality TV
AN  - 1559004937; 201432030
AB  - An intriguing shift in the public interest of Roma, Gypsy and Traveller minorities has been the rise of the 'Gypsy' reality TV star in shows across Europe ('Gypsy' is the word most often used in popular media culture). The latest phenomenon to hit the UK has been the Channel 4 series Big Fat Gypsy Weddings (Firecracker Films, Channel 4, 2010-2013), a flamboyant production that has garnered both huge audience shares and fierce criticism, with commentators berating its narrow, sensationalist focus. Drawing on both specialized literature on Roma minorities and current sociological debates on reality TV formats, this article raises questions about how the politics of the 'demotic turn' of such formats (as noted by Turner in 2004) can lean towards the demonic through emphasizing such groups as spectacular, extraordinary and above all, negatively different. Furthermore, this article shows how the series not only reproduces old stereotypes of Gypsies and Travellers as different, ethnicized others but is also heavily embroiled in UK gender and class discourses. Whilst the series claims to be a unique insight into a marginalized community, this close analysis discusses the wider politics within which it is embedded and how such representations can both popularize and undermine marginalized or minority groups.

T1  - Reviving agency: taking time and making space for rethinking diversity and inclusion
AN  - 1542002170; 201426881
AB  - The path of social inclusion has proven difficult for minority groups in the European context. In this article, we focus on the inclusion of refugees, particularly in the labor market, and show how the difficulties they faced were related to dominant discourses on migration. Uncovering the hegemonic assumptions within these discourses is crucial in order to enable a rethinking of diversity issues and inclusion. We addressed this through an intervention research, which was part of an empowerment project for refugees. The research included and connected refugees engaged in searching for work to Dutch professionals engaged with diversity issues. Through social intervention, this research aimed to create empowerment through critical reflection on the ways that the power of dominant discourses works in the practice of everyday life. By contrasting the discursive positioning of participants with different backgrounds, the research created alternative spaces for reflection. This, in turn, led to the production of alternative narratives and allowed participants to claim agency in the face of the dominant discourses. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Here are the Gypsies!' The importance of self-representations and how to question prominent images of Gypsy minorities
AN  - 1551000659; 201429124
AB  - Gypsy, Roma or traveller minorities remain a group that is still homogenized as the 'other'1. The European imagination continues to be entrenched in the spectacle of their difference -- images of weddings, musicians, funerals and fights are fascinating and are thus prioritized. But what would happen if the cameras were given to these people themselves? What if they became the image-makers? This article examines how ethnic studies might contribute to breaking the mould of the exoticized Gypsy through self-representations. The study here formed part of an ethnographic project among primary school pupils in Hungary. Using the photo elicitation method, children were given disposable cameras producing 451 photographs that then formed the basis of interviews. The results reveal very few indicators that could be described as significantly or distinctively divided into 'Gypsy' or 'non-Gypsy' identifications, questioning the status of difference in discourses around such minorities.

T1  - The antecedents and consequences of racial/ethnic discrimination during adolescence: Does the source of discrimination matter?
AN  - 1494749629; 201401990
AB  - In the current study, we examined the precursors and consequences of discrimination for 876 Latino, African American, and Asian American adolescents (Mage = 16.9 years, SD = 0.43). The race/ethnic characteristics of schools and neighborhoods influenced adolescents' perceptions of the race/ethnic climates of these contexts. In turn, adolescents who viewed climates more negatively were more likely to perceive discriminatory treatment by school personnel, peers, and societal institutions. Discrimination from these 3 sources exerted differential influence on developmental outcomes: Greater discrimination from school personnel was associated with poorer academic performance, greater discrimination from peers was associated with more psychological maladjustment, and greater societal discrimination was associated with heightened racial awareness. Relations were consistent across race/ethnic groups and gender. Implications for intervening to reduce racial discrimination and other social stigmas are discussed.

T1  - Positive or negative ethnic encounters in urban neighbourhoods? A photo experiment on the net impact of ethnicity and neighbourhood context on attitudes towards minority and majority residents
AN  - 1463013089; 201345800
AB  - Using data from a new factorial survey experiment, we study the mechanisms that drive negative interethnic attitudes in urban neighbourhood encounters. Specifically, we examine the extent to which the general impression made by a resident depends on the ethnicity of that resident and on the aspects of the neighbourhood environment. Majority and minority respondents in the Netherlands judged pictures and descriptions of fictitious neighbourhood residents, in which the ethnicity of the resident varied independently of other resident characteristics (i.e., work status, religion and problem behaviour) and the neighbourhood environment (i.e., physical disorder and ethnic and socioeconomic composition). We show that outcomes depend largely on the ethnicity of the respondent who experiences the encounters. For majority respondents, we find a main net effect of resident ethnicity: native Dutch are less positive about Surinamese residents. Furthermore, we find some support for the normative fit hypothesis that states that minority respondents are less positively evaluated in stereotype-consistent neighbourhood environments: native Dutch are less positive about Moroccan residents encountered in low-status neighbourhoods.

T1  - Kids Talking About Race: Tween-agers in a Post-Civil Rights Era
AN  - 1429629961; 201335827
AB  - Our research examines how American children understand and talk about how race matters in their everyday lives. We draw on interviews with 44 middle school children who attend schools in an integrated county-wide system and find that while some use color-blind rhetoric, most children in our study know that race matters, while they offer alternative accounts for why and how. Some explain race as social inequality, while others offer cultural accounts of racial differences. Our analysis suggests that for white children, gender matters; more girls describe racial inequality than boys. For children of color, class seems to be key, with middle-class children giving cultural explanations, including negative evaluations of others in their own racial group. We use an intersectionality framework to analyze the alternative and complex narratives children give for their own experiences of race and race relations between peers.

T1  - The Next Link in the Chain Reaction: Symbolic Racism and Obama's Religious Affiliation
AN  - 1373428367; 201329671
AB  - During the 2008 presidential election, questions about Barack Obama's religious affiliations spread rapidly over the Internet and became a regular story in the national news. Despite Obama's repeated testimony that he is a Christian, surveys indicated that a sizeable portion of the public believed that he was a Muslim, while others indicated that they were "unsure" of his religious allegiances. We evaluate the extent to which racial attitudes played a role in how the public viewed Obama's religious affiliations. We used nationally representative surveys conducted by the Pew Foundation and a state-level survey conducted in Arkansas. Our findings suggest that attitudes about Obama's religious affiliation were significantly influenced by symbolic racism. These findings suggest that the American public dialogue about racial politics has evolved in recent years to include religious denominations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race and Power: The Potential and Limitations of Prison-Based Democratic Therapeutic Communities
AN  - 1728661154; 201535680
AB  - Race and prisons are deeply intertwined in England and Wales and in other countries. Minority groups not only are overrepresented but also experience the weight and pain of imprisonment more acutely. However, democratic therapeutic community prisons such as HMP Grendon in the United Kingdom offer an alternative to mainstream imprisonment, using communal living as a means to explore psychotherapeutic issues in a humane and effective way. The primary aim of this article is to explore the potential and limitations of prison-based therapeutic communities in responding to individual needs and the wider structural constraints that shape race and ethnicity in contemporary society. The article sets out the context in which these communities operate, in particular the ways in which both prisons and clinical practice are implicated in the flow of racialized power. The article goes on to discuss the features of therapeutic communities that can challenge, confront, disentangle, and reorder aspects of power, inequality, and identity. The article concludes that while therapeutic communities do not provide a utopian answer to the structural problems of race and power, they do offer the potential for a more sensitive internal environment and enable individuals to act with conscious and considered agency in their own lives.

T1  - Expanding Policy-Based Conceptualizations of 'Successful Integration': Negotiating Integration through Occupation following International Migration
AN  - 1417526605; 201331951
AB  - The immigration of French-speakers to Canada and their successful integration into Francophone minority communities has become a priority for the country's federal government. A critical ethnography served to challenge assumptions regarding successful integration embedded within government documents and to raise awareness of the challenges faced by French-speaking immigrants from visible minority groups residing within London, Ontario, Canada. A theoretical framework applying Goffman's concept of performance and Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus, and capital guided the study. Eight migrants participated in up to five sessions including narrative and in-depth interviews, Occupational Mapping, and participation in occupations. Findings highlight that integration involves a process of 'starting over,' which entails becoming aware of differences in fields and habitus within and between home and host societies, learning 'how things work' in the host community, and negotiating performances in social interactions. This negotiation, enacted primarily through occupation, is influenced by differential access to forms of capital. It is further related to ways immigrants' intersecting identity markers are constructed within particular places and embedded in broader social systems and structures. These findings challenge the linear and individualized process of integration identified within government documents, and the narrow focus on economic productivity as the occupation-based marker of integration.

T1  - Multiculturalism in America, Australia and India
AN  - 1494300681; 201402128
AB  - Originally associated with the Left as academic reform and curriculum change, multiculturalism subsequently came to be accepted as study of the philosophy, literature and art of cultures. It got the status of official policy at all levels in the US and other democratic countries. It has been successful in the three democracies, America, Australia and India. India, as the most ancient of the three multicultural societies, has several cultures merging over the centuries, new cultures evolving, and several others co-existing today. There is a Hindu majority despite foreign incursions, Hinduism being the most tolerant religion that does not resort to conversions. America and Australia have Christian majority. The multiple ethnic groups in America and Australia are allowed to practise their individual religions. The occasional ethnic conflicts notwithstanding, the three multicultural societies are advancing as modern nations, interacting with each other.

T1  - Ubuntu in S. M. Kapwepwe's Shalapo Canicandala: Insights for Afrocentric Psychology
AN  - 1463008712; 201345843
AB  - The year is 1884. Somewhere in Central Africa is a vast Bantu kingdom known as luBemba. The people are abaBemba. Somewhere else, and unbeknownst to abaBemba, European nations are sharing African land including that of abaBemba. Consequent to this "scramble for Africa," abaBemba find themselves in an arbitrary amalgamation of 70-plus ethnic groups. The amalgam is Northern Rhodesia. Bemba sociopolitical systems collapse. Young men are forced into mine labor for tax money. Mine townships bring together cultures from Africa, India, and Britain. For abaBemba, this experience is characterized by a multilayered psychological destabilization. Taking advantage of the onset of the written text, Bemba authors delineate for their kinsfolk an Afrocentric space around their new sociopolitical reality. These novelists are neither psychologists nor conventional philosophers; yet their literary treatment of the African psyche is profound. From one such novelist, this article draws insights for Afrocentric psychology. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - First Nations Teenaged Female Lone Parent Families in Canada: Recognizing Family Diversity and the Importance of Networks of Care
AN  - 1629331631; 201441011
AB  - Using semi-custom data tabulations from the 2006 Census of Population, this article provides a brief statistical description of the socio-economic conditions of female First Nations teenaged lone parents aged 15 to 19 years in Canada. It examines existing formal and informal social and economic support systems available to First Nations lone mother families in multiple family households. These support systems where compared to First Nations lone mothers in single family households as a way to shed light on the varying degrees that informal networks of care may be available to First Nations lone mothers living on reserve, as compared to those living off reserve, who access varying degrees of support from extended family members for the care and nurturing of their children. Despite the dominant Westernized view of the negative impacts that teenaged lone parenting can have on women and their children, this article illustrates that there seems to be a culturally interrelated system, or 'networks of care,' available to these women. Such networks of care often have been overlooked in research on lone parenting. There remains much diversity among Aboriginal lone parent families when one accounts for factors such as age of the parent, number of children, living on or off reserve, education, employment, and income. Therefore, the assumption that the social and economic disadvantage of becoming a teenaged lone parent will result in the same circumstances and place all teenaged lone parents at the same 'disadvantage' is not necessarily accurate, at least in the First Nation context.

T1  - The 'Idle No More' Movement: Paradoxes of First Nations Inclusion in the Canadian Context
AN  - 1559005485; 201432039
AB  - Idle No More, a recent protest movement initiated to draw attention to concerns by Indigenous people and allies about changes in Canada's environment and economic policies, has also raised awareness about social and economic conditions experienced by much of Canada's Indigenous population. While discourses and policies oriented to social inclusion are not as prominent in Canada as in Europe and several other contexts, these conditions and the strategies adopted by governments to address them are consistent with narrowly-framed inclusion policies. We provide an overview of what these conditions represent and how they have come to be framed in the context of the Idle No More movement. However, we extend our analysis to understand how the Idle No More movement and discourses of inclusion and exclusion alike have often been framed in ways that further limit solutions to the problems that they are oriented to resolve by stigmatizing and distancing Indigenous people, especially when they ignore or undermine distinct Indigenous rights and the foundations of formal Aboriginal status. We draw upon Indigenous concepts of justice and critical analyses of power relations in order to explore the contradictory locations and experiences associated with Indigenous inclusion in the Canadian context. We conclude by exploring the movement's contributions to broadened conceptions of inclusion that build upon alternative conceptions of socioeconomic participation and success.

T1  - Interethnic tolerance among multiethnic youth: Accommodating differences in the construction of social citizenship
AN  - 1531933688; 201423222
AB  - A pluralistic nation like Malaysia needs an extremely organised and sensible society in order to be fruitfully tolerant. Living in a plural community demands a strong willingness to accommodate different ethnic expectations. Tolerance is crucial for the achievement of the right kind of community. It takes a collective voice among all the communities on the character of the nation they want to live in, and the respective rights and obligations within it to overcome the challenge of managing a diverse society, more so in a multiethnic one. The nature of a tolerant society inclined its members to be attentive and open to form a relationship that is continuous and reliable. To understand youth's life experience in regards to growing up amidst a multi-ethnic milieu, we have to explore their experiences to see how they are able to adapt and assimilate. This is an important aspect of fostering understanding with the different ethnic groups with motives that contribute to the formation of social citizenship and a participatory democracy. This research will focus on how Malaysian youth make sense of the seemingly calm and peaceful nation and how their negotiations and resolutions relate to their qualitative citizenship in a multi-ethnic society.

T1  - ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACT IN THE OBAMA ERA: SOCIAL NETWORKING, TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC SECTOR LEARNING
AN  - 1512220773; 201408908
AB  - The financial crisis of 2007-2010 began prior to the election of President Barack Obama. It is widely viewed as the worst fiscal crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It was a result of severe shortfalls in the United States banking system and led to a collapse of large financial institutions and downturns in stock markets worldwide. These challenges also resulted in a crisis in the housing market, declines in consumer wealth, and declines in overall economic activity, all of which have adversely affected local governments and citizens across every race, gender, and class in many ways. The collapse also spurred protest movements fueled by technological innovations and the involvement of well-educated middle class youth. This article explores the breadth and depth of the crisis and its specific impacts on local governments and their citizens. It also examines how local governments responded to these fiscal challenges and identifies which actions governments implemented across the board and the targeted budget cuts taken during the economic recession. It also examines the role of technology and transparency in the Obama Era in mounting citizen responses designed to address dire economic conditions in a way that we have never seen before. This article discusses the organizational changes made through advances in technology, and-using events and revolutions in the Middle East as examples-favorably argues that governments with appropriate, transparent measures of accountability are more likely to receive support from citizens and financial communities for such measures.

T1  - Some Factors Shaping the Expansion of Hutterite Colonies in Alberta Since the Repeal of the Communal Property Act in 1973
AN  - 1494299729; 201402026
AB  - The Hutterites are a religious sect, an ethnic group, and a communal brotherhood. Since their arrival in North America in 1874, they have resisted assimilation and held onto their language, their schools and socialization processes, their clothing and their lifestyle. Two clan groups of Hutterites relocated to Alberta in 1918. During and after World War Two, the freedom of these Hutterites to buy land on which to establish new colonies was curtailed by legislation. It was not until 1973 that the incoming Lougheed government repealed the Communal Property Act. This paper describes Hutterite expansion during the past thirty-five years and examines the changing context in which their locational decisions have been made. First, the attitudes of the main "actors" -- the government, the Hutterites and the people of Alberta -- are evaluated, and then some of the issues that have remained contentious are examined.

T1  - Francophone Minority Communities and Immigrant Integration in Canada: Rethinking the Normative Foundations
AN  - 1494298471; 201402057
AB  - This paper addresses one particular feature of Canada's accommodation of diversity-the existence of French-language communities outside of Quebec and New Brunswick-to show how there continues to be conceptual difficulties in reconciling Canada's many diversities. More specifically, we are concerned with conceptual ambiguities associated with the place of these minority communities in Canada's constitutive political sociology, and difficulties in promoting a coherent set of policies for their flourishing. Moreover, this paper will not simply rehash arguments about their formal and conceptual status. We are interested in illuminating a recent initiative that seeks to direct immigrants to these communities in the hope of maintaining their overall percentage of the Canadian population. This is a development that has received little attention to date from the perspective of the scholarship of multiculturalism and minority rights, and political theory more generally. We argue that the strategy to target Francophone minority communities as 'sites' of integration represents a false promise for both these communities and immigrants. This article will show that the federal framework of 'multiculturalism within a bilingual framework' obscures the realities confronting Francophone minority communities and thus their capacity to integrate newcomers, on both empirical and normative grounds.

T1  - Translating to Communicate with Linguistic Minorities: State Obligations under International Law
AN  - 1448992879; 201342905
AB  - In the on-going debate about language rights, the role of translation remains somewhat of a blind spot. And yet, because there are very few truly monolingual societies in the world, any language policy implies a translation policy. Translation policies will vary from place to place, and they are often the result of ad hoc choices by policy makers at the local level. Even so, by looking at international law, we can find a sort of lowest common denominator for what is to be expected of translation policies. Sources of international law that can have an effect in shaping domestic policies include treaties/conventions and the judicial decisions of international tribunals. In Europe, in particular, a number of regional treaties from the Council of Europe weigh on translation as an instrument to guarantee the rights of minority speakers. The European Union -- with its own treaties, regulations and directives -- also helps set minimum standards for domestic translation policies. We will see that in Europe translation is usually cast as a means to secure other rights. Unfortunately, international law seems to set a rather low bar for this, with the most explicit protections afforded in the judicial realm but with relatively little elsewhere.

T1  - Gauging the implications of the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting
AN  - 1315600378; 201307714
AB  - Although the recent shooting incident at the Wisconsin Sikh temple (gurudwara) has received country-wide sympathy from both American leaders and the people, the incident sparked debates on how to control hate crimes which seem to be taking its toll on the Sikh community in the US, especially after 9/11 terrorist attacks. Jacobs and Potter (1997) are of the opinion that 'the term "hate crime"... actually refers to criminal behaviour motivated, not by hate, but by prejudice, [and]... is meant to distinguish criminal conduct motivated by prejudices from criminal conduct motivated by lust, jealousy, greed, politics, and so forth.' According to them, 'unlike theft, burglary, or assault, hate crime emphasizes the offender's attitudes, values, and character.' In that sense, the Wisconsin shooting poses the question of whether it was a case of 'hate crime' against the Sikhs or of 'mistaken' identity of this minority community for Muslims, which need to be examined in the context of how to preserve the core American values of ensuring the safety of its citizens -- both the mainstream population as well as the minority communities.

T1  - Re-making a Frontier Community or Defending Ethnic Boundaries? The Caucasus in Cossack Identity
AN  - 1504423169; 201405517
AB  - The essay focuses on the notion of the Caucasus as a reference point in the construction of Cossack identity in southern Russia. Since the late Soviet period, the Cossack revivalist/nativist movement has emerged in the territories which constituted the frontier zones of Tsarist Russia. Arguably, the historical Cossack hosts were established as a kind of frontier community which played an important role in the expansion of the Russian Empire. This essay examines how post-Soviet Cossacks reinterpret the meanings of the Caucasus as a spatial and cultural realm where, or in relation to which, they produce their identity as a distinct ethnic and cultural community.

T1  - 'Grounded' politics: Manifesting Muslim identity as a political factor and localized identity in Copenhagen
AN  - 1448996364; 201342935
AB  - A prominent strand within current migration research argues that, to understand the participation of immigrants in their host societies, we must focus on their incorporation into the cities in which they settle. This article narrows the perspective further by focusing on the role that immigrants play within one particular neighbourhood: Norrebro in the Danish capital, Copenhagen. The article introduces the concept of grounded politics to analyse how groups of Muslim immigrants in Norrebro use the space, relationships and history of the neighbourhood for identity political statements. The article further describes how national political debates over the Muslim presence in Denmark affect identity political manifestations within Norrebro. By using Duncan Bell's concept of mythscape (Bell, 2003), the article shows how some political actors idealize Norrebro's past to contest the present ethnic and religious diversity of the neighbourhood and, further, to frame what they see as the deterioration of genuine Danish identity.

T1  - Cultural Responses to Changing Gender Patterns of Migration in Georgia
AN  - 1221407874; 201244053
AB  - In this paper, we explore how individual women cope with the tensions between economic forces encouraging temporary labour migration and cultural norms tying "proper" women to their homes and families. Combining in-depth interviews with returned migrant women in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi with secondary migration data for the region, we illustrate the recent increases in Georgian women's participation in international labour migration. Deteriorating economic conditions in Georgia leave women with few local opportunities to financially support their families, while institutional changes have altered the accessibility and attractiveness of international destinations, leading to increasing motivations and opportunities for women's migration. Focusing on the contradictions between growing female migration and persistent adherence to cultural norms stigmatizing migration in Georgia, we explore the cognitive strategies migrant women employ in an attempt to balance internalized perceptions of acceptable gendered behaviour with their migration choices. Two key pathways of adaptation emerge: framing migration as a necessity rather than a choice and stressing the unique and individually exceptional nature of their own migration experience. We posit that these strategies may serve to limit the norm-challenging nature of women's migration in Georgia. Although migration is often described as an empowering experience for women, if women migrants work to present their migration in a way that fits within the bounds of traditional gender norms, these norms may be strengthened rather than challenged.

T1  - The problems of owning culture: global intellectual property law and 'traditional' community arts in Indonesia
AN  - 1551001896; 201428884
AB  - In our digital age when most movies viewed at home carry Interpol warnings that copyright piracy is a crime, yet patented medicines are unaffordable for millions, ethical debates about intellectual property rights and freedom of information are becoming widespread. But a less noticed topic in these debates is the recent international effort to expand and implement Euro-American models of intellectual property law among peoples whose daily activities previously have not been covered by formal intellectual property laws (primarily copyright, patent, and trademark regulations). This essay considers how this trend is unfolding in post-Suharto Indonesia, particularly the tension between national efforts to create legal property rights over cultural resources and the fact that most ordinary Indonesians do not view their cultural knowledge and aesthetic or ritual activities as property to be claimed in an exclusive way by their ethnic group or government. Plans to legalize the cultural ownership of regional arts are addressed with ethnographic examples from Indonesian fieldwork including 2005-07 visits conducted by an international team of lawyers, musicologists, anthropologists, and Indonesian community activists with 'traditional' arts producers from eleven cultural regions in eight provinces. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Relationship closeness and control as determinants of pleasant amae
AN  - 1283639488; 201303185
AB  - Japanese often find it pleasant when someone engages in amae, defined as an inappropriate request with the expectation of acceptance. Using a random sampling survey, we examined why Japanese adults feel good when a friend or an acquaintance engages in amae and when they, themselves, engage in amae. In both situations, positive attitude toward amae predicted more positive emotions. Relationship closeness and feeling of control mediated this association, and perceiving enough resources to grant the request did so only in the friend/acquaintance amae situation. Despite its inappropriateness, amae could be an effective way to seek help and express closeness with others. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racism and Social Capital: The Implications for Social and Physical Well-Being
AN  - 1125223745; 201240361
AB  - Racism can be manifest at the cultural, institutional and individual levels, and can exert effects at the intrapersonal level if targeted individuals internalize attitudes toward their own racial/ethnic groups. The general aim of this article is to examine the ways in which all levels of racism undermine the development of peer relations, one component of social capital; and consequently affect the health and well-being of targeted individuals. The evidence suggests that cultural racism inculcates attitudes that may foster race-related social distancing; institutional racism isolates individuals from the opportunities to develop the skills needed to develop cross race-relations and promotes engagement with peers who exhibit antisocial behavior; interpersonal racism may erode the quality of routine interpersonal exchanges and engender anxiety about interacting with cross-race peers; and internalized racism may undermine the benefits of cross-race peer interactions. To the degree that racism affects the ability to form, maintain and benefit from peer relationships, it can contribute to racial disparities in economic, social and health-related outcomes and undermine the types of social cohesion that promote national unity.

T1  - Ethnic Residential Clusters in Nima, Ghana
AN  - 1221407435; 201243965
AB  - The global debate on ethnic residential segregation has focused more on the developed world, and little is known about similar patterns and processes in African cities. This is in spite of the fact that many African cities are now ranked among the world's most rapidly growing and least regulated urban areas. Indeed, the dynamics of ethnic residential segregation have scarcely been studied in African cities. The little literature available has looked at ethnic segregation between the neighbourhoods of major cities. This paper goes beyond current literature by examining the pattern and processes of ethnic clustering within a multi-ethnic community. Our goal in this paper is to answer the question as to whether within a multi-ethnic urban neighbourhood the major ethnic groups are residentially clustered, isolated or dispersed. The focus is on Nima, a major slum community of Accra, Ghana. The findings of the study show that even though Nima is a multi-ethnic community, some level of ethnic clustering can be discerned. These patterns are linked to the history of settlement formation, religious affiliation and ethnic or place of origin of earlier house owners. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diaspora: The Politics of Its Meanings
AN  - 1037875379; 201232173
AB  - A key aspect of diaspora research in international relations should be on the ontological politics of naming migrants, travelers, nomads, guest workers, minorities, their relations, and their politics "diasporic." Academic debates about the definitions of diaspora are endless; not only is this quest largely a waste of time, but it marginalizes a more important issuenamely, the politicality of defining a population or a set of relations as "diasporic." I draw here on the notion of "ontological politics," as developed within actor network theory by John Law and Annemarie Mol (Mol 1999). In her work on clinical practices, Mol demonstrates that a disease such as anemia is not a single reality. It is performed in at least two different ways that depend on the methods through which it is diagnosed and therefore "made real": (i) the analysis of external symptoms by a doctor and (ii) the analysis of hemoglobin levels in a laboratory. What Mol shows is that these are not just different ways at getting at the same preexisting phenomenon but rather that the two methods produce two broadly similar yet distinct realities.

T1  - Diversity Is in the Eye of the Beholder: How Concern for the In-Group Affects Perceptions of Racial Diversity
AN  - 925713861; 201204234
AB  - The reported studies suggest that concern for the in-group motivates Asian Americans and African Americans to define diversity specifically, that is, as entailing both minorities' numerical and hierarchical representation, while motivating White Americans to define diversity broadly, that is, as entailing either minorities' high numerical and/or hierarchical representation in an organization. Studies 2-4 directly assess if a concern for the in-group affects conceptions of diversity by measuring Black and White participants' racial identity centrality, an individual difference measure of the extent to which individuals define themselves according to race. These studies suggest that the tendency to conceive diversity in ways protective of the in-group is especially pronounced among individuals who identify strongly with their racial in-group.

AN  - 1266144100; 201300484
AB  - Drawing on newspaper, movement correspondence, and interview data, I examine the (in)visibility of a lesbian and gay student group, Gay Student Services (GSS), in a hostile university campus in Texas from the mid-1970s through the 1980s. GSS formed to create a safe space for sexual minorities at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and asked university officials to recognize the group officially. TAMU's resistance to their request forced GSS to file a lawsuit to achieve recognition. Using interviews with past members and archival data, such as newspapers and movement correspondence, I examine how GSS utilized (in)visibility to navigate the hostile environment. By controlling their (in)visibility, GSS members protected the organization from scrutiny and protect members' safety. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The propensity toward reconciliation among young people in Northern Ireland and Croatia: The role of conflict management styles within the family
AN  - 1018354248; 201212743
AB  - Two studies, conducted in Northern Ireland (N = 266) and Croatia (N = 261), examined the role of constructive adolescents-parents conflict management style (CAPCMS) in predicting inter-group reconciliation attitudes. We hypothesized that CAPCMS would be a unique and positive predictor of reconciliation attitudes over and above other common predictors of reconciliation attitudes, such as inter-group contact quantity and quality, and the experience of inter-group conflict. Findings from Study 1 supported this hypothesis. Study 2 replicated these findings in a different cultural context and extended them by examining the robustness of the relationship between CAPCMS and reconciliation attitudes in the presence of an individual difference measure (self-confidence in social interactions). Furthermore, both studies revealed that for adolescents with high CAPCMS the relationships between intergroup contact (quantity and quality) and reconciliation attitudes were more accentuated, and their reconciliation attitudes were less affected by their experience of conflict, relative to those with low CAPCMS.

T1  - Does diversity damage corporate value? Measuring stock price reactions to a diversity award
AN  - 1037875401; 201231034
AB  - Corporate decision-makers have increasingly adopted an approach to firm governance that places share value above other concerns, including meeting the needs of employees. Decision-makers' concerns about shareholder interests may potentially impede internal commitments to implementing diversity-friendly practices and policies. This study analyses how recognition for a company's diversity efforts impacts corporate share price. We rely on data of share price fluctuation following the receipt of Fortune Magazine's 'Best Companies for Minorities' Award. We find that companies recognized for their diversity efforts are penalized with a significant decline in share price, though this negative effect is mediated by the ethnic composition of the company's workforce.

T1  - Trends in educational attainment by race/ethnicity, nativity, and sex in the United States, 1989-2005
AN  - 919903724; 201201638
AB  - Despite the importance of education for shaping individuals' life chances, little research has examined trends and differences in educational attainment for detailed demographic subpopulations in the United States. We use labour market segmentation and cohort replacement theories, linear regression methods, and data from the National Health Interview Survey to understand educational attainment by race/ethnicity, nativity, birth cohort, and sex between 1989 and 2005 in the United States. There have been significant changes in educational attainment over time. In support of the cohort replacement theory, we find that across cohorts, females have enjoyed greater gains in education than men, and for some race/ethnic groups, recent cohorts of women average more years of education than comparable men. And in support of labour market segmentation theories, foreign-born Mexican Americans continue to possess relatively low levels of educational attainment. Our results can aid policymakers in identifying vulnerable populations, and form the base from which to better understand changing disparities in education. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Impact of Downsizing on the Social Capital Resources and Career Prospects of African-American Survivors
AN  - 1364699923; 201323519
AB  - This study examines African-American survivors' perceptions of how downsizing impacted their access to social capital resources and its effect on their careers. Layoffs can negatively affect the composition of the survivors' social ties at work and their access to career-related social capital resources. Using interview data, I find that most respondents lost contacts who offered social capital resources, which they perceived as detrimental to their career advancement. They also did not discuss having immediate access to additional sources of social capital resources. The implications of layoffs for the advancement of historically disadvantaged groups and organizations' ability to maintain a diverse workforce are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'It ain't where you're from, it's where you're born': re-theorizing diaspora and homeland in postcolonial Malaysia
AN  - 1030864404; 201227755
AB  - The concept of diaspora enjoys a significant currency in contemporary cultural theory. Its descriptive paradigm associates it with the shared experience of displacement, a sense of common origins, and a material or symbolic attachment to the 'original' homeland. This traditional framework overlooks diaspora as a narrative of national desire which enables contestation and disruption of dominant hierarchies and ideologies of nation from within the territorial, political, and cultural boundaries of the nation. It is this neglected aspect of diaspora as a narrative of national identification that is addressed in this paper, which examines the significance of contemporary diaspora cultural politics and formations vis-a-vis the exclusionary hegemonies and workings of the nation-state. In this sense, it seeks to re-orientate diaspora as a conceptual process that brings to the fore the 'routed' dimensions in the national affiliations and longings of marginalized minority communities. Focusing on the postcolonial nation-state of Malaysia and its literary productions, the paper's point of anchorage and discussion, to paraphrase Paul Gilroy, is 'where you're born', rather than 'where you're from'. This shift from a descriptive to a processual approach to diaspora enables more inclusive and emancipatory ways of reading both diaspora and homeland. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Forbidden Fruit: Inattention to Attractive Alternatives Provokes Implicit Relationship Reactance
AN  - 919903937; 201201510
AB  - Being inattentive to attractive relationship alternatives can enhance relationship well-being. The current investigation, however, demonstrates that implicitly preventing people from attending to desirable relationship alternatives may undermine, rather than bolster, the strength of that person's romantic relationship. Consistent with the notion of "forbidden fruit," we found that subtly limiting people's attention to attractive alternatives reduced relationship satisfaction and commitment and increased positive attitudes toward infidelity (Experiment 1), increased memory for attractive relationship alternatives (Experiment 2), and increased attention to attractive alternatives (Experiment 3). Findings suggest that although attention to attractive alternatives can harm one's relationship, situations that implicitly limit one's attention to alternatives can, rather ironically, increase the temptation of alternatives and undermine relationship well-being.

T1  - New Immigrants -- Old Disadvantage Patterns? Labour Market Integration of Recent Immigrants into Germany
AN  - 852900160; 201103285
AB  - This paper examines the labour market integration of immigrants who have entered Germany since 1990, and compares their situation with that of their predecessors. The analyses based on the cumulative micro-census data reveal that recent immigrants into Germany are on average better-educated than their earlier counterparts, and some ethnic groups are even better- educated than the national average. Despite their high levels of formal education, these immigrants coming mostly from Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East face severe integration problems in the German labour market. Thus, after taking into account the value of human capital represented by these immigrants, their ethnic disadvantages appear to increase. This stands in sharp contrast with the disadvantages faced by 'classic' immigrants who arrived in Germany during the 1960s and 1970s, for whom lack of human capital had been identified as the main obstacle to labour market integration.

T1  - Shifting the Balance in Environmental Governance: Ethnicity, Environmental Citizenship and Discourses of Responsibility
AN  - 925713885; 201204099
AB  - Abstract: This paper focuses on the notion of environmental citizenship in examining how black and minority ethnic groups (BME) in Britain talk about environmental "rights" alongside environmental responsibilities. This broader discursive context leads us to engage with two interpretations of sustainability promoting different policy and planning agendas-the environmental sustainability and just sustainability policy agendas-in understanding the multiple spaces of identity, power and agency in which BME communities respond to environmental issues in institutional and daily life. We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with community key informants and ten focus groups with African-Caribbean or Indian communities. We identified four environmental responsibility discourses in the participants' talk, that were variously defined by issues of trust, social equity, off-loading of responsibility and government intervention and that served to shift environmental responsibility away from the individual onto "institutional others". We conclude by suggesting policy implications for the environmental and sustainability policy and planning community. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 919903806; 201201705
AB  - This article discusses the development of immigration policies in postwar Japan by taking into consideration the long-term socioeconomic and demographic transformations of Japanese society. We demonstrate how Japan is experiencing the tension between the evident need of domestic enterprises for unskilled labor and the stated policies of not admitting foreign unskilled workers. We also point out that by the time Japan is ready to open its door to foreign laborers, particularly those from Asia, many of the Asian developing countries may find themselves in a situation where they have lost their potential to supply labor due to accelerating fertility decline. Finally, we conclude that since the processes shaping international labor migration are extremely complex -- which involve economic, political, institutional and social elements -- and the conditions in the world are constantly changing, it is virtually impossible to make any definite predictions regarding future international flows of labor into Japan.

T1  - The Influence of Exemplar Versus Prototype-Based Media Primes on Racial/Ethnic Evaluations
AN  - 907928728; 201124734
AB  - This study examined the individual and combined effects of exposure to positive Latino exemplars and prototypes in the media on White audience members' attitudes about and judgments regarding Latinos in society. Although it was expected that exposure to these favorable models would promote positive evaluations of Latinos among White consumers, the extent to which one mode of presentation could be privileged in the production of more beneficial outcomes was uncertain based on existing research. These results cautiously indicate that while prototypes may offer some advantages in terms of reducing stereotyping, both exemplar- and prototype-based characterizations of positive race-related media content (alone and in combination) can positively influence consumers' perceptions of target racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - Sociopolitical Integration as a Mode of Progressive Race, Gender and Class in United States
AN  - 1125217630; 201240426
AB  - This paper reassesses the tension between minority sociopolitical integration and differences in sociopolitical trust within the framework of conflict theory. Conflict theory posits that in the United States system of government, political systems are used by elites to solidify and/or maintain their relative social advantages over the less fortunate. Minority groups have been shut-out of the sociopolitical nexus until fairly recently, and available evidence of the long-term effects of the sociopolitical integration suggests that continuation of sociopolitical trust may reduce the socio-political gap between minority and majority population. Yet even conflict theory predicts that minority sociopolitical upliftment, and corresponding occupational gains, are threats to the status quo and therefore, be opposed by those who are threatened by such gains. Similarly, shifting and multilayered levels of what is sociopolitical integration and what is sociopolitical trust in a particular context are addressed in the explication of this work.

T1  - Staff of the People? Assessing Progress in Descriptive Representation under the Obama Administration
AN  - 1125217188; 201240527
AB  - Over the past few decades, presidents have made some increasingly noticeable efforts to fill their administrations with a higher number of minorities. Though not yet fully representative of the general public, such advances in descriptive representation are a sign of progressive change occurring within the executive branch, with positive potential implications for the state of representative democracy and public policy. In this article, I survey the current state of descriptive representation under the Obama presidency and the extent to which the president's policy agenda has substantively addressed the needs of historically underrepresented groups. Descriptively, I find that President Barack Obama has been symbolically progressive in adopting an inclusive approach for staffing the upper echelons of his administration. However, concerning substantive policy outcomes, I find that although the Obama administration has made some major strides concerning women's issues, its record concerning the needs and expectations of the African American and Latino communities has been more mixed.

T1  - No necessary tradeoff: Context, life course, and social networks in the identity formation of second-generation Nigerians in the USA
AN  - 1018355919; 201212818
AB  - Based on 25 semi-structured interviews, this article examines the racial, ethnic and national identities of second-generation Nigerian immigrants from the San Francisco Bay Area. I elaborate on the segmented-assimilation literature that considers economic circumstances to be a key determinant in identity formation. I show that participants form highly fluid identities throughout the life cycle, pinpointing factors that often get overlooked or de-emphasized in the second-generation incorporation literature such as youth co-ethnic community access, the college integrative experience and transnational social connections, particularly in adulthood. This article extends the black immigration literature that contends that ethnic identity is primarily used as a means of distancing from 'downwardly mobile' African-Americans. My findings highlight that respondents embrace a black racial identity that is neither oppositional nor associated with a downward trajectory, lending empirical support for the 'minority cultures of mobility' thesis that the minority middle classes share a culture of upward mobility.

T1  - Segregation, mistrust and minorities
AN  - 862595896; 201109736
AB  - Generalized trust is a value that leads to many positive outcomes for a society. It is faith in people you don't know who are likely to be different from yourself. Yet, several people, most notably Robert Putnam, now argue that trust is lower when we are surrounded by people who are different from ourselves. I challenge this view and argue that residential segregation rather than diversity leads to lower levels of trust. Integrated and diverse neighborhoods will lead to higher levels of trust, but mainly if people also have diverse social networks. I examine the theoretical and measurement differences between segregation and diversity and summarize results on how integrated neighborhoods with diverse social networks increase trust in the US and the UK.

T1  - Intergroup evaluations, group indispensability and prototypicality judgments: A study in Mauritius
AN  - 758124161; 201056724
AB  - This paper focuses on the superordinate (national)-subgroup (ethnic) association in relation to group identifications, relative ingroup indispensability, relative ingroup prototypicality and their effects on outgroup and ingroup evaluations. Survey data were collected from a large sample of Mauritian adolescents (N = 1,784) from three ethnic groups (Hindus, Muslims, Creoles). National and dual identifiers were more positive towards the outgroups than ethnic identifiers. Furthermore, relative ingroup prototypicality and relative ingroup indispensability were empirically distinguishable constructs. The Creoles, who are of lower status, had higher scores on both these measures. Also it turned out that relative ingroup indispensability and relative ingroup prototypicality were independently associated to respectively more negative outgroup evaluation and more positive ingroup evaluation. The findings give a differentiated view of the idea that a complex representation of the superordinate category fosters outgroup acceptance.

T1  - Gay Mexican Pornography at the Intersection of Ethnic and National Identity in Jorge Diestra's La Putiza
AN  - 749354374
AB  - This article aims to offer an analysis of the way that issues of national and ethnic self identity are structured and constructed in Mexican gay pornography. Unlike theorists who regard pornography as a matter of sex discrimination and argue that it simply undermines any positive attitudes towards homosexuality, this article argues that Mexican gay male pornography has served as a point of self reference for homosexual men in the country, while it has also helped to foster a degree of visibility for the gay community in mainstream culture. Through an analysis of the film La Putiza (2006), made by the emerging porn house Mecos Films, it will be demonstrated that Mexican male homosexuals do not regard pornography as a cultural product intended to the objectification of the gay community and its members. This film clearly stresses ethnic and national identity as the basis to contest the hegemony of Anglo-European gay pornography in which notions of Latin(o) identity have been caricaturised and heavily troped. This film borrows elements that are pertinent to the specificity of the national gay imagery, as well as film genres that are regarded as quintessentially Mexican. Therefore, the combination of Aztec heritage narrative and wrestling subtexts permit to posit this film as an alternative to the kind of images of Latin(o) homosexuality that are portrayed in Western pornography, while it also stresses national identity by using themes that circulate in the national imaginary as exclusively Mexican. In short, the emerging Mexican gay pornographic industry and the film that it produces prove to be a site of contestation of the hegemony of "Latinised" images that have been offered in foreign pornographic accounts, while they also become a site of validation for gay men whose physicality or ethnic heritage has been rejected within the politics of the erotic.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Divergent Streams: Race-Gender Achievement Gaps at Selective Colleges and Universities
AN  - 758121778; 201057009
AB  - In this paper, we extend previous research on racial performance gaps at twenty-eight selective U.S. colleges and universities by examining differences in grade achievement and graduate rates across race-gender categories. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF), we show that Black males, Black females, and Hispanic males attain significantly lower grades than other race-gender groups, and that Black males are thirty-five percent less likely to graduate on-time than other race-gender groups. Analyses consider an array of personal and institutional indicators of academic performance. Grades and graduation rates are improved by academic preparation (particularly high school grade point average), scholarly effort, and, for graduation rates, membership in career-oriented or majority-White campus groups. Grade performance and graduation rates are undermined by a hostile racial climate on campus, family stress, and stereotype threat, all of which disproportionately affect minority students. We conclude with recommendations to college administrators for ways of selecting and supporting minority students to reduce differentials in academic achievement across race-gender groups.

T1  - Desirable Difference: The Shadow of Racial Stereotypes in Creating Transracial Families through Transnational Adoption
AN  - 743043287; 201026574
AB  - The article analyzes how parents decide to adopt a child transnationally by detailing how the meaning of race is articulated in the formation of family. Drawing from my interviews with adoptive parents, I examine how they internalize ideas about different racial groups. For example, I investigate how what they have learned from the adoption agencies, their own perceptions of racial stereotypes, and their perceptions of the communities in which they reside influence their understanding of race. The article suggests that adoptive parents, when considering whether to adopt children from the U.S. or overseas, use a criteria dictated by racial stereotypes in understanding Asian Americans as the model minority, African-Americans as a deficient group, and Latinos occupying an intermediary position.

T1  - Real Italians and wogs: The discursive construction of Italian identity among first generation Italian immigrants in Western Australia
AN  - 743045448; 201026645
AB  - We explore the discursive construction of Italian identity among a bilingual sample of Italian-born Western Australians. Focus groups were held with two groups: Italians who had migrated to Australia as children and a group who had migrated as adults. We found intra- and inter-individual differences in identity construction, with much discourse devoted to demonstrating Italian authenticity and negotiating ethnic category boundaries. Shared markers of authenticity included language, heritage and food. The groups varied in their selection of referent groups to make authenticity claims, with the child migrants drawing upon the shared Australian stereotype of wogs to construct and authenticate their Italian-ness. In contrast, adult migrants constructed Italian identity through comparisons with the dominant Australian ethnic group and in relation to a broader migrant identity. The findings highlight the fluid and complex nature of ethnic identity and the need for further exploration of how it is constructed in talk. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Birds of a feather flock together -- and fall ill? Migrant homophily and health in Sweden
AN  - 743045413; 201026640
AB  - Although studies show that health inequities between ethnic groups exist, few have expressed interest in the origins of these disparities. As homophily (the phenomenon that people principally form relationships with those who are similar to them) influences people's norms and interactions, it might be an important property of migrants' networks, and have implications on their health. The aim of this study is to examine health inequities between natives and immigrants in Sweden and the health consequences arising from participation in homogenous migrant networks. Using total population registers and representative survey data initial analyses show that migrants experience poorer health than native Swedes. The findings further suggest that homophily is a prominent feature of migrant social networks and that migrants in networks with a high proportion of other migrants experience poorer health than those who include a high proportion of natives in their networks. However, unhealthy behaviour and disadvantaged social conditions may account for a considerable share of their excess risk. Hence, network closure may reinforce and maintain norms leading to negative behaviour and social conditions in such networks. Adapted from the source document.
