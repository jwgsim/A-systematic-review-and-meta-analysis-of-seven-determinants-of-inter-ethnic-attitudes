AB  - Many children in immigrant households endure unique stressors shaped by national, state, and local immigration policies and enforcement activity in the United States. Qualitative studies find that during times of heightened immigration enforcement, children as young as 3 years of age show signs of behavioral distress related to national anti-immigrant sentiment and the possibility of losing a parent. Using multiple sources of data from 168 racially and ethnically diverse families of children in pre-Kindergarten, the present study examined variability in perceived levels of immigration enforcement threat by parental immigrant status and ethnicity. This study examined associations between immigration enforcement threat and child mental health, self-regulation, and executive functioning and whether parent immigrant status or child gender moderates these associations. We found substantial variability in perceived immigration threat, with immigrant parents and Latinx parents reporting significantly greater levels of immigration threat compared to nonimmigrant parents and non-Latinx parents. Immigration enforcement threat was associated with greater child separation anxiety and overanxious behaviors, and lower self-regulation among boys and girls and among children of immigrant and U.S.-born parents. In contrast to our hypothesis, immigration enforcement threat was associated with higher self-regulation according to independent assessor ratings. Educators and healthcare providers working with young children from immigrant and Latinx households should be aware of the disproportionate stress experienced by immigrant and Latinx families due to a xenophobic sociopolitical climate marked by heightened immigration enforcement threat and racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric. © 2021 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice

AB  - To examine the prevalence and diversity of older adults on primetime television, and age stereotyping in these portrayals, we analysed the contents of 112 episodes of popular American television series aired between 2004 and 2018. We identified 6.6 per cent of characters as aged 65 and older - a slight improvement to the values reported in previous studies. However, older adult characters are still grossly under-represented, considering the actual proportion of older adults in the general population of the United States of America. Further, the typical older character was young-old, male, Caucasian, middle-class, able-bodied and straight - if his sexuality was referenced. Older women still face double discrimination in media representations. In addition, older adult characters with ethnicities other than Caucasian and African American are virtually invisible in primetime fiction series. Similarly, old-old characters, sexual minorities and persons with disabilities are particularly rare among older adult characters in this type of programming. Finally, portrayals of 51.9 per cent of characters included at least some elements of age stereotypes, most of which were positive. The most commonly applied positive and negative stereotypes were found to be the golden ager and the shrew, respectively. The findings are discussed in the context of the dominant discourse of ageing and the potential implications of how various social groups perceive ageing and older adults.

AB  - Children’s intergroup attitudes arguably reflect different construals of in and out-groups, whereby the former are viewed as composed of unique individuals and the latter of homogeneous members. In three studies, we investigated the scope of information (individual vs. category) Jewish-Israeli 5 and 8-yearolds prefer to receive about “real” in-group (“Jews”) and out-group members (“Arabs” and “Scots”) (Study 1, N = 64); the scope of information Jewish and Arab Israeli 8-year-olds prefer to receive about minimal in and out-groups (Study 2, N = 64); and how providing such information affects children’s intergroup attitudes (Study 3, N = 96). The main findings were that (a) 8-year-olds requested category information more about out-groups than in-groups, and vice-versa regarding individual information— for both, “real” and minimal groups, and (b) providing individual information about a “conflict” outgroup reduced attitudinal biases. These findings highlight children’s differential construal of in and outgroups and suggest ways for remedying biases toward out-groups. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - There are numerous references to Christopher Isherwood's prejudices against Jews in scholarly literature; however, this subject has not yet been approached in depth. This study aims to fill that void by dissecting the author's bias against Jews: Its origin and nature. The article discusses the references to Jews in the writer's novels, memoirs and diaries within the frame of reference of Tajfel and Turner's social identity theory, which holds that humans innately derogate those who are perceived as being opposed. A close reading reveals that Isherwood, in a specific social and political context, considered Jews alien to him and -in accordance with social identity theory predictions- he instinctually derogated them. Before his stay in Berlin, Judaism did not interest him and he disliked Jews because he regarded them as 'exotic'. During the rise and rule of Nazism, the writer felt compelled to support Jews -although reticently- because they had become the main target of persecution of national socialism. Later, once in America, Isherwood distinguished between 'right' and 'wrong' anti-Semitism and stated that Jewish politics were whining and belligerent. Even though he had Jewish friends, his diaries show a persistent instinctual dislike of Jews. Ironically, the anti-prejudice fighter could not help having his own prejudices. © 2021 Prensas Universitarias de Zaragoza. All rights reserved.

AB  - Importance: Stereotype threat, or the fear of confirming a negative stereotype about one's social group, may contribute to racial differences in adherence to medications by decreasing patient activation to manage chronic conditions. Objective: To examine whether a values affirmation writing exercise improves medication adherence and whether the effect differs by patient race. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Hypertension and Values trial, a patient-level, blinded randomized clinical trial, compared an intervention and a control writing exercise delivered immediately prior to a clinic appointment. Of 20777 eligible, self-identified non-Hispanic Black and White patients with uncontrolled hypertension who were taking blood pressure (BP) medications, 3891 were approached and 960 enrolled. Block randomization by self-identified race ensured balanced randomization. Patients enrolled between February 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019, at 11 US safety-net and community primary care clinics, with outcomes assessed at 3 and 6 months. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Interventions: From a list of 11 values, intervention patients wrote about their most important values and control patients wrote about their least important values. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of adherence to BP medications was measured using pharmacy fill data (proportion of days covered >90%) at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The secondary outcome was systolic and diastolic BP. Patient activation to manage their health was also measured. Results: Of 960 patients, 474 (286 women [60.3%]; 256 Black patients [54.0%]; mean [SD] age, 63.4 [11.9] years) were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 486 (288 women [59.3%]; 272 Black patients [56.0%]; mean [SD] age, 62.8 [12.0] years) to the control group. Baseline medication adherence was lower (318 of 482 [66.0%] vs 331 of 412 [80.3%]) and mean (SE) BP higher among Black patients compared with White patients (systolic BP, 140.6 [18.5] vs 137.3 [17.8] mm Hg; diastolic BP, 83.9 [12.6] vs 79.7 [11.3] mm Hg). Compared with baseline, pharmacy fill adherence did not differ between intervention and control groups at 3 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.57-1.43]) or at 6 months (OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.53-1.38]). There were also no treatment effect differences in pharmacy fill adherence by patient race (Black patients at 3 months: OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.61-1.92]; at 6 months: OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.58-1.87]; White patients at 3 months: OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.33-1.44]; at 6 months: OR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.24-1.27]). Immediately after the intervention, the median patient activation was higher in intervention patients than in control patients, but this difference was not statistically significant in an unadjusted comparison (75.0 [IQR, 65.5-84.8] vs 72.5 [IQR, 63.1-80.9]; P =.06). In adjusted models, the Patient Activation Measure score immediately after the intervention was significantly higher in the intervention patients than in control patients (mean difference, 2.3 [95% CI, 0.1-4.5]). Conclusions and Relevance: A values affirmation intervention was associated with higher patient activation overall but did not improve adherence or blood pressure among Black and White patients with hypertension.

AB  - The social stigma of cancer is a powerful source of stereotyping and prejudice against people affected by oncological disorders. Two cross-sectional studies attempted to (1) provide a formal and content characteristic of the stereotype of teenage cancer patient and (2) analyze explicit and implicit prejudice against them. In the first study, 2,370 middle school students proposed open-ended descriptions and quantified 50 attributes representing physical appearance, cognitive, task-oriented, social, and emotional functioning of the teenage cancer patient. In the second study, 207 undergraduate students of education completed the Implicit Association Test, which contrasted the teenage cancer patient with a teenager as a reference category. A content analysis of 11,191 open-ended descriptions and exploratory factor analysis of 50 attributes showed that teenage cancer patients were characterized in the emotional, social, and physical appearance domain. The IAT revealed that teenagers with cancer automatically induced moderate negative prejudice not linked with similarly negative explicit prejudice. Negative explicit and implicit prejudice suggests that teenagers with cancer may be omitted or disfavored by classmates and teachers, therefore they require special treatment in school and out-of- -school environments. The findings and their practical implications were discussed in light of theories of stigmatization, stereotyping, and prejudice against cancer patients. © 2021 Towarzystwo Naukowe Katolickiego Uniwersytetu Lubelskiego.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused distress in students globally. The mental health of international students studying abroad has been neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially Chinese students who have been unfairly targeted. Objective: To explore and document the positive and negative experiences of a group of Hong Kong Chinese international students studying in the U.K. and U.S. from an insider perspective in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The qualitative study used four 1.5-h online focus group interviews of 20 Chinese international students from Hong Kong aged 18 or older studying in universities in the United Kingdom or the United States, from 3 May to 12 May 2020. A framework approach with a semi-structured interview guide was used to reflect students' stressors, cognitive appraisals, coping, and outcomes (negative impacts and positive gains), in the early stages of COVID-19. Different strategies were used to ensure the credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability of the study. Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic content analysis. Results: Twenty full-time international University students (60% female, 90% aged 18–25 years and 65% undergraduates) were recruited. Students reported (i) stress from personal (e.g., worries about health and academic attainment), interpersonal (e.g., perceived prejudice and lack of social support), and environmental factors (e.g., uncertainties about academic programme and unclear COVID-19-related information); (ii) significant differences in culture and cognitive appraisal in the levels of perceived susceptibility and severity; (iii) positive thinking and using alternative measures in meeting challenges, which included effective emotion and problem coping strategies, and the importance of support from family, friends and schools; and (iv) negative psychological impact (e.g., worries and stress) and positive personal growth in crisis management and gains in family relationships. Conclusions: With the rise in sinophobia and uncertain developments of the pandemic, proactive support from government and academic institutions are urgently needed to reduce stress and promote the well-being of international students, especially Chinese students in the U.K. and U.S. Clear information, public education and policies related to the pandemic, appropriate academic arrangements from universities and strong support systems play important roles in maintaining students' psychological health. Clinical Trial Registration: The study was registered with the National Institutes of Health (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier: NCT04365361).

AB  - This paper aims to analyse the connection between values individuals hold and per-ception whether immigration is bad or good for economy in the European Union. It applies the multilevel modelling approach on the European Social Survey rounds 1–7 and a set of the OECD economic measures. The method allows for an examination of personal (values, socioecomic and demographic) and contextual (GDP, inequality and unemployment rates) drivers of anti-immigrant tendencies. The results show that individual values are connected to how people perceive immigrants in the EU. © Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2021.

AB  - This article examines the role of traditional festivals in citizens’ consciousness of identity, solidarity and integration, with particular attention to the Ode festival, which is dedicated to the worship of the Obalatan deity in Oye-Ekiti. It supplements the scant literature on traditional festivals that have fostered social solidarity and intergroup relations through cultural identity among theYorùb´ people of southwest Nigeria. The study harnesses sociology, cultural anthropology andhistorical research methodology resources, including oral interviews, participant observation,photography, and video and tape recordings to document and interpret its data. The articleinvestigates how the Ode festival fosters identity and solidarity among the people. It identifiesthe roles of religious festival performance, liturgy and rituals in terms of socio-cultural values,integration, and engaging identity. It is noted that the festival is the core of Oye people’s life, as itpromotes solidarity, values, cooperation, relationships, and has functioned as a primary markerof the social and cultural identity of the people over time. It is a traditional and long-establishedfestival that renews and expresses Oye kinship values and identity, and could be employed insignificant new initiatives to promote national value, integration and unity. © Equinox Publishing Ltd 2021

AB  - Introduction: Hispanic/Latinos experience a disproportionate burden of obesity. Acculturation to US obesogenic diet and practices may lead to an exacerbation of innate genetic susceptibility. We examined the role of gene–environment interactions to better characterize the sociocultural environmental determinants and their genome-scale interactions, which may contribute to missing heritability of obesity. We utilized polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for body mass index (BMI) to perform analyses of PRS-by-acculturation and other environmental interactors among self-identified Hispanic/Latino adults from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). Methods: PRSs were derived using genome-wide association study (GWAS) weights from a publicly available, large meta-analysis of European ancestry samples. Generalized linear models were run using a set of a priori acculturation-related and environmental factors measured at visit 1 (2008–2011) and visit 2 (2014–2016) in an analytic subsample of 8,109 unrelated individuals with genotypic, phenotypic, and complete case data at both visits. We evaluated continuous measures of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio. All models were weighted for complex sampling design, combined, and sex-stratified. Results: Overall, we observed a consistent increase of BMI with greater PRS across both visits. We found the best-fitting model adjusted for top five principal components of ancestry, sex, age, study site, Hispanic/Latino background genetic ancestry group, sociocultural factors and PRS interactions with age at immigration, years since first arrival to the United States (p &lt; 0.0104), and healthy diet (p &lt; 0.0036) and explained 16% of the variation in BMI. For every 1-SD increase in PRS, there was a corresponding 1.10 kg/m2 increase in BMI (p &lt; 0.001). When these results were stratified by sex, we observed that this 1-SD effect of PRS on BMI was greater for women than men (1.45 vs. 0.79 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001). Discussion: We observe that age at immigration and the adoption of certain dietary patterns may play a significant role in modifying the effect of genetic risk on obesity. Careful consideration of sociocultural and immigration-related factors should be evaluated. The role of nongenetic factors, including the social environment, should not be overlooked when describing the performance of PRS or for promoting population health in understudied populations in genomics.

AB  - Barrismo is a complex phenomenon and cannot be defined universally. Social representation is based on deficient conceptions that relate it to the use of psychoactive substances and violence. This article presents qualitative research evidence based on the epistemological assumptions of social constructionism, a hermeneutical phenomenological design and the use of qualitative interview and documentary and audiovisual review, to understand the political-pedagogical character of the collective actions of the popular bars of the city of Medellín, Colombia, as practices that contribute to the transformation of the territories. Categories found: i. Bars as popular movements: transition from the brave bar to the popular bar, and ii. Collective actions: Barrismo Social. The bars have gone from rough bars to popular bars, from political and critical reflexivity, with collective actions for the transformation of the territories, which transcends the experience of stigma and social prejudice. © 2021 Nova Southeastern University.

AB  - Issues of voice and representation have always been relevant in the media, but social media have raised new questions about the potential for more diverse, repre-sentative voices to appear in the media. Questions of representation are important in terms of the ability to cultivate empathy in the audience for the people repre-sented. The contact hypothesis suggests that exposure to people through media may decrease prejudice for people perceived to belong to different groups. This article examines the pandemic-driven changes made to the Humans of New York social media project to determine the effect of a change in whose voice is privi-leged in this storytelling medium. This study compared quantitative calculations of engagement on Instagram as well as attempted to qualitatively analyse two sets of comments on posts to determine how this change in ‘voice’ affected the perception of and engagement with the posts and the people featured in them. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - The research is funded by the Latvian Council of Science, project “The Baltic Germans of Latgale in the context of socio–ethnic relations from the 17th till the beginning of the 20th century, project No. lzp–2020/2–0136”. The history of mentality / mentalities is a significant branch of modern historical science, the relevance of which as a component of social history is only increasing. The purpose of the article is to define some features of the mode of thinking / world perception of Latvians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries based on the analysis of the lexical composition of Latvian folk anecdotes. This investigation is based on the linguistic analysis of Latvian folk anecdotes (5671 items), published in 1929–1930. The subject of the history of mentality has three facets: way of thinking / perception of the world, ideas about man and various phenomena of the world, existing forms, and norms of human behaviour. The revelation of the mode of thinking / world perception embodied in verbal texts demands to use linguistic analysis in three aspects—structure of texts, structural and functional. The analysis of the lexical thesaurus of Latvian folk anecdotes reveals the mythological mode of thinking/world perception of Latvians. The incomplete isolation of a person from the surrounding world and the resulting concreteness defines this way of thinking. Such features of this mode of world perception indicate narrowness and density of the sphere of human contacts, which was characteristic of the life of Latvians living in the territory of Latvia. © 2021 Shanghai Normal University.

AB  - The paper is aimed at analysing the novel Russian Skin (2020) by Latvian prose writer Dace Rukšāne and focuses on the problem of self-identification, transformation of woman’s identity under the impact of political and social changes in the context of a binary opposition “one’s own—alien.” Within the frame of everyday life in Soviet Latvia, this literary work reflects and brings to the forefront the specificity of the inclusive identity, when the opposites “one’s own” and “alien,” in the result of interaction, are seen not as dualities but rather as a new wholeness embodying both opposites. Via the theme of partner relationships, so characteristic of this writer, the author employs the model of intimate relationships between two outwardly incompatible worlds—the world of the main heroine of the novel (a Latvian) and that of her partner (a Russian), representative of the colonizing power, to symbolically show not only the existence of two causal world principles, but also the possibility for the two outward opposites’ merging into a new entity characterised by inclusivity. This is just the mother—a bearer of a new life—, who strives to create “one’s own” (a new-born) from the “alien,” and who, due to transformations in self-identity, becomes the embodiment of the “alien” among “one’s own.” The novel is the interpretation on the issue, widely discussed in Latvia in the context of preserving national identity, concerning the development of hybrid/inclusive/multiple identities, and on factors responsible for this (invasion, occupation, ethnic relations, interaction between cultures etc.). © 2021 Shanghai Normal University.

AB  - In the first decades of the twentieth century, American researchers at the Eugenics Record Office utilized a theoretical framework that combined humoral and Mendelian principles of inheritance to measure, trace, and predict the intergenerational transmission of an expansive net of morally charged heritable traits. Their reductive understanding of Mendelian principles—guided by class-and race-based prejudices—allowed them to paint a portrait of a nation that was bifurcated by ‘good’ and ‘bad’ strains of the population and threatened by the presence of ‘degenerate families’. This article examines the theoretical and methodological strategies and the technologies of display and ‘scientific’ legitimization that brought into being the category of ‘degenerate families’ and provided the justification for social policies that controlled marriage, limited immigration, and sterilized tens of thousands of Americans. © 2021, Berghahn Journals.

AB  - The Early Career Awards, given for the first time in 1974, recognize the large number of excellent early career psychologists. Recipients of this award may not have held a doctoral degree for more than nine years. For purposes of this award, psychology has been divided into 10 areas: animal learning and behavior, comparative; developmental; health; cognition/human learning; psychopathology; behavioral and cognitive neuroscience; perception/motor performance; social; applied research; and individual differences. Five areas are considered each year, with areas rotated in two-year cycles. The areas considered in 2021 were animal learning and behavior, comparative; developmental; health; cognition/human learning; and psychopathology. Each year, panels are selected for the areas under consideration, and these panels recommend nominees to the Committee on Scientific Awards. The 2021 recipients of the APA Scientific Contribution Awards were recognized by the 2020 Board of Scientific Affairs and selected by the 2020 Committee on Scientific Awards. For her outstanding contributions to social psychology including investigations of backlash against gender vanguards, which have led to successful interventions that defeat stereotypes and prejudice. Corinne A. Moss-Racusin's work helps society to overcome biases that contribute to gender segregation in the workforce, thereby liberating people to perform the work they are most passionate about without being held to double standards or expectations regarding what they 'ought to be.' As a testament to her interdisciplinary approach, her research has appeared in leading scientific journals, including Nature, Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and has been widely communicated through prestigious news outlets.

AB  - With the increased economic reform in the past few decades in China, a large number of surplus laborers in rural and underdeveloped areas moved to cities, becoming large-scale floating populations. They have made important contributions to the construction of the nation's economy. At the same time, they suffer from prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion, and urban society and residents made them marginalized. The psychological strains are related to the rural-to-urban floating population psychopathologies. We used the database of “Social Integration and Mental Health” and the multiple linear regression to discuss the impact of social exclusion, such as institutional exclusion, economic exclusion, social participation exclusion, and social welfare exclusion on the psychopathologies of Chinese floating populations. The total sample consisted of 15,999 respondents who were floating populations aged 15–59. We found that longstanding social exclusion has a positive effect on their psychopathologies. The impact of the social exclusion of Chinese floating populations in cities on their psychopathologies can be well explained by the Strain Theory of Suicide. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Refugees' vulnerability to mental illness has been well documented, but challenges in research remain. Following Bourdieu's approach to social suffering, this article uses Burmese Christian refugees' life stories to illustrate their lived realities of displacement in which their despair is produced. These stories reveal not only refugees' subjective experiences but also various structural inequalities in the sending, transit, and receiving social contexts that hinder their well-being. Burmese Christian refugees' social suffering is created by varied manmade social problems and processes, including the dictatorship and religious intolerance in Myanmar; human trafficking and gang rape in Thailand; labour exploitation and police corruption in Malaysia; and racial prejudice and oppression in the US. Regardless of their contributions to the blue-collar economy, Burmese refugees endure mistreatment and a lack of benefits and promotions in their labour-intensive factory jobs. Their feelings of displacement continue even after finding religious and political freedom in the resettled country. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Destigmatization is an understudied social process in which the negative outcomes for a previously stigmatized group improve. We theorize that during a period of destigmatization, the effects of stigma persist more strongly for people stigmatized by association than for those directly stigmatized. We propose that this occurs because, during periods of destigmatization, conscious prejudice has diminished but nonconscious prejudice remains, so people correct for their explicit biases toward individuals with the stigmatizing trait but are unaware of their ongoing implicit prejudice toward those stigmatized by association. Our evidence comes from archival data on individual employment in film during the cold war years in Hollywood. It shows that as the stigma of being on an anticommunist blacklist weakened, the employment penalty for being a coworker of a blacklisted artist was greater than the penalty for actually having been on the blacklist itself. A supplemental experiment, designed to address the limitations of archival data, shows the same imbalanced employment penalties in another stigma currently undergoing destigmatization (that of physical disability). Paradoxically, as stigmas recede, harmful effects persist more for associates of stigmatized individuals than for the stigmatized themselves. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

AB  - Breastfeeding is a cost-effective public health approach that decreases infant and child morbidity and mortality. Fiji's exclusive breastfeeding rate was 40 percent compared to the global target of 50 percent. The research aims to evaluate mothers’ breastfeeding infants' level of knowledge, attitudes, and practice less than 6 months of age in Suva. A descriptive quantitative cross-sectional study was carried out in 3 randomly selected medical areas in Suva, Fiji. Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) questionnaire was used to gather data from 415 mothers. The overall mean scores for breastfeeding knowledge of mothers were 12.9, the attitude was 33.7, and practice 7.20.Results showed that mothers were generally found to have good levels of knowledge and practice but a fair attitude. Knowledge was associated with the number of children that mothers had and ethnicity. Attitude had a positive correlation with household income. The practice was positively correlated with the mother's status of employment, the number of children, ethnicity, marital status, and household income. To improve breastfeeding knowledge, attitude and practices of mothers, awareness and education should be strengthened in all health facilities. Improvement in health education materials and advocacy is required. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Enviro Research Publishers.

AB  - This essay argues that Jean Carroll, America’s first Jewish female stand-up comedian, constitutes a key figure in the history of Jewish performance because she embodied a new model of Jewish femininity in comedy, transforming the emerging genre of “stand-up comedy” from one that reinscribed and circulated negative stereotypes of Jewish women to one that revised and humanized these stereotypes. As pioneers of modern stand-up comedy like Henny Youngman marked the genre with misogynistic accounts of Jewish women as backward and unsympathetically demanding, Carroll provided an alternate representation that captured a more assimilated, sophisticated, and sympathetic Jewess. Her performances on mainstream stages were coded, drawing on stereotypes of Jewish women circulated by her Jewish male colleagues, but humanizing them using a new style of “confidant comedy” that leveraged the intimacy of her informal, conversational delivery. © 2021, Purdue University Press.

AB  - Background: Sleep architecture and sleep hygiene might be disrupted by several pathogenetic mechanisms, and the effect of smoking has not been evaluated. Objective: To investigate the effect of smoking on sleep hygiene behaviors that might be associated with the deterioration of quality-of-life (QoL) parameters. Methods: In a prospective cross-sectional study, smokers (n=114) and nonsmokers (n=119) were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality İndex (PSQI), the Epworth Daytime Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI), and the Short Form-36 quality of life scale (SF-36) were applied. Results: We found that none of the components, as well as the PSQI total score were affected in smokers compared with the nonsmoker controls (65.5% of smokers had poor sleep compared to 62.5% of nonsmokers). Although smokers tend to get out of bed at different times from day to day and do important work before bedtime (components of the SHI) more often than non-smokers, no significant differences were detected between groups in any component and SHI total score (27.91±6.72 for smokers and 29.23±8.0 for non-smokers). ESS, depression and anxiety symptoms, and SHI scores in smokers with poor sleep quality were significantly different compared with smokers that had normal sleep quality. Both PSQI and SHI scores were inversely associated with QoL parameters. Conclusions: Our results suggest that smoking by itself is not associated with poor sleep hygiene or sleep quality. It can be concluded that worse SHI and quality of sleep negatively affect QoL, depression, and anxiety in smokers. © 2021 Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social justice refers to promoting fairness, equality, equity, and rights across multiple aspects of society, including economic, educational, and workforce opportunities. A number of scholars across academia have called for a greater incorporation of social and racial justice approaches to the field of human development and have asserted that social justice constitutes both a theoretical framework as well as a set of hypotheses to investigate and understand the human condition. The emergence, experience, and awareness of social injustice needs to be better understood from a psychological and developmental perspective. Four areas that reflect theoretical changes in human development research are featured in this issue: (a) socialization theories about race; (b) ethnic/racial identity and development; (c) developmental social identity and moral reasoning; and (d) lay theories and social essentialism. Childhood is a period of intense change and development. Human development research is uniquely positioned to promote change that will contribute to challenging social and racial injustice. © 2021 S.

AB  - This study was concerned with how accurate people are in their knowledge of population norms and statistics concerning such things as the economic, health and religious status of a nation and how those estimates are related to their own demography (e.g age, sex), ideology (political and religious beliefs) and intelligence. Just over 600 adults were asked to make 25 population estimates for Great Britain, including religious (church/mosque attendance) and economic (income, state benefits, car/house ownership) factors as well as estimates like the number of gay people, immigrants, smokers etc. They were reasonably accurate for things like car ownership, criminal record, vegetarianismand voting but seriously overestimated numbers related to minorities such as the prevalence of gay people, muslims and people not born in the UK. Conversely there was a significant underestimation of people receiving state benefits, having a criminal record or a private health insurance. Correlations between select variables and magnitude and absolute accuracy showed religiousness and IQ most significant correlates. Religious people were less, and intelligent people more, accurate in their estimates. A factor analysis of the estimates revealed five interpretable factors. Regressions were calculated onto these factors and showed how these individual differences accounted for as much as 14% of the variance. Implications and limitations are acknowledged. © 2021 Furnham et al.

AB  - Introduction European societies are rapidly becoming multicultural. Cultural diversity presents new challenges and opportunities to communities that receive immigrants and migrants, and highlights the need for culturally safe healthcare. Universities share a responsibility to build a fair and equitable society by integrating cultural content in the nursing curricula. This paper aims to analyze European student nurses´ experience of learning cultural competence and of working with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds. Materials and methods A phenomenological approach was selected through a qualitative research method. 7 semi-structured focus groups with 5–7 students took place at the participants’ respective universities in Spain, Belgium, Turkey and Portugal. Results 5 themes and 16 subthemes emerged from thematic analysis. Theme 1, concept of culture/ cultural diversity, describes the participants’ concept of culture; ethnocentricity emerged as a frequent element in the students’ discourse. Theme 2, personal awareness, integrates the students’ self-perception of cultural competence and their learning needs. Theme 3, impact of culture, delves on the participants’ perceived impact of cultural on both nursing care and patient outcomes. Theme 4, learning cultural competence, integrates the participants’ learning experiences as part of their nursing curricula, as part of other academic learning opportunities and as part of extra-academic activities. Theme 5, learning cultural competence during practice placements, addresses some important issues including witnessing unequal care, racism, prejudice and conflict, communication and language barriers, tools and resources and positive attitudes and behaviors witnesses or displayed during clinical practice. Conclusion The participants’ perceived level of cultural competence was variable. All the participants agreed that transcultural nursing content should be integrated in the nursing curricula, and suggested different strategies to improve their knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is important to listen to the students and take their opinion into account when designing cultural teaching and learning activities. © 2021 Antón-Solanas et al.

AB  - Hijra is a distinctive South Asia known for their gender and sexual difference and associated with their transgender and intersex identities. Otherwise known as transwomen, they are traditionally subjected to prejudices and embedded within narratives of exclusion, discrimination, and the subculture. As a result, Hijras are typically perceived as isolated, abject, and passive victims who remain social and economic peripheries. Concerning the stereotypical image of hijras, this study explores Arundhati Roy's The Ministry of Utmost Happiness (2017) to examine the novel's problematization of hijras in India. In this novel, sexual and gender non-conformity are addressed within characters desiring to be neither a man nor a woman. Drawing on Hélène Cixous's theories of inherent bisexuality and ecriture féminine, this study examines characters' contestations and alterations of existing definitions of sex and gender. This framework allows for a manifestation of gender flexibility and feminine writing as a tool for self-emancipation. Both protagonists Anjum and Tilo, illustrate that hijras are not predetermined but are formulated in a complex process of a conscious rewriting of the self. While the former character resists heteropatriarchal normativity through her conscious alterations of the phallogocentric structure of her Urdu language, the latter defies societal conventions of family and marriage with unorthodox views and actions that are materialized in the writing of her story. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press

AB  - Those who benefit from privilege often fail to understand the inner workings of their privilege. If they do, they can respond in various ways: abuse their privilege, continue to ignore it, become more self-reflexive with their actions, and more. This essay engages my (in)ability to use a standpoint of privilege in challenging everyday acts of oppression. I offer a dominant group methodology that uses dominant group theory as a heuristic to practice critical self-reflexivity through autoethnography. I follow by providing autoethnographic accounts of moments when I complicitly reinforced or attempted to impede communicative behavior(s) that perpetuated prejudice and discrimination. I conclude with practical implications for readers-especially those who identify as dominant group members. More specifically, I invite readers to unlearn oppressive ways of being toward the continual development and enactment of a social justice orientation. © 2021 by the Regents of the University of California.

AB  - Purpose: First-year students can form a preconception based on life experiences before entering college and identifying learners' existing characteristics can be useful foundation data for curriculum development. This study examines what preconceptions freshman students had about medicine before entering medical school. Methods: A total of 110 first-year students were asked about what preconceptions they had about "medicine". A total of 1,124 data were used in the content analysis method. Results: The results were extracted into 5, and 12 twelve categories. On the theme of "scientific discipline", the knowledge students had about general health was based on scant expertise and little evidence. Students perceived medicine as Western and scientific, considering Korean traditional medicine as unscientific. Students believed that "medical practice" should be a "disease treatment" and "patient-centered" approach rather than a "social responsibility". In "the role of the doctor", students were concerned about the doctor's being financially stable on the positive side, and about the high-intensity workload on the negative side. In "medical education", students believed that studying medicine would be "hard and difficult" because of the "importance of memorizing" and "extensive study load". In "specialty stereotype", students had biases that were mostly concentrated on "psychiatry" and "surgery" Conclusion: Perception of "medicine" has been revealed to a varied range of themes, but some have been inaccurate or unrealistic. These prejudices and groundless beliefs have a gap with the learning outcomes that students should achieve in the curriculum, and these preconceptions seem to have been influenced by South Korea's unique cultural context. © 2021 The Korean Ophthalmological Society.

AB  - National monitoring data and research suggest that British adopted children achieve poorer educational outcomes and experience higher levels of emotional, social and learning difficulties in school, compared to the general population. However, few studies have elicited the perspectives of adopted children and adoptive parents in relation to school experiences. The current study used a qualitative design to explore the lived educational experiences of adopted children through semi-structured interviews with 11 secondary-aged adoptees and a focus group with six adopters. Thematic analysis identified five themes within the narratives of the adoptees and adopters: inner turmoil; social disconnection; unsupportive school contexts; relational repair; and misperceptions and prejudice. These findings were presented to 20 Designated Teachers (DTs) within a workshop to explore how the experiences of the adoptees and adopters can be used to inform their role. Three themes were found, which illustrate broad implications for DTs’ practice with adopted children and adoptive parents in schools: raising awareness; developing relationships; and supporting emotional needs. Key implications for schools, post-adoption support services and policymakers are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article attempts to explain the positive reception of Black troops in Europe by focusing on the relatively underexplored case of the Italian campaign in the Second World War. It suggests that African American GIs actively nurtured positive relationships with Italian civilians in a number of ways that are hidden in official military documentation, but are detectable through testimonies, photographs, newspaper reports, veteran's surveys, and in Italian sources. By being more generous with their resources, befriending families, making efforts to learn the language, and often defying prevalent military attitudes that portrayed Italians as untrustworthy, African American GIs not only experienced liberal European attitudes, but actively fostered those attitudes by exploiting social opportunities so that they were seen as ‘goodwill ambassadors’ by the black press and by Italians. African American troops, particularly from poorer backgrounds, overcame the language barrier and formed ties with Italians worst affected by the war through empathy and a sense of shared experience. Cultivating these relationships was particularly significant given the context of racial discrimination in the American military, a situation that was compounded by the presence of Fascist and Nazi anti-black propaganda, which coexisted with Italian racial attitudes that ranged from fascination to fear, especially when it came to relations with Italian women. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Discrimination has been shown to have profound negative effects on mental and behavioral health and may influence these outcomes early in adulthood. We aimed to examine short-term, long-term, and cumulative associations between different types of interpersonal discrimination (eg, racism, sexism, ageism, and physical appearance discrimination) and mental health, substance use, and well-being for young adults in a longitudinal nationally representative US sample. METHODS: We used data from 6 waves of the Transition to Adulthood Supplement (2007-2017, 1834 participants) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Outcome variables included selfreported health, drug use, binge drinking, mental illness diagnosis, Languishing and Flourishing score, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale score. We used logistic regression with cluster-robust variance estimation to test cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between discrimination frequency (overall, cumulative, and by different reason) and outcomes, controlling for sociodemographics. RESULTS: Increased discrimination frequency was associated with higher prevalence of languishing (relative risk [RR] 1.34 [95% CI 1.2-1.4]), psychological distress (RR 2.03 [95% CI 1.7-2.4]), mental illness diagnosis (RR 1.26 [95% CI 1.1-1.4]), drug use (RR 1.24 [95% CI 1.2-1.3]), and poor self-reported health (RR 1.26 [95% CI 1.1-1.4]) in the same wave. Associations persisted 2 to 6 years after exposure to discrimination. Similar associations were found with cumulative high-frequency discrimination and with each discrimination subcategory in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative longitudinal sample, current and past discrimination had pervasive adverse associations with mental health, substance use, and well-being in young adults. © 2021 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Hate speech expresses prejudice and discrimination based on actual or perceived innate characteristics such as gender, race, religion, ethnicity, colour, national origin, disability or sexual orientation. Research has proven that the amount of hateful messages increases inevitably on online social media. Although hate propagators constitute a tiny minority—with less than 1% participants— they create an unproportionally high amount of hate motivated content. Thus, if not countered properly, hate speech can propagate through the whole society. In this paper we apply agent-based modelling to reproduce how the hate speech phenomenon spreads within social networks. We reuse insights from the research literature to construct and validate a baseline model for the propagation of hate speech. From this, three countermeasures are modelled and simulated to investigate their effectiveness in containing the spread of hatred: Education, deferring hateful content, and cyber activism. Our simulations suggest that: (1) Education consititutes a very successful countermeasure, but it is long term and still cannot eliminate hatred completely; (2) Deferring hateful content has a similar—although lower—positive effect than education, and it has the advantage of being a short-term countermeasure; (3) In our simulations, extreme cyber activism against hatred shows the poorest performance as a countermeasure, since it seems to increase the likelihood of resulting in highly polarised societies. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Global protests and civil unrest in 2020 has renewed the world's interest in addressing injustice due to structural racism and oppression toward Black and Latinx people in all aspects of society, including computing. In this article, we argue that to address and repair the harm created by institutions, policies, and practices that have systematically excluded Black and Latina girls from computer science, an intersectional, transformative justice approach must be taken. Leveraging testimonial authority, we share our past 8 years of experience designing, implementing, and studying Digital Youth Divas, a programmatic and systemic approach to encouraging middle school Black and Latina girls to participate in STEM. Specifically, we propose three principles to counter structural racism and oppression embedded in society and computing education: computing education must (1) address local histories of injustice by engaging community members; (2) counter negative stereotypes perpetuated in computer science by creating inclusive safe spaces and counter-narratives; and (3) build sustainable, computational capacity in communities. To illustrate each principle, we provide specific examples of the harm created by racist policies and systems and their effect on a specific community. We then describe our attempt to create counter structures and the subsequent outcomes for the girls, their families, and the community. This work contributes a framework for STEM and computing educators to integrate transformative justice as a method of repairing the harm that both society and the field of computing has and continues to cause Black and Latinx communities. We charge policy makers, educators, researchers, and community leaders to examine histories of oppression in their communities and to adopt holistic, transformative approaches that counter structural oppression at the individual and system level. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate gender stereotypes and prejudices that negatively affect women and men. It is important that students be aware of gender issues and are able to critically reflect on their own prejudices and gender "matrices"of the education system in the context of 'gender v sex'. A questionnaire was the main method of data collection. A sociological survey, "Students on the problems of gender equality"was conducted at V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University (Ukraine). The survey was conducted based on a three-level probability sample, which ensures the representativeness of the data. The effectiveness of aspects of gender education in secondary schools and higher education institutions has been assessed. At school, the problems of gender equality are not discussed enough; more than 80% of all respondents did not learn anything at school on this topic. Every third student discussed the issues of gender parity in the university classes. As a rule, this was done in general courses (sociology, philosophy, law), as there are no special disciplines on gender parity in society. The study reached the conclusion that respondents were unfamiliar with gender issues, so they might sometimes not see (perceive) certain gender prejudices and oppression in a student body, which encourages more attention to the development of gender-oriented disciplines of Ukrainian universities. ©Authors.

AB  - Background: Every person has a persona (or mask) which is the façade that every person shows to the world. Thus, males use façade to reveal or conceal their true feelings and emotions. Also, the male uses mental health façade to protect themselves from prejudice and judgment. Thus, the study aimed to explore the experiences of male Saudi nursing students of mental health. Method: Husserl’s descriptive phenomenology was used as a guiding lens to explore. Eleven participants were involved in the study by using the referral sampling technique. An unstructured interview was performed to gather information from the participants. The seven steps of the descriptive Colaizzi process were followed to investigate and examine the obtained data. The credibility, dependability, confirmability, transferability, and reflexivity criteria were observed to ensure the rigor of the study. Results: The findings have two major themes. The first theme is the unadulterated smile that describes optimism in the family and mutual guarantee. The second theme is the orchestrated smile, which describes avoiding diverting burdens, social responsibility, protection of self, and reputation. Conclusions: The findings document that the mental health façade of male Saudi nursing students is associated with the expectation of family optimism, mutual guarantee, the expectation of society, and self-protection. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Coastal plain economies are dependent on seasonal, low-wage labor for tourism, fisheries, construction, and other sectors. Historically, labor in these sectors has come from multiple social and cultural backgrounds: natives, legal and undocumented immigrants, visiting mariners, students, guestworkers, etc. Anti-immigration sentiments around the world have forced undocumented immigrants further underground while increasing demand for legal guestworkers, encouraging the growth of subcontracting and nonmarket labor relations, making work more precarious and laying the groundwork for human participation in livelihood constellations—or several activities that individuals and households combine for income, health, and well-being. Focusing on Eastern North Carolina, this paper examines how these processes influence local economies and the lives of working people, using this analysis as an occasion to critique market-emphasis economic analysis. © 2021 by the American Anthropological Association.

AB  - In India, many women from former untouchable caste groups (Dalits) are domestic workers. Despite attempts at seeking formal, legal recognition, they continue to be seen by the state as part of a broad, ambiguous category of “informal workers” whose work is stigmatized and not legislated for. In this essay, I suggest that the discourses and practices of a neighborhood-level Dalit domestic workers’ union in Mumbai reconceptualize domestic work as “formal” work. The workers assert themselves as formal workers (kamgaar) owing to their long histories of work in specific neighborhoods, relationships of trust with employers, and their ability to negotiate long-standing employment with them. Though domestic work does not align with the state’s definition of formal work (for example, through the presence of written contracts), for the workers, it was their own qualities, origins, social positions, and relationships that defined the formality of work rather than the other way around. Centering respect and dignity in their own work, their union also facilitated the articulation of the caste and gender-based prejudices that have not only kept domestic workers outside the ambit of formal recognition but also have brought about routine encounters with violence and harassment for Dalit women in the local neighborhood. © 2021 by the American Anthropological Association.

AB  - Socially disadvantaged youth are a group to which prejudices are attached which question the appropriateness of their participation, communication and language in the digital setting. From this perspective, the aim of the present research proposes to identify the forms and expressions of communication used by socially disadvantaged young people from the city of Madrid in social networks. This will be examined as a tool for the development of interpersonal and social relatedness processes, which will enable inclusion and socialisation in contemporary society. To this end, a qualitative approach was proposed which enabled a set of core memos, codes, networks and categories to be established, through which study data were interpreted. WhatsApp images and interviews conducted with 78 informants were analysed using Atlas.ti 9 software. All participants belonged to a social group characterised by circumstances of social vulnerability. Of the main findings, it should be indicated that these young people exhibit a social network use that is not limited to engagement in digital leisure but, instead, is based on the exchange of communication. For this reason, these individuals have developed their own language, a fact that highlights specific traits of the digital culture to which they belong and contributes to disproving the idea that these young people use the digital setting inappropriately. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Throughout the last few decades, plenty of attention has been paid to restorative environments that positively affect human psychological health. These studies show that restorative environments affect human beings emotionally, physiologically, and cognitively. Some studies focus on the cognitive effects of exposure to restorative environments. A widely used index that measures the cognitive response is the Perceived Restoration Potential Scale (PRS). Most studies employing the PRS have examined differences in human cognitive response between types of urban environments mainly urban versus green ones. We use Hartig’s questionnaire to expose differences between types of urban environments and ethnic groups. Variances between Arab and Jewish women were calculated in four environments: home; park; residential and central city environments. The effect of intervening variables such as exposure to thermal, noise, social and CO loads and social discomfort were tested. We find that dissimilar to urban typical built-up environments, green areas are highly restorative. Furthermore, differences in the restorativeness of different urban environments are low though significant. These differences depend on their function, aesthetic qualities, and amount of greenery. Ethno-national differences appear to affect the experience of restoration. While both ethnic related groups experienced a tremendous sense of restoration in parks, Jewish women enjoyed slightly higher levels of restoration mainly at home and in residential environments compared to Arab women who experienced higher sense of restorativness in central city environments. Jewish women experienced higher sense of being away and fascination. From the intervening variables, social discomfort explained 68 percent of the experience of restoration, noise explained 49 percent, thermal load explained 43 percent and ethnicity 14 percent of the variance in PRS. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: In the COVID-19 pandemic, Switzerland introduced broad nationwide face mask mandates only by October 2020, later than other Western European countries. This study aims to assess the underlying values and considerations of individuals to wear face masks in the absence of face mask mandates in the COVID-19 pandemic in German-speaking Switzerland. Methods: As part of the “Solidarity in times of a pandemic” (SolPan) research commons, we interviewed 31 participants living in the German-speaking part of Switzerland in April 2020 and 25 of them again in October 2020. Qualitative inductive thematic analysis was applied for data analysis and interpretation. Public health ethics principles guided the interpretation and organization of findings. Results: Five themes were identified: Trust and governmental policy; perceived benefits of mask-wearing; perceived risks of mask-wearing; social exclusion and prejudice; and decision-making in the absence of mandates. In light of increasing infection rates in October 2020, many participants started to consider the benefits higher than the risks and were willing to accept face mask mandates in that context, despite earlier reservations. Conclusions: The absence of face mask mandates underline individual autonomy but may also suppress personal responsibility due to social influence. Face masks are only temporarily acceptable in liberal Western societies and face mask mandates should be enforced only when epidemiologically necessary. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Transgender refugees are at risk of experiencing increased minority stress due to experiences of trauma in their country of origin, and the intersection of multiple marginalized identities in their host country. Adopting a transfeminist and decolonial approach, the present study aimed at exploring transgender refugees’ experiences of life and migration. A semi-structured interview protocol was developed, grounded in the perspectives of minority stress and intersectionality. Participants were five transgender refugees (four women and one non-binary) from different cultural/geographic contexts, professing different religions. Using thematic analysis, the researchers identified three themes: pre-and post-migration minority stress and transphobia; religion as a protective factor for gender affirmation; and individuation and the synthesis of social identities. Participants reported traumatic experiences and the inability to openly live out their gender identity in their country of origin as the main push factors to migration. They also reported feelings of isolation and experiences of victimization during interactions with the Italian asylum services, due to a lack of adequate training, racial prejudice, and transphobia. Participants demonstrated positive individuation, linked to gender affirmation treatments and religious protective factors. The interview protocol may be used by social operators to support the claims of transgender asylum seekers, and to clinically assess transgender people with an immigrant background. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Bias in clinical practice, in particular in relation to race and gender, is a persistent cause of healthcare disparities. We investigated the potential of a peer-network approach to reduce bias in medical treatment decisions within an experimental setting. We created “egalitarian” information exchange networks among practicing clinicians who provided recommendations for the clinical management of patient scenarios, presented via standardized patient videos of actors portraying patients with cardiac chest pain. The videos, which were standardized for relevant clinical factors, presented either a white male actor or Black female actor of similar age, wearing the same attire and in the same clinical setting, portraying a patient with clinically significant chest pain symptoms. We found significant disparities in the treatment recommendations given to the white male patient-actor and Black female patient-actor, which when translated into real clinical scenarios would result in the Black female patient being significantly more likely to receive unsafe undertreatment, rather than the guideline-recommended treatment. In the experimental control group, clinicians who were asked to independently reflect on the standardized patient videos did not show any significant reduction in bias. However, clinicians who exchanged real-time information in structured peer networks significantly improved their clinical accuracy and showed no bias in their final recommendations. The findings indicate that clinician network interventions might be used in healthcare settings to reduce significant disparities in patient treatment. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, the mobility behavior of Italian university students has garnered increasing interest from both social scientists and politicians. The very particular geographical characteristics of the country, together with the recognized persistence of a significant economic gap between the southern and northern regions, drive a large number of students to move from the first macro-region to the latter. As this phenomenon has several economic and social implications for policy-makers—at both central and local levels—it has led to various theories and prejudices. The present article will study the differences between the performance of STEM students who have decided to move from the south to the north and those who have decided to stay close to their hometowns. We devised multilevel modelling techniques to analyze this issue using administrative microdata from the Italian Ministry for Universities and Research (MUR), including eight cohorts of students from AY 2008–2009 to AY 2015–16, who enrolled in STEM fields after earning their high school diploma. One of the main findings is that individuals who moved from the south show lower levels of performance than their stayer counterparts who are enrolled in northern or central universities. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - One reason for the persistence of racial discrimination may be anticipated dissimilarity with racial outgroup members that prevent meaningful interactions. In the present research, we investigated whether perceived similarity would impact the processing of same-race and other-race faces.Specifically, in two experiments, we varied the extent to which White participants were ostensibly similar to targets via bogus feedback on a personality test. With an eye tracker, we measured the effect of this manipulation on attention to the eyes, a critical region for person perception and face memory. In Experiment 1, we monitored the impact of perceived interpersonal similarity on White participants’ attention to the eyes of same-race White targets. In Experiment 2, we replicated this procedure, but White participants were presented with either same-race White targets or other-race Black targets in a between-subjects design. The pattern of results in both experiments indicated a positive linear effect of similarity—greater perceived similarity between participants and targets predicted more attention to the eyes of White and Black faces. The implications of these findings related to top-down effects of perceived similarity for our understanding of basic processes in face perception, as well as intergroup relations, are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Using augmented reality (AR) in science education is one of the popular topics that have been researched in recent years. However, more qualitative studies are needed as the contributions of using AR in science education to the learning experience and knowledge construction can be better understood through qualitative research. Therefore, it is important to examine the opinions of teachers and students using AR on their experiences. This study aims to reveal their views on AR technology in terms of their perceived learning, interest, attitude, and experience. A case study design was employed. The research was conducted with 40 students in 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grades in a secondary school and 10 science teachers. In the research, the SPACE 4D application was used for 3 weeks within the scope of “Sun, Earth, and Moon”, “Solar System and Eclipses,” and “Solar System and Beyond” subjects. The interviews were held with all participants after the 12-h lesson. Students stated that AR increases their interest and motivation, facilitates learning, and prevents boredom. In addition, teachers stated that AR increases attention, the permanence of knowledge and curiosity, as well as concretizes the abstract concepts and is useful. In this regard, this technology can be used in science lessons to motivate students to the lesson, to help students overcome their prejudices, to change students' attitudes, and to provide more effective results. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The fans’ importance in sports is acknowledged by the term ‘the 12th man’, a figurative extra player for the home team. Sport teams are indeed more successful when they play in front of their fans than when they play away. The supposed mechanism behind this phenomenon, termed Home Advantage (HA), is that fans’ support spurs home players to better performance and biases referees, which in turn determines the outcome. The inference about the importance of fans’ support is, however, indirect as there is normally a 12th man of this kind, even if it is an opponent’s. The current pandemic, which forced sporting activities to take place behind closed doors, provides the necessary control condition. Here we employ a novel conceptual HA model on a sample of over 4000 soccer matches from 12 European leagues, some played in front of spectators and some in empty stadia, to demonstrate that fans are indeed responsible for the HA. However, the absence of fans reduces the HA by a third, as the home team’s performance suffers and the officials’ bias disappears. The current pandemic reveals that the figurative 12th man is no mere fan hyperbole, but is in fact the most important player in the home team. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The study aims to verify the predictive power of anxiety, depression, and stress over panic buying, and to assess gender differences. Data was collected in Brazil during May 2020 through an online questionnaire which was composed of sociodemographic questions, the Panic Buying Scale (PBS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to assess anxiety and depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to assess stress. 2297 Brazilians (520 men and 1777 women) aged between 18 and 85 years (M = 39.18 years; SD = 14.10 years) answered the questionnaire. Women reported statistically significant higher means' values for anxiety, depression, and stress than men. Though men reported higher panic buying levels than women, the difference was not statistically significant. The regression models revealed that anxiety and stress were panic buying predictors. Comparing gender, the regression models showed that mental health variables (anxiety and stress) explained a higher variance of men's panic buying values than women's values. Hence, there is a significant moderator gender effect between mental health variables and panic buying, as they explained more of the variance of panic buying for men than for women. Psychological support should be provided to individuals, and they should be alerted and educated to the potentially prejudicial outcomes of this type of consumer behavior. Further studies should investigate antecedents and consequences of panic buying. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, hate groups have increasingly attracted public attention while at the same time escaping the purview of scholars. Although overt prejudiced attitudes have lost public support in recent decades, hate group and hate-group activity has remained relatively consistent. What, then, explains the enduring power of hate? I argue that hate groups have arisen in reaction to the loss of social capital, particularly in regard to rural and exurban communities. Using county-level suicide rates as a proxy for the loss of social capital, I test this theory using data from the lower 48 states from 2010 to 2019. I find that each 5.38 percent increase in suicide rates is associated with 1 additional hate group forming. These findings highlight the importance of examining quality-of-life in understanding far-right activity, and challenge previous findings with regard to rurality and hate. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - According to French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, intellectuals are prone to substitute a scholastic relation to the social world for the practical relation people have to it: they replace the practical relation to objects by the relation an observer has to them and by their way of looking at them. When he/she replaces the active agent by the reflecting subject, and the logic of practice by a scholastic reason, the researcher doesn’t realize that he/she performs an essential alteration of experience. The logic of practice can’t be grasped from such a point of view. In order to seize it, Bourdieu said, we have to return to the world of everyday experience. But there are many ways for doing that. In this paper I examine two of them, through a comparison of two philosophers (Gadamer and Dewey) belonging to two different traditions (philosophical hermeneutics and pragmatism). Only Dewey seems to avoid what Bourdieu calls the “scholastic epistemocentrism”. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In contrast to the classic theory of contact among groups to combat prejudice against the outgroup (Allport, 1954), we propose the theory of the taboo of contact according to which prejudice against minorities does not arise due to lack of contact, but precisely in order to avoid contact. We summarise a series of themata whereby in the West the majority's fears of losing the purity of their religious, ethnic, or racial identity have been ontologised in four minorities (Jews, gypsies, natives, and black people). The hypothesis is that the greater the proximity to – or danger of mixing with – those vilified minorities, the greater the taboo of contact will be. We conclude that the prejudice against minorities who are victims of current ethnic and racial discrimination is an hysteresis effect of folk-anthropology themata. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Bisexual individuals experience prejudice specifically related to their bisexual identity, and these experiences may compound extant risk for disordered eating behaviors and body esteem concerns. However, little is known about how sexual minority stress related to bisexual orientation is associated with emotional eating and body esteem. The current study examined the associations between bisexual-specific minority stress and emotional eating and body esteem in a sample of bisexual plus (bi+) adults (including bisexual, pansexual, queer, and those with attractions to more than one gender regardless of identity), and tested the moderating effects of identity centrality, affirmation, and community connectedness as potential protective factors. This study leveraged data from an online survey of 498 adults (77.46% cisgender women; 79.7% White), ages 18 to 64 years (M = 28.5; SD = 9.59). Bisexual-specific minority stress was associated with more emotional eating (β = 0.15, p =.013) and lower body esteem (β = −0.16, p =.005), while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, and heterosexist minority stress. This finding remained the same when sensitivity analyses were conducted with participants who identified specifically as bisexual. Identity centrality and affirmation and community connectedness did not demonstrate moderating effects but they had main effects, such that they were positively associated with body esteem (β = 0.16, p =.001; β = 0.21, p <.001; β = 0.13, p =.004, respectively). Results suggest that anti-bisexual minority stress has a unique association with bi+ individuals' emotional eating and body esteem, and identified potential individual- and community-level protective factors for body esteem. These findings inform future research and interventions for this understudied population. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using data from Turkey and Belgium, this study investigated the relationships of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation with ambivalent sexism, homophobia, and subtle racism. First, we predicted that men are more prejudiced than women. This hypothesis was confirmed in the Turkish but not in the Belgian sample. Second, Muslims were higher in authoritarianism and homophobia than people belonging to other (or no) religious groups. Third, Muslims also showed more hostile sexism toward both men and women. Fourth, negative associations of education with authoritarianism, sexism, and homophobia were expected and found. Fifth, in both countries, authoritarianism was positively related to homophobia and sexism, and social dominance orientation was positively associated with racism. Finally, groups comparing both samples, we found that Turks’ authoritarianism and prejudice was higher than Belgians’. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Background: In Mozambique, HIV infection disproportionately affects young adults, particularly women. Despite awareness and knowledge of HIV transmission, many university students have not received HIV testing and continue to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors, including inconsistent condom use. Further understanding of patterns of engagement with HIV prevention and testing is key to reducing HIV transmission in this at-risk population. Methods: This study used a sequential mixed methods approach to examine patterns of engagement and perceptions of HIV prevention and testing services among higher education students in Mozambique. Survey data were collected from a representative sample of 501 students from Universidade Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) in Maputo, Mozambique to assess the primary outcomes of 1) HIV testing within the last 12 months; and 2) condom use during last sexual encounter. We employed univariate and multivariate regression models. The survey was followed by qualitative interviews with 70 survey participants which were analyzed using an inductive, content-focused analysis to further explain and contextualize survey findings. Results: Over 85% of students reported to be sexually active, among these 74% reported condom use during their last sexual encounter, and 64.2% reported an HIV test within the past 12 months. Females were more likely to have had HIV testing in the past 12 months in comparison to their male peers (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.11, 2.99), but were half as likely to have used a condom with their last sexual encounter (aOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33, 0.83), when controlling for other factors. Qualitative data suggests that these discrepancies may be explained by differential perceptions in risk and trust/mistrust, with women being more concerned about infidelity by their male partner(s) and assuming more responsibility for knowing their own serostatus. Women were also subject to negative stereotypes for possessing condoms in comparison to men, which could explain lower propensity for use. Conclusion: Given gendered differences in uptake of condom use and HIV testing, and perceived HIV risk, interventions tailored specifically to male and female students may impact engagement with HIV prevention and testing and empower informed choices about sexual behaviors. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines how digital technologies might be used to improve ethical attitudes towards nonhuman animals, by exploring the case study of nonhuman apes kept in modern zoos. The paper describes and employs a socio-ethical framework for undermining anti-ape prejudice advanced by philosopher Edouard Machery which draws on classic anti-racism strategies from the social sciences. We also discuss how digital technologies might be designed and deployed to enable and enhance rather than impede the three anti-prejudice strategies of contact and interaction, enlightenment, and individualization. In doing so, the paper illuminates the broad potential and limitations of digital technology to both harm and benefit animals via its effects on human ethical attitudes. This examination provides guidance for future projects and empirical work on using digital technologies to promote moral respect for a range of nonhuman animals in different settings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - With the rise of prejudice and discrimination against ethnic and immigrant minorities, strategies to reduce prejudice and discrimination, and to counteract the impact of intolerant, antiegalitarian ideologies, are needed. Here we focused on cultural humility, i.e., the ability to have a humble and other-oriented approach to others’ cultural backgrounds, resulting from self-examination and critical thinking about structural privileges and inequalities. In this research we proposed that cultural humility might attenuate the effects of intolerant, anti-egalitarian ideologies such as social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) on negative intergroup attitudes and perceptions. In a correlational study conducted in Italy, we found that cultural humility moderated the associations between SDO and prejudice toward immigrants, as well as between SDO and perceptions of threat posed by immigrants. Specifically, the associations of SDO with prejudice and threat were lower among respondents with high cultural humility compared to respondents with low cultural humility. Conversely, cultural humility did not moderate the effects of RWA on prejudice and threat. Findings are discussed considering the motivations underlying prejudice of high-SDO and high-RWA individuals, and proposing cultural humility training to foster positive intergroup relations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Listening to the voices of adolescents and young adults regarding their lived experiences could be a way to identify important skills and abilities for adaptive and positive behaviour that will enable youth to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life. Hence, the aim with the current study is to explore the experiences and understandings of the life situation among adolescents and young adults of today, by making their voices heard in regards to mental health and help-seeking behaviour. A total of 6 group interviews were conducted with 22 adolescents and young adults (13 girls and 9 boys) ages 17–25 (M = 18.6 years). Data analysis was conducted using qualitative content analysis and resulted in two categories and five subcategories. The first category, Life challenges, included views on the sources of mental health, how to manage different types of relationships, and thoughts on accepted ways to express mental health problems. The second category, The need of present adults, highlighted important aspects for seeking help, such as an expressed need to be seen and heard by adults including parents, school staff, and other professionals as well as a need for adults’ increased availability. The challenges to students’ well-being and mental health are many, and there are no simple solutions. Based on the results in this study, life skills training should include elements to enhance the development of individual coping strategies, to be applied when life feels tough and when the body is experiencing stress reactions. Further, to minimize the risk of self-stigma and the internalization of negative stereotypes and self-blame, life skills training should include elements to increase knowledge of structural factors that have effects on the life situation as well as parents, school personnel, and other important adults. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Making fun of growing older is considered socially acceptable, yet ageist humour reinforces negative stereotypes that growing old is linked with physical and mental deterioration, dependence, and less social value. Such stereotypes and discrimination affect the wellbeing of older people, the largest demographic of Canadians. While ageism extends throughout professions and social institutions, we expect nurses—the largest and most trusted group of healthcare professionals—to provide non-ageist care to older people. Unfortunately, nurses working with older people often embrace ageist beliefs and nursing education programs do not address sufficient anti-ageism content despite gerontological nursing standards and competencies. Methods: To raise awareness of ageism in Canada, this quasi-experimental study will be supported by partnerships between older Canadians, advocacy organizations, and academic gerontological experts which will serve as an advisory group. The study, guided by social learning theory, will unfold in two parts. In Phase 1, we will use student nurses as a test case to determine if negative stereotypes and ageist perceptions can be addressed through three innovative e-learning activities. The activities employ gamification, videos, and simulations to: (1) provide accurate general information about older people, (2) model management of responsive behaviours in older people with cognitive impairment, and (3) dispel negative stereotypes about older people as dependent and incontinent. In Phase 2, the test case findings will be shared with the advisory group to develop a range of knowledge mobilization strategies to dispel ageism among healthcare professionals and the public. We will implement key short term strategies. Discussion: Findings will generate knowledge on the effectiveness of the e-learning activities in improving student nurses’ perceptions about older people. The e-learning learning activities will help student nurses acquire much-needed gerontological knowledge and skills. The strength of this project is in its plan to engage a wide array of stakeholders who will mobilize the phase I findings and advocate for positive perspectives and accurate knowledge about aging—older Canadians, partner organizations (Canadian Gerontological Nurses Association, CanAge, AgeWell), and gerontological experts. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - According to evidentialism, what is epistemically rational to believe is determined by evidence alone. So, assuming that prejudiced beliefs are irrational, evidentialism entails that they must not be properly based on the evidence. Recently, philosophers have been interested in cases of beliefs that seem to undermine evidentialism: these are beliefs that seem both prejudiced (and, thus, irrational) and properly based on the evidence (and, thus, rational). In these cases, a believer has strong statistical evidence that most members of a social group have some property and then comes to believe that an individual member of that social group will likely have that property. For example, a server at a restaurant has statistical evidence that most Black diners tip less than average and then comes to believe that a particular Black diner will likely tip less than average. The goal of this paper is to defend evidentialism from the challenge posed to it by beliefs like the server’s by developing a plausible evidentialist account that explains away these conflicting intuitions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious phenomenon on a global scale that can worsen with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to understand the perceptions of health professionals about MDR-TB, their strategies to ensure adherence to treatment and their challenges in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in a priority municipality for disease control. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study and recruited 14 health providers (four doctors, three nurses, three nursing technicians, three nursing assistants and a social worker) working in a city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Remote semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants. For data analysis, the thematic content analysis technique was applied according to the study’s theoretical framework. Results: The study revealed the causes of MDR-TB are associated with poverty, vulnerability, and social risk. A pre-judgement from the providers was observed, namely, all patients do not adhere due their resistance and association with drug abuse or alcoholism. The study also observed difficulty among health providers in helping patients reconstruct and reframe their life projects under a care perspective, which would strengthen adherence. Other issues that weakened adherence were the cuts in social protection and the benefits really necessary to the patients and a challenge for the providers manage that. The participants revealed that their actions were impacted by the pandemic and insecurity and fear manifested by patients after acquiring COVID-19. For alleviating this, medical appointments by telephone, delivery of medicine in the homes of patients and visits by health professionals once per week were provided. Conclusion: The study advances knowledge by highlighting the challenges faced by the health system with the adherence of patients with MDR-TB in a context aggravated by the pandemic. An improvement in DOT is really necessary to help the patients reframe their lives without prejudices, face their fears and insecurity, recover their self-esteem and motivate in concluding their treatment. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Despite the appeal of early intervention in psychosis, there is concern that identifying youth as having high psychosis risk (PR) may trigger stigma. This study employed a pre-post design to measure change in PR participants' emotions about PR upon being told of their PR status and according to whether this was the first time receiving this information. Methods: Participants (n = 54) identified as at PR via structured interview rated their emotions about PR before and after being told they were at PR. Qualitative analyses explored the valence of participant reflections on being given this information. Results: Participants reported significantly less negative emotion after being told of their PR status (p < .001), regardless of whether they were hearing this for the first time (p = .72). There was no change in positive emotions or the predominant belief that they should keep their PR status private. Most participants commented positively about the process of feedback but negatively about its impact on their self-perceptions and/or expectations of others' perceptions of them. Conclusion: This is the first study to collect pre-post data related to being told one is at PR and to examine quantitative and qualitative responses across and within individuals. For a majority of participants, clinical feedback stimulated negative stereotypes even as it relieved some distress. To actively address internalized stigma, clinicians providing feedback to PR youth must attend to the positive and negative impacts on how youth think about themselves as well as how they feel. © 2021

AB  - Aims and Objectives: The aim of the present study is to address the reciprocal relationship between L2 attitudes and L2 use in a bilingual setting among teenaged L2 learners. Whereas several scholars suggested that L2 attitudes and L2 use mutually facilitate each other, empirical studies have traditionally assessed the relationship between L2 attitudes and L2 use from one direction. Design/Methodology: We propose a complex model that integrates concepts tied to the larger social context surrounding formal L2 teaching, such as attitudes towards L2 speakers and L2 use outside the school, with concepts that are more closely associated with formal L2 teaching, such as L2 motivation and L2 competence. In addition, acknowledging that peers’ opinion is a salient issue for teenagers, we also included L2 related peer norms into the model we propose. Based on earlier research we developed six hypotheses regarding the relationships between the theoretical concepts. Self-report questionnaire data were collected among students in Italian language secondary schools in South Tyrol (N = 315). The questionnaire included items from well-established and validated measurement instruments. We tested the proposed model with non-recursive path modelling. Findings/Conclusions: All the hypotheses were substantiated by the data. We found that both L2 attitudes and L2 related peer norms predicted L2 motivation. In addition, a significant interaction emerged between L2 attitudes and peer norms. L2 motivation predicted L2 competence which in turn predicted L2 use. Finally, the results have provided evidence of a reinforcement process, namely, that L2 use can contribute to positive intergroup attitudes. Originality: To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first that utilized non-recursive path modelling in exploring patterns of bilingualism. Significance/Implications: In bilingual settings, L2 use can promote better L2 attitudes. Positive peer norms regarding L2 can counterbalance the effect of negative attitudes on second language acquisition. © The Author(s) 2021.

Driving this concern is the thesis, apparently established by tests such as the IAT, that people who hold egalitarian explicit attitudes and beliefs are often influenced by implicit mental processes that operate independently from, and are largely insensitive to, their explicit attitudes. We argue that implicit bias testing in social and empirical psychology does not, and without a fundamental shift in focus could not, establish this startling thesis. We suggest that implicit bias research has been conducted in light of inadequate theories of racism and sexism. As a result, such testing has not sufficiently controlled for subjects’ prejudiced explicit beliefs and emotions, and has not ruled out the possibility that explicit prejudice best explains test subjects’ discriminatory associations and behavior. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The Central Asian republics represent an interesting yet little-studied space for researching the interplay between language learning motivation (LLM), multiculturalism, and multilingualism given their cultural and linguistic diversity and official promotion of multilingualism and positive multicultural attitudes through language learning initiatives in schools and universities. This article reports on a questionnaire study that investigated the LLM of 235 university students in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, including their integrativeness and international posture. The students were learning Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish, with a majority of them learning two or more languages concurrently. The study also explored their views regarding the benefits of being multilingual and the extent to which their level of multilingualism, both formally and natively acquired, affected their multicultural attitudes and levels of prejudice towards outgroups. The findings revealed statistically significant gender differences in how the participants viewed the benefits of being multilingual, as well as statistically significant relationships between their levels of natively acquired multilingualism and their multicultural attitudes and levels of prejudice towards outgroups. International posture and integrativeness, meanwhile, were found to be distinct concepts with little overlap. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Prejudice against tourists from the epidemic areas or those infected during the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted much attention. While many studies examined the influence of this prejudice on tourists themselves, little research has been conducted to identify cyber-bystanders’ reactions to tourism companies' prejudice practice. This study aims to fill this gap by revealing the process of how cyber-bystanders identify, evaluate, and respond online to prejudice practice in the context of the tourism industry. The study developed a conceptual model to examine the influential factors and their internal relationship of cyber-bystanders’ reactions. A multistage model was proposed based on the social comparison theory. An online survey was conducted in mainland China, and 558 useable questionnaires were collected. The three-process model was estimated using the Bootstrap mediation test and hierarchical regression analysis. The results indicate that cyber-bystanders’ prejudice recognizing process could impact their reactions through the influence of their evaluation behaviors. Meanwhile, the collective sentiment on social media has a moderating effect on the relationship between cyber-bystanders’ evaluating process and their reactions to prejudice practice. Both theoretical and practical implications were discussed. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Background: Experiences of HIV stigma remain prevalent across Canada, causing significant stress and negatively affecting the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV. While studies have consistently demonstrated that stigma negatively impacts health, there has been limited research on the mechanisms behind these effects. This study aims to identify which dimensions of stigma have significant relationships with self-rated health and examine the mechanisms by which those types of stigma impact self-rated health. Methods: We recruited 724 participants to complete the People Living with HIV Stigma Index in Ontario, designed by people living with HIV to measure nuanced changes in stigma and discrimination. The present study utilizes data from externally validated measures of stigma and health risks that were included in the survey. First, we conducted multiple regression analyses to examine which variables had a significant impact on self-rated health. Results from the multiple regression guided the mediation analysis. A parallel mediation model was created with enacted stigma as the antecedent, internalized stigma and depression as the mediators, and self-rated health as the outcome. Results: In the multiple regression analysis, internalized stigma (coefficient = −0.20, p < 0.01) and depression (coefficient = −0.07, p < 0.01) were both significant and independent predictors of health. Mediation analyses demonstrated that the relationship between enacted stigma and self-rated health is mediated in parallel by both internalized stigma [coefficient = −0.08, se = 0.03, 95% CI (−0.14, −0.02)] and depression [coefficient = −0.16, se = 0.03, 95% CI (−0.22, −0.11)]. Conclusions: We developed a mediation model to explain how HIV-related stigma negatively impacts health. We found that that enacted stigma, or experiences of prejudice or discrimination, can lead to internalized stigma, or internalization of negative thoughts regarding one’s HIV status and/or increased depressive symptoms which then may lead to worse overall health. Highlighting the importance of internalized stigma and depression has the potential to shape the development of targeted intervention strategies aimed at reducing the burden of stigma and improving the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Students who will become health professionals should be educated according to universal standards of providing foreign patients with culturally satisfying health care, free from discrimination. Aim: This study aims to identify the relationship of intercultural effectiveness and awareness with xenophobia in undergraduate nursing students and vocational schools of health services students. Method: This descriptive study was conducted with undergraduate nursing students (N= 257) and vocational schools of health services students (N = 341) in a region with a high refugee population in Turkey. Data were collected through the “Intercultural Awareness Scale,” the “Intercultural Effectiveness Scale,” and the “Xenophobia Scale.” Results: Of all the participants, 70.1% were females, and the mean age was 20.70 ± 2.64 years; 57% of the students were from the vocational school students, and 43% from the undergraduate nursing program. Female students had significantly higher scores in intercultural effectiveness, behavioral flexibility, xenophobia (p = 0.036, p = 0.041, p = 0.001, respectively), interaction relaxation and interactant respect (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), while male students had significantly higher intercultural awareness (p < 0.001). The median intercultural effectiveness score of the students living in the rural area was low (p = 0.044), and the median xenophobia score of the students who lived abroad was significantly lower (p = 0.032). There was a negative correlation between the Intercultural Effectiveness Scale total and Intercultural Awareness and Xenophobia Scale total mean scores (r = -0.085, r = 0.182), and there was a weak, positive correlation between the Intercultural Awareness Scale total mean scores and the Xenophobia Scale mean scores (r = 0.113). Conclusion: Intercultural sensitivity is considered to be improved by including course content in the curriculum to improve students' intercultural effectiveness and awareness levels and decrease their xenophobic prejudices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Following the COVID-19 outbreak, anti-Asian racism increased around the world, as exhibited through greater instances of abuse and hate crimes. To better understand the scale of anti-Asian racism and the characteristics of people who may be expressing racial prejudice, we sampled respondents in Australia and the United States over 31 August–9 September 2020 (1375 Australians and 1060 Americans aged 18 or above; source YouGov). To address potential social desirability bias, we use both direct and indirect (list experiment) questions to measure anti-Asian sentiment and link these variables to key socioeconomic factors. We find that, instead of being universal among general populations, anti-Asian sentiment is patterned differently across both country contexts and socioeconomic groups. In the United States, the most significant predictor of anti-Asian bias is political affiliation. By contrast, in Australia, anti-Asian bias is closely linked to a wide range of socioeconomic factors including political affiliation, age, gender, employment status and income. © 2021 Australian Social Policy Association

AB  - Background: This study sought to determine how institutional environments, including values, policies, and their implementation, shape inequities in scientific career progression for women and men, and their disadvantages in relation to their multiple social identities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The findings are drawn from a wider research study that was aimed at gaining an in-depth understanding of the barriers and enablers of gender-equitable scientific career progression for researchers in SSA. This was nested within the context of the Developing Excellence in Leadership, Training and Science in Africa (DELTAS Africa) programme—a health-based scientific research capacity-strengthening initiative. Methods: The study adopted an exploratory qualitative cross-sectional study design. In-depth interviews (IDIs) with trainees/research fellows at various career stages supported and/or affiliated to three purposively selected DELTAS Africa Research Consortia were the main method of data collection. In addition, key informant interviews (KIIs) with consortia research leaders/directors, co-investigators, and the consortia management team were also conducted to corroborate information gathered from the IDIs, and also to provide additional insights on the drivers of intersectional gender-inequitable career progression. In total, 58 IDIs (32 female and 26 male) and 20 KIIs (4 female and 16 male) were conducted. The interviews were carried out in English between May and December 2018. The data were analysed inductively based on emergent themes. Results: Three interrelated themes were identified: first, characterization of the institutional environment as highly complex and competitive with regard to advancement opportunities and funding structure; second, inequitable access to support systems within institutions; third, informal rules—everyday experiences of negative practices and culture at the workplace, characterized by negative stereotypical attitudes, gender biases, sexual harassment, and bullying and intimidation. Conclusions: We contend that understanding and addressing the social power relations at the meso-institutional environment and macro-level contexts could benefit career progression of both female and male researchers by improving work culture and practices, resource allocation, and better rules and policies, thus fostering positive avenues for systemic and structural policy changes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Anti-immigration rhetoric in the mass media has intensified over the last two decades, potentially decreasing prosocial behavior and increasing outgroup hostility toward immigrants, and fostering ingroup favoritism toward natives. We aim to understand the effects of negative and positive discourses about immigration on prosociality at different levels of societal ethnic diversity. In two studies (student sample, nationally representative sample), we conduct a survey and a 3X3 between-subject experiment, including money-incentivized behavioral games measuring prosociality. We manipulate media representations of immigrants and the probability of interacting with immigrants (the latter measuring diversity). Results show that negative news affects prosociality as a function of the probability of interacting with immigrants. Negative portrayals increase altruism and trustworthiness in ethnically homogenous settings relative to unknown and ethnically-mixed contexts. These results are stronger for right-wing and high-prejudice respondents. Moreover, negative media portrayals of immigrants increase the testosterone-cortisol ratio, which is a proxy for proneness to social aggression. Negative news also increases outgroup-related perceived health risk, outgroup anxiety and outgroup threat less in ethnically-homogeneous contexts. Overall, negative portrayals of immigrants generate physiological and emotional hostility toward the outgroup, and ingroup favoritism in economic transactions, possibly determining efficiency losses in ethnically-diverse markets, relative to ethnically-homogeneous markets. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In this article, the authors reflect on social consequences of the deagrarianization process, based on their study conducted in the Błaszki commune in central Poland. The study shows deagrarianization in the making, as the region is prone to land being concentrated among the largest farms and to the deactivation of the majority of smallholders. Our research indicates how farmers specialize, quit livestock farming, and endure work overload. It also shows attitudes among younger farmers, who in most cases reject farming as their future career. Among the social consequences of deagrarianization, we note the erosion of community life, conflicts between entrepreneurial farmers and smallholders, and growing distrust. We then reflect on the deagrarianization process's roots, which lie in anti-peasant prejudices and the modernization paradigm in Polish social sciences and in the public sphere. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Viral influence of consumer reviews can change the strategic intent of co-branding relationships between minority entrepreneurial startups and established corporations. When social justice positioning is involved, the intent is often to support minority businesses. We acknowledge this strategy as social justice branding. However, such alliances can trigger vitriolic responses. This backlash is an expression of free speech, and social media provides an obscure facilitative environment. The challenges of social justice branding are complex. We examine consumer online reviews of The Honey Pot and Target Corporation partnership, to understand the implications of social justice branding in practice. Using Leximancer analysis, we find that social justice branding elicits multiple emotions that empower action. Some consumers accepted the collaboration while others resisted. Analyzing the basis of the resistance revealed some consumers expressed racist and shameful behaviors displaying disagreement. Backlash reflected willful ignorance releasing pent up prejudices and disseminating viral-like negative information as weapons of retaliation against brands and marginalized communities. We contribute a conceptual model integrating theoretical frames of social justice, social marketing, brand activism and free speech elucidating the impact of consumer response to social justice branding. The findings and model add a lens to further explore race in the marketplace. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Previous studies on the relationship between religiosity and prejudice have produced inconsistent results and lack a diverse understanding of faith identities. This prompts the need for further exploration of the contexts in which different forms of faith correlate with attitudinal biases both within and between biocultural groups. In this online study, we evaluated two cascade models hypothesizing paths between three forms of faith — mysticism, religiosity, and spirituality — and bias against: (i) women and (ii) Arab immigrants. Additionally, we provide evidence supporting the nomological validity of a novel measure of globalism. 189 volunteer participants were recruited from the population of undergraduate students enrolled in psychology courses at the University of Arizona, and data were collected through a series of online survey measures. We found that both mysticism and religiosity appear to facilitate antagonistic attitudes towards both women and Arab immigrants. Meanwhile, spirituality seems to inhibit antagonistic attitudes towards women, while facilitating antagonistic attitudes towards Arab immigrants. By assessing the structural pathways between these constructs and various group-orientation variables, including collectivism, overt positive ethnocentrism, social dominance orientation, and globalism, this research provides a clearer understanding of how variations among these forms of belief affect group behavior and prejudiced attitudes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The interpersonal distance kept by each individual plays a prominent role in daily social interactions and typically communicates implicitly human attitudes toward conspecifics. While it is held that men dyads keep a larger distance than women, information about whether such sex-related distance is moderated by sexual orientation and implicit/explicit sexual prejudice is scarce. To explore this issue, Heterosexual and Non-Heterosexual Men and Women (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual) were immersed in virtual reality and asked to provide comfort-distance judgements in relation to approaching male or female avatars. Results showed that same-sex comfort-distance was smaller for Non-Heterosexual compared to Heterosexual participants. Moreover, the larger distance toward the male avatar kept by Heterosexual Men was associated with the implicit prejudice toward gay men. Our results indicate that comfort-distance demarcation is modulated by sexual orientation and that implicit sexual prejudice leads to increased interpersonal comfort-distance, a possible proxy to avoidant behaviors. Our approach suggests that immersive virtual reality may allow to overcome limitations typical of studies with real participants and provide a unique opportunity to explore the physiological and neural underpinnings of sexuality-related variables that regulate interpersonal distance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Mining in the Amazon exposes gold miners to various diseases, including malaria, whose control is still a major challenge. The environment of the mines contributes to the proliferation of vector mosquitoes and the precarious housing conditions facilitate transmission of the disease. Understanding gold miners’ perceptions is essential for the formulation of strategies to fight malaria. A qualitative study was carried out in the municipality of Calçoene, state of Amapá, Brazilian Amazon adjointining the municipality of Oiapoque, that is in the border area with French Guiana and Suriname. Methods: A semi-structured interview was applied to an intentional sample of 29 miners, a number determined by the theoretical saturation criterion. Thematic analysis was adopted to obtain the results and the Cohen's Kappa index was calculated to verify the agreement between observers during coding. Results: The agreement between observers was verified by a Cohen's Kappa index of 0.82. Analysis of the interviews showed that gold miners were subjected to prejudice from the community due to forest diseases that they can transmit, and their activities are often associated with crime. When the miners return to their hometown after a period of mining, the urban population blames them for the onset of diseases such as malaria. Most participants in the survey did not know how malaria transmission occurs, and associated its occurrence with contaminated water and food. Participants reported not being afraid of the disease, trusting the diagnosis and available treatment, though this depends on where they are treated. The use of therapeutic resources, such as medicinal plants and medicines acquired in the illegal market, is very common in this population. Despite the challenges identified by the research subjects, they believe that the disease can be controlled, or the cases reduced, but there was low acceptability for a possible mass drug administration (MDA) intervention. Conclusion: Despite a recent reduction in malaria prevalence in Brazil, there are still vulnerable populations, such as gold miners, who help to perpetuate the existence of the disease in the Amazon. The lack of knowledge regarding how the transmission of malaria occurs, associated with myths regarding this and the use of traditional health practices and illegal drugs for the treatment of the disease without a specific diagnosis, jeopardizes the country’s efforts to eliminate malaria. It is necessary to implement control programmes in these populations, especially those who frequently travel around the border region and to remote locations, which are difficult regions for health teams to access, thus hindering diagnostic and treatment actions. For this reason, understanding the perceptions of these individuals as well as their customs, beliefs and lifestyle, can assist in the production of targeted educational material and adoption of strategies in the elimination of malaria in the country. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Research on stereotyping has mainly focused on single social categories such as ethnicity or gender. Extending prior work, here we analyse the effects of the intersection of ethnicity and gender on stereotyping considering the descriptive and prescriptive components of positive and negative stereotype dimensions of morality, sociability and competence. We also examine these interaction effects on the stereotypes–emotions–facilitation behavioural tendencies link. Following a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, Spanish participants evaluated Moroccan immigrant (vs. Spaniard) women (vs. men). We found interaction effects only on descriptive moral character: Moroccan men are perceived as less moral than Spanish men, and less moral and more immoral than Moroccan women. Moreover, (im)morality has a driving role in predicting less facilitation tendencies towards Moroccan men (vs. Moroccan women and Spanish men) via positive emotions. Our findings reveal the primacy of (im)morality in social perception and helping intentions towards targets varying on gender and ethnicity. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The aging population has become a serious challenge for health care service and will lead to an increasing demand for nurses to work with older people. However, working with older people has always been an unpopular career choice among nursing students. This study aimed to further explore the willingness and associated factors of undergraduate nursing students to work with older people in China. Methods: A convenience sampling method was employed from May to July 2017 among undergraduate nursing students from a nursing school in Nantong China. Demographic data, the Chinese version of the Kogan’s Old Person’s Scale, the Chinese version of the Facts of Aging Quiz and the motivation questionnaire were used to collect data. A series of Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Spearman correlation test and Ordinal logistic regression analysis were applied to analyze the data. Results: Of the 853 students surveyed, 38.1 % were willing to work with older people after graduation. Expectancy, interest, attainment value, cost, prejudice, whether they like nursing profession and whether they participated in elderly-related activities were the most significant predictors of the students’ willingness to work with older people. Conclusions: Nursing students expressed a low level of willingness to work with older people upon graduation. Nursing educators have an important part in challenging students’ stereotype of older people and inspire their career choice in caring for older people through both well-designed curriculum and elderly-related activities, and relevant education departments should actively optimize aged-related courses, strengthen professional ethics and gratitude education, and improve nursing students’ sense of identity and mission in caring for older people, so as to improve their willingness to work with older people. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - People with disabilities face attitudinal barriers including prejudice, stereotypes, and low expectations. Many young people without disabilities may doubt that people with disabilities can be fulfilling partners in any loving adult relationship. The objective of the present research was to assess the willingness of non-disabled youth to engage in conjugal relationships with persons with disabilities in Wolaita Sodo town, Ethiopia. Both descriptive and explanatory study designs were used and quantitative data were collected. A self-administered questionnaire was designed and distributed to randomly selected 403 (202 females & 201 males) unmarried youth. Data analysis was undertaken using SPSS software in which both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were utilized for data presentation. The result showed that most (85.5%) of the young people without disabilities participated in the survey were not willing to have any type of personal relationships with persons with disabilities and the main reason for 44.2% of these respondents being the fear of reaction from family members. Furthermore, it was found that the level of willingness of youth without disabilities to engage in romantic love and marital relationships was not influenced by the socio-economic status of people with disabilities. Moreover, the result of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the willingness of respondents to have marital and romantic love relationship with persons with disabilities is significantly associated to the sex (OR = 2.376; P < 0.05; 95%CI = 1.210, 4.664), raised-up area (OR = 2.512; P < 0.01; 95%CI = 1.319, 4.783), age (OR = 2.886; P < 0.05; 95%CI = 1.012, 8.228) and the presence of person with disability in the family (OR = 3.945; P < 0.01; 95%CI = 1.648, 9.442) of respondents. The findings of the present research demonstrate that people with disabilities have continued to face stereotypes and discriminations. Such stereotypes extend to assuming them as asexual and unfit to carryout roles that arise from love or marital relationships which violates the rights of PWDs to form their own family and have children. It is therefore, important to raise the awareness of young people about the differences between disability and sexuality and that physical disability has nothing to do with sexuality and relationship formation. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Applying a dual-process framework to in-depth interviews and survey data, this article explores behavioural manifestations of intercultural attitudes for white majority Norwegians. The article builds upon established literatures on social cognition showing that humans operate with two separate cognitive systems. Affective ‘automatic’ heuristics often generate negative stereotypes, aversive emotions and behavioural responses to ethnic diversities. In contrast, the ‘discursive’ cognitive system, which stores cultural scripts, motivates predominantly egalitarian aspirations and performances. As people balance their behaviours according to contextual evaluations of costs and benefits, the article’s findings indicate a tendency to practise openness and civility in public and spatio-temporally bounded encounters, and to reject or exclude the Other in half or more of privately made selection decisions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: The first 2 years of a child’s life have been found to be crucial to healthy growth and development. Parent support groups can help parents to promote health-related behaviours during this crucial period. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of parents who participated in a parent support group (Parent-Child Meetings) which promoted health-related behaviours of their children, and to determine whether and how these meetings supported them in promoting these behaviours. Methods: We used a qualitative study design. The parent support group consisted of weekly Parent-Child Meetings organized in a multi-ethnic, relatively low-income neighbourhood in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data on the experiences of parents was collected through participatory observations, informal conversations (n = 30 sessions) and semi-structured interviews (n = 13) between April 2019 and March 2020. The data was analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: Parents indicated that they experienced the parent-child meetings as enjoyable and as providing them with socio-emotional support. They reported that the meetings increased their parenting knowledge, skills and practices regarding healthy behaviours of their children and that they used this knowledge in their daily lives. They also appreciated the practical information and advice provided by experts in the meetings. Parents indicated that the positive attitude of the experts was crucial in accepting and adopting their advice. Additionally, parents valued the interactive and hands-on workshops, which integrated health-related behaviours and active play with children, as it enabled them to learn while they played with their children. Conclusion: This study indicated that parent-child meetings contributed to enhancing parental knowledge, skills and practices regarding healthy behaviours of their children. This could potentially benefit the health of children during the first 2 years of their lives. In particular, the peer support of other parents, the hands-on workshops, and the concrete advice and information provided in an informal setting were highly valued by parents. Future parent support groups could use these findings to improve their meetings or to start meetings that better suit the needs of parents with young children. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Across cultures, darker skin tone is associated with lower social status. We propose that Black politicians are subject to skin tone biases in US newspapers, with hostile biases resulting in them being portrayed as more dark-skinned. We hypothesized that such biases occur as a function of negative racial attitudes. We contrast this with an ingroup bias hypothesis, according to which partisans denigrate Black politicians of the other side, but not their own side. The present research evaluated skin tone biases toward President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Dr. Ben Carson, a Republican, in US newspapers. We collected published photographs of President Obama during his first term in office (n = 3781 from 34 newspapers) as well as for Dr. Carson during his 2015–2016 presidential run (n = 1049 from 53 newspapers) from high-circulation newspapers, which had endorsed Democratic or Republican presidential candidates. Blind coders rated the darkness of Obama's and Carson's skin tone. Multilevel modeling revealed that Democratic-leaning newspapers portrayed both Obama and Carson as lighter than Republican-leaning newspapers. Findings did not support a partisan ingroup bias. We conclude that Black politicians of either party are subject to a skin tone bias, where Republican-leaning newspapers portray them with darker skin tones, regardless of whether they are a Democrat or a Republican. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - In the theoretical literature on tolerance a distinction is proposed between coexistence and respect tolerance. In three studies with four national samples of Dutch majority members, we demonstrate that these two forms of tolerance can be distinguished empirically in relation to different immigrant target groups. The findings of all studies further show that the more principled respect tolerance was negatively associated with prejudice towards immigrants, and positively associated with the acceptance of concrete minority practices, above and beyond prejudice. However, the positive association between respect tolerance and acceptance of practices was weaker for people who were more strongly concerned about the continuity of their national cultural identity. Overall, the more pragmatic coexistence tolerance was found to have no independent association with prejudicial feelings and with the acceptance of minority practices. The findings indicate that stimulating respect tolerance might be particularly helpful for improving intergroup relations in culturally diverse societies. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - While numerous studies have highlighted the consequences of exclusion in STEM, fewer studies have empirically tested the benefits of inclusion in peer relationships. We focus on the impact of having cross-racial or cross-gender study partners among one’s close friends in a national sample of 408 STEM majors. Using structural equation modeling, we examined the direct and indirect relationships between having diverse study partners, key background and college experience variables, and college GPA. We identified a significant positive relationship, both direct and indirect, between studying with a close friend of a different race and GPA. We also found that having a cross-gender study partner is positively linked to organizing study groups and study-faculty interaction, which in turn improves GPA. However, Black students were less likely to have either cross-racial or cross-gender study partners among their close friends. We discuss implications for equity and the need to encourage positive intergroup relations in STEM. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The human brain has evolved to predict and anticipate environmental events from their temporal dynamics. Predictions can bias perception toward the recent past, particularly when the environment contains no foreseeable changes, but can also push perception toward future states of sensory input, like when anticipating the trajectory of moving objects. Here, we show that perceptual decisions are simultaneously influenced by both past and future states of sensory signals. Using an orientation adjustment task, we demonstrate that single-trial errors are displaced toward previous features of behaviorally relevant stimuli and, at the same time, toward future states of dynamic sensory signals. These opposing tendencies, consistent with decisional serial dependence and representational momentum, involve different types of processing: serial dependence occurs beyond objecthood whereas representational momentum requires the representation of a single object with coherent dynamics in time and space. The coexistence of these two phenomena supports the independent binding of stimuli and decisions over time. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Bayesian racism is the belief that it is rational to discriminate against people based on existing racial stereotypes. The presence of Bayesian racism is strongly associated with negative feelings about minoritized groups and the desire to maintain racially inequitable social hierarchies. A confirmatory factor analysis on the Bayesian Racism Scale (BRS) yielded a unidimensional measure for assessing prejudicial attitudes that endorse stereotypes based on racial and ethnic groups. Findings from the study have important implications for multicultural and social justice research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Implicit bias instruction is becoming more prevalent in health professions education, with calls for skills-based curricula moving from awareness and recognition to management of implicit bias. Evidence suggests that health professionals and students learning about implicit bias (“learners”) have varying attitudes about instruction in implicit bias, including the concept of implicit bias itself. Assessing learner attitudes could inform curriculum development and enable instructional designs that optimize learner engagement. To date, there are no instruments with evidence for construct validity that assess learner attitudes about implicit bias instruction and its relevance to clinical care. Methods: The authors developed a novel instrument, the Attitude Towards Implicit Bias Instrument (ATIBI) and gathered evidence for three types of construct validity- content, internal consistency, and relationship to other variables. Results: Authors utilized a modified Delphi technique with an interprofessional team of experts, as well as cognitive interviews with medical students leading to item refinement to improve content validity. Seven cohorts of medical students, N = 1072 completed the ATIBI. Psychometric analysis demonstrated high internal consistency (α = 0.90). Exploratory factor analysis resulted in five factors. Analysis of a subset of 100 medical students demonstrated a moderate correlation with similar instruments, the Integrative Medicine Attitude Questionnaire (r = 0.63, 95% CI: [0.59, 0.66]) and the Internal Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice Scale (r = 0.36, 95% CI: [0.32, 0.40]), providing evidence for convergent validity. Scores on our instrument had low correlation to the External Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice Scale (r = 0.15, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.19]) and the Groningen Reflection Ability Scale (r = 0.12, 95% CI: [0.06, 0.17]) providing evidence for discriminant validity. Analysis resulted in eighteen items in the final instrument; it is easy to administer, both on paper form and online. Conclusion: The Attitudes Toward Implicit Bias Instrument is a novel instrument that produces reliable and valid scores and may be used to measure medical student attitudes related to implicit bias recognition and management, including attitudes toward acceptance of bias in oneself, implicit bias instruction, and its relevance to clinical care. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents a novel Indigenous resentment scale to measure anti-Indigenous attitudes in settler-colonial societies. I draw from existing quantitative research on measuring outgroup attitudes, Indigenous philosophy, and settler-colonial scholarship to develop a concept and measure of settlers’ resentment toward Indigenous peoples (settlers’ “Indigenous resentment”) with high construct validity. I test the Indigenous resentment scale using original and nationally representative survey data. I conduct a reliability analysis and use statistical learning techniques to show that the Indigenous resentment scale is internally consistent and unidimensional, and has high theoretical construct validity. As I show, the Indigenous resentment scale is a strong predictor of social avoidance behaviors and significantly predicts opposition to government policies designed to help Indigenous peoples. I explain how the Indigenous resentment scale improves upon existing attempts to measure anti-Indigenous attitudes and discuss the usefulness of the scale in social scientific research. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explain why differences make such a difference by drawing on an historical, institutional, and structural account of intergroup relations and to show the relevance in the present of what has in the past shaped the differences that we take for granted as essential, enduring, and consequential. I make five fundamental points about the meaning of diversity and why difference makes a difference. First, I argue that diversity is always associated with hierarchical inequality, most prominently a racial hierarchy. Second, I emphasize the historical embeddedness of diversity through processes of institutionalization. Third, I emphasize that the structure of intergroup relations is also always subject to contentious politics and to social change. Fourth, I argue that understanding the consequences of diversity over time requires a multi-levelled analysis at the structural, cultural, and social psychological levels in their interrelationships and mutual causality. Fifth, I call attention to the epistemological ignorance that overlays inequality and the history of diversity. I conclude with a discussion of theoretical contributions and outline the need for anti-racist responses at multiple levels to break the link between diversity and inequality. © 2021 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Globally, the average number of children per household is expected to drop to 1.0 by 2020. Single-child families are increasingly the norm, with nearly half of British families classified as single-child. Despite this, research on only-children and their families is scant. Using a convergent mixed-methods design, this study explores parenting of adolescents in British single-child families. Single-child (31 adolescents, 47 mothers, 25 fathers) and multiple-children families (46 adolescents, 76 mothers, 31 fathers) completed online surveys. In-depth interviews were also conducted with 15 only-child families and 15 multiple-child families. All adolescents were aged 11 years to 14 years. Surveys did not find any differences in parenting between one-child and multiple-children families. However, interview data found single-child families were more child-centered, reporting higher overprotective and pushy parenting, but less authoritative and authoritarian parenting. Findings challenge negative stereotyping of single-child families and provide an in-depth insight into the experiences of adolescent only-children and their parents. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Stigma and bias experienced during prenatal care can affect quality of care and, ultimately, the health of pregnant women with obesity and their infants. We sought to 1) better understand the bias and stigma that women with BMIs ≥40 kg/m2 experience while receiving prenatal care, 2) gauge women’s interest in group prenatal education for women with obesity, and 3) gather feedback about their preferred weight-related terminology. Methods: We conducted and thematically content-analyzed 30 semi-structured interviews of women with BMIs ≥40 kg/m2 who received prenatal care at a university-affiliated teaching hospital in the Midwest region of the United States. Results: All women recalled positive experiences during their perinatal care during which they felt listened to and respected by providers. However, many also described a fear of weight-related bias or recalled weight-based discrimination. Women reacted favorably to a proposed group prenatal care option for pregnant women with obesity that focused on nutrition, physical activity, and weight management. Women rated “weight” and “BMI” as the most desirable terms for describing weight, while “large size” and “obesity” were rated least desirable. Conclusions: Many pregnant women with BMIs ≥40 kg/m2 experience bias in the prenatal care setting. Potential steps to mitigate bias towards weight include improving provider awareness of the experiences and perspectives of this population, expanding prenatal care options targeted towards women with high BMIs, including group care, and using patient-preferred weight-related terminology. Through the remainder of this manuscript, wherever possible, the term “high BMI” will be used in place of the term “obesity” to describe women with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 in order to respect the preferred terminology of the women we interviewed. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Change is an inevitable part of life, more so for gender non-conforming students who have to confront prejudice and hostile environments as they transition from school to university. An understanding of the issues faced by first year students with diverse sexual and gender identities is important to ameliorate many of the challenges presented during this transition. This article examines how these youth negotiate and navigate the marked compulsory heteronormative university environments. We employed the concept of compulsory heteronormativity to reflect on assumptions of sexuality and gender identity construction as well as aspects of power and difference. A phenomenological research design was used in the study. Twelve gender non-conforming students participated in focus group discussions and individual in-depth interviews to relate their day-to-day experiences as they transition from school to university environment. The findings revealed that there are individual, institutional and structural factors that impede on the transitioning progress of gender non-conforming students from school to university in South Africa. Given these findings, we strongly recommend further research in the development and implementation of robust university transition programmes that are inclusive of students with diverse sexual and gender identities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Extant scholarship on attitudes toward immigration and immigrants relies mostly on direct survey items. Thus, little is known about the scope of social desirability bias, and even less about its covariates. In this paper, we use probability-based mixed-modes panel data collected in the Southern Spanish region of Andalusia to estimate anti-immigrant sentiment with both the item-count technique, also known as list experiment, and a direct question. Based on these measures, we gauge the size of social desirability bias, compute predictor models for both estimators of anti-immigrant sentiment, and pinpoint covariates of bias. For most respondent profiles, the item-count technique produces higher estimates of anti-immigrant sentiment than the direct question, suggesting that self-presentational concerns are far more ubiquitous than previously assumed. However, we also find evidence that among people keen to position themselves as all-out xenophiles, social desirability pressures persist in the list-experiment: the full scope of anti-immigrant sentiment remains elusive even in non-obtrusive measurement. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Some psychologists aim to secure a role for psychological explanations in understanding contemporary social disparities, a concern that plays out in debates over the relevance of the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Meta-analysts disagree about the predictive validity of the IAT and about the importance of implicit attitudes in explaining racial disparities. Here, I use the IAT to articulate and explore one route to establishing the relevance of psychological attitudes with small effects: an appeal to a process of “accumulation” that aggregates small effects into large harms. After characterizing mechanisms of accumulation and considering some candidate examples, I argue that such mechanisms suggest how a contemporary attitude with small effects could figure in the explanation of large disparities, but they do not vindicate the importance of such an attitude since such mechanisms are typically also determined by competing causes. I close by sketching several strategies for advancing a defense of the relevance of attitudes with small effects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A comparative anthropological perspective reveals not only that some human societies do not engage in war, but also that peaceful social systems exist. Peace systems are defined as clusters of neighbouring societies that do not make war with each other. The mere existence of peace systems is important because it demonstrates that creating peaceful intergroup relationships is possible whether the social units are tribal societies, nations, or actors within a regional system. Peace systems have received scant scientific attention despite holding potentially useful knowledge and principles about how to successfully cooperate to keep the peace. Thus, the mechanisms through which peace systems maintain peaceful relationships are largely unknown. It is also unknown to what degree peace systems may differ from other types of social systems. This study shows that certain factors hypothesised to contribute to intergroup peace are more developed within peace systems than elsewhere. A sample consisting of peace systems scored significantly higher than a comparison group regarding overarching common identity; positive social interconnectedness; interdependence; non-warring values and norms; non-warring myths, rituals, and symbols; and peace leadership. Additionally, a machine learning analysis found non-warring norms, rituals, and values to have the greatest relative importance for a peace system outcome. These results have policy implications for how to promote and sustain peace, cohesion, and cooperation among neighbouring societies in various social contexts, including among nations. For example, the purposeful promotion of peace system features may facilitate the international cooperation necessary to address interwoven global challenges such as global pandemics, oceanic pollution, loss of biodiversity, nuclear proliferation, and climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Effective treatment has extended the life expectancy and reduced disability in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, previous research has found 45–65% of working-age PLWH were unemployed compared to 5–10% in the general public of North America and Europe. We examined the barriers to gaining employment among PLWH. Methods: Thirty-five in-depth interviews were conducted in person or over the phone with PLWH living in Toronto or Ottawa. This included PLWH who were unemployed but actively seeking employment, as well as PLWH who had successfully gained employment through an agency that specifically supported PLWH funded by the AIDS Committee of Toronto. Interviews were conducted between February 2019 and March 2020. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The majority of participants were between the ages of 40–55 and identified as male. Participants shared many common barriers when describing their attempts to attain or maintain employment. Although varying in employment status at the time of the study, consistent barriers included experiencing HIV stigma in workplaces, challenges overcoming mental health illnesses, and difficulties in navigating social assistance and unemployment insurance programs when pursuing a return to work. Conclusions: PLWH face significant barriers when attempting to engage with employment opportunities. Health providers and organizations can do more to support campaigns to end HIV stigma, to support individuals in pursuing employment, and to advocate for policy change that supports reentry into the workforce for PLHA. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Parenting is a challenging life-cycle transition, particularly for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons who have to deal with prejudice and discrimination. Considering this position of social disadvantage and the potential protective role of social support, our aim in this work was to systematize existing knowledge about the role of social support (i.e., social support, family support, community support, LGBT support, support, and engagement) in the transition to parenthood among LGB persons. Through a systematic review process conducted in May 2019 using PRISMA guidelines, the present study identified 22 manuscripts which accomplished all inclusion criteria. Our results suggested closer relationships to the family of origin and a detachment from the LGBT community in this stage of life cycle. Furthermore, the social support received in the transition to parenthood seems to influence not only the psychological well-being of these parents and prospective parents but also the quality of their relationships with different support networks. Thus, we understand that inclusive clinical and human professional interventions aimed at improving the available social support networks of LGB persons and, consequently, enhance their psychosocial well-being and family relations during this life transition. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This essay brings together political theories of empire and racial capitalism to clarify the entanglements between socialist and imperial discourse at the turn of the twentieth century. I show that white labor activists and intellectuals in the United States and the British settler colonies borrowed from imperial scripts to mark non-white workers as a threat. This discourse was thus both imperial and popular, because it absorbed the white working class into settler projects and enlisted its support in defense of imperial logics of labor control. While white workers’ demands of enfranchisement were part of a transnational imagination that was both imperial and narrowly emancipatory, this discourse reemerged as one of popular sovereignty and found channels and paths to institutionalization through national states. These institutional formations arose out of the encounter between capitalists interested in facilitating mobility of racialized laboring subjects around the globe, elite projects invested in sheltering settler spaces, and white workers concerned with protecting their own labor from competition by excluding exploitable non-white workers. White labor’s embrace of racial prejudice and the exclusion of workers of color created segregated labor spaces that fit neatly with both capitalist goals of labor control and the protection of the settler status of emerging polities. Bringing to the forefront the imperial genealogy of popular sovereignty and immigration control disrupts liberal political theory frameworks that condemn restrictions as well as those that find migration restrictions permissible. The analysis also illuminates contemporary immigration politics. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Hindu supremacist ideology and Hindu nationalism are recently resurgent in India's far-right government. This ideology has manifested itself in increased religious intolerance and human rights violations, including escalating oppression of religious and other minorities, journalists, civil rights advocates, and others. Using psychoanalytic theories of social trauma, groups, and prejudice, I link present-day disturbances to the profound social trauma engendered by the colonial occupation of India by the British in multiple forms for nearly 200 years. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study evaluated the main and interactive effects of social identity and cultural intelligence on the acculturative adaptation of an ethnic minority diaspora in India. This cross-sectional survey study (N = 246, 58.5% female, mean age = 26.7 years) focused on the dichotomy of ethnic and national aspects of social identity of the northeast Indian diaspora in Indian cities outside the northeastern region. Path analysis showed that identification of the national group predicted adaptation and cultural intelligence positively moderated that association. The ethnic identity had no main effects on adaptation and reported adaptive outcomes only through its interaction with cultural intelligence. This study reveals that pursuing bi-cultural identity is not a sufficient condition for adaptation, particularly in prejudiced acculturation contexts where the dominant social groups may not espouse multiculturalism. Here, cultural intelligence is a vital skill that facilitates adaptive outcomes of an integrated bi-cultural identity for ethnic minority groups. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Even when overt sexism and prejudice become rarer, social norms that perpetuate inequality are remarkably persistent. The present research lays out one of the subtle ways in which sexist norms may spread through society, by pointing to the role of responses to sexism. We investigate how third parties infer social norms about sexism when observing social interactions. In three studies among male students (Studies 1 and 2) and male and female students (Study 3), we demonstrate that subtle variations in how people respond to a sexist statement can have a substantial influence on inferences third parties make about sexist norms. Specifically, when a sexist statement is made and the conversation continues in a smoothly flowing fashion, third parties infer that this opinion is shared among interaction partners, perceived as appropriate, and that sexism is normative among them. However, when a sexist statement is followed by a brief silence that disrupts the flow of the conversation, observers think that it is contentious and that sexism is neither shared nor normative. Importantly, the effects of the manipulation generalized to the perception of sexist descriptive norms among male students in general. We conclude that social and cultural norms are not just inferred from conversation content, but also from conversational flow. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Perspective taking is conceptualized as the ability to consider or adopt the perspective of another individual who is perceived to be in need; it has shown mixed results in stereotype reduction and intergroup attitude change across many social science disciplines. The inconsistent results raise concerns about the robustness of the perspective-taking phenomenon. The present study uses p-curve analysis to examine whether evidential value existed among two sets of published experimental studies where perspective taking was operationalized in two different paradigms. Despite low statistical power, we found that both sets of studies revealed some evidential value of the effects of perspective taking. The theoretical and methodological implications of perspective-taking studies are discussed as well. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - It is often assumed that trolling is an intentional action. The aim of the paper is to argue for a form of unintentional trolling. Firstly, we outline minimal conditions for intentional actions. Secondly, an unintentional trolling example is introduced. Thirdly, we will show that in some cases, an utterance can be expressive, while it is perceived as descriptive. On the basis of the justification-suppression model, we argue that the introduced trolling example is such a case. In order to bypass social sanctions for expressing prejudices, agents unintentionally express their prejudices through stories that appear to be descriptive. Thereby, the characterized behavior does not fulfill the minimal conditions for intentional action. Fourthly, we give criteria that can be used to identify unintentional trolls. Finally, after unintentional trolling is analyzed, the trolls’ behavioral goals are considered. In conclusion, an analysis of unintentional trolling is given, which has explanatory benefits in contrast to the classic intentional trolling concepts. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study examined short- and long-term effects of ethnic classroom diversity for intergroup relations in adolescence. Using a five-year panel of Swedish majority youth (MageT1 = 13.40, MageT5 = 17.30), we found only limited direct effects of classroom diversity on anti-immigrant attitudes. However, classroom diversity increased the likelihood of cross-ethnic friendships, which in turn was associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant attitudes. Moreover, we found that the effect of classroom diversity on friendships remained also after adolescents transitioned to new schools. The findings highlight the importance of longitudinal analyses and contribute to a deeper understanding of how intergroup relations develop during adolescence. It brings new insights related to the longevity of classroom effects and to cross-ethnic friendships’ ability to mediate the diversity–attitudes relationship. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This study examined relations between parental racial socialization messages (i.e., egalitarianism, racemute, and preparation for bias) and racial attitudes in a sample of 282 White young adults (ages 18–22) in the United States. Egalitarianism messages were positively related to warmth toward racial outgroup members, whereas preparation for bias was negatively related to warmth toward racial outgroup members. In both cases the relation between racial socialization and racial attitudes was mediated by internal motivation to respond without prejudice and fairness/reciprocity moral orientation. Contrary to our expectations, racemute socialization messages were not directly related to participants’ warmth toward racial outgroup members. However, racemute socialization predicted internal motivation to respond without prejudice and fairness/reciprocity moral orientation, which in turn predicted outgroup warmth. These findings suggest possible mechanisms by which parents’ messages about race and racism may shape youths’ racial attitudes. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Against the backdrop of an increase in reported hate crimes, we present the development of a U.K.-focussed instrument designed to evaluate the nature of public beliefs about hate crime, legislation, offenders and victims. In Study 1, 438 participants completed an Anglicized version of the Hate Crime Beliefs Scale (HCBS). Factor analyses revealed three subfactors: Denial (high scores represent a denial of hate crime severity and need for legislation), Compassion (high score reflect compassion toward victims and affected communities) and Sentencing (higher scores reflect more punitive attitudes). In Study 2 (N = 134) we show that scores on Denial are positively associated with those on Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), ideologies known to be associated with prejudice. Compassion was negatively associated with these ideologies. Mediation analyses showed that Big Five personality traits Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness predicted Denial and Compassion via RWA, whereas Agreeableness and Openness predicted scores via SDO, consistent with a dual-process motivation model of hate crime beliefs. Results are discussed in terms of the nature of hate crime beliefs and the importance of understanding public attitudes which may support undesirable social norms and influence jury decision making in trials of hate related offenses. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Over the past two decades, political scientists have demonstrated that racial animus among white Americans is increasingly associated with evaluations of presidential candidates. Like most work on white racial attitudes, these efforts have focused almost exclusively on the out-group attitudes whites possess toward racial and ethnic minorities. Work in social psychology, however, suggests that intergroup attitudes are usually comprised of both an out-group and an in-group component. Nevertheless, political scientists have tended to overlook or dismiss the possibility that whites’ in-group attitudes are associated with political evaluations. Changing demographic patterns, immigration, the historic election of Obama, and new candidate efforts to appeal to whites as a collective group suggest a need to reconsider the full nature and consequences of the racial attitudes that may influence whites’ electoral preferences. This study, therefore, examines the extent to which both white out-group racial resentment and white in-group racial identity matter in contemporary electoral politics. Comparing the factors associated with vote choice in 2012 and 2016, and candidate evaluations in 2018, this study finds that both attitudes were powerfully associated with candidate evaluations in 2012 and early 2016, although white out-group attitudes overshadowed the electoral impact of in-group racial attitudes by the 2016 general election. The results suggest that there are now two independent racial attitudes tied to whites’ political preferences in the contemporary U.S., and understanding the dynamics of white racial animus and white racial identity across electoral contexts continues to be an important avenue for future work. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Demands on the teacher workforce are changing as one quarter of children in U.S. schools live in immigrant families and about half of students are racial/ethnic minorities. Simultaneously, diminishing teacher support and teacher shortages cause reliance on alternative certification programs (e.g., Teach for America). In response, we studied the links between color-blind racial attitudes and culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy and outcome expectations with immigrant students among 323 teachers completing an alternative program. Results from a moderated mediation model based on social cognitive career theory demonstrated that color-blind racial attitudes were significantly negatively associated with teaching outcome expectations with immigrants. In addition, the link between color-blind attitudes and self-efficacy was positive and significant only for Asian/Asian American teachers, and the link between self-efficacy and outcome expectations was significant for Latinx and Asian/Asian American teachers, and White teachers. We discuss implications for supporting teachers’ career development in schools serving immigrants of color. © Curators of the University of Missouri 2020.

AB  - This study examined how a diverse group of sexual and gender minority (SGM) homeless youth described and understood their victimization experiences occurring before they were homeless and those occurring after they were homeless and engaging in survival sex. In addition, the study explored how these youths manifested resilience when living on the street. The sample consisted of 283 racially/ethnically diverse youth between the ages of 15 and 26 years (M = 19.6, SD = 1.28) living in a large U.S. city. Participants identified their gender as male (47%), female (36%), transgender (15%), or queer and other (3%) and their sexual orientation as bisexual (37%), gay (23%), lesbian (15%), heterosexual (13%), or queer and other (13%). Thirty-seven percent identified as Black, 30% as multiracial, 22% as Latino/a, 5% as White, and 5% as another race. Content and thematic analyses were used to conduct a secondary analysis of qualitative data. Four themes were identified: unsafe and unsupported at home; barriers to housing and employment stability; ongoing victimization and lack of protection; and unexpected opportunities for resilience. Findings demonstrated that participants experienced victimization related not only to their SGM identities but also to chaotic home environments. Once homeless and engaging in survival sex, youth experienced barriers to securing employment and housing as well as victimization by police and clients. These experiences frequently involved prejudice related to their intersecting identities. Despite encountering numerous challenges, participants described surviving on the streets by living openly and forming relationships with other youth. Implications for practice and policy are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Objective: Early childhood is an important developmental period to focus on the outcomes associated with ethnic-racial identity (ERI) given that children notice racial differences, are processing information about ethnicity and race, and have race-related experiences. The present study tested whether three components of ERI (i.e., positive attitudes, negative attitudes, and centrality) predicted children’s social functioning (i.e., interactive, disruptive, and disconnected play with peers; externalizing behaviors; and observed frustration and cooperation with an adult). Child sex was also tested as a moderator. Method: The present study included 182 5-year-old Mexican-origin children (57% male) of mothers who entered parenthood during adolescence (M = 21.95, SD = 1.00). Results: Children’s positive ethnic-racial attitudes were associated with greater social functioning (i.e., greater interactive play and less externalizing behaviors) among boys and girls, and less frustration among boys. Negative ethnic-racial attitudes predicted maladaptive social functioning (i.e., greater disruptive play) among boys and girls and more disconnected play among girls. Contrary to expectations, ethnic-racial centrality predicted boys’ and girls’ maladaptive social functioning (i.e., greater disruptive and disconnected play). Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of fostering children’s positive ethnic-racial attitudes and helping them discuss and cope with negative ethnic-racial attitudes to promote more adaptive social functioning. © 2021.

AB  - Purpose: Immigration is considered a stressful process that causes many problems such as social isolation, prejudice, unemployment, minority status and intergenerational tensions. This study aims to determine the opinions of the leaders of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Germany about the experiences of individuals who immigrated from Turkey to Germany. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a qualitative method was used. This study was conducted between April and May 2014 with leaders of CSOs who were living in Germany. Informed consent forms were signed by all the participants. Purposeful sampling was used to select the leaders of CSOs to be included in the sample. In-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview format. The data reached saturation for the 30 leaders of CSOs. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and evaluated through thematic analysis. Findings: Four main themes were identified: “Difficulties experienced”, “Recommendations to cope with/solve the difficulties experienced,” “Medical tourism” and “Use of health services.” Research limitations/implications: This study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration during the interpretation of the results. A majority of the leaders of CSOs had bachelor’s degrees, and were middle-aged and older, which might affect the variety required in qualitative studies. Thus, it remains unclear whether the results could be generalized to all Turkish immigrants in Germany. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first qualitative study conducted with different Turkish CSO leaders living in Germany. This study outlines perspectives of CSO leaders’ migration-related challenges that Turkish immigrants struggle with to integrate into German societies. As a consequence, Turkish immigrants’ socio-cultural values, beliefs, difficulties they experienced, and legal rights should be taken into consideration in health care and tourism interactions. Possible found experiences could help to provide evidence on how to improve migrants’ situations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the wake of ‘Black Lives Matter’, this paper examines the concept of testimonial injustice and the prejudicial stances held towards victims that diminishes the credibility of their claims and the social support they receive from the public. To explore this concept, the following work revisits the widely parodied U.S. originating broadcast news report, The Bed Intruder. In the broadcast, victims of a home invasion and attempted rape deliver a public call that outlines the conditions of their victimhood and the potential threat to the community. A rhetorical stylistic analysis of the victims’ testimonial discourse and a thematic analysis of a sample of YouTube videos that reappropriate and parody their discourse are conducted. The analyses highlight the memetic elements of the video parodies that acknowledge the victimisation and yet strategically misconstrue events in ways that 1) render the victims and their claims less credible and 2) fail to provide them with the moral concern such an acknowledgement deserves. © 2021, equinox publishing.

AB  - Purpose: Despite more than half a century of academic research, relatively few methods have been shown to reliably improve intergroup relations in the real world. This paper aims to use a social marketing approach to design a pro-diversity intervention in a university setting. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted extensive qualitative, quantitative and observational background research to identify elements that would increase the effectiveness of the intervention. Focus groups and surveys allowed us to identify a target audience, target behaviors and the relevant barriers and benefits. Findings: The background research suggested increasing inclusive behavior would have a greater impact than reducing discriminatory behavior. Based on this research, this paper determined an optimal target audience was students who had relatively positive attitudes toward diversity but engaged in few inclusive behaviors. This paper used relevant theories from the behavioral sciences to design an intervention that promoted a small set of inclusive behaviors and that addressed the relevant barriers and benefits. The intervention took the form of a single page of targeted messages that instructors can add to their course syllabi. The page communicates injunctive and descriptive norms, highlights the benefits of behaving inclusively and provides concrete behavioral advice. Originality/value: The research applies the social marketing approach to a novel domain. This approach represents a new way to advance diversity, equity and inclusion through promoting inclusive and reducing discriminatory behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Historically, literacy education and research have been dominated by white supremacist narratives that marginalize and deficitize the literate practices of Black students. As anti-Blackness proliferates in US schools, Black youth suffer social, psychological, intellectual, and physical traumas. Despite relentless attacks of anti-Blackness, Black youth fight valiantly through a range of creative outlets, including multimodal compositions, that enable them to move beyond negative stereotypes, maintain their creativity, and manifest the present and future lives they desire and so deeply deserve. Design/methodology/approach: This study aims to answer the question “How do Black students' multimodal renderings demonstrate creativity and love in ways that disrupt anti-Blackness?” The authors critically examine four multimodal compositions created by Black elementary and middle school students to understand how Black youth author a more racially just society and envision self-determined, joyful futures. The authors take up Black Livingness as a theoretical framework and use visual methodologies to analyze themes of Black life, love and hope in the young people’s multimodal renderings. Findings: The findings suggest that Black youth creatively compose multimodal renderings that are humanizing, allowing their thoughts, feelings and experiences to guide their critiques of the present world and envision new personal and societal futures. The authors conclude with a theorization of a Black Livingness Pedagogy that centers care for Black youth. Originality/value: Recognizing that “the creation and use of images [is] a practice of decolonizing methodology” (Brown, 2013, loc. 2323), the authors examine Black student-created multimodal compositional practices to understand how Black youth author a more racially just society and envision self-determined, joyful futures. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The Italian historiographical tradition on the reception of Maria Montessori has highlighted the widespread misunderstanding that she faced in Italy, often accompanied by prejudicial devaluation, if not by actual personal attacks. Within this critical panorama, stronger resistance was exhibited by Catholics and Neo-Kantians than by Idealists, and in particular Gentile and Lombardo-Radice showed deep appreciation for Montessori, offering her remarks that were rather interesting from a pedagogical standpoint – and are still to be considered thoroughly if we wish to approach her method critically. Furthermore, Lombardo-Radice also brought into the Italian debate a series of international criticisms that had the same tone and content as those addressed to her by the intellectuals involved in the new school movement, as evidenced by an analysis of the articles that Ferrière published in the magazine Pour l’Ère Nouvelle during the 1920s. By doing so Lombardo-Radice confirmed his divergence from Gentile and his proximity to the progressive school movement. © 2021, University of Bologna. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, social stigma towards COVID-19 infection has become a major component of public discourse and social phenomena. As such, we aimed to develop and validate the COVID-19 Public Stigma Scale (COVID-PSS). Design and setting National-based survey cross-sectional study during the lockdown in Thailand. Participants We invited the 4004 adult public to complete a set of measurement tools, including the COVID-PSS, global fear of COVID-19, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, Bogardus Social Distance Scale, Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index. Methods Factor structure dimensionality was constructed and reaffirmed with model fit by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and non-parametric item response theory (IRT) analysis. Psychometric properties for validity and reliability were tested. An anchor-based approach was performed for classifying the proper cut-off scores. Results After factor analysis, IRT analysis and test for model fit, we created the final 10-item COVID-PSS with a three-factor structure: Stereotype, prejudice and fear. Face and content validity were established through the public and experts' perspectives. The COVID-PSS was significantly correlated (Spearman rank, 95% CI) with the global fear of COVID-19 (0.68, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.70), perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (0.79, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.80) and the Bogardus Social Distance Scale (0.50, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.53), indicating good convergent validity. The correlation statistics between the COVID-PSS and the Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index were <0.2, supporting the discriminant validity. The reliability of the COVID-PSS was satisfactory, with good internal consistency (Cronbach's α of 0.85, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.86) and test-retest reproducibility (intraclass correlation of 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.96). The proposed cut-off scores were as follows: No/minimal (≤18), moderate (19-25) and high (≥26) public stigma towards COVID-19 infection. Conclusions The COVID-PSS is practical and suitable for measuring stigma towards COVID-19 in a public health survey. However, cross-cultural adaptation may be needed. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - With the availability of antiretroviral therapy, more children living with HIV live longer than before and grow into young adulthood. This study examined the concerns of youth about disclosure of an HIV diagnosis to their sexual partners and attempted to gain an understanding of their HIV status disclosure experiences, views, and plans. A focused ethnography was undertaken. Using semi-structured interviews, data were collected from 20 youth between the ages of 15 and 24 years who were attending an HIV clinic. The findings highlight that youth generally struggled to disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners. The most frequent reasons for concealing their HIV status was fear of relationship termination, being unmarried, and fear that their sexual partners may reveal their HIV diagnosis to the community, thereby predisposing them to stigmatization, discrimination, and prejudice. There is a need to develop and strengthen HIV disclosure support groups for youth to help them develop life skills for overcoming HIV-related stigma. © 2021 Elsevier USA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives. To examine the relationship between city-level structural stigma pertaining to sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) and completeness of patient SOGI data collection at US federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Methods. We used the Human Rights Campaign's Municipal Equality Index to quantify city-level structural stigma against sexual and gender minority people in 506 US cities across 49 states. We ascertained the completeness of SOGI data collection at FQHCs from the 2018 Uniform Data System, which describes FQHC patient demographics and service utilization. We included FQHCs in cities captured by the structural stigma index in multinomial generalized linear mixed models to examine the relationship between city-level structural stigma and SOGI data completeness. Results. FQHCs in cities with more protective sexual orientation nondiscrimination policies reported more complete patient sexual orientation data (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2, 2.1). This association was also found for gender identity nondiscrimination policies and gender identity data collection (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.3, 2.2). Conclusions. Municipal sexual and gender minority nondiscrimination laws are associated with social and municipal environments that facilitate patient SOGI data collection.(Am J Public Health. 2021;111(11):2059-2063. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306414).

AB  - Mini-Med Schools (MiMS) are an opportunity for health sciences and social work undergraduates to discuss health-related topics with Innu and Atikamekw youth in Canada. More than 500 undergraduates and 1,000 students have taken part in the project since its beginning in 2011. This study aims to assess the impact of both 1) MiMS’s predeparture training and 2) the MiMS themselves on undergraduates’ prejudices toward Indigenous peoples. Satisfaction of the undergraduates taking part in the activity was also assessed. Seventy-eight undergraduates were recruited and completed the Old-fashioned and Modern Prejudiced Attitudes Toward Aboriginals Scales (O-PATAS and M-PATAS) at baseline, after the pre-departure training, and after the MiMS. They also completed satisfaction surveys. This study shows a reduction of prejudices after participating to a MiMS, but no effect of a pre-departure training. The activities were overall appreciated by undergraduates and most of them would like to take part again in the MiMS. © Meharry Medical College.

AB  - Background Current data indicates 70% of adults with obesity report experiencing bias and stigmatisation when engaging with healthcare. Most studies to date, have focused on weight bias from a healthcare professional’s perspective. Few have explored weight bias from the perspective of the individual living with obesity and no study has conducted this research in the Irish context. Aims This study explored, the lived-in experience of individuals afflicted with obesity, when interacting with the Irish healthcare system. It examined whether participants encountered weight bias and stigma, if so, how it may have impacted them and gathered their suggestions on how it could be best addressed. Methods Employing a phenomenological approach, purposive sampling and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 individuals living with class II (BMI 35.0–39.9) or III obesity (BMI ≥40kg/m2) who reported regular and consistent engagement with the Irish healthcare system. Predominant emergent themes were categorised using the interview domains; (1) experiences of obesity bias and stigma, (2) impact of this bias and stigma and (3) suggested avenues to reduce bias and stigma. Findings Participants reported experiencing high levels of weight bias and stigmatisation. Relating to experiences, three themes were identified; interpersonal communication, focus of care and physical environment. In terms of its impact, there were two emergent themes; negativity towards future healthcare and escalation of unhealthy behaviours. Suggested avenues to eliminate bias and stigma included the introduction of a timely and clear clinical pathway for obesity management and a focus on HCPs education in relation to obesity causes and complexity. Conclusions Outside of specialist obesity tertiary care, weight bias and stigmatisation is commonly reported in the Irish healthcare system. It is a significant issue for those living with obesity, detrimental to their physiological and psychological health. A concerted effort by HCPs across clinical, research and educational levels is required to alleviate its harmful effects. Copyright: © 2021 O’Donoghue et al.

AB  - Generics (e.g., “Dogs bark”) are thought by many to lead to essentializing: to assuming that members of the same category share an internal property that causally grounds shared behaviors and traits, even without evidence of such a shared property. Similarly, generics are thought to increase generalizing, that is, attributing properties to other members of the same group given evidence that some members of the group have the property. However, it is not clear from past research what underlies the capacity of generic language to increase essentializing and generalizing. Is it specific to generics, or are there broader mechanisms at work, such as the fact that generics are terms that signal high proportions? Study 1 (100 5–6 year-olds, 140 adults) found that neither generics, nor high-proportion quantifiers (“most,” “many”) elicited essentializing about a novel social kind (Zarpies). However, both generics and high-proportion quantifiers led adults and, to a lesser extent, children, to generalize, with high-proportion quantifiers doing so more than generics for adults. Specifics (“this”) did not protect against either essentializing or generalizing when compared to the quantifier “some.” Study 2 (100 5–6 year-olds, 112 adults) found that neither generics nor visual imagery signaling high proportions led to essentializing. While generics increased generalizing compared to specifics and visual imagery signaling both low and high proportions for adults, there was no difference in generalizing for children. Our findings suggest high-proportion quantifiers, including generics, lead adults, and to some extent children, to generalize, but not essentialize, about novel social kinds. © 2021 Cognitive Science Society LLC

AB  - The present study used EEG/ERPs to detect the activation of implicit stereotypical representations associated to other-race (OR) people and the modulation of such activation through the previous presentation of positive vs. neutral social information. Electrophysiological signals were recorded in 40 Italian Caucasian participants, unaware of the overall study's purpose. They were presented with 285 sentences that could either violate, non-violate (e.g., "the Roma girl was involved in a robbery) or be neutral with regard to stereotypical concepts concerning other-race people (e.g. Asians, Africans, Arabic). ERPs were timelocked to the terminal words. Prior to the sentence reading task, participants were exposed to a 10 minutes colourful video documentary. While the experimental group was presented a video containing images picturing other-race characters involved in "prestigious"activities that violated stereotypical negative assumptions (e.g. a black neurosurgeon leading a surgery team), the control group viewed a neutral documentary about flora and fauna. EEG signals were then recorded during the sentence reading task to explore whether the previous exposure to the experimental video could modulate the detection of incongruence in the sentences violating stereotypes, as marked by the N400 response. A fictitious task was adopted, consisted in detecting rare animal names. Indeed, only the control group showed a greater N400 response (350-550 ms) to words incongruent with ethnic stereotypes compared to congruent and neutral ones, thus suggesting the presence of a racial bias. No N400 response was found for the experimental group, suggesting a lack of negative expectation for OR individuals. The swLORETA inverse solution, performed on the prejudicerelated N400 showed that the Inferior Temporal and the Superior and Middle Frontal Gyri were the strongest N400 intra-cortical sources. Regardless of the experimental manipulation, Congruent terminal words evoked a greater P300 response (500-600 ms) compared to incongruent and neutral ones and a late frontal positivity (650-800 ms) was found to be larger to sentences involving OR than own-race characters (either congruent or incongruent with the prejudice) thus possibly indicating bias-free perceptual in-group/out-group categorization processes. The data showed how it is possible to modulate a pre-existing racial prejudice (as reflected by N400 effect) through exposure to positive media-driven information about OR people. Further follow-up studies should determine the duration in time, and across contexts, of this modulatory effect. © 2021 Brusa et al.

AB  - Using cross-sectional (n = 340) and longitudinal data (n = 208) collected during the European refugee crisis of 2015, this study examined elementary school teachers' role in the supportive attitudes toward refugees of their students. We focused on teachers' self-reported multicultural attitudes, students' reports of teachers' anti-prejudice norms and their relational closeness to the teacher. Using multilevel analyses, we found that teachers' multicultural attitudes predicted more supportive attitudes toward refugees in October 2015 and an increase in supportive attitudes by February 2016 (Wave 3). We also found cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence for a positive effect of perceived closeness to the teacher. We did not find positive cross-sectional effects of teachers' anti-prejudice norms, and we found negative relations over time. These relations were stronger in classrooms with relatively more non-majority students, presumably due to increased threat perceptions. It is very important for teachers to be aware of such possible adverse effects. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Early intervention for children with ASD can help to improve their intellectual ability and reduces autistic symptoms. Multiple clinical researches have suggested that facial phenotypic differences exist between ASD children and typically developing (TD) children. In this research, we propose a practical ASD screening solution using facial images through applying VGG16 transfer learning-based deep learning to a unique ASD dataset of clinically diagnosed children that we collected. Our model produced a 95% classification accuracy and 0.95 F1-score. The only other reported study using facial images to detect ASD was based on the Kaggle ASD Facial Image Dataset, which is an internet search-produced, low-quality, and low-fidelity dataset. Our results support the clinical findings of facial feature differences between children with ASD and TD children. The high F1-score achieved indicates that it is viable to use deep learning models to screen children with ASD. We concluded that the racial and ethnic-related factors in deep-learning based ASD screening with facial images are critical to solution viability and accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This paper explores how Australian gay men experience gender and sexuality in relation to heteronormative gender norms, specifically masculinity. A sample of 32 gay men 22–72 years of age participated in an online interview, using a videoconferencing software, on masculinity and homosexuality. Thematic analyses revealed that gay men experience gender and sexuality-related strain across all levels of their socioecological environment through social regulation, homophobic discrimination/harassment, and anti-effeminacy prejudice. The gay men expressed feelings of self-loathing, shame, internalized homonegativity, and isolation as a result. In examining interactions at each level of the socioecological environment, future research and practice may gain understanding in the social phenomena and how to ameliorate such strain. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This article argues that it is not Buddhism, per se, but rather Buddhist extremism, that is responsible for violence against relevant out-groups. Moreover, it suggests that the causes of Buddhist extremism, rather than being determined solely by textual and scriptural justifications for out-group violence, are rooted instead in the intersection between social psychology and theology, rather than organically arising from the latter, per se. This article unpacks this argument by a deeper exploration of Theravada Buddhist extremism in Sri Lanka. It argues that religious extremism, including its Buddhist variant, is best understood as a fundamentalist belief system that justifies structural violence against relevant out-groups. A total of seven of the core characteristics of the religious extremist are identified and employed to better grasp how Buddhist extremism in Sri Lanka manifests itself on the ground. These are: the fixation with maintaining identity supremacy; in-group bias; out-group prejudice; emphasis on preserving in-group purity via avoidance of commingling with the out-group; low integrative complexity expressed in binary thinking; dangerous speech in both soft-and hard-modes; and finally, the quest for political power, by force if needed. Future research could, inter alia, explore how these seven characteristics also adequately describe other types of religious extremism. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The lack of diversity in surgical career pathways impacts the cultural competence of the learning and working environment, the variety of leadership styles found within surgical leadership, and the ability of an organization to achieve equity in the workplace due to ongoing mistrust and untouched bias. Leading mitigating factors include developing pathways for greater numbers of diverse people at the high school and college level and implicit bias training. Though educators have had some success with these factors in the initial stages of diversifying early pathways, these factors are not yet correlated to entry into a surgical career. Future solutions to the lack of diversity in surgery will be predicated on surgeons collectively valuing justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - History can inconspicuously repeat itself through words and language. We explored the association between the “Black” and “African American” racial labels and the ideologies of the historical movements within which they gained prominence (Civil Rights and Black Power, respectively). Two content analyses and two preregistered experimental studies (N = 1,204 White American adults) show that the associations between “Black” and “bias and discrimination” and between “African American” and “civil rights and equality” are evident in images, op-eds, and perceptions of organizations. Google Images search results for “Black people” evoke more racially victimized imagery than search results for “African American people” (Study 1), and op-eds that use the Black label contain more bias and discrimination content than those that use the African American label (Study 2). Finally, White Americans infer the ideologies of organizations by the racial label within the organization’s name (Studies 3 and 4). Consequently, these inferences guide the degree to which Whites support the organization financially. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background and objectives: One important forensic activity is the assessment of aesthetic injuries where expert criteria and analysis are insufficiently outlined due to the subjective elements related to the traumatized victim. Unaesthetic morphological changes may occur due to various circumstances committed under the Penal Code, resulting in permanent unaesthetic morphological scarring. Considering that most of the existing scales for the assessment of aesthetic prejudices refer only to morphometric changes, our aim was to create a modern method for the evaluation of aesthetic damage that also considers its social and psychological consequences. Materials and Methods: In this study, we developed the Mekereș Psychosocial Internalization Scale (MPIS), which proposes a clear boundary between the presence or absence of aesthetic damage. The traumatized person is evaluated after a minimum of six months (in the case of an average scar, necessary for defining the character of the scar) to assess changes in the physiognomy or even alterations in the victim’s aesthetic perception of their own body. Our study was conducted on 103 patients with scars, and the results were compared to 101 controls (subjects without scars). Results: Individuals with scars have a distorted perception (compared to controls) of the support provided by significant people [t (202) = 2.473; p = 0.01]. Hypothetically, they will most likely exhibit a nuanced socio-cognitive and psycho-emotional vulnerability that may be the source of future dysfunctions. The fidelity of the MPIS scale was estimated by employing Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, resulting in a value of 0.934 (15 items). The exploratory factorial analysis with Varimax rotation mode sustains a single dominant factor, indicating a good internal consistency. The results of this study provide evidence regarding the psychosocial or psychometric worthiness of MPIS. Conclusions: MPIS can be used for research and as an instrument to assess aesthetic damage or disfigurement by forensic physicians and lawyers. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Breakfast is considered an important meal, especially for people who are about to com-mence a long or demanding workday, and for roles that may involve physical tasks and a require-ment to remain alert and vigilant in potentially high‐risk situations. This study looks at breakfast consumption influences within two workplace institutional settings, namely military and mining. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with military personnel (n = 12) and mining employees (n = 12) to understand their breakfast consumption behaviour at work and at home, and the associated behavioural influences. The interview questions were framed by social cognitive theory. Over-all, cognitive and environmental influences were the most prominent influences on breakfast con-sumption, less evident were behavioural influences. A negative stereotype of workplace institutional food services emerged as one of the most significant barriers to breakfast consumption for those already at work. Considerations of environmental influences on behaviour may need to be broadened beyond physical barriers and social influences, to include perceptions of the behavioural environment. Programs that aim to increase breakfast consumption must create areas where their employees want to go. Food systems need to ensure nutritious, quality, and appealing food is avail-able. Interventions need to increase participants’ knowledge, improve their attitudes, and create positive expectations for breakfast. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In U.S. society, Native Americans face invisibility, stereotypes, discrimination, and structural barriers. In this article, we employ a symbolic interactionist approach, embedded in critical analysis, to explore how this social context impacts the conveyance and interpretation of Native American identity among people who are not Native American. Participants, 213 White American and 104 Native American people, replied to open-ended questions about Native American identity conveyance and interpretation. We employed an inductive thematic approach to analyze their written replies. The majority of Native American participants discussed their identity in the context of limited public knowledge of, and/or oppression faced by, Native Americans. For most Native American participants, this context generated strain and struggle associated with conveyance and interpretation of their identities. Despite this, some Native American participants engaged in identity work to educate others and reduce oppression. Without prompting, some White participants expressed positive attitudes toward Native Americans and their identity revelation. These positive attitudes evidence both hope for social change and problematic fetishization based on romantic stereotypes of Native Americans. We argue that society-wide change is necessary to reduce strain in, and enhance the effectiveness of, identity work by Native American people. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The notion of accountability has language variants depending on whether one refers to the familiar language, of daily use, or to the specialized language, whether medical or legal; it also refers to a question on two modes of reasoning relating to causality. Accountability has a dual legal and social attribution meaning. The search for accountability is based on, which is part of a legal proceeding, is based on the application of seven criteria derived from the assessment of personal injury. It is the basis of medico-legal causality and differs from legal causality. Collective Psychogenic Phenomena (CPD) bring together diverse entities before which the search for accountability remains complex, the notion of causality remains difficult to establish. In these situations with multiple clinical contours, social treatment and the search for social adaptability are now preferred. © 2021

AB  - Objective: This study examines the improvement of U.S. natives’ social distance attitudes toward Southern, Central, and Eastern (SCE) European ancestry groups in the post-World-War II United States, applying the idea that prejudice against these groups was due to racial/ethnic prejudice and social class prejudice. Methods: Analyzing data from the Bogardus surveys and other published sources, the study tests the proposition that U.S. natives’ social distance attitudes toward SCE European ancestry groups improved because social class prejudice against these groups diminished as the groups’ educational attainment levels increased from the second- to third-generations. Results: Contrary to modernization and classical assimilation theories, the favorable trend in U.S. natives’ social distance attitudes toward SCE European ancestry groups was unaffected by the groups’ intergenerational educational mobility. Conclusion: The decline in prejudice against SCE European ancestry groups in the postwar United States resulted from a decrease in racial/ethnic prejudice against these groups, independently of social class prejudice. © 2021 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - In this review, we propose that the social dynamics of founder populations in novel and newly available environments can have critical effects in shaping species' sociality and can produce long-lasting changes in social structure and behavior. For founder populations which expand into an underexploited niche separated from the parent population, the necessity of bond formation with strangers, lack of clear territories, and initial abundance of resources can lead to altered initial social dynamics to which subsequent generations adapt. We call this the founder sociality hypothesis. After specifying the theoretical reasoning and mechanism of effect, we focus on three particular cases where the social dynamics of founder populations may have a central role in explaining their modern behavioral ecology. In particular, we develop and review evidence for three predictions of the founder sociality hypothesis in territorial, mixed-sex group forming species: relatively stronger social bonds in the dispersing sex with relatively weaker bonds in the nondispersing sex, reduced territoriality, and increased social tolerance. We briefly touch on the implications for human evolution given our species' evolutionary history marked by frequent expansion and adaptation to novel environments. We conclude by proposing several experiments and models with testable predictions following from the founder sociality hypothesis. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Across the world, it remains legal to discriminate against people because of their weight. Although US studies demonstrate public support for laws to prohibit weight discrimination, multinational research is scarce. The present study conducted a multinational comparison of support for legislative measures to address weight discrimination and bullying across six countries. Methods: Participants were adults (n = 13,996) enrolled in an international weight-management program and residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the US. Participants completed identical online surveys that assessed support for antidiscrimination laws and policies to address weight bullying, demographic characteristics, and personal experiences of weight stigma. Results: Across countries, support was high for laws (90%) and policies (92%) to address weight-based bullying, whereas greater between-country variation emerged in support for legislation to address weight-based discrimination in employment (61%, 79%), as a human rights issue (57%), and through existing disability protections (47%). Findings highlight few and inconsistent links between policy support and sociodemographic correlates or experienced or internalized weight stigma. Conclusions: Support for policies to address weight stigma is present among people engaged in weight management across Westernized countries; findings offer an informative comparison point for future cross-country research and can inform policy discourse to address weight discrimination and bullying. © 2021 The Obesity Society

AB  - When children return to school from juvenile detention, they face a severe stigma. We developed a procedure to orient educators and students toward each other as positive relationship partners during this period. In Study 1, through a structured exercise, students reentering school powerfully articulated to an educator of their choosing their prosocial hopes for school as well as challenges they faced. In a preliminary field trial (N = 47), presenting this self-introduction to this educator in a one-page letter via a third-party requesting the educator’s help reduced recidivism to juvenile detention through the next semester from 69% to 29%. In Study 2 (preregistered), the letter led experienced teachers (N = 349) to express greater commitment to, anticipate more success for, and feel more love and respect for a student beginning their reentry into school, potentially initiating a better trajectory. The results suggest how relationship-orienting procedures may sideline bias and make school more supportive for students facing stigma. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that majority group members in immigration-receiving societies express differential levels of prejudice and stereotyping toward various immigrant origins. However, there is little research on whether this tendency to differentiate between more vs. less liked immigrant groups is informed by essential psychological motivations and systematically related to individual differences. In this paper, I test whether majority group members’ propensity to express greater differences in affect toward immigrant origins is associated with social dominance orientation. Using survey studies carried out in the Netherlands, the United States, and Britain, I demonstrate that majority group members’ tendency to express differential affect toward immigrant origins holds across national contexts. I also show that individual-level inclination to differentiate between more and less liked immigrant groups is consistently related to social dominance orientation in all three countries. Overall, my findings confirm the group-specific character of anti-immigration attitudes and highlight the role of social-dominance motivations in prejudice toward immigrants. © 2021

AB  - Although schools have been described as an important socialization context for the development of intergroup attitudes, longitudinal multilevel studies are still rare within this field. This 3-wave study (with annual assessments) of German adolescents (N = 1292; Mage = 13.86; 51.8% female) examined the role of school experiences (perceived multicultural education, supportive peer relations in class, democratic classroom climate) in the development of youth’s negative attitudes toward immigrants. Longitudinal multilevel analyses revealed that a democratic classroom climate predicted youth’s attitudes at the individual level. At the classroom level class-average perceptions of a democratic classroom climate, supportive peer relations in class, and multicultural education (the latter solely among male, higher track students) were associated with less negative attitudes toward immigrants. In addition, age moderated the effect of school experiences on attitudes, showing that perceptions of a democratic climate at the classroom level mattered in particular among older adolescents. The findings suggest that school experiences are related to youth’s negative attitudes toward immigrants and can therefore help to reduce the risk of prejudice development. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transgender youth report high rates of negative experiences in schools. Using a lens of minority stress, this study sought to examine in-school experiences of transgender youth to understand youth coping and to identify key opportunities for improving school environments for transgender youth. METHODS: Participants included 41 youth across 33 in-depth interviews (Mage = 21.7) and two focus groups (N = 8; Mage = 17.3). Thematic analysis was used to analyze data. Themes related to stress, coping, and facilitators/barriers to stress/coping were derived and coded. RESULTS: Distal stressors, such as structural discrimination and prejudice events, were found to contribute to the exclusion of transgender youth from school life, while proximal stressors, such as concealment and expectations of rejection, reinforced transgender youth's feelings of personal isolation. Participants expressed coping with both challenges by advocating for inclusion through direct action with teachers and administrators and seeking/finding connection with trusted staff and peers. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that creating safe and supportive environments at school for transgender youth is an attainable goal, as all identified barriers to inclusivity and connection were modifiable. By considering the needs of transgender youth in policies and programming, schools may improve climate for and wellbeing of transgender students. © 2021 American School Health Association.

AB  - Empirical research on the impact of linguistic labels on social perceptions is scarce, especially in the context of ethnic groups. Across three studies (N = 1185), we investigated the impact of labels on perceptions of the Romani ethnic group by non-Romani participants in Serbia. In Study 1 (N = 244), we found some evidence that the Romani elicit more positive perceptions (more sociable and competent) when labeled with the neutral (vs. derogatory) term. In two follow-up studies, we focused on investigating potential mechanisms. In Study 2, we tested whether positive perceptions emerged via perceived higher status, while in Study 3 we focused on the motivation to respond without prejudice and sensitivity to hate speech. Study 2 (N = 467) replicated the labeling effect showing that Romani were perceived more positively (more sociable and moral) when labeled with the neutral term. However, we found no support for perceived group status as a mechanism. Study 3 (N = 474) did not corroborate the labeling effect but found the higher external motivation to respond without prejudice (potential mechanism). Meta-analytic effects showed that Romani were perceived as more moral, sociable, and competent when the neutral term was used. These effects were to some extent moderated by ideology as they existed only for right-wing individuals. We conclude that the effect is much smaller than the effects in previous comparable studies. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Ethnic-racial socialization is a mechanism through which immigrant parents instill in their children a sense of pride in their culture while preparing them for negative experiences with racial and cultural out-groups. For Black immigrant parents, this can include promoting a wariness of Black Americans in their children. Through this lens, we investigated an understudied intercultural dynamic via interviews with 12 first- and second-generation African and Caribbean immigrants. Using deductive and inductive analyses, we first examined the socialization messages they received about Black Americans from their parents, finding that in addition to messages inculcating ethnic and cultural pride, the participants also heard warnings about affiliation with Black Americans. Those messages relied on personal experiences and harmful stereotypes. Second, emergent from the data were examples of the ways the participants rejected their parents’ warnings. Experiences outside of the home appeared to influence views that were alternative to their parents. This novel finding provides avenues for future research investigating Black immigrants’ paths to a sense of connection or distancing from Black Americans. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Intergroup competitions such as democratic elections can intensify intergroup polarization and conflict. Partisan attitudes toward the elected leader can also shift from before to after an election, but the biology underlying these attitudinal shifts remains largely unknown. An important factor could be the hormone testosterone, which is theorized to fluctuate during competition and to influence status seeking. In a naturalistic study of 113 registered voters, we measured changes in testosterone levels and attitudes toward the winner of the 2012 US Presidential Election. We found that supporters of the losing candidate (Mitt Romney) showed acute increases in testosterone levels compared to supporters of the winner (Barack Obama) on the evening of Election Day. Supporters of the losing candidate also demonstrated flatter diurnal testosterone slopes on Election Day that persisted up to two days after the election. Furthermore, greater increases in acute testosterone levels and flatter diurnal slopes among supporters of the losing candidate were associated with less positive evaluations of the winning candidate. These testosterone-moderated attitudinal shifts observed in the days after the election showed a directionally similar pattern with a weaker effect size six months later. Finally, we confirmed that the main results were robust to alternative data analytic choices using multiverse specification curve analysis. The findings from this paper suggest that hormonal responses to large-scale intergroup competitions may shape how we perceive our elected leaders, shedding light on the biology of intergroup relations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - How have the white, middle-class, Eurocentric ideologies and practices of the Western psychoanalytic canon prepared us to make meaning of the complexities of our pluralistic world? Psychoanalysis has been criticized for its predominantly decontextualized and depoliticized perspectives that emphasize universal intrapsychic unconscious dynamics. In the context of a sociopolitically critical view of psychoanalytic theory and practice, I will reflect on what it means to keep conducting ‘business as usual’ in an era where movements like Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, as well as the health inequities that became apparent due to the Covid-19 pandemic are clear warning signs that our world is deeply troubled by injustice. I will argue that psychoanalytic theory and practice is not immune from this injustice. I will also contemplate aspects of a socially just psychoanalytic vision that may reverse decontextualizing, depoliticizing, and prejudicial trends using the principle of social thirdness, which expands traditional views of thirdness to include the patient's and therapist's embeddedness in the larger sociopolitical currents that inform and shape their engagement with each other. Reflecting on themes such as race, sexuality, gender, and sex/gender nonconformity, both the collapse and repair of social thirdness will be described and illustrated with relevant clinical examples. © 2021 BPF and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study examines the effects of national and cosmopolitan self-identity on xenophobic attitudes across 33 countries with a multilevel analysis of data from the National Identity Module III of the International Social Survey Programme. Of primary interest is how country contexts are intertwined with the sense of national belonging to predict individuals’ anti-immigrant attitudes. The study finds that individuals with a stronger ethnicity-based national identity tend to evidence stronger xenophobia. Net of the individual-level effect of ethnic national identity, citizens of countries with a higher average of ethnic national identity also tend to be more xenophobic. Interestingly, the link between ethnic national identity and xenophobia is stronger in countries where this perspective is not shared as strongly. In the seemingly more ‘open’ country context, individuals’ belief in the requirement of ancestral roots for national membership may entail stronger exclusivism as a fringe ideology. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Psychological models can only help improve intergroup relations if they accurately characterise the mechanisms underlying social biases. The claim that outgroups suffer dehumanization is near ubiquitous in the social sciences. We challenge the most prominent psychological model of dehumanization - infrahumanization theory - which holds outgroup members are subtly dehumanized by being denied human emotions. We examine the theory across seven intergroup contexts in thirteen pre-registered and highly powered experiments (N = 1690). We find outgroup members are not denied uniquely human emotions relative to ingroup members. Rather, they are ascribed prosocial emotions to a lesser extent but antisocial emotions to a greater extent. Apparent evidence for infrahumanization is better explained by ingroup preference, outgroup derogation and stereotyping. Infrahumanization theory may obscure more than it reveals about intergroup bias. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Young children often prefer people high in status and with access to resources. Children also favor fairness and equality, especially when it comes to sharing. Two studies examined how children (N = 185; age range = 4.0–6.9 years, Mage = 5.49 years; 45% White, 12% Asian, 11% Black, 7% Hispanic, 24% other or undisclosed) reconcile these conflicting preferences by investigating the relation between children's social preferences and resource allocations to White and Black children. Race provides an important case to examine how children resolve this conflict given that children show preferences for stereotypically high-status (White) people but also show awareness of systemic racial inequality that disadvantages Black people. In a costly sharing resource allocation task (i.e., Dictator Game) where participants were asked how much of a limited resource they wanted to share with a Black child and a White child, Study 1 revealed that participants sometimes chose to share more with a White child compared with a Black child but that biased giving was unrelated to children's biased feelings of warmth toward White children. Study 2 confirmed that biased giving was unrelated to children's feelings of warmth and instead implicated children's beliefs about race and wealth; children who expected White people to have more wealth showed more pro-White bias in their giving behavior. Together, these results suggest that cultural stereotypes about wealth might shape children's economic decision making in a way that perpetuates disadvantage, but they also indicate that the processes underlying resource allocation decisions warrant further study. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - LGB+ parented families in recent years are becoming more visible, but limited information exists about how professionals interact with people in these family forms. This study used the framework of intergroup contact theory to investigate whether contact with lesbians and gay men, same-sex couples, and same-sex parents respectively increase inclusive practices towards same-sex families, and whether this association is mediated by professionals' prejudice and endorsement of same-sex families' rights. A questionnaire with scales on: (a) intergroup contact, (b) professionals' orientation towards same-sex families' inclusive practices, (c) professionals' prejudices, and (d) support of same-sex couples' rights was administered to 460 professionals (9.8% males) working in social (N = 103), education (N = 156), and healthcare (N = 201) services in Italy. Path analysis was used to test the prediction that contact increases professionals' intention to embrace inclusive practices towards same-sex families through the mediation of both prejudice and support to same-sex couples' rights to have and raise children. Results showed that contact reduced prejudices towards same-sex families and increased the endorsement of same-sex families' rights, which in turn favoured professionals' willingness to modify their practices to include these family forms. Implications for the training and development of inclusive models are discussed.

AB  - The concept of epistemic (specifically testimonial) injustice is the latest philosophical tool with which to try to theorise what goes wrong when mental health service users are not listened to by clinicians, and what goes right when they are. Is the tool adequate to the task? It is argued that, to be applicable at all, the concept needs some adjustment so that being disbelieved as a result of prejudice is one of a family of alternative necessary conditions for its application, rather than a necessary condition all on its own. It is then argued that even once adjusted in this way, the concept does not fit well in the area where the biggest efforts have been made to apply it so far, namely the highly sensitive case of adult patients suffering from delusions. Indeed it does not serve the interests of service users struggling for recognition to try to apply it in this context, because there is so much more to being listened to than simply being believed. However, the concept is found to apply smoothly in many cases where the service users are children, for example, in relation to children's testimony on the efficacy of treatment. It is suggested that further research would demonstrate the usefulness of the concept in adult cases of a similar kind. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial re-use.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the ongoing pandemic of racial injustice. In the context of these twin pandemics, emergency medicine organizations are declaring that “Racism is a Public Health Crisis.” Accordingly, we are challenging emergency clinicians to respond to this emergency and commit to being antiracist. This courageous journey begins with naming racism and continues with actions addressing the intersection of racism and social determinants of health that result in health inequities. Therefore, we present a social-ecological framework that structures the intentional actions that emergency medicine must implement at the individual, organizational, community, and policy levels to actively respond to this emergency and be antiracist. © 2021 American College of Emergency Physicians

AB  - Although employees’ attitudes towards an autism employment programme may impact its ultimate success, there is limited research examining the implementation of these programmes from the perspective of non-autistic employees (i.e. co-workers and managers). This study explored the implementation of an Australian-based supported autism employment programme, drawing on qualitative data collected from 32 employees working with autistic trainees in the programme. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes. The programme benefits theme suggested that the employment programme and autistic trainees were generally viewed positively, with the programme benefitting both the trainees and the organisation, and leading to greater understanding of autism. However, negative attitudes and perceptions of special treatment contributed to programme challenges, which paralleled challenges that have been observed with other disability and diversity programmes. The design of this specific programme led to concerns about workforce integration, such as reduced opportunity for social and work integration into the broader workplace. This research extends the research on diversity management in the context of autism employment and provides practical insights into barriers and facilitators associated with implementing autism employment programmes. Lay abstract: We asked 32 employees who work alongside autistic trainees for their thoughts about the autism employment programme that is running in their company. Specifically, we analysed their responses to understand how the employees perceived the autism employment programme’s implementation and outcomes. How employees within an organisation view diversity, and the nature of specific programmes to increase the inclusion of certain groups of individuals (e.g. autistic employees) in their organisation, can impact the success of these programmes. Research in other organisations has suggested that diversity perspectives that fully support the inclusion of people with diverse backgrounds in the organisation lead to better outcomes. Thematic analysis of the responses in this study revealed that the views of the employees fit three main themes: programme benefits, programme challenges and concerns about workforce integration. The programme benefits theme suggested that the autism employment programme was viewed positively. However, negative attitudes and perceptions of special treatment contributed to programme challenges, which were similar to challenges that have been observed with other disability and diversity programmes. The design of this specific programme led to concerns about workforce integration, such as reduced opportunity for social and work integration into the broader workplace. This research extends the research on diversity management in the context of autism employment, and it provides practical understanding into ways in which organisational-based autism employment programmes are more and less successful. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Since the Stonewall uprisings, there has been greater social acceptance of homosexuality within Western contexts. Nevertheless, those who are at the intersection of more than one minority identity continue to face prejudice and discrimination, including homophobia and racism. Though there has been increasing work regarding the experiences of sexual minority people of colour (POC), a lacuna remains regarding the experiences of sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men and the integration of sexual minority and religious identities, particularly within a context of increased societal acceptance towards sexual minorities and societal Islamophobia. In this study, 38 sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men were recruited via snowball sampling and interviewed. Data were examined via reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: degrees of “outness”, hegemonic Whiteness and the LGBTQ+ community, internalisation of White hegemony, distancing from the sexual minority religio-cultural ingroup, and attempting to reconcile potential identity conflict between sexual orientation identity and religious and cultural identities. Respondents' experiences highlighted substantial social exclusion due to intersectional disadvantage as well as a lack of intra-community social support, suggesting substantial isolation, psychological implications and a general eschewing of identity affiliation based on sexual attraction. This has implications on services predicated on identity affiliation which may potentially exclude the needs of hidden and intersectionally disadvantaged populations. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This article examines the use of disparaging humour and slurs in Norwegian high school boys’ friendship groups to shed light on the complexity of adolescent males’ friendships and everyday socialization through a phenomenon that is usually connected to bullying. The study employed a qualitative approach consisting of participant observation and individual interviews with students. The article addresses the ambiguity embedded in the boys’ use of disparaging humour and slurs. The findings of this study suggest that the boys employ prejudiced and discriminatory language frequently with friends; however, the intent behind it is not linked to discriminatory or prejudiced attitudes or practices. Thus, adolescent boys utilize a form of humour where lines between harmful and harmless are blurred and inherently complex. The ambiguity of disparaging humour and slurs may cause challenges for teachers, and this article offers valuable new knowledge that may support them in their daily work. © 2021 SAGE Publications and Young Editorial Board.

AB  - In an attempt to address the paucity of research examining the childhood experience of people living with albinism within family context, the present study explored family-based violence and prejudicial treatments against children born with albinism in Nigeria. In addition, issues that traumatized children with albinism (CWA) within their family setting, and the coping strategies they found effective were identified. The research was located within an interpretive qualitative paradigm and framed within the theories of ‘othering,’ self-esteem, and family system. Interviews were conducted with 62 adults living with albinism who were raised in family settings. The prejudicial treatments and family-based violent behaviors experienced by participants were explored, and a thematic analysis of the narratives was carried out. Findings confirm the existence of family violence and prejudice regarding albinism. Prejudices on albinism were found to result in parents denying CWA of educational and vocational sponsorship, cordial family relationship, social interactions and attendance of social events. Family members’ perceptions of CWA were reportedly influenced by social and religious inclinations. Families were found not to be only violent with CWA but also facilitating institutional violence by religious organizations. Participants expressed developing emotional problems like paranoia, anger, depression, feelings of powerlessness, and low self-esteem, while they utilized varieties of emotion-oriented coping strategies during their childhood experiences. CWA are subjected to prejudice and violence within their families that are unique and deserving of research and policy interventions. Therefore, family-based orientations, screening for family violence, religious and social groups’ support for people living with albinism (PWA) were suggested. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The use of social robots in service scenarios (e.g. in hotels) is expected to increase. Research has indicated that realistic threat and identity threat contribute to prejudice, discrimination, and conflict. Therefore, designing smart robots that can understand user needs and provide prompt service is critical. This study aimed to explore the relationships among perceived threat, negative attitudes toward robots, and usage intention, and to discuss how anthropomorphism moderates the relationship between negative attitudes and usage intention toward robots. We hypothesized that realistic threat and identity threat positively influence negative attitudes toward social robots; such negative attitudes have negative effects on usage intention; and anthropomorphism positively moderates said effect. A between-subjects factorial research design was employed; participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions of robot anthropomorphic appearance. The stimuli were two pictures of service robots—one with a humanoid appearance and one without. After viewing one of the stimuli, participants filled in a questionnaire that assessed the realistic threat, identity threat, negative attitudes, and usage intention. When participants perceived the robot’s appearance to be highly anthropomorphic, their negative attitudes toward it had a stronger negative effect on their usage intention than when they considered the appearance less anthropomorphic. Both identity threat and realistic threat significantly increased negative attitudes toward the robots; thus, the public’s willingness to use these robots would be negatively affected. This study recommends that robotics companies consider how to decrease people’s perceived realistic and identity threats as well as adjust robots’ anthropomorphic appearance to people’s tastes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - During the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, it was crucial that providers take steps to protect patients by managing HIV with the perspective of 'HIV exceptionalism'. However, in 2020, the social and historical barriers erected by this concept, as demonstrated in this patient's case, are considerably impeding progress to end the epidemic. With significant medical advances in HIV treatment and prevention, the policies informed by HIV exceptionalism now paradoxically perpetuate stigma and inequities, particularly for people of colour. To improve overall HIV care, the medical community must move past HIV exceptionalism by liberalising diagnostics, instituting clinician implicit bias training and advocating to fully decriminalise HIV non-disclosure. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - Negative stereotypes about atheists are widespread, robust, rooted in distrust, and linked to discrimination. Here, we examine whether social perceivers in the United States might additionally hold any positive stereotypes about atheists (and corresponding negative stereotypes of the religious). Experiments 1 (N = 401) and 2 (N = 398, preregistered) used methods of intuitive stereotypes (the conjunction fallacy). People tended to stereotype atheists as fun, open-minded, and scientific—even as they harbor extreme intuitive anti-atheist prejudice in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 (N = 382) used a quasi-behavioral partner-choice paradigm, finding that most people choose atheist (vs. religious) partners in stereotype-relevant domains. Overall, results suggest that people simultaneously possess negative and also positive stereotypes about atheists, but that corresponding negative stereotypes of the religious may be even stronger. These effects are robust among the nonreligious and somewhat religious, but evidence is mixed about whether the highly religious harbor these positive stereotypes. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Both straight (i.e., heterosexual) and gay/lesbian individuals still question and erase bisexual identities. Skeptics contend that people adopt bisexual identities for strategic motivations, such as avoiding the stigma associated with identifying as gay, or for attention-seeking purposes. Across two studies, self-identified gay (N = 168), straight (N = 237), and bisexual (N = 231) participants completed a sexual identity Implicit Association Test, a measure that can provide insight into automatic associations and lessen the influence of impression management strategies. All three groups displayed implicit sexual identities that were consistent with their self-ascribed identities. Gay men and lesbians implicitly identified as more gay and less bisexual than bisexual men and women, who in turn identified as less straight and more bisexual than straight men and women. These findings show that self-reported sexual identities converge with implicit identities and have implications for understanding the psychology of sexual orientation. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: Although knowledge is a crucial component in contact theory delineating how prejudice changes toward out-groups with stigmatized conditions, little is known about the mediating role of knowledge on contact, stigmatizing attitudes, and behaviors toward mental illness. Aim: This study aimed to examine the mechanism underlie contact and stigma change by knowledge. Methods: A total of 366 participants including family members (FM), mental health providers (MHP), and community residents (CR) recruited across communities in Hong Kong and completed measures of contact level, contact quantity, contact quality, mental health related knowledge, prejudice, and discriminatory behaviors. Structural equation modeling was adopted to test the association among the key variables. Results: Higher level of contact was significantly correlated with better knowledge, less prejudice, and less discriminatory behaviors. Knowledge was directly and negatively correlated with prejudicial attitudes but was not significantly related to discriminatory behaviors. Furthermore, lower levels of prejudice were associated with less discriminatory behaviors. Conclusion: Enhancement of contact may increase understanding toward people with mental illness (PMI) and diminish stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors. Although prejudicial attitudes may be reduced by broadening mental health knowledge, increasing knowledge only might not ameliorate discriminatory behaviors. Future research should test mediators on contact and stigma by using longitudinal data. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Stereotype threat posits that students who are members of negatively stereotyped groups in school should feel more threat and less belonging, especially in schools with large achievement disparities and low racial/ethnic minority representation. This research has focused primarily on the experiences of negatively stereotyped monoracial minority students, but for a biracial Black/White student who claims both a negatively stereotyped (e.g., Black) and a positively stereotyped (e.g., White) identity, do these outcomes vary? We assessed 1,399 biracial Black/White, monoracial Black, and monoracial White middle school students’ perceptions of threat and belonging in school, across four lower-stereotype-salient schools (i.e., racially diverse schools) and seven higher-stereotype-salient schools (i.e., racially homogeneous schools). Biracial students reported a similar amount of threat across school contexts, whereas monoracial students’ threat was differentially context dependent. These findings suggest biracial students may face unique identity-related threats in school and point to a need to develop supports specific to their experiences. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Lillias Hamilton trained as a doctor in London, qualified in 1890 and practiced in Calcutta and later in Afghanistan where she was the personal physician to the Amir and the only Western doctor. After six years abroad, she returned to England but owing partly to establishment prejudice was unsuccessful in setting up a London practice and eventually became the Principal of a Women's Agricultural College. Her career illustrates the aspects of medical practice abroad in the 1890s, as well as the difficulties encountered by women doctors in England even after the route to qualification in the UK had been opened. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The present study explores how international students’ (IS; N = 169; Mage = 19.81 years, 36% male) identity fusion, the extent to which they feel connected with a particular social group, is concurrently and longitudinally correlated with belonging, loneliness, well-being, and perceived social support. IS reported higher fusion with other IS than with domestic students (DS). Fusion with IS at Time 1 (T1) was associated with greater IS support at T1 and Time 2 (T2). Fusion with DS was positively correlated with T1 belonging, well-being, and DS support at both time points, and was negatively linked with loneliness at T1 and T2. IS and DS fusion also interacted in predicting T1 belonging and loneliness. Students with proportionally greater DS than IS fusion reported greater DS support, and proportionally greater IS fusion was related to greater IS support. Discussion centers on promoting adjustment and intergroup relationships in higher education. © 2020 European Association for International Education.

AB  - In this prospective study, we examined the association between three types of mental health symptom clusters (i.e., psychotic, internalizing, and externalizing) and the frequency and severity of violent-behavioral outcomes, and whether community disadvantage, residential instability, and criminogenic facility density moderated these associations. Study data were derived from 258 community-dwelling adults nested in 60 postal forward sortation areas (FSAs) in a large metropolitan area in Western Canada who were assessed twice over a 6-month period. In addition, census and administrative data were obtained on the same areas. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, relationship status, and employment status), lifetime history of violent-behavioral outcomes, and community structural characteristics, internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms were significantly positively associated with the frequency and severity of subsequent violence perpetration and with the severity of subsequent violent victimization. Several significant interactions were observed: internalizing symptoms increased the risk of frequent and severe violence perpetration in FSAs with high but not low disadvantage, and externalizing symptoms increased the risk of frequent violent victimization in FSAs with a high but not low criminogenic facility density. Only the interactive association of internalizing symptoms and community disadvantage with the severity of violence perpetration, however, remained significant after Bonferroni correction was applied. These findings provide tentative support that associations between mental health and violent-behavioral outcomes can vary with community context. The implication of these findings for assessing and managing violent-behavioral outcomes in the community is discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Exposure to sexist humor creates a context in which some men feel comfortable expressing aggressive tendencies toward women (i.e., self-reported rape proclivity). This is in part because this type of humor makes it easier for men who have antagonistic attitudes toward women to express their prejudice without fear of social reprisal. Besides, previous research has demonstrated the influence of motivational variables such as autonomy (initiation or regulation of intentional behavior based on free choice) and control (acting under external pressure) on aggression. We conducted two experiments to explore the hypothetical influence of priming autonomy and control motivations on the relation between sexist humor and the expression of sexually aggressive tendencies toward women. Study 1 (N = 108) revealed that control-primed men with high (vs. low) scores in hostile sexism reported a higher rape proclivity when exposed to sexist (vs. neutral) humor. These results were partially replicated in Study 2 (N = 132), assessing the accessibility of aggressive sexual thoughts. This research contributes to our understanding of the influence of sexist humor and motivational orientations in sexist men on the expression of aggressive sexual behaviors directed against women. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Negative perception of scientists is disquieting for the future of science and US economic and scientific competitiveness. Drawing on studies suggesting that warmth guides people’s judgments of social groups and professions, this study aims to communicate the interpersonal warmth of scientists using two non-verbal behaviors, namely, smiling and collaboration. Building on the visual communication literature, posters were used in a 2 x 2 x 3 within-subject, online experiment in the context of College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, as a test case for Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics (STEM) colleges. Analyses showed main and interaction effects of smile and collaboration on warmth judgments. Students who smile were perceived as warmer than those who don’t smile. Further, students who collaborate were perceived as warmer than an individual student who works alone. Finally, students who collaborate and smile were perceived as higher in interpersonal warmth than those who work alone without smiling. Implications for the use of visuals to communicate warmth and change scientists’ negative stereotypes are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Purpose: A new phenomenon called “Glass Cliff” has formed claiming that women at the higher echelons of organizations are being placed in higher risk positions when compared to men. The purpose of this research study is to examine whether this phenomenon occurs at the middle to upper middle management levels for women. If so, it can possibly be one of the many underlying reasons that contribute to the grounds of why the pipeline problem exists with female leadership at the top-level management positions. Design/methodology/approach: The design considers competing hypotheses based on the emerging, contradictory research on the Glass Cliff and the more established perspective of social norms and implicit biases. The experimental study is conducted on 202 participants to examine the likelihood of occurrence of this phenomenon at middle to upper middle management levels. Findings: Counter to the tenets pertaining to the Glass Cliff phenomenon but consistent with the implicit leadership theories, this research study revealed that when compared to the female candidate, the male candidate was more likely to be assigned to the higher risk position. Research limitations/implications: The subjective nature of the study can be the reason for variations of each participant and their biases since it is a specific experiment dealing with perceptions, social norms and prejudice. Originality/value: This phenomenon is mostly studied at the executive level and can contribute to the pipeline problem for women, hence this study provides insight and examines the phenomenon at the middle to upper middle management levels to examine its likelihood. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to experimentally investigate whether disclosing one's sexual orientation while applying for a job would impact hiring decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The experiment employed a 2 (Applicant Gender: Male/Female) × 2 (Applicant Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual or Gay/Lesbian) × 2 (Job Type: Masculine/Feminine) between-subjects design. Participants (N = 349) were randomly assigned to one of eight applicant conditions. They were first presented with a job description, followed by a cover letter displaying the applicants' qualifications, gender and sexual orientation. Participants evaluated the applicant's competence, social skills and hireability, and provided self-reports of their attitudes toward gays/lesbians and traditional gender roles. Findings: The results demonstrated a distinct pattern of discrimination toward gay/lesbian applicants who were rated significantly lower in competence, social skills and hireability than were heterosexual applicants. Additionally, using multigroup structural equation modeling, we found that sexual orientation differentially impacted the relationship between attitudes and hireability ratings; negative attitudes toward homosexuality, beliefs about sexual orientation as a choice and belief in traditional gender roles were significant predictors of hireability ratings for gay/lesbian applicants, but were unrelated to evaluations of heterosexual applicants. Research limitations/implications: The current study highlights the underlying mechanisms involved in hiring discrimination against Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans (LGBT) workers including lower evaluations of competence, social skills and structural differences in the impact of attitudes. These direct links must be explicitly addressed for continued progress related to equality, diversity and inclusion in Human Resource Management (HRM). Continued multidisciplinary research that considers gender identity and sexual orientation signal salience, consequences of specific career stereotypes, regional differences and the effects of societal shifts in attitudes overtime will continue to improve our understanding and drive us toward a more equitable future. Practical implications: By identifying the underlying mechanisms involved in hiring discrimination, this study highlights the need for diversity trainings that go beyond the blanket approaches to diversity management and explicitly address conscious and unconscious biases that may influence the hiring process. Additionally, it is critical for organizations to provide top-down support from leadership, and implement mechanisms that allow LGBT voices to be heard and feel comfortable in their work environment to reduce the psychological strain. Social implications: Prior to the recent landmark ruling by the Supreme Court on June 15, 2020, which extended the 1964 Civil Rights Act workplace protections to gay, lesbianand transgender employees, in many places across the United States Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) identifying workers could still be legally discriminated against. The pattern of discrimination identified in the current study provides clear evidence that these protections are necessary, and long overdue. Originality/value: This study identifies two clear patterns of hiring discrimination: (1) lower hireability ratings and (2) structural differences in the evaluative process for gay/lesbian applicants. These findings provide experimental evidence, currently lacking in the literature, that support survey-based and qualitative findings of LGBT's experiences, and demonstrate how negative attitudes, irrelevant to the qualifications of an applicant, seep into hiring decisions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - As part of their “essentialist” intuitions, young children tend to form personal attributions for observed intergroup differences – attributing them to groups’ intrinsic natures or inborn characteristics. Much research has linked this essentialist view of social groups with prejudiced attitudes. However, less research has explored children’s capacity to form structural attributions for observed intergroup differences – attributing them to groups’ extrinsic circumstances or access to opportunities – or how structural attributions relate to social attitudes. Structural attributions could enable children to view low-status groups as extrinsically disadvantaged rather than intrinsically inferior. We were interested in whether verbally highlighting the extrinsic causes of novel social status disparities could support young children in forming structural attributions for them, thereby mitigating the formation of prejudice toward novel low-status groups. To investigate, we introduced participants (n=106 5- and 6-year olds) to novel social status disparities that could be attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic causes, and we framed the disparities in either intrinsic, neutral, or extrinsic terms. We then assessed children’s attributions for the disparities (through two measures: explanations and interventions) and their social attitudes toward the groups (through two measures: friendship preferences and prize allocations). Results indicated that participants tended to provide mostly personal attributions overall but that extrinsic framing led them to provide significantly more structural attributions. Extrinsic framing did not significantly impact social attitudes overall, but exploratory analyses revealed that it impacted participants’ friendship preferences in particular. Together, results suggest that verbally highlighting extrinsic causes can disrupt children’s intuitive tendency toward personal attributions, with promising implications for their views of low-status groups. © Copyright © 2021 Peretz-Lange and Muentener.

AB  - This special issue explores the use of metaphor in education from a multilingual perspective in two Scandinavian countries, Norway and Sweden. In this introduction, we include a brief overview of earlier research in the domain and identify common factors noteworthy to discuss in relation to the multilingual context, for instance, the notion of creativity and speaker legitimacy in a second language context. The issue includes six articles comprising multilingual school children, youth, university students, adult migrants, and indigenous minorities. Several of the articles focus on second language acquisition, use and assessment, while others deal more with social issues, including unequal power relations and prejudices that newcomers encounter in everyday life. © John Benjamins Publishing Company

AB  - Indigenous people are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic group in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) in the United States. Most prior research suggests this trend is the result broadly of settler colonialism, and more specifically of cultural differences between students and school/university environments; poor academic preparation in K-12 schools; vague constructs of educational or vocational goals; insufficient financial aid; unwelcoming school and university environments; prejudice and racism; and social isolation. There is also a vast body of published work on the unique epistemologies and knowledge systems held by Indigenous peoples, which are only recently being acknowledged within mainstream STEMM communities. One potential reason for lower participation in STEMM programs and professions by Indigenous people that has generally gone unexplored relates to unique cultural and spiritual factors that could deter Indigenous people from STEMM fields. Our research investigates the range and variation of cultural/spiritual/ethical practical issues that may be affecting Indigenous people’s success in STEMM. Our research provides valuable insights for policy and practices within higher education institutions and industry to provide flexible pathways for Indigenous people to reduce or eliminate barriers related to culturally- and spiritually-informed issues. In this paper, we explore how our findings can be used by professional societies to provide leadership to higher education institutions and industry in the area of changing some standard practices to be more inclusive of Indigenous people. An important mode of systemic change in STEMM fields is through professional societies that guide future practices in various STEMM disciplines. © Copyright © 2021 Ingram, Castagno, Camplain and Blackhorse.

AB  - Interpersonal anxiety (i.e., the fear of negative consequences from interacting with someone) may be more prominent in post-#MeToo organizations when interacting with someone of a different gender. Initial exchanges may particularly trigger this anxiety, obfuscating key organizational decisions such as hiring. Given humor’s positive, intrapersonal stress-reduction effects, we propose that humor also reduces interpersonal anxiety. In three mixed-methods experiments with hiring managers, we examined the effects of applicant and evaluator gender (i.e., same-/mixed-gender dyad), positive applicant humor (i.e., a pun), and context (i.e., gender salience) in job interviews. Results showed that mixed-gender (vs. same-gender) interactions elicited more interpersonal anxiety, particularly when gender was more salient; mixed-gender interactions also predicted downstream attitudinal outcomes (e.g., social attraction and willingness to hire) and hiring decisions (e.g., selection and rejection) via interpersonal anxiety. Although humor reduced interpersonal anxiety and its consequences for female applicants, the opposite was true for male applicants when gender was salient, because it signaled some of the same expectations that initially triggered the interpersonal anxiety: the potential for harmful sexual behavior. In sum, we integrated diversity and humor theories to examine interpersonal anxiety in same and mixed-gender interactions and then tested the extent to which humor relieved it © 2021.

AB  - A well-functioning democracy requires a degree of mutual respect and a willingness to talk across political divides. Yet numerous studies have shown that many electorates are polarized along partisan lines, with animosity towards the partisan out-group. This article further develops the idea of affective polarization, not by partisanship, but instead by identification with opinion-based groups. Examining social identities formed during Britain's 2016 referendum on European Union membership, the study uses surveys and experiments to measure the intensity of partisan and Brexit-related affective polarization. The results show that Brexit identities are prevalent, felt to be personally important and cut across traditional party lines. These identities generate affective polarization as intense as that of partisanship in terms of stereotyping, prejudice and various evaluative biases, convincingly demonstrating that affective polarization can emerge from identities beyond partisanship.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to identify the factors influencing positive subjective health awareness of middle school-age multicultural adolescents in Korea. Methods: This study used data from the fourth to sixth waves of the Multicultural Adolescents Panel Study conducted by the National Youth Policy Institute. In this study, a panel logit model analysis was performed using the Eviews 8.0 program (p<.050). Results: Socioeconomic status (r=.02, t=2.13, p=.033), body satisfaction (r=.71, t=1.97, p=.048), and depression (r=-.74, t=2.35, p=.018) influenced positive subjective health awareness in multicultural adolescents. When multicultural characteristics were entered into a statistical model with environmental and personal characteristics, multicultural characteristics did not have a significant influence on positive subjective health awareness. Conclusion: Environmental, personal, and multicultural characteristics were related to positive subjective health awareness in multicultural adolescents; thus, an integrated approach considering those variables is recommended. Nursing interventions and educational programs are needed to improve the psychological status of multicultural adolescents and reduce prejudice about them. In addition, nurses need to be sensitive to multicultural characteristics and the developmental characteristics of multicultural adolescents. © 2021. Korean Academy of Child Health Nursing.

AB  - Early evidence of disproportionate COVID-19 infection and death rates in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities in the continental US raised concerns for similar disparities in Hawai'i, where these communities make up 25% of the state's population. Representatives from more than 40 different government, academic, institutional and community-based organizations partnered to form the Hawai'i Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander COVID-19 Response, Recovery, and Resilience Team. The team consists of 5 committees including the Data & Research Committee. This committee is tasked with examining issues regarding the acquisition, quality, public reporting, and utilization of race/ethnicity-related health data used to inform priorities and guide resource allocation. Problems addressed by this committee include: inconsistency across agencies in the use of race identifiers, defaulting to the Office of Management and Budget standards which aggregated Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, and methods of data collection and reporting by the Department of Health. Outcomes include: 2 forms with race categories that reflect the population of Hawai'i; the reporting of disaggregated data by the Department of Health; and conversations with testing sites, laboratories, and health institutions urging a standardized form for race/ethnicity data collection. The collection and reporting of disaggregated race/ethnicity data is critical to guiding organizations in addressing underlying inequities in chronic disease and social determinants of health that can exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19. The Data and Research Committee's network offers a community-based model for collaborative work that honors culture and ensures Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other minority populations are recognized and counted. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).

AB  - As workforces age, organizations are challenged to provide human resource management policies and practices that are responsive to the needs of older workers. Flexible work arrangements (FWAs) - practices that allow workers to influence when, where, and how work is completed - have been promoted as enabling older workers to maintain work engagement by decreasing demands of the work role, providing the autonomy to balance work and nonwork commitments, and signalling the value of workers to employers. The current study aimed to examine whether FWAs were effective in alleviating key challenges to work among older workers by assessing the impact of FWAs on the associations of physical health, mental health, and negative age-related stereotypes about older workers, with work engagement. Data were obtained from 1,834 workers aged 55-82 (age M = 63.3, 54% female) from a general random sample of older adults. Greater mental health and lower negative stereotypes predicted higher work engagement. Greater physical and mental health conveyed an indirect impact on engagement via lower perception of negative stereotypes. Greater FWAs displayed a weak negative association with the perception of negative stereotypes about older workers and reduced the association of negative stereotypes with work engagement. Access to FWAs may have a minor role in alleviating key risks to work engagement associated with mental and social challenges for an aging workforce. Considerations for future investigations of FWAs and their impact on risks to engagement among older workers are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Victims of childhood trauma report shame and anticipation of stigma, leading to non-disclosure and avoidance of help. Stigma is potentially aggravating the mental health consequences of childhood trauma. So far there is no comprehensive study examining stigma toward adult survivors of various forms of childhood trauma, and it is unclear whether stigma interferes with reaching out to affected individuals. In a vignette study based on a representative sample of the German general population (N = 1320; 47.7% male) we randomly allocated participants to brief case vignettes pertaining to past childhood sexual/physical abuse or accidents, and adult physical abuse. Stigma was elicited by applying the Social Distance Scale, assessing respondents’ attitudes/stereotypes toward the persons in the vignette and their reluctance to address the specific trauma in conversation. While one aim was to establish the prevalence of stigma toward persons with CT, we hypothesized that attitudes differ according to type of trauma. Of the respondents, 45% indicated they were unlikely to reach out to a victim of childhood sexual abuse, 38% to a victim of childhood physical abuse, 31% to someone reporting a childhood accident and 25% to someone reporting adult physical abuse. Contrary to our expectations, childhood sexual abuse did not consistently elicit more stigma than childhood physical abuse in Krukall-Wallis tests. Equally, childhood interpersonal trauma did not consistently elicit more stigma than childhood accidental trauma. Structural equation modeling revealed social distance as mediator of the relationship between negative stereotypes and reluctance to address childhood trauma in conversation. Our analyses further revealed an ambiguous role of negative stereotypes in addressing childhood trauma in conversation with trauma victims, which has yet to be examined. There is evidence for stigma associated with having survived childhood trauma, which is interfering with offering help. Copyright: © 2021 Schomerus et al.

AB  - In Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court held Title VII's prohibition on sex-based employment discrimination applies to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Although the opinion is an important victory, if history is any guide, Bostock was only one battle in a larger war against invidious workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Prejudiced employers and managers will seek alternative, less obvious ways to discriminate. Judges and civil rights lawyers must prepare themselves to recognize and reject pretextual rationales for adverse actions taken against lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees. A better understanding of history can inform those efforts. This Article examines an unexplored chapter in the United States' history of anti-gay discrimination in the workplace: punishing gay workers for concealing their sexual orientation. Beginning in the 1960s, as federal and state law implemented procedural protections for publicsector workers, employers developed a new mechanism to evade those protections: the gay perjury trap. At its core, the strategy is simple. An employer asks job applicants about their sexual orientation. If they reveal that they are gay, decline to hire them. If gay workers conceal their sexual orientation and it is later discovered, terminate them for their dishonesty. Either way, gay workers are purged from the workforce. This Article provides historical examples of the federal government and local school districts using this strategy to terminate high-performing workers who were later discovered to be gay. After discussing the inherent unfairness of the gay perjury trap, this Article explains how prejudiced employers may attempt to deploy this strategy as a means of circumventing Title VII liability in the post-Bostock era. Finally, this Article discusses how courts should prevent employers from using the gay perjury trap in the post-Bostock work environment. Dismantling the gay perjury trap entails three components. First, courts should interpret Title VII as prohibiting employers from inquiring about an applicant's or employee's sexual orientation. Second, courts should not afford employers a general right to penalize gay workers for concealing or misrepresenting their sexual orientation. Third, courts should construe Title VII to protect employees who refuse to answer questions about their sexual orientation. Whether Title VII can effectively deter and remedy anti-gay discrimination will in significant part depend on courts' ability to recognize and prohibit employers from using the gay perjury trap. The post-Bostock Title VII cannot succeed if employers can use alleged dishonesty about sexual orientation as a means of punishing gay workers and avoiding liability. © 2021. Christopher R. Leslie.

AB  - Given the pervasiveness of prejudice, researchers have become increasingly interested in examining racial bias at the intersection of race and other social and perceptual categories that have the potential to disrupt these negative attitudes. Across three studies, we examined whether the emotional expression of racial exemplars would moderate implicit racial bias. We found that racial bias on the Affect Misattribution Procedure only emerged in response to angry but not smiling Black male faces in comparison to White (Study 1) or White and Asian (Study 3) male faces with similar emotional expressions. Racial bias was also found toward Asian targets (Studies 2 and 3), but not only following angry primes. These findings suggest that negative stereotypes about Black men can create a contrast effect, making racial bias toward smiling faces less likely to be expressed in the presence of angry Black male faces. © 2021 Guilford Publications, Inc.

AB  - Internal rural-to-urban migrants in China are facing a high risk of mental disorders. Previous research on mental health correlates and predictors among this population focused on individual-level characteristics, neglecting network-level indicators, and migrant–urbanite intergroup relationship. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Beijing, China from December 2018 to January 2019. A convenience sample of 420 rural-to-urban migrants completed the Chinese 12-item General Health Questionnaire and reported their relationship with urbanites in the past six months. Multivariate linear regression models were used to test the association of the inter-hukou network with migrant mental health. Two indicators of the inter-hukou network were significantly associated with migrant mental health. Migrants were more mentally healthy if their proportion of weak ties in the inter-hukou network was no less than 50%. The more social support migrants received from the inter-hukou network, the better their mental health was. Meanwhile, there was a significant interaction effect between social support and sex, indicating that the same level of social support better protected the mental health of female migrants. Results suggest the importance of social network factors and migrant–urbanite ties for migrant mental health. Future efforts may need to mobilize and facilitate the inter-hukou network to improve migrant mental health. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A current shift in intergroup relations research aims to delve deeper into whether, and how, individual differences predict social attitudes. Recent research goes beyond the measurement of typical personality traits and focuses also on the subclinical area of malicious traits. The present studies aimed at exploring the role of one such trait, psychopathy, as a predictor of negative social attitudes. The role of empathy was examined as a key underlying process explaining the relationship between primary and secondary psychopathy and social attitudes. Study 1 (N = 171) and Study 2 (N = 332) demonstrated that when entered as simultaneous predictors of negative attitudes toward immigrants (Study 1) and racism (Study 2), only primary psychopathy emerged as a significant predictor. Study 1 further demonstrated that lower levels of empathy mediated the psychopathy—attitudes path. Study 2 decomposed empathy into cognitive and affective, and tested the explanatory role of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Primary psychopathy predicted lower cognitive and affective empathy, which sequentially predicted racism via SDO (in the case of cognitive empathy) and RWA (in the case of affective empathy). The results are discussed in the context of an integration between the personality and intergroup relations literature. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - We used a phenomenological approach to explore 12 sexual minority Korean college students’ coming out experiences. Emergent themes from in-depth interviews included (a) expression of universal needs, (b) awareness of sociocultural violence, (c) coping strategies, and (d) cocreating an inclusive culture. These four themes characterize interactions of sociocultural factors, such as gender norms, sexual prejudice, and education with sexual identity development. Findings provide an understanding of the importance of developing effective and empowering strategies for counseling. Doce estudiantes universitarios de minorías sexuales fueron entrevistados en Corea. El análisis de los datos indicó que cuatro temas caracterizan la complejidad de las interacciones de factores socioculturales, como las normas de género, la socialización, la cultura y los prejuicios religiosos o sexuales con el desarrollo de la identidad sexual de los estudiantes universitarios. Los temas incluyeron (a) la expresión de las necesidades universales, (b) estar consciente de la violencia sociocultural, (c) las estrategias de afrontamiento y (d) la cocreación de una cultura inclusiva. Los resultados proporcionan una comprensión de la importancia de desarrollar estrategias efectivas, de empoderamiento e interconexión para la autoconexión y la sociedad coreana. © 2021 American Counseling Association.

AB  - Background: Higher rates of death by suicide are recognized both in individuals of any age with cancer and, separately, among adolescents and young adults (AYA) without cancer. Given this intersection, identifying risk factors associated with suicidal risk among AYA with cancer is critical. Objective: To identify characteristics associated with suicide among AYA with cancer. Methods: A retrospective analysis of AYA (aged 15–39) during 1975–2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was conducted. Clinical and demographic factors associated with death by suicide among the AYA cancer population were compared to (i) US population normative data (standardized mortality ratios [SMRs]) and (ii) other AYA individuals with cancer (odds ratios). Results: In total, 922 suicides were found in 500,366 AYA with cancer (0.18%), observed for 3,198,261 person-years. The SMR for AYA with cancer was 34.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31.4–36.9). Suicide risk was particularly high in females (SMR = 43.4, 95% CI: 37.2–50.4), unmarried persons (SMR = 50.6, 95% CI: 44.7–57.1), those with metastatic disease (SMR = 45.2, 95% CI: 33.1–60.3), or certain histological subtypes (leukemia, central nervous system, and soft tissue sarcoma). Risk generally reduced over time, however remained elevated ≥5 years following a cancer diagnosis (SMR > 5 years = 28.1, 95% CI: 25.4–31.0). When comparing those who died from suicide and those who did not, the following factors demonstrated significant associations: sex (males > females), race (White ethnicity > Black/other ethnicity), relationship status (never married > other), and disease stage (distant > localized). Conclusions: Death due to suicide/non-accidental injury is high compared to normative data, requiring increased awareness among health-care providers, suicide risk monitoring in AYA, and appropriately tailored psychosocial interventions. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In April 2017, scientists and science sympathizers held marches in the United Kingdom as part of a coordinated international March for Science movement that was held in over 600 cities worldwide. This article reports from participant-observation studies of the marches that took place in London and Cardiff. Supplemented with data from 37 interviews from marchers at the London event, the article reports on an analysis of the placards, focusing on marchers’ concerns and the language and images through which they expressed those concerns. How did the protesters articulate their concerns and objectives, and how were these articulations used to build a community? The placards did not represent a clear, focused, and unifying message; they instead illustrated disparate concerns ranging from human-induced climate change, Trump and “alternative facts,” and local UK specific political issues concerning the country’s exit from the European Union. Our analysis shows that placards gave a playful and whimsical character to the march, with slogans displaying significant amounts (and moments) of humor, often formulated through insider jokes, scientific puns, or self-deprecating appropriation of negative stereotypes about scientists. We analyze the march through the social movement literature and as a collective identity-building exercise for an (emergent) community of scientists and sympathizers with long-term aims of establishing a louder voice for scientists, and experts, in public discourse. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To explore the experiences and perspectives of nurses’ transition into entrepreneurship in a clinical and cultural nursing setting and the impact of entrepreneurship on the nurses’ role and professional identity. Background: Entrepreneurship is a relatively unknown phenomenon in international nursing research, and the prevalence of entrepreneurial nurses is only 0.5–1% of all working nurses globally. Unfortunately, several barriers occur within the healthcare system and existing nursing culture that may affect the potential of bringing entrepreneurship into the nursing profession. Design: The qualitative study used a phenomenological–hermeneutical approach based on an interpretative phenomenological analysis and COREQ-guided reporting. Methods: Nine individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted face to face (n = 6) and by telephone (n = 3) with Danish nurse entrepreneurs between February and March 2019. Results: The analysis revealed four themes: (a) prejudice towards entrepreneurship; (b) to become an entrepreneur in a nursing culture; (c) rebellion against the traditional role as employee and (d) challenged professional identity and new professional roles. Conclusion: Nurse entrepreneurs are caught between traditional and new ways of viewing nursing identity, norms, values and roles, and they face a conflict of professional values and a stereotyped view of ‘real’ nursing. Our findings show that entrepreneurship entails a huge learning process that develops nurses’ ability to think outside the box in a broader health perspective and challenge the existing nursing culture and role. However, nurse entrepreneurs’ ability to engage in entrepreneurship is compromised by professional values, the duty to behave as a good nurse and their own prejudices towards entrepreneurs. Impact: Entrepreneurship and nurse entrepreneurs pose a huge potential development of the nursing role and identity, as they challenge the current view on the nursing profession. This development is important for patients and health professionals, as future health challenges call for new ways of thinking and acting. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In this article, I use autoethnography to examine time spent on an acute psychiatric ward during the COVID-19 lockdown. I employ the device of “communitas in crisis” to emphasize the precarious nature of this experience and the extent to which, for myself at least, informal social interactions with fellow patients and “communitas” were significant features of my hospital experience and subsequent discharge. I suggest that a lack of emphasis on inpatient to inpatient relationships in the recovery literature is an omission and a reflection of psychiatry’s authority struggles with both service users and professionals, along with a general perception of psychosis as individual rather than as a socially constructed phenomenon. I also suggest that, especially in the wake of greater social distancing, mental health and social services should safeguard against psychological and social isolation by creating more spaces for struggling people to interact without fear or prejudice. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article examines the Opinion of AG Rantos in two cases concerning Islamic headscarves before the CJEU and argues that this Opinion appears to give almost carte blanche to (private) employers to adopt neutrality policies in their workplaces based on the wishes of their customers. In doing so, the AG appears to allow employers to pander to the prejudices of their customers and to push believers, and especially Muslim women, even further out of sight. It is argued that this affects not only the employment opportunities, but also the social inclusion of people from groups especially vulnerable to discrimination and that this goes against the founding values of the EU. The CJEU now has a choice: it can choose to protect the fundamental rights of religious minorities by taking these rights into account when assessing the two cases before it, or it can allow employers to pander to the prejudice of customers against people from religious minorities. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered life for individuals worldwide. Specifically, at the time of data collection (late April 2020), most forms of face-to-face interactions were limited and, in some cases, prohibited, as close contact with others increases the rate of transmitting the virus. As social beings, engaging in social distancing may have negative consequences on well-being. However, many individuals maintained their social connections by means of computer-mediated communication (CMC), such as hosting FaceTime happy hours or family reunions. Utilizing a nationally representative sample of 985 adults from the United States, this study investigated the association between social distancing adherence and positive affect and the extent to which this association might be mediated by CMC frequency. Results did not indicate a direct effect of social distancing adherence on positive affect. However, an indirect effect between these two variables occurred when mediated by CMC frequency. Specifically, greater social distancing adherence predicted greater frequency of CMC, which predicted greater positive affect. These findings held controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, relationship status, and income. Results suggest that despite social distancing, CMC may be a beneficial way to engage with others during and, perhaps, beyond COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Using the lenses of humor studies and narrative analysis, this paper discusses the stand-up comedy of Vivek Mahbubani, a Hong Kong-born stand-up comedian of Indian descent. Mahbubani uses humor about ethnicity-related issues to highlight the irrationality of racial discrimination and stereotypes. Specifically, Mahbubani challenges people's preconceived ideas about the speakerhood of Cantonese and the local identity. The present study demonstrates how this comedian has effectively built humor into his narrative as a response to oppression, thus engaging the local, ethnically Chinese audience to reflect on the social and ethnic tension felt by minorities in Hong Kong. This study further argues that Mahbubani's comedy reflects a more general trend in stand-up comedy: humor as a vehicle for a more inclusive and progressive grand narrative across different cultures; this trend stands in stark contrast to earlier ethnic jokes that often made minorities the target of verbal humor. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - The 21st century has highlighted major dilemmas on how to best manage diversity in our increasingly plural societies. Various strategies for managing diversity have been promoted to address this challenge including assimilation, colorblindness, and multiculturalism. However, empirical evidence has revealed that each poses weaknesses for intergroup relations. As a result, policy-makers and political theorists have promoted interculturalism as an alternate strategy that addresses new and emerging realities revolving around superdiversity, cultural fusions, and mixed forms of identity. In the current paper, we explore interculturalism as a pro-diversity ideology that takes a more dynamic view of cultural identity where individuals belonging to different social groups are supported to interact and influence each other leading to new and complex self-understandings. We consider the meaning and conceptualization of interculturalism, its psychological correlates, its implications for intergroup relations, and how minority group members perceive interculturalism. Given that empirical research on interculturalism is in its infancy, we further consider gaps in our understanding of the topic and suggest avenues for future research. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Growing evidence suggests highly processed foods may trigger an addictive-like process, which is associated with obesity. Other research suggests an addictive-like process occurs in response to eating itself, rather than specific foods. Addiction-based obesity explanations raise concerns about double stigmatization of people with obesity and addiction. This study compared effects of obesity framings on external and internalized weight stigma. Methods: The study was preregistered via Open Science Framework. Four hundred and forty-seven adults read an informational passage that described food addiction, eating addiction, or calorie balance explanations for obesity or a control passage about memory. Participants then completed external and internalized weight stigma measures. Results: Participants in the food addiction condition reported higher internalized weight stigma compared with those in the control condition. Obesity framing did not significantly affect external weight stigma compared with the control. Conclusions: These findings suggest that food addiction explanations for obesity may elicit greater internalized weight stigma than non-obesity-related messages. Addiction-based and traditional obesity explanations do not appear to influence external weight stigma. Illuminating the effects of obesity framing on stigma will help researchers communicate discoveries in ways that mitigate stigma. © 2021 The Obesity Society

AB  - Introduction: Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain that affects approximately 50 million people globally, with over 80 % of them living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Madagascar, as in most LMICs, one of the main obstacles to treatment is the stigma and discrimination experienced by patients. Beliefs and prejudices regarding this disease are common, especially among children. “Ao Tsara” is an educational comic book regarding epilepsy, which has been translated in Malagasy from a French version, and which objective is to raise awareness and fight epilepsy related stigma and discrimination. Comic books have indeed been used successfully to raise awareness and change behaviors in several areas of public health. Methods: We conducted a study to evaluate the effect of a single reading of this comic book on epilepsy related knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) in schoolchildren in Madagascar. This quasi-experimental study compared data collected before and immediately after reading “Ao Tsara”. It was conducted both in a school in an urban area and in a school in a rural area. Results: We recruited 244 children with a mean age of 11.4 (±1.5) in this study. We noted a significant improvement in the global KAP score after reading the comic book, overall as well as both in the urban school and the rural school. Out of a maximum score of twenty, the global KAP score increased from 9.4 to 11.2 (p < 0.001). Although the increase in knowledge was reasonable (10.2–12.9, p < 0.001) and the corresponding subscore after reading the comic book was at a satisfactory level, that was not the case for attitudes & practices, where the sub-score despite a significant increase remained low (8.7–9.5 out of a maximum score of twenty, p < 0.001). The comic book was much appreciated by the children with more than 50.0 % giving it the top rating, and 66.4 % stating they had learned a lot from it. Conclusion: A single reading of the comic book has demonstrated a positive effect on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of primary school children in Madagascar. This educational tool, which was much enjoyed by the children, could be of great value to raise awareness about epilepsy in Madagascar. By targeting a slightly older age group and adjusting the reading approach, the outcomes could be optimized especially in terms of attitudes and practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An extensive literature documents racial discrimination in housing, focusing on its prevalence and effect on non-White populations. This article studies how such discrimination operates, and the intermediaries who engage in it: landlords. A fundamental assumption of racial discrimination research is that gatekeepers such as landlords are confronted with a racially heterogeneous applicant pool. The reality of urban housing markets, however, is that historical patterns of residential segregation intersect with other structural barriers to drive selection into the applicant pool, such that landlords are more often selecting between same-race applicants. Using interviews and observations with 157 landlords in four cities, we ask: how do landlords construct their tenants’ race within racially segmented housing markets, and how does this factor into their screening processes? We find that landlords distinguish between tenants based on the degree to which their behavior conforms to insidious cultural narratives at the intersection of race, gender, and class. Landlords with large portfolios rely on screening algorithms, whereas mom-and-pop landlords make decisions based on informal mechanisms such as “gut feelings,” home visits, and the presentation of children. Landlords may put aside certain racial prejudices when they have the right financial incentives, but only when the tenant also defies stereotypes. In this way, landlords’ intersectional construction of race—even within a predominantly Black or Latino tenant pool—limits residential options for low-income, subsidized tenants of color, burdening their search process. These findings have implications for how we understand racial discrimination within racially homogenous social spheres. Examining landlords’ screening practices offers insight into the role housing plays in how racism continues to shape life outcomes—both explicitly through overt racial bias, and increasingly more covertly, through algorithmic automation and digital technologies. © American Sociological Association 2021.

AB  - Intersectionality scholars have long identified dynamic configurations of race and gender ideologies. Yet, survey research on racial and gender attitudes tends to treat these components as independent. We apply latent class analysis to a set of racial and gender attitude items from the General Social Survey (1977 to 2018) to identify four configurations of individuals’ simultaneous views on race and gender. Two of these configurations hold unified progressive or regressive racial and gender attitudes. The other two formations have discordant racial and gender attitudes, where progressive views on one aspect combine with regressive views on the other. In the majority of survey years, the most commonly held configuration endorsed gender equality but espoused new racialist views that attributed racial disparities to cultural deficiencies. This perspective has become increasingly common since 1977 and is most prevalent among White women and White men, likely due to racial-group interest. Black women and Black men, in contrast, are more likely to embrace progressive racial and gender attitudes. We argue that White men’s gender egalitarianism may be rooted in self-interest, aimed at acquiring resources through intimate relationships. In contrast, Black men adopt progressive racial and gender attitudes to form a necessary coalition with Black women to challenge racism. © American Sociological Association 2021.

AB  - A student’s weight is a particularly important characteristic in physical education. Research has shown that physical education teachers and people working in this area are particularly likely to hold strong negative implicit biases toward overweight students and that these students tend to earn lower grades in physical education. Stereotypes of overweight people might color teachers’ judgments of these students. In this study, we experimentally investigated whether overweight students received lower grades from physical education teachers on an exercise than normal weight students. We presented a verbal description of an exercise and asked teachers to grade a student’s performance and to judge the student’s social and working behaviors. Teachers gave lower grades to the overweight student, and regression analyses showed that their stereotypical beliefs predicted their judgments. Teachers’ motivation to control prejudice had no relation to their judgments. Nonetheless, our results showed that the same performance was graded worse only because the student was overweight. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Although explicit verbal expression of prejudice and stereotypes may have become less common due to the recent rise of social norms against prejudice, prejudice in language still persists in more subtle forms. It remains unclear whether and how language patterns predict variance in prejudice across a large number of minority groups. Informed by construal level theory, intergroup-contact theory, and linguistic expectancy bias, we leverage a natural language corpus of 1.8 million newspaper articles to investigate patterns of language referencing 60 U.S. minority groups. We found that perception of social distance among immigrant groups is reflected in language production: Groups perceived as socially distant (vs. close) are also more likely to be mentioned in abstract (vs. concrete) language. Concreteness was also strongly positively correlated with sentiment, a phenomenon that was unique to language concerning minority groups, suggesting a strong tendency for more socially distant groups to be represented with more negative language. We also provide a qualitative exploration of the content of outgroup prejudice by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation to language referencing minority groups in the context of immigration. We identified 15 immigrant-related topics (e.g., politics, arts, crime, illegal workers, museums, food) and the strength of their association and relationship with perceived sentiment for each minority group. This research demonstrates how perceived social distance and language concreteness are related and correlate with outgroup negativity, provides a practical and ecologically valid method for investigating perceptions of minority groups in language, and helps elaborate the connection between theoretical positions from social psychology with recent studies from computer science on prejudice embedded in natural language. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Much research has shown that intergroup contact is associated with a reduction in prejudice. Far less attention has been paid to the conditions that promote intergroup contact. This research explored the role of normative social influence in predicting contact engagement (total N = 1,538). Cross-sectional Study 1 found that individuals’ perception of descriptive levels of intergroup contact amongst the ingroup predicted their own contact engagement whilst controlling for outgroup attitudes. Study 2 and Study 3 demonstrated that an experimental manipulation of descriptive norms promoted outgroup approach intentions, and actual approach behaviour. Participants were more open to future intergroup contact when they learnt of the high prevalence of this behaviour amongst the ingroup. Study 4 then considered how normative techniques could be used when intergroup contact is not commonplace. Together, the findings provide a new understanding of the antecedents of intergroup contact and new techniques for encouraging greater inclusion and integration. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In the 2010s, China witnessed a return of the state in land acquisition and urban (re)development processes. This return of the state has resulted in a new type of neighborhood, namely displaced villagers' resettlement community (DVRC), which is well built by the government and located close to middle-income communities' amenities. The displaced villagers are entitled to full ownership and sale right of their resettlement houses. However, these houses in DVRCs are depreciated in the housing market. This study examines and explains the housing depreciation in DVRCs with a combination of quantitative hedonic models and qualitative field investigations. We explain the housing depreciation in DVRCs through the lens of territorial stigmatization theory. Based on the findings, we argue that the housing depreciation DVRCs is caused by the entrenched prejudice towards the peasantry in Chinese society. This prejudice has mutated into territorial stigmatization of DVRCs as uncivilized and poor neighborhoods. This paper innovatively bridges territorial stigmatization thesis and housing price research to provide a new method to reveal territorial stigmatization in the context of rising market approach to social housing. It contributes to the debate on whether social mix development can avoid the stigmatization of social housing communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The global demographic shift toward an aging population is predicted to result in a significant burden of mental health conditions and psychosocial disability. There has been a greater awareness of ageism and its toxic effects creating a paradigm shift to include a human right, ethical, and social justice-based approach to augment the biomedical model of mental healthcare. The concept of dignity lies at the heart of human rights and must be a central concept integrated into public health and mental healthcare. Dignity denotes the self-respect and worthiness of an individual as well as social consideration of his/her identity. Dignity in older persons is multi-dimensional and includes several factors such as privacy, independence, inclusion, autonomy, etc. There are several determinants such as frailty, dependence, sensory, cognitive impairment and socioeconomic vulnerabilities, which tend to compromise dignity in the elderly and hence their fundamental rights. One such construct is that of ageism which comprises stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination based on age. Ageism and related forms of stigma impair dignified healthcare in older persons and deprive them of their rights. Mental health professionals are uniquely positioned to incorporate the strategies to promote dignity in their clinical care and research as well as advocate for related social/health policies based on a human rights approach. These intersections are discussed in this paper in light of the United Nations Convention on Rights of the Older Persons. © 2021 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry

AB  - Racial tensions continue to ignite social unrest in the United States. Structural racism is increasingly recognized as a public health issue. It is therefore necessary to continue addressing the interaction of race and medicine, including anesthesiology. While many may overlook the impact that racial discrimination has had on the development of anesthesiology, understanding pain through a racialized lens has always been entwined with this medical specialty since its origins. Considering the first public demonstration of ether anesthesia in 1846 occurred 15 years before the American Civil War (1861-1865), it is naïve to pretend that anesthesia has been insulated from racial prejudice. We increasingly recognize the effects of variables, such as housing and education, which are important as social determinants of health. Across ethnic and racial lines, statistically significant differences persist in pain assessment and analgesia delivery. To understand these irregularities without relying on unsupported theories, we must challenge our current understanding of race in medicine. By reviewing the history of anesthesia through a racialized lens, we may better explore our biases and develop strategies towards racially equitable care. This article focuses on anesthesia's roots on the plantation in the American South, the medical perpetuation of racial disparities, and the challenges we face in healthcare today. © 2021 National Medical Association

AB  - Aim: To explore the concept of intercultural communication. Background: As global migration increases, countries around the world are starting to see diversity among their population. With this increasing multicultural society, effective communication is crucial, particularly in the area of healthcare. Intercultural nursing requires nurses to care for patients of various cultural backgrounds by considering their cultural needs. It is critical for nurses to be able to communicate effectively with patients of various cultures to provide care that is holistic and culturally appropriate to the diverse population. Methods: Walker and Avant's eight-step approach to concept analysis. Results: Intercultural communication in nursing is face-to-face, verbal or nonverbal communication that occurs between people of different cultures. Its defining attributes are (1) meeting between language and culture for a specific purpose and (2) face-to-face (in-person or virtual) human interaction between individuals from different cultures. Antecedents of intercultural communication in nursing are globalization, technology, and social environment. Consequences include reduced ethnocentrism and negative stereotyping. Empirical referents depict the existence of the concept, which includes several tools developed as a means to measure or evaluate intercultural communication. Conclusion: This study presented the defining attributes, antecedents and consequences, model case, and empirical referents of intercultural communication. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Purpose: This paper aimed to research attitudes of women working in the Croatian public relations (PR) industry regarding office culture (networking, banter, dress codes, etc.). Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses Bourdieu's habitus theory and analyses the experiences of women working in the Croatian PR industry with a focus on office culture. The study is based on 21 in-depth interviews with women working in the Croatian PR industry. Thematic analysis has been used to analyse data. Findings: Although female employees (76.84%) dominate the PR industry in Croatia, the so-called masculine patterns still prevail in the PR sector. Results show that women are often exposed to gender discrimination but at the same time, they also perpetuate gender-based prejudices. Practical implications: Employees in the PR industry should consider working on their own gender stereotypes that impact their patterns of behaviour. Relinquishment of the ideas of patriarchal essentialism would consequently change career progression opportunities, and it would particularly improve networking among women, which could lead to career advancement opportunities. Social implications: Structural changes are needed in society to avoid women perpetuating inequality through masculine behaviour and unrealistic expectations that many women cannot meet. Originality: To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper is the first paper that explores gender-biased office culture in the Croatian PR industry. In doing so, the paper also applies Bourdieu's habitus theory, thus contributing to studying cultural masculinities from a Croatian perspective. The paper also introduces the concept of gender-biased behaviour. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Migration elicits mixed reactions from the host-society. Negative responses towards migrants seem to emerge when migrants are perceived as culturally different. We investigated when and why perceived cultural distance (PCD) is associated with negative migrant attitudes by focussing on differences in cultural values. We expected that PCD in social values (focus on relationships and society) should be more strongly associated with attitudes towards migrants than personal values (individual needs and gains) and should be mediated by symbolic threat. In two quasi-experimental studies (N = 200, N = 668) with Dutch participants (host-society), we simultaneously tested effects of respondents’ perception of Dutch values, their perceptions of migrant values (of Moroccan, Syrian, Polish ethnic origin), and PCD between Dutch-migrant value on attitudes. For all migrant groups, PCD in social values was associated with more negative attitudes, less tolerance, and less policy support regarding migrants; this was mediated by symbolic threat. These links were weaker for personal values. © 2021 The Authors. British Journal of Social Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Psychological Society

AB  - Pervading global narratives suggest that political polarization is increasing, yet the accuracy of such group meta-perceptions has been drawn into question. A recent US study suggests that these beliefs are inaccurate and drive polarized beliefs about out-groups. However, it also found that informing people of inaccuracies reduces those negative beliefs. In this work, we explore whether these results generalize to other countries. To achieve this, we replicate two of the original experiments with 10,207 participants across 26 countries. We focus on local group divisions, which we refer to as fault lines. We find broad generalizability for both inaccurate meta-perceptions and reduced negative motive attribution through a simple disclosure intervention. We conclude that inaccurate and negative group meta-perceptions are exhibited in myriad contexts and that informing individuals of their misperceptions can yield positive benefits for intergroup relations. Such generalizability highlights a robust phenomenon with implications for political discourse worldwide. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Objectives: We aimed to introduce, validate, and showcase the utility of a new construct: communal collective narcissism. Method: We conducted four studies, in which we developed a new scale for communal collective narcissism (Study 1, N = 856), tested the construct's unique predictions (Study 2, N = 276), examined its social relevance (Study 3, N = 250), and assessed its implications for intergroup outcomes (Study 4, N = 664). Results: In Study 1, we verified the structural soundness of the Communal Collective Narcissism Inventory. In Study 2, we obtained evidence for a defining feature of communal collective narcissism, namely, that it predicts communal, but not agentic, ingroup-enhancement. In Study 3, we illustrated the social relevance of communal collective narcissism. Communal collective narcissists derogated outgroup members, if those outgroups threatened the ingroup and the threat targeted the ingroup's communion. Finally, in Study 4, we showed that communal collective narcissism predicts intergroup outcomes in the communal domain (e.g., humanitarian aid) better than agentic collective narcissism does, whereas agentic collective narcissism predicts intergroup outcomes in the agentic domain (i.e., preferences for military aggression) better than communal collective narcissism does. Conclusions: The construct of communal collective narcissism is conceptually and empirically distinct from classic (i.e., agentic) collective narcissism. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Online reviews promise to provide people with immediate access to the wisdom of the crowds. Yet, half of all reviews on Amazon and Yelp provide the most positive rating possible, despite human behaviour being substantially more varied in nature. We term the challenge of discerning success within this sea of positive ratings the ‘positivity problem’. Positivity, however, is only one facet of individuals’ opinions. We propose that one solution to the positivity problem lies with the emotionality of people’s opinions. Using computational linguistics, we predict the box office revenue of nearly 2,400 movies, sales of 1.6 million books, new brand followers across two years of Super Bowl commercials, and real-world reservations at over 1,000 restaurants. Whereas star ratings are an unreliable predictor of success, emotionality from the very same reviews offers a consistent diagnostic signal. More emotional language was associated with more subsequent success. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Individuals belonging to ethnic minority groups are more susceptible to depression and comorbid hypertension than European host populations. Yet, data on how depression is related to hypertension in ethnic groups in Europe are lacking. Therefore, we studied the association between significant depressed mood (SDM) and hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control among ethnic groups. Data from the HELIUS study included 22,165 adults (aged 18–70) from six ethnic backgrounds in the Netherlands. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between SDM and hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control with adjustment for age, sex, and for sensitivity analysis purposes also for anti-depressants. After adjustment for age and sex, Dutch with SDM had an increased odds of hypertension (OR 95% CI 1.67; 1.08–2.59). Among Turkish, SDM was associated with higher odds of hypertension awareness (2.09; 1.41–3.09), treatment (1.92; 1.27–2.90) and control (1.72; 1.04–2.83). Among Moroccans, SMD was associated with an increased odds of hypertension awareness (1.91; 1.14–3.21) but decreased odds of hypertension control (0.42; 0.20–0.89). Additional adjustment for anti-depressant medications did not change the results. There were no associations between SDM and hypertension, awareness, treatment and control in South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese and Ghanaian participants. The results underline significant differences in the association between SDM and hypertension awareness, treatment and control between ethnic groups. Our findings emphasize the necessity to further study ethnicity-related factors that may influence the association between SDM and hypertension to promote hypertension control especially, among Moroccans with SDM. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The aims of the present research were to evaluate the preliminary psychometric properties of a new measure for evaluating teachers’ attitudes towards the representation of homosexuality in film and television, and to explore the association between moral disengagement and teachers’ negative attitudes towards homosexual representations. Participants were 241 Italian primary and secondary school teachers. The new self-report measure comprises 14 items or 8 items (brief version) scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Teachers completed three instruments: the new measure created to capture participants’ social and emotional evaluations of homosexuality in film and television, the latent and manifest prejudice scale, and the Italian moral disengagement scale. Exploratory factor analysis of the new measure suggested a single factor. The results demonstrated that the measure had satisfactory construct and convergent validity and reliability. Finally, we identified how teachers’ dehumanization of victims and euphemistic labelling were positively associated with their negative attitudes towards representations of homosexuality. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Difference-education interventions teach people a contextual theory of difference: that social group difference comes from participating in and adapting to diverse sociocultural contexts. At two universities, we delivered difference-education interventions during the college transition and examined long-term academic and intergroup outcomes. Nearly 4 years later, first-generation students who received a difference-education intervention earned higher grades and were more likely to attain honors standing than those in the control condition. Based on an end-of-college survey with students at one of the two universities, both first-generation and continuing-generation students showed greater comfort with social group difference compared with students in the control condition. Our results demonstrate for the first time that teaching first-generation students a contextual theory of difference can lead to long-term academic benefits that persist until graduation. This work also provides new evidence that difference-education can improve comfort with social group difference. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Anti-immigrant attitudes are often explained in terms of ethnic boundaries in which a categorical distinction between the ethnic ingroup and immigrant outgroup is made. However, these attitudes might also result from contrasting cultural worldviews. We examined the importance of ethnic categorisation and perceived cultural worldview difference in explaining behavioural intentions towards immigrants. Using an experimental survey design with a national sample of ethnic Dutch respondents (N = 832), we studied two positive and two negative behavioural intentions towards either immigrants with a contrasting cultural worldview or co-ethnics with such as worldview. Our findings indicate similar behavioural intentions towards both target groups. Furthermore, except for “the intention to learn” there were no differences in behavioural intentions towards both target groups for respondents with lower and higher authoritarian dispositions. Overall, this pattern of findings is theoretically most in line with a worldview conflict perspective rather than an ethnic boundary perspective. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Minority groups have long been underrepresented in politics. Support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights and the incidence of LGBT candidates have dramatically increased in recent years. But do voters (still) penalize LGT candidates? We conducted original survey experiments with nationally representative samples in the United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. To varying degrees voters penalize LGT candidates in all countries, with penalties strongest in the United States. Yet, progressives, people with LGBT friends, and nonreligious individuals do not discriminate against gays and lesbians, while transgender candidates face stronger bias. Electability concerns, outright prejudice, and identity cueing (i.e., LGT candidates seen as more liberal) explain voter bias. This study contributes to the literature on minority candidates and disentangles correlated candidate attributes, exploring the intersectionality of bias. Understanding the barriers to the election of LGT people is crucial to improve the representation of marginalized communities. © 2021 Southern Political Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Emerging adults (i.e., age 18–25 years) of color in the United States are exposed to race/ethnicity-related traumatic events in online settings. Although an emerging literature documents the mental health consequences of such online exposures among adolescents, the association between these exposures and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains understudied in emerging adults. Furthermore, little is known about strengths-based factors that may be protective for emerging adults of color faced with such exposures. The current study aimed to fill these gaps by examining the potential of liberatory media literacy (i.e., the ability to critically read, evaluate, support, and create media and technology that represents people of color in their full humanity) to ameliorate the association between exposure to traumatic events online and PTSD symptoms. Emerging adults of color (N = 325, Mage = 22.24, 56.0% male) were recruited to complete a self-report online survey that assessed exposure to race/ethnicity-related traumatic events in online settings, liberatory media literacy, and PTSD symptoms. The results of moderation analysis indicated that increased exposure to traumatic events online was associated with higher PTSD symptoms, β =.22, and that the inclusive media and technology component of liberatory media literacy was protective in this association, β =.19. However, these effects were small, f2 =.22–.23. The potential of liberatory media literacy as a strengths-based asset for emerging adults of color are discussed. Increasing inclusive media and technology skills may be an important target for intervention. © 2020 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies

AB  - There is a pervasive stigma attached to being Haitian in the Bahamas. This article examines reflections on the experiences of the stigma of being Haitian at primary and secondary school among second-generation Haitians in the Bahamas. Based on this research, I argue that primary school functions as the first major institution where children of Haitian descent experience stigma as it relates to their ethnic heritage and, in turn, are exposed to the idea of being the ‘other’ in Bahamian society through bullying and anti-Haitian sentiments from students and teachers. Stigma, prejudice, exclusion, and discrimination characterize primary and secondary education for Haitians living in the Bahamas and are manifest in the form of cruel teasing, bullying, and discrimination primarily from students and teachers. The goal is not to argue that children of Haitian descent are completely unaware of anti-Haitian sentiment in the Bahamas until they attend school but, rather, that school functions as one of the first institutions children of Haitian descent learn there is stigma in being Haitian in the Bahamas. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Integrating past research on women of color, stigma transfers, and generalized prejudice, the present research examined the extent to which threats and safety cues to one identity dimension (e.g., gender) results in threat or safety to women of color’s other stigmatized identity dimension (e.g., race). Across three experimental studies (Total N = 638), the present research found support for a dual cue hypothesis, such that Black and Latina women anticipated gender bias from a racial identity threat (Studies 1 and 2) and anticipated racial bias from a gender identity threat (Study 2) resulting in greater overall anticipated bias compared to White women (Study 3). Moreover, Black and Latina women anticipated racial identity safety from a gender identity safety cue (Study 3) supporting a dual safety hypothesis. These studies add to work on double jeopardy by extending a dual threat framework to anticipation of discrimination and highlighting the transferability of threat and safety cues for women of color. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Slurs have become a big topic of discussion both in philosophy and in linguistics. Slurs are usually characterised as pejorative terms, co-extensional with other, neutral, terms referring to ethnic or social groups. However, slurs are not the only ethnic/social words with pejorative senses. Our aim in this paper is to introduce a different kind of pejoratives, which we will call “ethnic/social terms used as insults”, as exemplified in (European) Spanish, though present in many other languages and mostly absent in English. These are ethnic terms like gitano, ‘Romani’, which can have an extensional and neutral use, but also a pejorative meaning building on a negative stereotypical representation of the Romani community. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects of participants’ gender, and target figures’ gender on the preferences for individuals with overweight and average-weight. The study also assessed whether evaluations of the groups are affected by the group composition (the number of children with overweight). The study was conducted on the sample of 102 children (43 girls and 59 boys). The age of the participants ranged from 7 to 11 years. Twenty pairs of female and male child images with average-weight and overweight were drawn for this study. The individual images were combined into five groups of children with average-weight and overweight. The results showed that target with average-weight and male targets were preferred more than target with overweight and female targets and that participants evaluated same-sex targets more positively. The same trend was obtained for group images. The results also showed that the increase in the number of children with overweight in groups was connected with more negative evaluations of these groups. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A damaging belief exists that to become a victim of sexual violence, victims must be deemed sexually desirable. As a result, sexual violations where the victims are individuals whom society may deem as less attractive—such as overweight women—may elicit less empathy for the victim or minimize the likelihood they are believed. Yet, there is some evidence that overweight women actually report higher rates of sexual violence than women of other weight categories. Although there has been some research implicating weight biases in sexual assault cases, this has not been extended to cases of sexual coercion despite their growing share of police reports. A sample of 168 participants were recruited from Canada via social media (n = 82) and through a midsized university in Ontario, Canada (n = 86). Using a mock jury paradigm, participants responded to a vignette depicting the sexual coercion of a thin or overweight woman. Participants reported their opinions on the sexual coercion scenario, and prejudicial attitudes, using two standardized scales. Men reported greater rape myth acceptance, anti-fat attitudes, and victim responsibility and endorsed significantly more perpetrator mitigating factors and expressed more negative affect toward the victim. Participants in the overweight condition also expressed greater perpetrator sympathy, greater perpetrator mitigation, and less negative affect toward the perpetrator. These results suggest that overweight women may face additional barriers when reporting their experiences of sexual coercion, particularly to men. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate whether U.S. citizenship status influences the racialization of offenders engaged in homicide, sexual violence, and terrorism. The role of social media exposure and interracial contact are explored as additional proximal factors that may explain racialization across citizenship status. The cross-sectional online survey consisted of 729 participants enrolled at a culturally diverse northeastern university. Results suggest that non-U.S. citizens have a more color-blind perspective and are less likely to racialize crime when associating a particular race/ethnicity with violent crimes. Surprisingly, social media exposure and interracial contact were not significant contributors to racialization. Suggestions for future research and policy implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study investigates how the awareness of social inequities and racism may serve as a foundation for psychology trainees’ social justice self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations, interests, and commitment. Using the social-cognitive justice developmental framework proposed by Miller et al. (2009), a total of 222 participants were recruited from accredited applied psychology programs across the United States. Participants completed measures assessing their levels of two dimensions of critical consciousness: Egalitarianism and awareness of inequality (Diemer et al., 2017), their colorblind racial attitudes (Neville et al., 2000), and their social justice self-efficacy, outcome expectations, interests, and commitment (Miller et al., 2009). A hypothesized path model was fit to the data. Alternative models were also considered. Results indicated that participants who endorsed egalitarianism and were more aware of social inequities showed greater awareness of racism and, in turn, were more likely to endorse a higher orientation and commitment to social justice. Limitations and implications for future research and training are discussed. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - Family members who witnessed the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi arguably shape their children’s narratives of the events and subsequent formation of outgroup prejudice. An understanding of whether vestiges of the genocide are transmitted to future generations informs ongoing peacebuilding efforts. We, therefore, examined the relationship between child and guardian attitudes toward one’s outgroup among households of survivors or génocidaires and investigated whether this relationship was potentially affected by social interactions with members of outgroups (survivors or génocidaires) outside the family. We interviewed 588 members of survivor (153 guardian–child dyads) and génocidaire (141 guardian–child dyads) households in the Muhanga district of Rwanda to investigate whether children, 12–18 years old, conveyed their parents’ outgroup prejudice after parents participated in a local peace intervention compared to when children participated in similar programming for youth. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results indicated that survivors’ and génocidaires’ outgroup prejudice did not influence their children’s formation of these beliefs. Nor did children affect their guardians in this regard. However, other factors influenced children’s beliefs in both households. In survivor households, children who endorsed more positive attitudes toward génocidaires reported stronger family relationships and more frequent interaction with génocidaires after adjusting for child age and gender, and guardian’s gender. In génocidaire households, children’s positive beliefs about survivors were influenced by more interactions with survivors and living with a guardian who participated in peace interventions. Rather than being passively shaped by their guardians’ experiences, our results suggested that a new generation of viewpoints was being formed by relationships within and outside the family. © 2021.

AB  - Mounting reports in the media suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified prejudice and discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, especially Asians. Existing research has focused on discrimination against Asians and is primarily based on self-reported incidents or nonrepresentative samples. We investigate the extent to which COVID-19 has fueled prejudice and discrimination against multiple racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States by examining nationally representative survey data with an embedded vignette experiment about roommate selection (collected in August 2020; n = 5,000). We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: Compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them. These findings suggest that COVID-19-fueled prejudice and discrimination have not been limited to East Asians but are part of a broader phenomenon that has affected Asians generally and Hispanics as well. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The identification of factors associated with ethnic bullying within multiethnic schools is a timely social issue. Up to now, ethnic prejudice has been found to facilitate aggression triggered by schoolmates’ cultural background. Yet, there is still a dearth of research about the mechanisms underlying this relation among children. In order to fill this gap, by adopting a social-cognitive developmental perspective on prejudice and morality, this paper investigated the mediating role of moral disengagement in the association between ethnic prejudice and ethnic bullying, as well as the moderating role of closeness with the teacher. A mediation model and a moderated mediation model were applied to data collected from 552 primary school children aged 8–10years. Ethnic prejudice, ethnic bullying, and moral disengagement were assessed through self-reported questionnaires, whereas a questionnaire was administered to teachers to assess the level of closeness with their pupils. Results indicated that ethnic prejudice was directly and positively related to ethnic bullying and that moral disengagement partially mediated this association. This indirect link was particularly strong for children with low levels of closeness with their teachers, whereas it resulted not significant for pupils with high levels of closeness, suggesting that closeness with the teacher might restrain morally disengaged children from enacting ethnic bullying. Implications for research and practice aimed at reducing prejudice and moral disengagement, as well as at promoting positive relationships among children and between pupils and teachers, are discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Iannello, Camodeca, Gelati and Papotti.

AB  - This study examined whether killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor by current or former law enforcement officers in 2020 were followed by shifts in public sentiment toward Black people. Methods: Google searches for the names “Ahmaud Arbery,” “Breonna Taylor,” and “George Floyd” were obtained from the Google Health Application Programming Interface (API). Using the Twitter API, we collected a 1% random sample of publicly available U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019–September 2020 (N = 3,380,616). Sentiment analysis was performed using Support Vector Machines, a supervised machine learning model. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on a random sample of 3,000 tweets to understand themes in discussions of race and racism and inform interpretation of the quantitative trends. Results: The highest rate of Google searches for any of the three names was for George Floyd during the week of May 31 to June 6, the week after his murder. The percent of tweets referencing Black people that were negative decreased by 32% (from 49.33% in November 4–9 to 33.66% in June 1–7) (p < 0.001), but this decline was temporary, lasting just a few weeks. Themes that emerged during the content analysis included discussion of race or racism in positive (14%) or negative (38%) tones, call for action related to racism (18%), and counter movement/arguments against racism-related changes (6%). Conclusion: Although there was a sharp decline in negative Black sentiment and increased public awareness of structural racism and desire for long-lasting social change, these shifts were transitory and returned to baseline after several weeks. Findings suggest that negative attitudes towards Black people remain deeply entrenched. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - If preferences on immigration policy respond to facts, widespread misinformation poses an obstacle to consensus. Does factual information about immigration indeed affect policy preferences? Are beliefs about immigration’s societal impact the mechanism through which factual information affects support for increased immigration? To address these questions, we conducted an original survey experiment, in which we presented a nationally representative sample of 2,049 Americans living in the United States with facts about immigrants’ English acquisition and immigrants’ impact on crime, jobs, and taxes—four domains with common misperceptions. Three of these factual domains (immigration’s impact on crime, jobs, and taxes) raise overall support for increased immigration. These facts also affect beliefs that are directly relevant to that information. Moreover, those beliefs mediate the effect of factual information on support for increased immigration. By contrast, information about English acquisition affects neither policy preferences nor beliefs about immigration’s impact. Facts can leverage social cognitions to change policy preferences. © 2021 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.

AB  - Purpose: Tuberculosis is an infectious condition with a high disease burden, and the stigma in patients with tuberculosis causes negative health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to define and clarify the concept of self-stigma among patients with tuberculosis. Methods: The analysis was conducted using Walker and Avant’s conceptual approach. Twenty-seven studies met the selection criteria. Results: Self-stigma in patients with tuberculosis can be defined by the following attributes: 1) self-esteem decrement; 2) fear; 3) negative emotions to oneself; 4) social withdrawal; and 5) discrimination. The antecedents identified were 1) inappropriate knowledge of tuberculosis, 2) spread of improper health information through media and social communications, 3) stereotypes and prejudices, 4) visibility due to symptoms appearing, 5) recognizing the risk of infection, and 6) low financial status. The consequences were 1) concealing the disease, 2) treatment delay, 3) poor treatment adherence, 4) poor quality of life, and 5) deterioration in or lack of social activities. Conclusion: The definition and attributes of self-stigma identified by this study can be applied to enhance the understanding of stigma in tuberculosis patients and to improve communications between healthcare providers and researchers. It can also be used to develop theories and measurements related to stigma in patients with tuberculosis. © 2021 Korean Academy of Community Health Nursing

AB  - In 1882 the criminal registry, a bureaucratic tool used to assemble information about the criminal biographies of German citizens, was implemented in all territories of the German Empire. This article demonstrates that the registry, evidence that states were accumulating ever more knowledge about the population, was from the beginning surrounded by critical reflection on its functioning. Worried about the scale of the work involved, in the interests of administrative efficiency bureaucrats wished the use of the registry to be curtailed. Prussian officials stressed that private parties should be denied access to the registry, while scholars pointed out that the registry was not intended to support forensic investigation. Journalists and worried citizens argued that the use of the registry in German courts was responsible for a culture of excessive suspicion. By portraying the emotional effects of the registry on German citizens, critics therefore sought to mobilize empathy for the 'victims' of the registry and started to demand a 'right to be forgotten'. The Expungement Law of 1920 was designed as a solution to many of these problems and can be viewed as the endpoint of an important liberalizing process in German society. Yet, for many contemporaries the law was largely ineffective, for it did not combat social prejudices against citizens with a criminal record. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: Diversification of the profession is an important element of combating racism, bias, and prejudice in the speech-language pathology workforce at national and systemic levels. However, national and systemic change needs to be combined with equipping individual speech-language pathologists to adapt to the challenges that they face to engaging in culturally responsive practice. This paper presents four interacting levels of practice within the Culturally Responsive Teamwork Framework (CRTF): (a) intrapersonal practices, (b) interpersonal practices, (c) intraprofessional practices, and (d) the interprofessional practices. Conclusion: CRTF is a practical, strengths-based framework that draws on international research and expertise to expand personal and professional practice and describe critical behaviors within the workplace that can be used to promote principles of evidence-based practice and social justice, especially when working with people from nondominant cultural or linguistic groups. © 2021 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

AB  - Objective:Families, pediatric providers, and service systems would benefit from expanded knowledge regarding (1) who is most likely to receive a recommended diagnostic evaluation after a positive primary care-administered autism screen and (2) of those who screen positive, who is most likely to be diagnosed with autism?Method:Participants included 309 predominantly low-income, racial/ethnic minority parents and their child, aged 15 to 27 months, who screened positive on the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F). Generalized estimating equations were used to fit models of predictors for each binary outcome: receiving a diagnostic evaluation and receiving an autism diagnosis on evaluation.Results:Significant predictors of diagnostic evaluation receipt included the parent being older or non-Hispanic and the child having private insurance, lower child communication functioning, or receiving Early Intervention services. Significant predictors of an autism diagnosis on evaluation included male child, lower child communication functioning, screening directly in the parent's preferred language, White/non-Hispanic parent, and no parent history of mood disorder.Conclusion:Children with younger parents, Hispanic ethnicity, relatively higher communication skills, public insurance, and no Early Intervention services were less likely to receive recommended diagnostic care. Reduced likelihood of autism diagnosis after a positive screen in non-White/non-Hispanic subgroups supports previous research indicating issues with M-CHAT-R/F positive predictive power for racial/ethnic minorities. The use of telephonic interpreters to administer screens, as opposed to directly screening in families' preferred languages, may lead to identification of fewer true autism cases. Thus, multilingual clinical staff capacity may improve positive predictive power of autism screening. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nonwhite women still commonly work as maids in white or affluent South African households despite the fall of apartheid more than twenty years ago. Their employers provide insight into the renegotiation of privilege when they move to a country that has different understandings of race and servitude. The accounts of eight white South African immigrants living in New Zealand are here deconstructed via Foucauldian discourse analysis. As these immigrants reflect on their past, they camouflage an oppressive and prejudicial relationship through notions of friendship and compassion. Their struggles with opposing ideologies reveal well-rehearsed racial scripts, which buffer the impact of white supremacy that is culturally inappropriate in New Zealand. These scripts suggest that South African emigrants take their “post” apartheid space with them, challenging a status quo that tran-scends spatial boundaries. © The Trustees of Indiana University.

AB  - Background: Weight stigma is a serious challenge because of its negative impact on human health and harmful psychological and behavioral consequences. The aim of the study was to explore and compare the relationships between self-reported body weight and weight-related stigmatization experiences and body image, mental self-image, self-esteem, and stereotypes concerning people with obesity among young adult Polish women (N = 374; aged between 18 and 35). Methods: The study was conducted online on a Polish sample recruited through a social network site, a website, and snowball sampling. Body mass index (BMI) was used to assign the respondents to groups with normal or excess weight. We tested whether women enrolled in the study experienced weight-related stigmatization using two questions based on the concepts of spoiled identity and related to the obesity stigma. The Contour Drawing Rating Scale was used to study different aspects of the body image and discrepancies between them. The Self-Discrepancy Questionnaire was used to study the self-schemas associated with mental qualities. The Polish version of the Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale was applied to determine self-esteem level. Stereotypes concerning people with obesity were studied using the semantic differential method. Results: Although excess weight was associated with weight-related stigmatization experiences, many women reported confronting such stigmatization even though their body weight was normal according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Women with excess weight and women with weight-related stigmatization experiences were characterized by larger discrepancies between the actual body image and the ideal, reflected, and ought body image, lower self-esteem, and more negative beliefs about their mental actual and reflected self compared to women with normal weight and without weight-related stigmatization experiences. The study participants from all groups tended to believe their actual body image to be ampler than the ideal and the ought body images. They also believed that other people perceived their mental qualities more positively than they did. The study groups were also characterized by negative stereotypes of people with obesity, although these stereotypes were more vital in women with excess weight and women who experienced weight-related stigmatization. Conclusion: The study shows the similarity between psychological functioning of women with self-reported excess weight and those who experience weight-related stigma. The results also provide guidelines for practical actions aimed at reducing negative mental outcomes associated with not conforming to body weight standards. © 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - With increasing concern over online misinformation in perspective, this study experimentally examined the cognitive as well as the affective consequences of online search. Results of the two experiments using widely shared, prejudiced misinformation about an ethnic minority in Japan indicated that (a) online search reduces on average the likelihood of believing the misinformation, (b) the magnitude of the effect is larger among those who are predisposed to believe the misinformation, (c) cognitive correction is observed whether searchers are motivated to achieve a directional goal or an accuracy goal, and (d) online search deteriorates affective feeling toward the target groups of the misinformation. Theoretical implications are discussed in relation to the robustness of confirmation bias in online search and the "belief echo"in which exposure to negative misinformation continues to shape attitudes even after the misinformation has been effectively discredited. © 2021 Kobayashi et al.

AB  - The current studies (N = 1,709) explore why demographic composition of place matters. First, this work demonstrates that relative level of group representation affects one's experience of place in the form of self-definition (self-categorization), perceptions of place being representative or characteristic of factors that distinguish the group from others (place-prototypicality), and sense of belonging (place-identification; Studies 1a-1e; Studies 2a & 2b). Second, the studies illustrate that group representation within place shapes the way group member's approach (i.e., expectations of group-based treatment and procedural justice; Studies 2a-2c), understand (i.e., attribution for group-based events, Study 2b; responsiveness to bias-reduction intervention, Study 4a; sense of solidarity, Study 4b), and behave (i.e., prejudice, Studies 3a & 3b; collective action, Study 4c). More broadly, I present a Social identity Paradigm for Contextualized Experience (SPACE) that provides an organizing framework for the study of the impact of characteristics of place on social identity-based contextualized experience and (in turn) collective behavior. Taken together, the findings provide evidence of distinct psychological experience and orientation as a function of minority versus majority-group status within place, as well as for a group-based approach to place. Implications for the study of collective and intergroup behavior are discussed. Copyright: © 2021 Demis E. Glasford.

AB  - On Tuesday, April 24, 1900, three days after Passover, Freud gave a talk at his B’nai B’rith lodge on Emile Zola’s utopian novel penned in self-exile in London, Fécondité (1899). The next day Freud wrote Wilhelm Fliess that the night before the talk he had a dream in which “[t]he brethren… were unkind and scornful of me.” In the dream his brethren’s contempt signifies that Freud is making his impious move to destroy their Tree of Life: No Law, no Judaism, no Christianity, no miserable antisemitism. In Freud’s utopia, an enlightened socially just world grounded in reason, which mirrors the brotherly atheistic utopia envisioned in Fécondité, the seed of Abraham at long last can move across frontiers freely, develop their talents, and satisfy their needs. © 2021 N.P.A.P.

AB  - Emotional intelligence (EI) is a fundamental skill related to different aspects of human life, such as psychological well-being or mood states. The present study has a triple objective: first, to explore the psychometric properties of the TMMS-24 in three Spanish-speaking countries (Argentina, Ecuador, and Spain); second, to examine the relation of EI with mood and avoidance of responsibility; and finally, to analyse the influence of sex, age and national differences on EI. The relevance of this study is given by the need for tools to assess EI in different cultures. A sample of 1048 adults (Mage = 21.11 years, SD = 5.84; 52.3% male) was selected by convenience sampling. The psychometric properties of the TMMS-24 were adequate, and the Spanish sample showed lower levels of EI than the Argentinian and Ecuadorian ones. EI was associated with mood and the avoidance of responsibility, with higher levels in women in all cases. Regarding the national and sex-specific differences, the Spanish sample showed significant differences in attention and repair, with men exhibiting higher scores in attention and women having higher scores in repair. In the Argentinean sample, no significant differences were found, and in the Ecuadorian one, women presented higher scores in attention than men. The TMMS-24 can be considered a useful, practical tool to assess EI in adults in different cultures and with different languages. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Echoing the 1960s, the 2020s opened with racial tensions boiling. The Black Lives Matter movement is energized, issuing pleas to listen to Black voices regarding day-to-day discrimination and expressing frustrations over the slow progress of social justice. However, psychological scientists have published only several opinion pieces on racial microaggressions, primarily objections, and strikingly little empirical data. Here I document three trends in psychology that coincide with the academic pushback against microaggressions: concept-creep concerns, especially those regarding expanded notions of harm; the expansion of right-leaning values in moral judgments (moral foundations theory); and an emphasis on prejudice symmetry, with the political left deemed equivalently biased against right-leaning targets (e.g., the rich, police) as the right is against left-leaning targets (e.g., Black people, women, LGBT+ people). Psychological scientists have ignored power dynamics and have strayed from their mission to understand and combat prejudice against disadvantaged populations, rendering researchers distracted and ill-equipped to tackle the microaggression concept. An apparent creep paradox, with calls to both reduce (e.g., harm) and expand (e.g., liberal prejudices, conservative moral foundations) concepts, poses a serious challenge to research on prejudice. I discuss the need for psychology to better capture Black experiences and to “tell it like it is” or risk becoming an irrelevant discipline of study. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - With the increased desire to engage in antiracist clinical research, there is a need for shared nomenclature on racism and related constructs to help move the science forward. This article breaks down the factors that contributed to the development and maintenance of racism (including racial microaggressions), provides examples of the many forms of racism, and describes the impact of racism for all. Specifically, in the United States, racism is based on race, a social construct that has been used to categorize people on the basis of shared physical and social features with the assumption of a racial hierarchy presumed to delineate inherent differences between groups. Racism is a system of beliefs, practices, and policies that operate to advantage those at the top of the racial hierarchy. Individual factors that contribute to racism include racial prejudices and racial discrimination. Racism can be manifested in multiple forms (e.g., cultural, scientific, social) and is both explicit and implicit. Because of the negative impact of racism on health, understanding racism informs effective approaches for eliminating racial health disparities, including a focus on the social determinants of health. Providing shared nomenclature on racism and related terminology will strengthen clinical research and practice and contribute to building a cumulative science. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - When graduates of Australian social work courses embark on a career in mental health, the systems they enter are complex, fragmented and evolving. Emerging practitioners will commonly be confronted by the loneliness, social exclusion, poverty and prejudice experienced by people living with mental distress; however, social work practice may not be focused on these factors. Instead, in accordance with the dominant biomedical perspective, symptom and risk management may predominate. Frustration with the limitations evident in this approach has seen the United Nations call for the transformation of mental health service delivery. Recognising paradigmatic influences on mental health social work may lead to a more considered enactment of person centred, recovery and rights-based approaches. This paper compares and contrasts influences of neo-liberalism, critical theory, human rights and post-structuralism on mental health social work practice. In preparing social work practitioners to recognise the influence of, and work more creatively with, intersecting paradigms, social work educators strive to foster a transformative approach to mental health practice that straddles discourses. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Ethnic stereotypes are cognitive markers that are formed and modified because of inter-cultural contact with a new cultural group. There is now much empirical evidence that explicates how stereotypes of ethnic groups can impact individuals’ acculturation experiences. However, what is unknown is how previously nonexistent ethnic beliefs are formed as a result of contact with the local culture. One hundred and seventy-four (N = 174) overseas Chinese construction workers were contacted through the Chinese Consulate in Montenegro and agreed to participate in the present study. The online questionnaire asked workers to describe Montenegrin majority members in terms of five characteristics. These traits formed the stereotype markers that were classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Sojourners also answered questions that measured perceived cultural distance, social exclusion, knowledge of Montenegrin culture, feelings of social exclusion, and their sociocultural adaptation. Results show that both positive and negative stereotypes are correlated with less social exclusion and better socio-cultural adaptation. Perceived cultural distance, knowledge of host culture and length of stay was mediated by stereotypes on adaptation outcomes. Interestingly longer sojourn did not lessen the type of stereotype, nor did it reduce cultural distance. Contribution to the stereotype literature and practical understanding of how Chinese sojourners see majority members will be discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The democratization of AI tools for content generation, combined with unrestricted access to mass media for all (e.g. through microblogging and social media), makes it increasingly hard for people to distinguish fact from fiction. This raises the question of how individual opinions evolve in such a networked environment without grounding in a known reality. The dominant approach to studying this problem uses simple models from the social sciences on how individuals change their opinions when exposed to their social neighborhood, and applies them on large social networks. We propose a novel model that incorporates two known social phenomena: (i) Biased Assimilation: the tendency of individuals to adopt other opinions if they are similar to their own; (ii) Backfire Effect: the fact that an opposite opinion may further entrench people in their stances, making their opinions more extreme instead of moderating them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DeGroot-type opinion formation model that captures the Backfire Effect. A thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of the proposed model reveals intuitive conditions for polarization and consensus to exist, as well as the properties of the resulting opinions. © 2021 Chen et al.

AB  - Objectives: Although the prevalence of ageism against older people has been well-established, less is known about the characteristics of those experiences or the experiences of young and middle-aged adults. The present study addressed these gaps by examining young, middle-aged, and older adults' self-reports of an ageist action they experienced. Methods: Participants' descriptions were coded for the domain in which the ageist experience occurred, the perpetrator of the ageist experience, and the type of ageist experience. Results: Young adults most commonly reported experiencing ageism in the workplace with coworkers as perpetrators. Middle-aged and older adults also reported ageism in the workplace; however, they also frequently reported experiencing ageism while seeking goods and services. Perpetrators of ageism varied more widely for middle-aged and older adults. Regardless of one's age, ageism was commonly experienced in the form of a lack of respect or incorrect assumptions. Discussion: The findings enhance our understanding of ageism across adulthood by considering the domains, perpetrators, and types of ageist expressions that adults of all ages encounter. They also suggest that interventions to reduce age bias will require multifaceted approaches that take into account the different forms that individuals experience across the life span. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Social interaction requires fast and efficient processing of another person’s intentions. In face-to-face interactions, aversive or appetitive actions typically co-occur with emotional expressions, allowing an observer to anticipate action intentions. In the present study, we investigated the influence of facial emotions on the processing of action intentions. Thirty-two participants were presented with video clips showing virtual agents displaying a facial emotion (angry vs. happy) while performing an action (punch vs. fist-bump) directed towards the observer. During each trial, video clips stopped at varying durations of the unfolding action, and participants had to recognize the presented action. Naturally, participants’ recognition accuracy improved with increasing duration of the unfolding actions. Interestingly, while facial emotions did not influence accuracy, there was a significant influence on participants’ action judgements. Participants were more likely to judge a presented action as a punch when agents showed an angry compared to a happy facial emotion. This effect was more pronounced in short video clips, showing only the beginning of an unfolding action, than in long video clips, showing near-complete actions. These results suggest that facial emotions influence anticipatory processing of action intentions allowing for fast and adaptive responses in social interactions. © 2021 Kroczek et al.

AB  - In today’s society where there is an abundance of accessible, complex, and often false information, critical thinking (CT) is an essential skill so that citizens in general and students in particular can make complex decisions based on scientific evidence, rather than on prejudices, biases, and pre-established beliefs. In this context, the purpose of this study is to discover whether Active Learning (AL) methodology, using different technologies, contributes to improving the CT of the student body, applying it to the Digital Gender Divide (DGD). Three questionnaires were used to collect information, using both a quantitative and a qualitative approach. Open-ended questions are included for fuller answers, which are complemented by content analysis of the recordings and virtual presentations made. The results show that the AL methodology favours the development of CT in the DGD in a remarkable way. Likewise, the various technologies implemented in the methodology (e.g., the Google Applications Site, online round table discussions, role-plays, virtual presentations, and forms) are relevant to improving CT in DGD. It concludes by recommending the implementation of AL with CT as in the one carried out, to help prepare better professionals and raise awareness of how to reduce the DGD. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Radicalization and violent extremism in young people are growing problems in almost every society around the globe. This article starts by briefly summarizing the result of several comprehensive reviews on the prevention of radicalization and violent extremism. Based on a new social-developmental model of radicalization, it then introduces the concept of developmental prevention and presents a review of prevention principles, approaches, and programs derived from a developmental perspective within four different fields of proximal radicalization processes. These include (1) identity problems; (2) prejudice and negative intergroup attitudes; (3) extremist narratives, beliefs, and ideologies; and (4) antisocial development. Overall, several approaches and programs reveal promising effect sizes for a developmentally founded prevention of radicalization. However, more sound evaluations are needed to further promote this field. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Using the latest (fourth) wave of Asian Barometer Survey (2014–2016), this study examines how national pride and two types of trust (general and particular) are related to nativist preference (cultural nativism), independent of anti-immigration attitudes, among citizens in East and Southeast Asian countries. Findings from multilevel models show that, at the individual level, national pride and particular trust are positively related to cultural nativism, while general trust is negatively related. At the subnational-regional level, we also find significant contextual effects. Living in geographic areas with greater national pride is positively associated with nativist preference, as is residency in places with higher levels of particular trust. In contrast, residency in subnational contexts with higher levels of general trust is negatively associated. Finally, the association between national pride and cultural nativism is stronger in regions with greater contextual national pride. © 2021

AB  - We examined majority group members’ perceptions of racial slurs, compared to what we have labeled as combination terms. These combination terms possess the same semantic and pragmatic linguistic functions as racial slurs, functioning to express negative emotion toward, and to describe, a target. Across three studies (total N = 943) racial slurs were not perceived as significantly different from combination terms. We then examined whether participants higher in social dominance beliefs reported greater perceived justification for using combination terms over racial slurs because of their lack of historical denigration of marginalized groups that racial slurs have. Participants, even those higher in socially dominant attitudes, did not perceive greater justification for the use of combination terms than racial slurs. Indeed, an important implication is that race-marking, an understudied area of social psychology, paired with general derogative terms produces terms which may function similarly to racial slurs, but, fortunately, are also similarly vilified in modern society. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Online perspective-taking experiments have demonstrated great potential in reducing prejudice towards disadvantaged groups such as refugees or Roma. These experiments trigger the psychological process of empathy and evoke feelings of compassion. Meanwhile, a growing literature argues that compassion towards the poor is an important predictor of support for social welfare. This paper bridges these two literatures and predicts that perspective-taking with the poor could increase support for welfare assistance. This hypothesis is tested in a pre-registered experiment conducted on a large and diverse online sample of US citizens (N = 3,431). Our results suggest that participants engaged with the perspective-taking exercise, wrote essays expressing strong emotions, but perspective-taking had no meaningful causal effect on general attitudes towards social welfare. We can confidently rule out effects exceeding 2 points on a 100-point scale. These results indicate that perspective-taking with a poor, deserving individual does not necessarily reduce stereotypes about the poor in general; nor does it change views towards redistributive policies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Children’s memberships in social groups have profound effects on their motivation. Stereotypes about social groups shape children’s beliefs about what is expected for their group members. These beliefs can influence children’s developing beliefs about themselves (self-perceptions). In this article, I review research on how gender stereotypes influence children’s motivation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), including ability beliefs and sense of belonging. When children belong to a gender group that is negatively stereotyped in a STEM field, they may doubt their own capabilities and whether they belong in that field, making it harder for them to develop interest over time. Developmentally, the influence of gender stereotypes on motivation begins during preschool and strengthens during late childhood. I also address the consequences of different kinds of stereotypes and why some children are more influenced by stereotypes than others. Understanding this process in childhood will help researchers design effective interventions to remedy educational inequities in STEM. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Decades of research have led to a solid understanding of the social systems of gregarious apes: chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and gibbons. As field studies have increasingly collected data from multiple neighboring habituated groups, genetic and social interconnections have been revealed. These findings provide a more nuanced picture of intergroup relations in apes, and have led to claims in the literature that some ape taxa have multilevel societies. A multilevel society is defined as a nested collection of social entities comprising at least two discernible levels of social integration between the individual and the population. We argue that the evidence for multilevel sociality sensu stricto in apes is currently inconclusive and that it is premature to abandon the traditional classification of ape social systems. However, available findings appear to be consistent with the existence of some degree of higher social grouping patterns. We propose the term supra-group organization which may adequately capture ape social systems when viewed from a top-down perspective. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The effects of intergroup dialogues on intercultural relations in digital societies and the growing conflict, inflammatory and hate speech phenomena characterizing these environments are receiving increasing attention in socio-psychological studies. Based on Allport’s contact theory, scholars have shown that online intercultural contact reduces ethnic prejudice and discrimination, although it is not yet clear when and how this occurs. By analyzing the role of the Dialogical Self in online intercultural dialogues, we aim to understand how individuals position themselves and others at three levels of inclusiveness—personal, social, and human—and how this process is associated with attitudes towards the interlocutor, intergroup bias and prejudice, whilst also considering the inclusion of the Other in the Self and ethnic/racial identity. An experimental procedure was administered via the Qualtrics platform, and data were collected among 118 undergraduate Italian students through an anonymous questionnaire. From ANOVA and moderation analysis, it emerged that the social level of inclusiveness was positively associated with ethnic/racial identity and intergroup bias. Furthermore, the human level of inclusiveness was associated with the inclusion of the Other in the Self and ethnic/racial identity, and unexpectedly, also with intergroup bias. We conclude that when people interact online as “human beings”, the positive effect of online dialogue fails, hindering the differentiation processes necessary to define one’s own and the interlocutor’s identities. We discuss the effects of intercultural dialogue in the landscape of digital societies and the relevance of our findings for theory, research and practice. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Plastic surgery is a dynamic and evolving field but remains poorly understood due to lack of knowledge, media misconceptions and recent changes to medical undergraduate curricula. To address issues around student interest and recruitment into the speciality, it is imperative to understand the factors influencing medical students and future clinicians. Aims: To examine influences, interest and perceptions of plastic surgery amongst Scottish medical students and explore methods to increase undergraduate engagement. Method: Cross-sectional survey distributed online via Scottish undergraduate medical school offices comprising 6 domains: demographics; career interest; perceptions, interests and influences in plastic surgery; curriculum and trainer views; understanding the role of a plastic surgeon; and undergraduate engagement. Results: A total of 193 students responded with no statistically significant relationship between year group, gender, and interest in plastic surgery. Phrases most strongly identified with plastic surgery included private practice, reconstruction and cosmetics. Placements, teaching staff and workshops/courses were found to influence perception of plastic surgery. Fortunately, only 6% of students encountered antagonism towards plastic surgery encompassing themes of negative stereotypes of surgeons and connotations surrounding cosmetic surgery. Importantly, many students were largely unaware of the range of common procedures undertaken by plastic surgeons. To overcome this lack of awareness and generate greater interest, students suggested greater plastics exposure, consultant-led teaching and workshops showcasing the specialty. Conclusion: Medical students want varied, stimulating and flexible careers – something which plastic surgery can provide. However it seems the understanding of the scope of plastic surgery is poorly understood amongs future trainees. To increase uptake and interest, negative perceptions need to be addressed and greater engagement is required from medical school upwards. © 2021

AB  - Objective: To explore entry-level physiotherapy students’ attitudes and beliefs relating to weight bias and stigmatisation in healthcare. Design: Cross sectional survey of physiotherapy students. Methods: All final year physiotherapy students (n = 215) enrolled in entry-level physiotherapy programmes in the Republic of Ireland were invited to participate. Each received a questionnaire, consisting of 72 questions, within four key sections. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to analyse the data. Results: A response rate of 83% (179/215) was achieved. Whilst physiotherapy students, overall, had a positive attitude towards people with obesity, 29% had a negative attitude towards people with obesity, 24% had a negative attitude towards managing this population and most (74%) believed obesity was caused by behavioural and individual factors. Over one third of students (35%) reported that they would not be confident in managing patients with obesity and more than half (54%) felt treating patients with obesity was not worthwhile. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary findings to suggest that weight stigma-reduction efforts are warranted for physiotherapy students. Helping students to understand that obesity is a complex, chronic condition with multiple aspects requiring a multi-faceted approach to its management might be the first step towards dispelling these negative attitudes towards patients living with obesity. Inclusion of a formal obesity curriculum should perhaps now be part of the contemporary physiotherapy students’ education. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Researchers from marginalized groups often make important social scientific discoveries about prejudice, particularly when they are members of the group under investigation (e.g., women studying sexism, Black Americans studying racism). But is the scientific integrity and validity of their work perceived differently by virtue of their membership in the marginalized group? Across three survey experiments conducted in the domains of weight stigma, racism, and sexism research (total N = 1317), we find that researchers from a marginalized group whose research focuses on prejudice against their ingroup face a double-edged sword. On one hand, they are perceived as having greater psychological standing and expertise in the research area owing to their personal experience and insight into the processes they are researching. This, in turn, facilitates greater trust in, and perceived legitimacy of, their research. On the other hand, their research is simultaneously considered less trustworthy and legitimate because it is perceived as being motivated by a vested interest, in terms of having a personal agenda in the research. These findings demonstrate the competing biases that affect public perceptions of marginalized group researchers and their work in the area of prejudice. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This critical review is one of the first to take a lifespan approach to examine the emotion regulation (ER) and coping strategies used by African Americans in response to racial-related adversities (e.g., discrimination, racism, prejudice) and to discuss why African Americans may engage in these specific strategies. The current review found that African Americans continue to experience racial discrimination throughout the lifespan. The most prominent coping and ER strategies among African American in response to racial discrimination appear to be negative emotion expression suppression, avoidant coping, social support, and religion/spirituality. The review discusses various factors that may underlie these patterns (e.g., power differentials, African Americans’ history and African culture) and also limitations of current ER and coping research. By examining stability and changes across the lifespan, time, and varying situations, more inferences about patterns of coping and ER and contributing factors can be made to better determine ways to help decrease or mitigate the effects of racial stress on African Americans’ lives. © 2021

AB  - Adolescence can be a tumultuous period with numerous threats to self-integrity. A 3-year field experiment tested whether repeated affirmations of self-integrity can help lessen the impact of psychological threat on adolescent (11–14 years old) students’ core course GPA over time. A diverse cohort of students (N = 163) was randomly assigned to a control condition or to an affirmation condition, in which teachers repeatedly administered classroom writing exercises that affirmed students’ personal values. Results showed that affirmation lessened a downward trajectory of GPA over time. In contrast to previous research, this effect occurred among all ethnic groups rather than only among stereotype-threatened ethnic minority groups. Affirmation did not reduce self-reported psychological threat, but it severed its relationship with performance: Among control students, psychological threat predicted lower GPA. Among affirmed students, psychological threat was unrelated to performance. Beyond their practical implications, these results make two theoretical contributions. First, affirmation can have broader benefits than those previously documented among negatively stereotyped groups, if timed to co-occur with different sources of threat that emerge over a long developmental window. Second, the effect of affirmation may not be so much to reduce threat as to disrupt its adverse cognitive and motivational effects. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - In recent years, European countries have become hosting destinations for thousands of people who have been forced to leave their home countries. Greece is one of the main European hosting countries of refugees, especially children. Thus, the pupil population is gradually changing and the need for intercultural education is increasing. Physical education (PE) and sports have been recorded as suitable contexts for this process. However, there are still many challenges present in these contexts. The following study attempts to present the perceptions of PE teachers, coaches, and academics on the inclusion of refugees in PE and sports. Fifteen PE teachers/coaches and academics involved in the field of intercultural education participated in the study. A phenomenological approach was followed through semi-structured interviews. The method of thematic analysis was chosen to analyze the data. While all the participants considered PE and sports to be the most suitable contexts for the inclusion of refugees, they emphasized certain barriers to be overcome: The lack of training for PE teachers and coaches, prejudices of the parents of both natives and refugees, and refugees' socioeconomic status and gender issues. Participants also shared their ideas for an adequate training program to improve PE teachers' and coaches' attitudes and promote their knowledge and skills regarding the inclusion of refugees. The participants underlined the need for intercultural education and well-structured training programs to properly manage culturally diverse environments. © 2021 Eleftheria Papageorgiou et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Who is most likely to consider diverse representation desirable? Previous literature typically emphasizes the importance of partisanship and group identity congruence (i.e., women representing women) in influencing attitudes about descriptive representation. Alternatively, we test whether the racialized politics that emerged in 2016 might now shape views about representation by members of underrepresented groups. Using data from the 2016 ANES, we examine attitudes toward increasing the number of women and Hispanic representatives. Rather than partisanship or identity congruence, our results point to the primacy of racial attitudes, linked fate, and feminism in shaping views about diverse representation. Indeed, even when examining attitudes about increased representation by women, we find strong evidence that opinions are now racialized. We argue for a more expansive understanding of support for descriptive representation, which may reflect an individual’s opinions of marginalized groups and structural inequities more broadly. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The right-wing Hindu nationalist “Hindutva” movement in India has political control of the world’s most populous democracy. To gain insight into the tools of the movement, this paper examines Hindutva framing rhetoric. Social movement framing entails the crafting of movement messages to motivate collective identity and collective action. This paper takes a new approach to studying social movement framing by using the social psychological principle of metacontrast as an organizing theoretical framework. Metacontrast involves minimizing differences within the group (intragroup homogenization) and maximizing differences between groups (intergroup polarization). We argue dual homogenizing-polarizing frames work in concert to construct a unified collective identity and mobilize concerted collective action. Using qualitative content analysis of two Hindutva organization websites, we find Hindutva framing rhetoric simultaneously homogenizes and polarizes through two framing strategies: a threat-counter threat frame that portrays an antagonistic outgroup that must be countered with a unified ingroup, and a striking positive-negative intergroup contrast that paints the ingroup as a moral protector and the outgroup as a vilified adversary. Notably, key to these efforts is the minimization of deeply entrenched, rigid caste differences. Our findings have implications for the study of social movements, nationalism, collective identity, collective action, and intergroup relations. © 2021 Eastern Sociological Society

AB  - One of the current and visible controversies in UK policing that challenges the heart and foundation of the principle of law is arguably the apparent disproportionate use of stop and search powers involving ethnic minority communities. Prior research found that differential exposure by the police to certain types of suspected offenders led to the development of cognitive scripts that operate as stereotypes and which may play a role in informing suspicions concerning police stops and searches. Focusing on whether police officers use negative stereotypes to inform suspicions when conducting stops and searches, this study examined more than 2,100 stop and search records held by a police force in England, in addition to conducting 20 semi-structured interviews with frontline serving police officers from the same force. It was found that the use of stop and search powers is consistent with: (a) the use of stereotypes with respect to age, appearance, and social class; and (b) the disproportionate recorded use of stop and search powers involving Black, Asian and Mixed communities. The implications of these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Abuse against women’s rights activists is a serious concern, but there is a lack of research into strategies on how to reduce this. Past research has identified self-affirmation (i.e., thinking about one’s valued traits) and perspective-taking as promising strategies to reduce minority target backlash. Through one pilot study (n = 98), and one two-part experimental study (n = 202), we tested the effect of perspective-taking and self-affirmation on empathy toward feminism among men. Fictional Facebook profiles were manipulated to encourage perspective-taking, perspective-taking with self-affirmation, or were neutral in content. Participants then rated feelings toward individual feminists as well as feelings (in the context of perspective-taking emotions) toward abuse faced by feminists more generally. Results indicated that perspective-taking combined with self-affirmation promoted empathetic feelings (as represented by perspective-taking emotions) toward feminists experiencing abuse. The impact on empathy was particularly strong among men with high initial prejudice toward feminists. These results suggest that self-affirmation could potentially reduce online abuse of feminists through an increase in empathetic feelings. This research has broader implications for male engagement within feminism, and we recommend that educators and male allies of feminism promote positive, affirming roles for men (e.g., as fathers), as this may encourage empathy toward feminist issues. Policy makers could consider this strategy in the context of promoting policies such as shared parental leave.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Despite substantial evidence documenting weight stigma toward people with higher body weight, international comparative studies are lacking in this field. The few studies that have compared weight stigma across different countries focus on explicit weight-biased attitudes rather than people’s experiences of weight stigma. The present study conducted a multinational systematic comparison of weight stigma in six countries to assess experiences and interpersonal sources of weight stigma. Subjects/Methods: Adults (N = 13,996) enrolled in WW International (formerly Weight Watchers), residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the US completed identical online anonymous surveys in the dominant language for their country. Surveys assessed their history of experiencing weight stigma, the onset of stigmatizing experiences and associated distress from stigma in different time periods, and interpersonal sources of weight stigma. Results: More than half of participants (55.6–61.3%) across countries reported experiencing weight stigma. Participants with higher BMI were significantly more likely to report weight-stigmatizing experiences than individuals with lower BMI. In all countries, weight stigma experiences were most frequent in childhood and adolescence, with associated distress highest during these time periods. Participants in Germany reported a higher frequency of weight stigma across their whole life, but lower distress associated with stigmatizing experiences, compared to participants in the other five countries. High percentages of participants in each country experienced weight stigma from family members (76.0–87.8%), classmates (72.0–80.9%), doctors (62.6–73.5%), co-workers (54.1–61.7%), and friends (48.8–66.2%). Conclusions: Weight stigma is prevalent for adults actively engaged in weight management across different Western countries. There were more similarities than differences in the nature, frequency, and interpersonal sources of people’s experiences of weight stigma across the six countries in this study. Findings underscore the need for multinational initiatives to address weight stigma and interventions to support individuals engaged in weight management who experience weight mistreatment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - This article explores why cultural branding – ideo-affective market communication addressing intense political tensions – paradoxically seems to lead to political inertia rather than political mobilization. I critically analyse advertising addressing political tensions related to race, ethnicity and immigration, but instead of only following the traced-out trajectory of postcolonial theory, I use the lens of Žižek’s radicalized Lacanian psychoanalysis and treat the therapeutic visuality in cultural branding as ideological fantasies of the market’s multicultural imaginary. Through critical visual methodologies, I situate four ‘multicultural’ commercials in their culture- and idea historical contexts, and juxtapose a postcolonial with a Žižekian reading for each of them. I come to argue that the market’s multicultural imaginary (unconsciously) serves important ideological functions in sustaining the political status quo not foremost because it placates anxiety, but because it doesn’t. Tapping into previous discussions in critical marketing on fetishistic disavowal and inversion, I offer yet another explanation. The political inertia following from ideo-affective dimensions of cultural branding does not primarily come from therapeutic sedation, but from the opposite, namely the parallax object’s upholding of gruesome tension and suspense; a fetishistic tickling. This article ends by critiquing the compulsory use of postcolonial theory in research on racial and ethnic relations. From the Žižekian reading, it appears that the postcolonial gaze is now a punishing agency like any dominant ideology, where the social inequality of global capitalism is deemed a more bearable alternative than the traumatic horror of visible racism, which, subsequently, closes the circuit from radical politics. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Black athletes have had to express a double consciousness of being American and being Black. By exploring the biographies of pioneering tennis figures—Althea Gibson, Arthur Ashe, and the Williams sisters—Venus and Serena—one can look at their encounters with racism and their quests for self-respect and explore the social implications of race in the USA. To understand race and its complications on the world in which black tennis players navigate, we broadly look at racial discrimination in their lives using the lens of sociological concepts such as “the color line” hypersegregation and “American Apartheid;” the controlling image thesis and respectability politics, and class mobility in and outside the black community. The concepts connect to illuminate the racial constructs and structures the players operated in and which shaped in the process of becoming a sports champion. Through their biographies, we argue that it is possible to interrogate the ways in which America’s longstanding racial policies, prejudices, and perspectives have had a persistent impact on not only the lives of black tennis players, but the lives of black Americans. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: In France, general practitioners (GPs) are usually the first-line healthcare contact for breast cancer (BC) screening/diagnosis in older women, information about therapies, access to cancer specialists, management of comorbidities and follow-up. GPs' practices may influence the factors involved in the unfavorable prognosis of BC in older patients: delay in diagnosis, insufficiently active treatment and the impact of associated morbidities. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore GPs' experience, to understand the factors which shape their care of older women with BC and to identify ways in which this care might be improved. Method: This was a two-part qualitative study among GPs following COREQ guidelines. We analysed themes arising from group and semi-directive personal interviews. Results: GPs had diverse attitudes caused by 1/ the GPs' professional values, in response to their mission for local referral, their overall knowledge of the patient's context and wishes; 2/ the impact of comorbidities; 3/ the GPs' own experiences (confrontation with the disease, emotional ties established with the patient, embarrassment about examinations); 4/ prejudicial connotations (therapies judged as being too aggressive). GPs expressed interest for training, for inclusion in a coordinated multidisciplinary organisation with oncologists and geriatricians, confirming the GP's position (to better inform their patients, participate in the therapeutic decision and ensure the continuity of care). Conclusion: To improve their care of older patients with BC, GPs would welcome improved relationships with geriatricians and oncologists, more information support and a more clearly defined role in the geriatric oncology care pathway. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To examine the mental health experiences of international graduate students of Color (IGSC) as they navigate through a multitude of systemic barriers, the researchers interviewed eight IGSC in the U.S. Adopting a critical race perspective, the researchers sought to address a persistent gap in the counseling literature, and explore how systemic influences of racism, xenophobia, and discriminatory policies impacted the mental health of IGSC. Three distinct themes emerged from phenomenological analysis of the participants’ interviews in the current study: cross-cultural challenges, surviving racism and anti-immigrant sentiment, and mental health and wellness. Implications for how professional counselors can support IGSC as they navigate through multiple challenges are emphasized. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: Implicit bias contributes to both health care disparities and professional limitations, and it exists among physicians. Prior literature has described physician weight bias (WB) toward patients, but little research has investigated interphysician WB. This study describes the prevalence of interphysician implicit WB and investigates the relationships between implicit, explicit, and professional biases. The authors hypothesized that the majority of physicians possess interphysician implicit WB and that the degree of implicit bias has a direct relationship with explicit and professional WB. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a survey was used to measure interphysician implicit, explicit, and professional WB. It included adaptations of two previously validated measures (the Implicit Association Test and the Crandall Anti-fat Attitudes Questionnaire) and an investigator developed and tested Professional Weight Bias Scale. The survey was distributed electronically via medical society message boards, email lists, and social media groups. Results: A total of 620 physicians and medical students participated. Fifty-eight percent were female, ages ranged from 22 to 83 years (mean = 44 years), and body mass index (BMI) ranged from 16 to 59 (mean = 26). Descriptive analyses revealed that 87% had some degree of implicit interphysician antifat bias, with 31% and 34% categorized as moderate and severe, respectively. Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed that male sex, increased age, and decreased BMI were related to increased implicit bias, controlling for all other factors. Furthermore, implicit, explicit, and professional bias all had significant, direct relationships with each other. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the prevalence of interphysician implicit WB; the strong correlations between implicit, explicit, and professional WB; and the potential disparities faced by physicians with obesity. These results may be used to guide implicit bias training for a more inclusive medical workplace. © 2021 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

AB  - Lesbian-parented families challenge the heteronormative dominant discourse of family in major social institutions such as schools. This study explores Greek lesbian mothers' experiences and perceptions of their interaction with the school personnel and other parents. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse the data obtained through in-person interviews with 14 lesbian mothers. The study revealed three overarching themes: (a) anticipating teachers' rejection, (b) non-traditional family models are not addressed in school curricula, and (c) Managing disclosure. Participants' experiences of anticipated rejection, of hiding and concealing their family structure and sexual identity confirm that LGBTQ+ individuals live in a macro- and micro-environmental context which adds to minority stress and produces essential new challenges. The findings of this study are discussed in the light of the institutional sources of minority stress that affect lesbian mothers. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Previous research located two opposite findings and frequently used threat perceptions and value-support to explain the relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants: Religious individuals have negative attitudes toward immigrants because they support conservative values and feel threatened by unfamiliar groups. Second, they are open toward immigrants because they integrate prosocial and altruistic teachings of religion into their daily lives. Both lines have been confirmed repeatedly, which is puzzling. I argue that we need to consider all three factors (religiosity, value-support, threat perceptions) simultaneously and explore their mutual interactions. In this study, I test this line of argumentation empirically with data from the European Social Survey (Round 7). The analyses reveal that religiosity has the weakest direct effect on attitudes toward immigrants. Threat perceptions, on the other hand, have the strongest direct effects, followed by value-support. However, religiosity affects the attitudes toward immigrants indirectly via threat perceptions. These findings highlight that religiosity, value-support, and threat perceptions are closely linked and need simultaneous consideration to make reliable claims about their effects. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Despite extensive discussion about the shape of post-pandemic trade recovery after the COVID-19 outbreak, no consensus has been reached. Using 414 outbreaks as exogenous shocks from 1951 to 2015 and matching bilateral trade data, we find that outbreaks have a significant long-term negative impact on the export of affected countries. The results show that it takes at least five years after the end of an epidemic for the export levels of affected countries to recover to the ex-ante average. Our mechanism analysis shows that the prejudice generated by an outbreak has long-lasting adverse effects on exports. Our heterogeneity analysis shows that the negative impact of epidemic prejudice on exports is more pronounced for trading partners with greater linguistic and cultural differences, weaker political ties, and larger income gaps. Our findings contribute to understanding the post-pandemic global trade recovery process and validate behavioral economics and social psychology theories. © 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland

AB  - Theories of stereotyping and prejudice have yet to be comprehensively applied to accents. U.S. adults (n = 124) listened to clips from Indian, Latinx, Arabic, and Toronto-accented speakers. They then completed stereotype measures based on solidarity, status, dynamism (SSD), and the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), and evaluated the speakers. Stereotypes, but not evaluations, differed between accents. Results suggest that measures of warmth and competence may be sufficient to capture differences in accent-based stereotyping. Authoritarianism predicted accent-based prejudice against non-North American accents relative to Toronto accents (as in-group allies), whereas social dominance orientation predicted more negative evaluations overall. Neither ideological belief predicted stereotypes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research suggests that weight-related teasing is associated with body concerns and disordered eating in male and female adolescents and women. Yet, little is known about these associations for young men with diverse racial and ethnic identities. This study examined the association of weight-related teasing frequency and distress with body concerns, loss of control (LOC) eating, dietary restraint, and history of psychiatric and medical diagnoses in racially and ethnically diverse young men. Racial and ethnic identity was examined as a potential moderator. Participants (N = 1,069; 18–30 years; Mage = 24.1 ± 3.6 years) completed an online survey and reported on general demographics; weight-related teasing; body concerns; LOC eating frequency in the last 28 days; dietary restraint; and history of psychiatric and medical diagnoses. All models adjusted for BMI, income, education, and history of psychiatric diagnoses (when not the dependent variable). Both weight-related teasing frequency and distress were significantly and positively linked with all dependent variables, and these associations did not significantly vary by racial and ethnic identity. These findings suggest that, much like in prior research with adolescents and women, experiences with weight-related teasing are associated with body concerns, disordered eating, and poorer health in racially and ethnically diverse young men, regardless of body size. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Affective polarization is a key concern in America and other democracies. Although past evidence suggests some ways to minimize it, there are no easily applicable interventions that have been found to work in the increasingly polarized climate. This project examines whether irrelevant factors, or incidental happiness more specifically, have the power to reduce affective polarization (i.e., misattribution of affect or “carryover effect”). On the flip side, happiness can minimize systematic processing, thus enhancing beliefs in conspiracy theories and impeding individual ability to recognize deep fakes. Three preregistered survey experiments in the US, Poland, and the Netherlands (total N = 3611) induced happiness in three distinct ways. Happiness had no effects on affective polarization toward political outgroups and hostility toward various divisive social groups, and also on endorsement of conspiracy theories and beliefs that a deep fake was real. Two additional studies in the US and Poland (total N = 2220), also induced anger and anxiety, confirming that all these incidental emotions had null effects. These findings, which emerged uniformly in three different countries, among different partisan and ideological groups, and for those for whom the inductions were differently effective, underscore the stability of outgroup attitudes in contemporary America and other countries. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This study examined the role of group norms, group identity, age, contact, and stereotypes on youths’ decisions to include a peer in an intergroup context portraying Lebanese and American adolescents. Lebanese participants (N = 275), ages 12 and 16 years, were surveyed about expectations for inclusion of an out-group target with similar interests or an in-group target with different interests into their own Lebanese group or another American group. Findings indicated participants focused on shared interests, rather than national identity, when making inclusion decisions for either group and group norms mattered. Older participants expected American peers to be less inclusive towards an out-group peer. Direct contact predicted inclusivity of out-group American peers into one’s own Lebanese group, and indirect media-based contact predicted expectations for inclusivity into an American out-group. Findings have implications for interventions aimed at improving cross-national friendships which, in turn, have the potential to reduce prejudicial attitudes. © 2021 The British Psychological Society

AB  - The current study examined intergroup-related and social-cognitive correlates of bystanders' acceptability judgements and their responses to bias-based bullying of immigrant peers and to possible retaliation for the bullying. Participants included 179 immigrant-origin and non-immigrant-origin youth (Mage = 13.23; SD = 1.55; 79 immigrant-origin youth). Participants' bystander judgements and responses to bullying and retaliation were examined via a hypothetical scenario. Further, participants' intergroup attitudes towards immigrants and their social-cognitive skills were evaluated. ANOVA results showed that immigrant-origin youth judged bullying as less acceptable and retaliation as more acceptable compared to non-immigrant-origin youth, documenting that group membership is related to adolescents' judgements. A similar pattern was observed in active bystander responses. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that immigration background, intergroup process in the context of immigration, and social-cognitive skills predict bystander responses to bullying and retaliation. This study provides important implications for anti-bullying intervention programmes to overcome the negative consequences of retaliation in the escalation of aggressive behaviours. © 2021 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Non-binary and genderqueer identities often resonate with people whose genders are outside the man-woman dichotomy, fluid, androgynous, and/or variant. Yet the gender binary system remains the unwavering norm, often placing non-binary and genderqueer people on the margins of social acceptability, and surprisingly little research has investigated those who stigmatize non-binary/genderqueer people. The current study utilizes Worthen’s (2020) Norm-Centered Stigma Theory (NCST) and nationally representative data collected from U.S. online panelists (n = 3009: 1419 cis men, 1461 cis women, 74 trans women, 55 trans men) to investigate how norms (cisnormativity) and gender identity axes of social power (man/woman, cis/trans, and intersecting cis/trans-man/woman identities) relate to the stigmatization of non-binary/genderqueer people. Overall findings indicate that (a) cisnormativity is integral to understanding non-binary/genderqueer stigma, (b) the stigmatizer’s gender identity axes of social power are essential to explore as related to both cisnormativity and non-binary/genderqueer stigma, and (c) cisgender women are significantly different from others when it comes to both cisnormativity and non-binary/genderqueer stigma. Overall, the results underscore the significance of focusing on the unique complexities involved in the stigmatization of non-binary/genderqueer people and work toward dismantling such negativities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper examines employment-related gender discrimination during the initial stages of a hiring process. It specifically focuses on recent college graduates in China. By examining firms’ responses to fictitious resumes with randomly generated information on gender and other key attributes of applicants (e.g., school reputation, student's academic achievement, and leadership experiences), this study is able to separate the effect of gender on a student's potential for getting an on-site interview from the confounding effects of other factors. The findings reveal that, with all other factors remaining constant, female applicants, on average, are less likely to be invited by hiring firms to on-site interviews as compared with their male counterparts. Furthermore, gender discrimination in computer and mathematics, architecture and engineering, and sales occupations appears to be driving the results of this study. The qualitative evidence based on interviews with firm recruiters suggests that the findings of this study are generally consistent with the role congruity theory of prejudice in psychology literature. While the finding that the quality of a job candidate (academic achievement and leadership experience) does not reduce gender discrimination offers some evidence to support a taste-based discrimination view, we do not have enough evidence to support a statistical discrimination view. © 2021 Association for Comparative Economic Studies

AB  - The current research investigates the role of racialized work ethic stereotypes on attitudes toward welfare. We hypothesized that work ethic stereotypes shape both people’s attitudes toward welfare and their perceptions of who benefits from these policies. Consistent with hypotheses, when the demographic composition of welfare recipients was majority Black (vs. White), participants thought recipients were lazier and were less positive to welfare programs and policies (Study 1). Describing welfare recipients as hardworking (vs. no information control) mitigated this effect, even when the demographic composition of welfare recipients was majority Black (Study 2). Finally, we investigated whether work ethic stereotypes shape both attitudes toward welfare and spontaneous mental images of recipients. Images generated when participants were asked to envision hardworking (vs. lazy) recipients were rated by a separate sample as more representative of White Americans and garnered more support for providing welfare benefits (Study 3). © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Turkey hosts the largest Syrian refugee population in the world. As an attempt to understand antecedents of residents attitudes towards Syrian refugees, the present study aimed to investigate the relationships between contact experience, perception of threat, and the attitudes. Specifically, we hypothesized that perception of threat would mediate the relationship between contact experience and the attitudes. Frequency of different contact types, threats associated with economic, cultural, and criminal risks, and attitudes towards male or female targets based on preferred social distance were subjected to analyses in an adult sample of 170 women and 183 men. Results revealed a full mediation effect both for female and male Syrian refugee targets. We discussed the findings referring the observed nature of contact as mostly being casual, threat level being high, and attitudes being relatively negative within a specific media-effects framework. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that situational factors such as perceived threats to the social order activate latent authoritarianism. The deadly COVID-19 pandemic presents a rare opportunity to test whether existential threat stemming from an indiscriminate virus moderates the relationship between authoritarianism and political attitudes toward the nation and out-groups. Using data from two large nationally representative samples of adults in the United Kingdom (N = 2,025) and Republic of Ireland (N = 1,041) collected during the initial phases of strict lockdown measures in both countries, we find that the associations between right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and (1) nationalism and (2) anti-immigrant attitudes are conditional on levels of perceived threat. As anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic increases, so too does the effect of RWA on those political outcomes. Thus, it appears that existential threats to humanity from the COVID-19 pandemic moderate expressions of authoritarianism in society. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Although an increasing number of studies emphasise migrants’ lack of knowledge about their childcare rights as a crucial barrier to their childcare usage, almost none examines the conditions under which migrant families acquire this knowledge. This study contributes to the literature by exploring potential individual factors determining migrant families’ knowledge about their childcare rights in Germany. I use unique data collected through the project Migrants’ Welfare State Attitudes (MIFARE), in which nine different migrant groups in Germany were surveyed about their relation to the welfare state, including childcare. Analysing a total sample of 623 migrants living with children in their household and by using logistic regression analyses, I find that human and social capital play significant roles in explaining migrants’ knowledge about their childcare rights. Migrants who speak the host language sufficiently are more likely to know about their childcare rights; however, it does not matter whether migrants are lower or higher educated. Moreover, I observe that migrants benefit from their co-ethnic relations only if childcare usage is high among their ethnic group. Based on these results, policy recommendations are discussed in order to increase migrants’ knowledge about their childcare rights in Germany. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Positive intergroup contact, under some conditions, can undermine the interest of members of both socially disadvantaged and advantaged groups to act for equality. However, little is known about whether similar effects appear in a unique form of intergroup relations, gender relations. In two correlational studies and two experiments, we investigated the relationships among quality of contact, perceived discrimination, fusion with the feminist movement, and willingness to engage in collective action for women’s rights. For women (Study 1a), positive contact with men was associated with less perceived discrimination, less fusion, and less collective action. For men (Study 1b), the relationships were in the opposite direction. Studies 2a and 2b revealed that recalling experiences of gender discrimination nullified the effects of contact for both women and men as compared to a control condition. Thus, when discrimination is not explicitly recognized, positive contact might have sedative effects on women, but mobilizing effects on men. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Border closures associated with COVID-19 constitute a response to an exogenous shock unrelated to migration. In this IMR Dispatch, we argue that the impact of policies initially implemented to halt movement and curb the spread of the disease will nonetheless have medium- and longer term consequences for international migration. Specifically, we argue that these initial border restrictions have set in motion demographic and sociological processes that are likely to culminate in greater support for restricting future migration. Based on demographic evidence, we posit that after extended suppression of migration, OECD countries and Russia will see a migration spike, akin to a “baby boom” for fertility rebounds. Drawing on sociological theory and research, we hypothesize that these spikes in migration will increase anti-immigrant sentiment among native-born residents in destination countries and mobilize political support for reintroducing restrictive migration policies — triggering a feedback loop. In an effort to help facilitate future research and empirical tests of our model, we identify key concepts, processes, and data sources for the analysis of the pandemic’s impact on international migration over time. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Although right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) are the two most studied individual difference correlates of prejudice, debate remains over their status as enduring constructs that precede generalized prejudice. We contribute to this discussion using 10 annual waves of longitudinal data from a nationwide random sample of adults to investigate the stability and temporal precedence of RWA, SDO, and prejudice among members of an ethnic majority group (Ns = 23,383–47,217). Results reveal high wave-to-wave rank-order stability for RWA, SDO, and generalized prejudice. Adjusting for their between-person stability, RWA and SDO predicted within-person increases in generalized prejudice. Results replicated when predicting (a) prejudice toward three specific minority groups (namely, Māori, Pacific Islanders, and Asians) and (b) anti-minority beliefs. These findings demonstrate that RWA and SDO are highly stable over 10 consecutive years and that they independently precede within-person annual increases in generalized prejudice and anti-minority beliefs. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In response to current anti-immigration rhetoric and policy coming from national leadership, the authors engage in multimodal analysis of picture books that humanize individuals who make the journey across the Mexico–U.S. border. Findings suggest that picture book narratives restory anti-immigrant sentiments by (1) placing the child at the center of the story, (2) demonstrating the way in which the (im)migration journey is a shared journey, and (3) featuring expressions of tenderness among the characters. The article emphasizes the importance of elevating young people’s perspectives on Latinx (im)migration through children’s literature. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Introduction: This study compared childless Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals to their heterosexual counterparts on anticipation of stigma upon parenthood and assessed its mediating role in the association between being a member of a sexual minority and lower parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations. Methods: A total of 612 childless participants (174 self-reported as LGB people) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 31.18, SD = 3.89) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2019 and February 2020. They completed online questionnaires assessing their anticipation of stigma upon parenthood, parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations. Results: LGB individuals reported a higher anticipation of stigma upon parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. The anticipation of stigma upon parenthood fully mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower parenting desires and intentions and partially mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower estimated likelihood of parenthood. Conclusions and Policy Implications : The findings are interpreted in light of LGB possible awareness of prejudice and discrimination by local legislation that prohibits or impedes sexual minorities from pursuing parenthood. Policymakers and health professionals should be alerted to the impact of anticipation of stigma when accounting for the disparities in parenting aspirations between LGB individuals and heterosexual counterparts and its possible connections to discriminatory Israeli social policies toward LGB rights. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - How do people react to foreign actors’ involvement in a conflict in a third party? Many studies have explored how individuals react to their country’s foreign policy choices, as well as how they react to the policies targeting their countries. Yet, we know less about how they form their attitudes regarding the policies not directly aiming at their own countries, and hence, their well-being. Building on intergroup relations and employing a social psychological approach, this article argues that identity serves as a heuristic through which individuals evaluate foreign actors, and their policies targeting in- and out-group members living abroad. Conducting a survey experiment in Turkey, I test my claims in the context of the Syrian Civil War. The findings of the experiments reveal that transnational identity ties have an impact on attitude formation: Turks and Kurds express positive/negative attitudes towards the USA and Russia conditional on whether their involvement to the conflict favor/disfavor their in-group/out-group across the border. Broadly speaking, the results show that domestic cleavages are of importance in predicting the public’s reaction to the developments in international politics, which implies a necessity of taking domestic politics in designing soft power promotion and public diplomacy strategies for many global and regional powers in attempting to win hearts and minds abroad. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Introduction: Prejudice toward sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals plays a significant role in SGM youth healthcare. This study examines relations between psychosocial predictors (spirituality, religiosity, SGM education, experience with SGM individuals) and SGM moral condemnation among three distinct samples. Methods: This study utilized online questionnaires to assess moral condemnation toward SGM individuals, religiosity, spirituality, SGM experience, and education/training about SGM individuals. The questionnaires were distributed to a college sample, community sample, and pediatric healthcare provider sample. Data were collected in years 2016–2019. Results: Religiosity positively predicted moral condemnation in all three samples. Spirituality positively predicted moral condemnation in the community and college samples, but not the provider sample. Education about SGM individuals, previous experience with SGM individuals, having a close SGM friend/family member, and self-reporting previous personal discrimination experiences, as a set, significantly explained additional variance in SGM moral condemnation within the community and college sample, but not within the healthcare provider sample. Conclusion: This study lays groundwork for innovative research to further improve pediatric SGM healthcare and to increase the extent to which SGM youth disclose and discuss specific healthcare risks with their medical providers. Policy Implications: There is a significant need for social policy focused on decreasing SGM stigmatization and discrimination within the healthcare environment. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: Same-sex parenting remains controversial, with many arguing that it negatively impacts children’s psychological and social development. This study investigated the influences of beliefs about the etiology of homosexuality (as either learned or genetic) and ambivalent sexism (benevolent and hostile) on beliefs about children’s development in same-sex families. Methods: A Chinese sample of 1400 respondents completed an online questionnaire in March–July 2019 and February 2020. The respondents self-identified as gay (490), lesbian (256), heterosexual male (266), or heterosexual female (388). Participants’ beliefs about children raised by same-sex parents were measured using the Scale on Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families which included two subscales, namely individual opposition and normative opposition. We tested four hypotheses using multiple analysis of variance and hierarchical multiple linear regression. Results: Respondents who were male, heterosexual, older, or had stronger beliefs in the learned etiology showed stronger individual and normative opposition to same-sex parenting. Overall, benevolent sexism was related to individual opposition; lesbians and gays’ hostile sexism was related to individual opposition, while heterosexuals’ hostile sexism was related to normative and individual opposition. Participants’ individual opposition was significantly stronger than their normative opposition. Conclusions: Chinese lesbians, gays, and heterosexuals hold relatively conservative and traditional beliefs about children’s development in same-sex families. Policy Implications: Our results suggest a need for legal and policy protection against prejudice and the dissemination of educational material about same-sex families through public service advertising and educational programs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The current study aims to investigate what factors influence whether adults detect a change between social partners in a brief interaction. In two experiments, we examined whether locale diversity, a stranger’s marginalized minority status (e.g., minority race, minority religious affiliation), and race congruence (e.g., own or other race) influenced the likelihood of being differentiated. Using a change blindness paradigm, an experimenter approached pedestrians asking for directions, then surreptitiously changed places with a confederate. After the switch, we measured whether pedestrians noticed if the person had changed. In Experiment 1, noticing rates were significantly lower for confederates belonging to a minority race compared to White confederates, but only in the more homogenous location and not in the highly diverse location. In Experiment 2, pedestrians were least likely to detect a change when confederates belonged to a religious minority and a racial minority. We discuss the important implications for prejudicial behaviour and eyewitness identification, as well as the utility of performing psychological research outside of the lab. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The current work aims to investigate if social cueing during an attentional task is likely to influence prejudice. In three studies we adopted a Posner-like task whereby participants observed an outgroup (vs ingroup) member performing a reach-to-grasp movement. The individual’s action, oriented rightward or leftward toward an object, preceded a peripheral target stimulus requiring a simple categorization response. The action direction could be congruent or incongruent with target location. Unbeknownst to the participants, the action direction predicted the target location with different validities. We measured the identification with the ingroup (i.e., Italians) and the prejudice toward the outgroup (i.e., Iraqi). Results showed that, for highly identified participants, explicit prejudice toward Arabs was lower after predictive-congruent social cues provided by an outgroup member than after predictive-incongruent cues. Thus, these findings suggest that positive experience with an outgroup member, even when subtle, might be effective in changing attitudes toward the entire social category. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to focus on cyberbullying (Donegan in Elon J Undergrad Res Commun 3(1):33–42, 2012) affecting the community of hunters in Poland. The investigation reveals that linguistic aggression pervades more and more spheres of our lives and the Internet, which gives anonymity and physical distance, is the main forum of cyberbullying. The researchers investigate the material gathered from websites such as “Ludzie przeciw myśliwym” [Humans against hunters], hunting-related blogs and Facebook sites devoted to hunting and related to persons who are known to be hunters (e.g. spokesmen of the Polish Hunting Association). The problem of the stereotypical perception of hunting is also raised (Bartmiński and Chlebda in Etnolingwistyka 25:69–95, 2003. https://doi.org/10.17951/et.2013.25.69). The issues of prejudice, stereotyping and lack of knowledge result in the possibility of inciting people to cyberbully others. People brought up in cities, far away from nature, are easily convinced to attack other groups which they perceive as deviant (Bartmiński and Chlebda 2003). The verbal aggression deeply rooted in stereotypes and prejudice based on limited knowledge of nature, overly idealistic and naïve worldviews becomes more and more widespread. Therefore, the authors intend to provide some insight into the problem of cyberbullying of hunters in Poland in order to find the patterns of that activity from socio-semiotic perspective analyzing verbal signs and symbols used to justify that sort of behaviour as well as socio-linguistic perspective concerning the usage of emotion-loaded language. Additionally psycho-linguistic issues will be touched upon as well as the problem of shaping the image of hunters by media will be discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Theories of the environmental state – treadmill of production and ecological modernization – have dominated discussion of the political economy of environmental change. While the former contends that the state’s mitigation of labor–capital relations engenders ecological instability, the latter posits that the state’s use of business-friendly incentives can goad producers and consumers to adopt sustainable practices. However, these theories largely focus on dynamics related to class, labor, and markets, and thus overlook the role that race and racism play in the political economy. In contrast, this article argues that racial politics are not peripheral influences, but rather are central to the political economy in which environmental policy formation occurs. The author advances the argument with the concept of the racial fix, which refers to the idea that race and racism are mechanisms for circumventing barriers that slow the treadmill of production. Synthesizing long-standing and emerging research, the author outlines three dimensions – spatial, political, and cognitive – that constitute the racial fix. Overall, this article not only shows how race and racism serve as building blocks for environmental state formation, but also articulates new theoretical paths for studying the relationship between race and environment. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This paper studies the sociolinguistics of quotative be like in Trinidad and its relation to Trinidadian English Creole (TrinEC). Corpus evidence shows a significant association of be like use and young age as well as female gender, in line with global trends. Questionnaire data reveal that it does not detract from the perception of a speaker as educated and of high social status as long as utterances are grammatically standardized English (StE). TrinEC grammar triggers contrasting perceptions but the data also point to traditional social prejudice against TrinEC being transcended. This ties in with the finding that be like users tend not actually to be averse to using TrinEC. Overall the sociolinguistics of be like in Trinidad is shaped by global trends as well as the local sociolinguistic configuration. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Recent years have seen increased attention to the problem of hate crime, including such crime motivated by anti-gay bias. Although there is a growing body of research regarding the context of hate crime offending, there is a relative dearth of work investigating the community-level context of anti-gay hate crime. The current study investigates the community-level determinants of anti-gay hate crime in New York City from 2006 to 2010, using data obtained from the New York Police Department (NYPD)’s Hate Crimes Task Force (HCTF), one of the nation’s leading hate crime police units. Using a framework drawing on group conflict and criminological theories, the current study examines anti-gay hate crime as an outcome of gay visibility, social disorganization, and economic strain. It is hypothesized that greater gay visibility, as well as social disorganization and poor and worsening economic conditions over time will be associated with increases in anti-gay hate crime. Results show that gay demographics, measured by static visibility and increasing gay populations over time, are shown to consistently predict higher levels of anti-gay hate crime. Adding to the generally mixed findings on the role of economic conditions in explaining hate crime, this study also finds that anti-gay hate crime occurs in more disadvantaged communities and communities marked by poorer economic conditions. The findings show anti-gay hate crime to be an outcome of gay visibility, disadvantage, and poor economic conditions, indicating that anti-gay crime may be an angry response to the strains present in the community. The study concludes with a discussion of the findings and implications for policy makers and practitioners. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Introduction: South Africa (SA) has one of the highest prevalence rates of Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) globally, with women carrying a larger burden of the disease. Furthermore, female inmates have higher rates of HIV compared to their male counterparts, with an over-representation of mental illnesses among female inmates as well. Additionally, mental illnesses are highly prevalent in people living with HIV, with HIV and mental illness sharing a complex bidirectional relationship. This study, which forms part of a larger two-phased, mixed-methods study, describes the experiences of contracting and living with/being affected by HIV, among female inmates with a lifetime history of mental illness, in a South African setting. Method: This study was conducted at a correctional centre in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, SA. Fourteen adult (18 years and older) female inmates, were purposively selected to participate in individual, in-depth semi-structured interviews. Participants had a lifetime history of mental illness, trauma and were either living with HIV, or affected by HIV. Women from diverse cultural backgrounds, who were fluent in English, were selected. This manuscript focuses on the description of the HIV component of the qualitative interviews only. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: Themes related to contracting HIV included intimate partner betrayal, gender differences regarding sexual behaviour, fear associated with HIV and the importance of pre- and post-test HIV counselling. Themes related to living with/being affected by HIV included the challenges women experienced in their home community, which contrasted with their experience of living with HIV in the prison community, and the importance of accepting an HIV positive life. Conclusion: HIV is prevalent in the female inmate population at this correctional centre in SA. This study emphasises that whilst incarcerated, attempts should be made to educate, train, support and manage HIV in this population, thereby helping to curb the epidemic. Further research should aim at exploring such strategies. The study also underscores the importance of the continued need for HIV education in order to eradicate associated stigma and discrimination which are still prevalent in SA. © Copyright © 2021 Naidoo, Ferreira, Subramaney and Paruk.

AB  - Theoretical basis: This case uses concepts from Korten’s strategies of development-oriented four generations of non-government organizations (NGOs) and social psychology such as stereotypes, prejudices and actions to explain the social phenomenon. In furtherance, the case presents Aristotle’s approach to creating a message for masses that include use of ethos, pathos and logos. Stood’s (2017) narrative, engagement and technology (NET) model of social leadership was used to analyse the characteristics of social leaders. Research methodology: Prima facie the case was developed from primary sources i.e. interviewing with Ashish Thakur. Literature from secondary sources was obtained to make teaching notes. List of references is presented towards the end that depicts the use of textbooks, research papers, websites and blogs. This case was tested in the classroom with MBA students learning business communication. Case overview/synopsis: The case dealt with the challenges of an NGO that included conducting respectful last rites of unclaimed dead bodies. As the NGO grew, Ashish Thakur, the initiator of Moksh started facing resource management challenges, namely, volunteer induction, fundraising and managing non-human resources. These issues are deeply embedded in several social stereotypes about dead bodies. Learning covers strategies of four generations of NGO development, a NET model of social leadership, breaking social stereotypes related to dead bodies and last rites (necrophobia), designing social communication and opportunity to assess faulty rationalizations and do critical thinking around the socio-religious practices. Complexity academic level: This case is intended to be used for the students of the social leadership or social entrepreneurship, social psychology, business communication or communication skills, organizational behaviour, advertising and social media. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Political advertisements can shift attitudes and behaviors to become more exclusionary toward social out-groups. However, people who engage in an antidiscrimination exercise in the context of an experiment may respond differently to such ads. What interventions might foster inclusive attitudes in the presence of political communications about social policy issues like transgender rights? We examined two scalable antidiscrimination exercises commonly used in applied settings: describing a personal narrative of discrimination and perspective-taking. We then showed people political ads that are favorable or opposed to transgender rights to determine whether those interventions moderate how receptive people are to the messages. Relying on two demographically representative survey experiments of adults in the United States (study 1 N = 1,291; study 2 N = 1,587), we found that personal recollections of discriminatory experiences did not reduce exclusionary attitudes, but perspective-taking had some effects, particularly among those who fully complied with the exercise. However, both studies revealed potential backfire effects; recalling a discriminatory experience induced negative attitudes among a subset of the participants, and participants who refused to perspective-take when prompted also held more negative attitudes. Importantly, political ads favorable toward transgender rights consistently resulted in more positive attitudes toward transgender people. Future work needs to carefully examine heterogeneous responses and resistance to antidiscrimination interventions and examine what particular aspects of the political ads induced the attitude change. © Copyright © 2021 Flores, Haider-Markel, Lewis, Miller and Taylor.

AB  - HIV-related stigma and discrimination are recognized barriers to HIV prevention, testing and treatment among people of Sub-Saharan African descent (SSA) origin living in Belgium, but insights into HIV related-stigma mechanisms and outcomes are lacking for this population with high HIV prevalence. Guided by Earnshaw and Chaudoir’s stigma framework (2009), we conducted this qualitative study using 10 focus-groups with 76 SSA community members and 20 in-depth interviews with SSA descendants living with HIV to explore specific HIV-stigma mechanisms and outcomes and underlying drivers. Inductive and deductive thematic analysis showed high degrees of stigma among SSA communities driven by fear of HIV acquisition and misconceptions in a migration context, negatively affecting SSA descendants living with HIV. The results allowed for contextualization of the framework: At the community level, prejudices and stereotypes were major stigma mechanisms, while physical distancing, gossips, sexual rejection, violence and increased HIV prevalence emerged as stigma outcomes. Among SSA descendants living with HIV, enacted, anticipated and internalized stigmas were validated as stigma mechanisms, with witnessed stigma as an additional mechanism. Self-isolation, community avoidance and low utilization of non-HIV specialized healthcare were additional outcomes. These results are relevant for tailoring interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This research aims to: (1) examine the construct social dominance orientation (SDO) in a setting that expands group hierarchy to include prejudices and dominance toward animals; (2) compare predictive validity and internal consistency between the 16-item SDO6 and the 4-item SSDO; and (3) test whether the SDO6 and the SSDO scales predict well in a consumer behavior oriented contextual setting. Predictive validity of the SSDO was almost as high as that of the SSD6; internal reliability, however, was considerably lower. Further, as hypothesized, individuals exhibiting lower levels of SDO, as assessed by both SDO6 and SSDO, exhibit lower levels of speciesism as well as higher levels of empathic concern. In addition, as hypothesized, ethical vegans, as compared to carnists, display lower levels of SDO and speciesism, and higher levels of empathic concern. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Over recent years, globalisation occasioned a dramatic rise in cross-cultural interactions until this was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ability to competently engage in a multicultural world is often considered the “literacy of the future”. Global interconnectedness has brought studies into intercultural competence to centre stage. This has increased the demand for cross-cultural education experiences that facilitate such learning. However, there is a dearth of empirical research into the issues and effects surrounding short-term cross-cultural educational experiences for adolescents. This mixed-methods study extends previous research by looking specifically into what impact short-term cross-cultural experiences may have on the formation of intercultural competence (IC) and emotional intelligence (EI) of Australian high school students. This study used two instruments for measuring IC and EI in a pre-and post-test quasi-experimental design (n = 14), the General Ethnocentrism (GENE) Scale and Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ). Moreover, it conducted in-depth post-experience qualitative interviews (n = 7) that broadly followed a phenomenological paradigm of inquiry. The findings suggest that fully embodied cross-cultural immersive experiences can effectively support the formation of IC and EI in high school students and may thereby play a contributing role in redressing ignorance, xenophobia, prejudice, and discrimination. A greater understanding of the linkages between immersive cross-cultural experiences and intercultural competence offers prospects for policymakers, educators, pastoral carers, and other relevant stakeholders who might employ such experiential learning to foster more interculturally and interracially harmonious human relations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Experiencing psychosis-spectrum symptoms is challenging to youth. Among many difficulties, internalized mental health stigma—the internalization of negative stereotypes—can lead to shame and withdrawal. The objective of this study was to better understand the correlates of internalized stigma among a clinical sample of youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Participants (n = 66; 12–25 years old) were referred by community providers in Maryland, United States. Psychosis-spectrum symptoms were measured via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS); family-functioning was measured via the Family Assessment Device. Interviewers rated participants’ social/role functioning via the Global Functioning: Social and Role Scales. Internalized stigma was measured using the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) total scale and subscales. The sample included 34 individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis, 16 experiencing early psychosis, and 16 help-seeking controls. Regression analyses indicated that unusual beliefs, avolition, role functioning, and lower family-functioning (caregiver-reported) were significantly associated with higher aspects of internalized stigma, controlling for other symptoms and sociodemographics. These models explained 27% of the variance (adjusted R2) in the total ISMI scale and between 15% to 49% of the variance in ISMI-subscales. Among this help-seeking sample, unusual beliefs, avolition, higher role functioning, and lower family-functioning (caregiver-reported) were associated with more internalized stigma. Pending future research with larger samples, therapeutic interventions focused on these factors and their correlates may benefit youth. Future research is needed to determine temporal precedence of these associations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) General Scientific Summary—Endorsement of unusual thought content and avolition, as well as higher role functioning and lower care- giver-reported family functioning, were associated with increased self-reported internalized mental health stigma. This study supports the notion that specific clinical variables are related to internalized stigma. Pending future research, individual, group, and/or family-based interventions may be developed and adapted to specifically target these areas and to reduce internalized stigma across help-seeking youth.

AB  - Little data are available for women diagnosed with a dual diagnosis. However, dual diagnosis in women presents increased stigma, social penalties, and barriers to access to treatment than it does for men. Indeed, it increases the probability of suffering physical or sexual abuse, violent victimization, gender-based violence, unemployment, social exclusion, social-role problems, and physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Thus, a transversal sex and gender-based perspective is required to adequately study and treat dual diagnosis. For this, sex and gender factors should be included in every scientific analysis; professionals should review their own prejudices and stereotypes and train themselves specifically from a gender perspective; administrations should design and provide specific treatment resources for women; and we could all contribute to a structural social transformation that goes beyond gender mandates and norms and reduces the risk of abuse and violence inflicted on women. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Workplace discrimination may affect the health of the exposed employees, but it is not known whether workplace discrimination is also associated with an increased risk of longterm sickness absence. The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal associations of changes in and onset of workplace discrimination with the risk of long-term sickness absence. Data on workplace discrimination were obtained from 29,597 employees participating in survey waves 2004, 2006, 2008 and/or 2010 of the Finnish Public Sector Study. Four-year changes in long-term sickness absence (≥10 days of medically certified absence with a mental or non-mental diagnosis) were assessed. This covered successive study waves in analyses of onset of workplace discrimination as well as fixed effect analyses of change in workplace discrimination (concurrent i.e. during the exposure year and 1-year lagged i.e. within one year following exposure), by using each employee as his/her own control. The risk of long-term sickness absence due to mental disorders was greater for employees with vs. without onset of workplace discrimination throughout the 4-year period, reaching a peak at the year when the onset of discrimination was reported (adjusted risk ratio 2.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-2.52). The fixed effects analyses showed that workplace discrimination was associated with higher odds of concurrent, but not 1-year lagged, long-term sickness absence due to mental disorders (adjusted odds ratio 1.61; 95% CI 1.33-1.96 and adjusted odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.83-1.25, respectively). Long-term sickness absence due to non-mental conditions was not associated with workplace discrimination. In conclusion, these findings suggest that workplace discrimination is associated with an elevated risk of long-term sickness absence due to mental disorders. Supporting an acute effect, the excess risk was confined to the year when workplace discrimination occurred. © 2021 Clark et al.

AB  - Objectives: To measure nurse-perceived electronic health records (EHR) usability with a standardized metric of technology usability and evaluate its association with professional burnout. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of a random sample of US nurses was conducted in November 2017. EHR usability was measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS; range 0-100) and burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: Among the 86 858 nurses who were invited, 8638 (9.9%) completed the survey. The mean nurse-rated EHR SUS score was 57.6 (SD 16.3). A score of 57.6 is in the bottom 24% of scores across previous studies and categorized with a grade of "F."On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, race, ethnicity, relationship status, children, highest nursing-related degree, mean hours worked per week, years of nursing experience, advanced certification, and practice setting, nurse-rated EHR usability was associated with burnout with each 1 point more favorable SUS score and associated with a 2% lower odds of burnout (OR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; P <. 001). Conclusions: Nurses rated the usability of their current EHR in the low marginal range of acceptability using a standardized metric of technology usability. EHR usability and the odds of burnout were strongly associated with a dose-response relationship. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Vascular surgeons of all backgrounds play an important role in providing high quality vascular surgical care in their communities. In America, with our diverse population and communities, patients presenting with vascular disease are very common and could pattern the community demographic. Often faced with the challenges of community hospital politics and demand, the vascular surgical workforce has continued to be active members in their communities, focusing on their strengths to lead vascular surgery healthcare in an environment of high patient demand. Having a varied vascular surgery workforce provides all patients afflicted by vascular disease a comfortable opportunity for compassionate and empathic vascular care. This is a significant strength of vascular care when diversity, equity, and inclusion are supported by the leadership. © 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery

AB  - Overweight, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are major global health concerns. Lifestyle factors, including diet, have been acknowledged to play a key role in the solution of these health risks. However, as shown by numerous studies, and in clinical practice, it is extremely challenging to quantify dietary behaviors as well as influencing them via dietary interventions. As shown by the limited success of ‘one-size-fits-all’ nutritional campaigns catered to an entire population or subpopulation, the need for more personalized coaching approaches is evident. New technology-based innovations provide opportunities to further improve the accuracy of dietary assessment and develop approaches to coach individuals towards healthier dietary behaviors. Pride & Prejudice (P&P) is a unique multi-disciplinary consortium consisting of researchers in life, nutrition, ICT, design, behavioral and social sciences from all four Dutch Universities of Technology.

AB  - Secular bioethicists do not speak from a place of distinction, but from within particular culturally, socially, and historically conditioned standpoints. As partisans of moral and ideological agendas, they bring their own biases, prejudices, and worldviews to their roles as ethical consultants, social advocates, and academics, attempting rhetorically to sway others and shift policy to a preferred point of view. Their pronouncements represent just one voice among others, even when delivered with strident rhetoric, in an educated and knowing tone, from within institutional positions of power. This essay argues that, given the hegemony of progressive secular bioethics, traditional Christians routinely face epistemic injustice within medicine. That is, Christian knowledge regarding moral reality is all too often demeaned or dismissed, unless such norms can be translated into and defended within a secular ethos. Given such systemic bias, I argue, Christians also experience significant moral distress: they are fully aware of their moral obligations and what they ought to do, but institutionalized power structures make it nearly impossible to so act. But, Christian physicians are not mere technicians, obliged to provide whatever patients request from the list of legally available treatments. That antireligious critics seek to remove the rights of Christian physicians to limit how they practice medicine, where they do not offer or refer for abortion, euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, and other inappropriate forms of care, is unjustified and prejudicial, singling out Christians, and other religious groups, for singular treatment. Regardless of what the law requires or institutional policy demands, however, Christians are obliged to submit to God in all things. As a result, they may at times find themselves required to engage in acts of civil disobedience. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The 2010s migrant crisis cost the lives of many immigrants on their way to Europe. In 2015 alone, about 3,800 immigrants and refugees died trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea on board of large vessels or small floating boats. Among those tragic incidents, two specific occurrences are investigated here: over the course of a week in April 2015, about 1,200 people drowned in two consecutive events after their boats capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. Later that year, on September 2nd, Alan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy, tragically drowned. We used these two incidents to investigate the “identifiable victim effect” on public opinion toward immigrants using a natural experiment framework, based on the timing of the European Social Survey in Portugal. Results showed that the tragic drowning of an identified child can affect a change in public sentiment, in contrast to the drowning of more than a thousand statistical victims. We also examined the temporal pattern and duration of the effect on public sentiment, and found that the impact of Alan Kurdi's death lasted for a little over a month and significantly abated, with public sentiment returning to the same level of opposition to immigration as before the incident. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Members of social categories defined by attributes such as sex, race, and age occupy certain types of social roles much more than members of other social categories do. The qualities that define these roles become associated with the category as a whole, thus forming a stereotype. In a vicious cycle, this stereotype then hinders category members’ movement into roles with different demands because their stereotype portrays them as well matched to their existing roles but not to these new roles. This vicious cycle has important implications for stereotype change. Given the difficulties of producing enduring change by directly attacking stereotypes in the minds of individuals, a more effective strategy consists of policies and programs that change the distributions of category members in roles, thereby changing stereotypes at their source. If the vicious cycle is not interrupted by such social change, observations of category members’ typical social roles continually reinstate existing stereotypes. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Narrative letters of recommendation (NLORs) have become key elements of the application process for residency and fellowship. The potential to inadvertently admit bias into these subjective narratives has become an area of research focus across many disciplines. In the present review, we have highlighted the current data regarding bias in NLORs. We also believe that one of the most effective methods to eliminate bias from written recommendations is to first understand that it exists. Thus, the objective measures that have been taken to identify bias in NLORs are important steps in the right direction. We have presented and reflected on the accrued data on bias in NLORs pertaining to surgical training. © 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery

AB  - A publication in the August 2020 issue of the Journal of Vascular Surgery, “Prevalence of unprofessional social media content among young vascular surgeons,” brought the concept of professionalism in the vascular surgery community to the forefront. In response to the methodology used in the article, and the definitions of professionalism, a global backlash from health care providers and lay people ensued. The article has since been retracted; however, its publication highlighted the need to reexamine current definitions and philosophies surrounding professionalism in medicine and surgery that may be discriminatory and exclusive. The term professionalism has no standard definition as evidenced by varying definitions among different societies and organizations. The lack of a structured, universally accepted definition of professionalism in the medical and surgical communities has resulted in no standard by which to measure the actions of physicians and surgeons. The definition of professionalism need not be complex and should not vary among specialties and societies. In its most simplistic form, the core definition of “professionalism” embedded in the volumes of publications, guidelines, and charters that exist on the subject of professionalism in medicine is respect. We propose a tiered approach to define professionalism in medicine that builds on fundamental principles of respect and inclusivity, and includes actionable steps at three levels: (1) individual, (2) organizational, and (3) societal. Through this approach, any physician, regardless of specialty, practice type or location, can apply these concepts to ensure they consistently embody what it means to be “professional.” © 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery

AB  - Publication bias has been shown to exist in research across medical and surgical specialties. Bias can occur at any stage of the publication process and can be related to race, ethnicity, age, religion, sex, gender, or sexual orientation. Although some improvements have been made toward addressing this issue, bias still spans the publication process from authors and peer reviewers, to editorial board members and editors, with poor inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities throughout. The result of bias remaining unchecked is the publication of research that leaves out certain groups, is not applicable to all people, and can result in harm to some populations. We have highlighted the current landscape of publication bias and strived to demonstrate the importance of addressing it. We have also provided solutions for reducing bias at multiple stages throughout the publication process. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout all aspects of the publication process, requiring diversity, equity, and inclusion statements in reports, and providing specific education and guidelines will ensure the identification and eradication of publication bias. By following these measures, we hope that publication bias will be eliminated, which will reduce further harm to certain populations and promote better, more effective research pertinent to all people. © 2021

AB  - This study analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the detection of new cases of leprosy in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The periods January–September 2019 and January–September 2020 were compared. There was a 44.40% reduction in the diagnosis of leprosy when comparing the two periods (1,705 in 2019 and 948 in 2020). There was a reduction in the number of municipalities with reported cases: 251 municipalities in 2019 and 202 in 2020, expressing a reduction of 24.25%. Considering only the months following the arrival of the virus (April–September), the reduction was 51.10%. An inverse correlation was observed between the number of new cases of leprosy and the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 (Spearman's correlation coefficient = −0.840; P < 0.001) and the number of new monthly cases of COVID-19 (Spearman's correlation coefficient = −0.817; P < 0.001). A slight increase was also observed in the proportion of multibacillary cases in the state (70.38% in 2019 and 72.69% in 2020) as well as in the proportion of individuals with the degree of physical disability not assessed at diagnosis, whose proportion rose from 16.39% in 2019 to 22.53% in 2020. The negative impact of COVID-19 in tackling leprosy should be seen as a warning sign for health and political authorities. © 2021 the International Society of Dermatology

AB  - Latinx and African American children are disproportionately affected by obesity and often do not engage in enough physical activity (PA) to yield health benefits. Because children are less active during the summer compared to the school year, summer care programs can provide structure and social support needed for PA promotion. The purpose of this study was to examine how race/ethnicity relate to social connections and PA within a summer care program. Children self-reported race/ethnicity, PA, and friends at a summer care program before and after summer. PA did not significantly differ based on race/ethnicity or time. Additionally, children were more likely to make friends with and remain friends with those of the same race/ethnicity throughout the summer. PA was also related to a child's social connections at the end of summer regardless of race/ethnicity. Using active play to connect children may promote diverse friend networks at these programs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous research suggests that listening to music can enhance memory and well-being. However, what is often missing from this analysis is consideration of the social dimensions of music—for example, its capacity to affirm or threaten listeners’ social identities. This study examined whether (ir)religious music that was potentially identity-affirming or identity-threatening (Christian hymns, Buddhist chants, classical, or no music) would affect Christians’ and Atheists’ (N = 267) well-being and memory performance while listening. Analyses revealed significant interactions between (ir)religious group and music type on memory, self-esteem, and mood. Listening to music that potentially threatened one's religious identity appeared to undermine both performance self-esteem and actual memory performance, while increasing feelings of hostility. This pattern was found for Christians (vs. Atheists) who listened to Buddhist chants. Conversely, Atheists’ performance self-esteem (and to some degree their memory performance) was lowest, and their hostility highest, when they listened to Christian hymns. In this way, listening to music that potentially threatened one's religious group identity (or lack thereof) appeared to be detrimental for memory, self-esteem, and mood. These results bridge research on the psychology of religion, music psychology, and social identity theorizing by demonstrating that the effects of music on memory and well-being may reflect important (even sacred) social identities, with potential implications for individual well-being and intergroup relations. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Children tend to assume that their ingroup members are more likely to share their preferences than outgroup members, but group membership and shared preferences need not be congruent in reality. The current study investigated 76 3- to 6-year-old children's baseline intergroup attitudes in a minimal group context and their subsequent attitudes after being informed that either (a) their ingroup, but not their outgroup, shared their preferences or (b) their outgroup, but not their ingroup, shared their preferences. Cues about shared preferences affected children's intergroup biases to some extent, such that children tended to like their outgroup more and to allocate resources fairly among their ingroup and outgroup when they learned that their outgroup shared their preferences. However, intergroup biases were robust in some measures, such that children reported high ingroup liking and demonstrated ingroup favoritism in behavioral attribution regardless of whether they learned that their ingroup or outgroup shared their preferences. Children were also administered measures tapping into cognitive flexibility, but there was no coherent evidence that children's cognitive flexibility was related to their initial intergroup attitudes or their subsequent intergroup attitudes after learning that their ingroup or outgroup shared their preferences. The current study demonstrates a nuanced picture of intergroup biases, such that these biases might not be entirely entrenched but can nonetheless be robust in the face of conflicting cues about group membership and shared preferences. Furthermore, the importance of investigating intergroup biases at the individual level, rather than only at the group level, is discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Public health policies have been proposed to help address prevalent Canadian obesity rates. Along with the increase in obesity prevalence, explicit weight bias is also rampant in Western society. This paper aimed to assess the association between explicit weight bias attitudes and Canadian public support of these policy recommendations. Methods: Canadian adults (N = 903; 51% female; BMI = 27.3 ± 7.0 kg/m2) completed an online survey measuring explicit weight bias, using the three subscales of the Anti-Fat Attitudes Questionnaire: Willpower (belief in weight controllability), Fear of fat (fear of gaining weight), and Dislike (antipathy towards people with obesity). Whether these subscales were associated with policy support was assessed with logistic regression. Analyses were adjusted for age, race, gender, and income. Results: Public support of policy recommendations ranged from 53% to 90%. Explicit weight bias was primarily expressed through a fear of weight gain and the belief that weight gain was within the individual’s control based on willpower. Although the Dislike subscale was associated with lower support for several policies that enable or guide individual choice in behaviour change, the Willpower and Fear of fat subscales were associated with greater support for similar policies. Conclusion: This study contributes to evidence-informed public health action by describing public support of public health policies and demonstrating an association between explicit weight bias and public support. A higher total explicit weight bias score increased the odds of supporting primarily less intrusive policies. However, dislike of individuals with obesity was associated with decreased odds of supporting many policies. © 2021, The Canadian Public Health Association.

AB  - Children’s adherence to gender stereotypes can be detrimental, yet interventions to tackle stereotyping have achieved mixed success. Few studies have examined interventions developed collaboratively by educators and researchers, and the impact of interventions that focus on increasing perceived similarities between genders has yet to be tested. The present study evaluated an intervention among 6- to 10-year-old British children (47 boys; 37 girls) compared to a control group (61 boys; 47 girls). Led by their class teacher via weekly 30-minute lessons, over a four-month period, children learned to identify and challenge stereotypes, and explored similarities between genders and diversity within gender (e.g., not all girls like pink). Key measures of gender flexibility in relation to toy play, occupations, and perceived similarity to gender groups were utilised. After controlling for baseline scores, the intervention group felt more similar to the other gender and reported that they could do a wider range of occupations in the future. Those who showed less flexibility around toy play at baseline were more flexible after the intervention. Boys in the intervention group reported that gender stereotypes were more unfair than did the control group. Findings are discussed in relation to theories of gender stereotyping and intervention research. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The southern U.S. has both high HIV and incarceration rates in comparison to its population. As in the rest of the country, HIV prevention is based on education, behavior change, and biomedical efforts, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This study examined the implementation of an educational intervention and supportive services to obtain PrEP in a population of individuals (N = 218) involved in an Adult Drug Court (ADC) or on probation or parole (P-P). Nearly all ADC and P-P participants self-reported risk behaviors linked to HIV acquisition. Results supported the acceptance and usefulness of the intervention as rated by participants. Participants showed increased knowledge of HIV risks and testing post-education. In multivariate analysis, predictors of interest in using PrEP included low stigma beliefs, specifically their level of prejudice views, high depressive symptoms, and white race. The intervention shows promise. Given the high risk documented for ADC and P-P individuals, HIV prevention is a critical component for increased protective behaviors. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The stressors of immigration detention and negative host country experiences make effective access to health care vital for migrant detainees, but little is known regarding the health experiences of this populations and the barriers to healthcare access. The present research investigates immigration detainees’ experiences of health-related help-seeking in the distressing and stigmatised environment of UK immigration removal centres (IRCs), as well as staff members’ experiences of providing help. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 detainees and 21 staff and analysed using theoretical thematic analysis guided by the social identity approach. The findings indicate that the practical constraints on help provision (e.g. lack of time and resources, the unpredictable nature of detention) are exacerbated by the complex and conflictual intergroup relationships within which these helping transactions occur. These transactions are negatively affected by stigma, mutual distrust and reputation management concerns, as well as detainees’ feelings of powerlessness and confusion around eligibility to receive health care. Some detainees argued that the help ignores the systematic inequalities associated with their detainee status, thereby making it fundamentally inappropriate and ineffective. The intergroup context (of inequality and illegitimacy) shapes the quality of helping transactions, care experiences and health service engagement in groups experiencing chronic low status, distress and uncertainty. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The present study is one of few to investigate both anti-trans discrimination and anti-trans prejudice. It examined four individual factors (religiosity; political beliefs; affiliation with LGBTQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer] people; gender role beliefs) through a lens of hetero-cis-normativity to understand their association with anti-trans attitudes and reported behaviors. Using a sample of 302 cisgender college students from across the United States, hierarchical multiple regressions on bootstrap samples were used to analyze how these factors are associated with anti-trans attitudes and behaviors. More liberal political beliefs, affiliation with more LGBTQ friends and family members, and less traditional gender role beliefs were related to more positive attitudes toward transgender people. Less traditional gender role beliefs and more positive attitudes were associated with more positive reported behaviors toward transgender individuals. Interventions designed to challenge traditional gender role beliefs and approximate affiliation with LGBTQ persons may be most effective to reduce pervasive hetero-cis-normative prejudice and discrimination within schools. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: The therapeutic itinerary is not limited to the identification and availability of health services offered, but relates to the different individual searches and sociocultural and economic possibilities of each patient. In this study, we discuss the therapeutic itinerary of transsexual people seeking healthcare, from the user’s perspective. Objective: The aim of this study was to discuss the therapeutic itinerary of transsexual people seeking healthcare, from the user’s perspective. Design and participants: Individual interviews were performed with 10 transsexuals at the Trans Space of a University Hospital of Pernambuco, using the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the theoretical reference and the Bardin’s thematic content analysis as the reference methodological framework. Ethical considerations: This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the Federal University of Pernambuco under protocol no. 91284218.5.0000.5208. Findings: The comprehensive care for transsexual people was evidenced through four categories analyzed: low demand of transsexuals in health services; use of social name in health services; care permeated by prejudiced and discriminatory attitudes; and health system and professionals who are not able to meet transgender health issues. Discussion: Transsexual people are stigmatized and experience prejudice in their daily health, in a way they do not enjoy fundamental rights, as if they had fewer rights, or infringe the principle of universality of access to health. Thus, for effective and comprehensive care, the health team must keep up to date on the public policies existing in the healthcare of transsexual people and reconstruct what they understand by gender. Conclusion: Knowledge about the therapeutic itinerary of transgender people may support evaluation processes of health service networks to ensure the access to and reorganization of these services. Understanding this dynamic allows fostering discussions about the structure of health services at all care levels for the care of this population. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Despite their less vulnerable economic status, white individuals' attitudes toward overseas trade in the United States may have become more protectionist than those of economically disadvantaged minorities. We present results from five different studies examining two different ways in which trade may have become racialized. First, we examine the extent to which a person's racial identity is associated with levels of trade support. Second, we examine whether the predominant racial identity of a potential trading-partner country influences people's willingness to trade with that country. Using various surveys and multiple survey experiments conducted over the past 12 years, we find that white individuals have become less supportive of trade than minorities and that whites are more likely than minorities to favor trade with highly similar countries. We suggest that minority support for trade is due to four well-documented differences in the psychological predispositions of whites and minorities in the United States. Minorities have lower levels of racial prejudice, are lower in social dominance, and express less nationalism than whites. At the same time, there is evidence of rising ingroup racial consciousness among whites. Each of these characteristics has been independently linked to trade support in a direction encouraging greater support for trade among minorities. As the United States grows ever closer to becoming a “majority minority” nation, the racialization of trade attitudes may stimulate shifts in the likely future of America's trade relationships. © 2020 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - The present research examines men’s self-conscious discomfort while imagining performing counter-stereotypical (traditionally feminine) behaviors as compared to stereotypical (traditionally masculine) behaviors, as a function of traditional masculinity endorsement and perceived social changes in men’s gender norms (men’s feminization) in two distinct cultural populations (U.S. Americans and Kosovan Albanians). Experiment 1 (n = 192, U.S.) confirmed prior findings by showing that men, as compared to women, experienced more self-conscious discomfort when imagining performing counter-stereotypical (vs. stereotypical) behaviors. Experiments 2 (n = 292, U.S.) and 3 (n = 191, Kosovo) focused solely on heterosexual men and experimentally manipulated perceived social changes in men’s gender norms. Results showed that the men’s feminization condition, as compared to a control or masculinity conditions, decreased self-conscious discomfort when imagining performing feminine behaviors among men who endorsed a lower versus higher level of traditional masculinity. Experiment 3 further indicated that this effect was driven by lowered expectations of being misclassified as gay. We discuss the relevance of these findings for both the gender and sexual prejudice literature. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study provides implicit verb consequentiality norms for a corpus of 305 English verbs, for which Ferstl et al. (Behavior Research Methods, 43, 124-135, 2011) previously provided implicit causality norms. An online sentence completion study was conducted, with data analyzed from 124 respondents who completed fragments such as “John liked Mary and so…”. The resulting bias scores are presented in an Appendix, with more detail in supplementary material in the University of Sussex Research Data Repository (via https://doi.org/10.25377/sussex.c.5082122), where we also present lexical and semantic verb features: frequency, semantic class and emotional valence of the verbs. We compare our results with those of our study of implicit causality and with the few published studies of implicit consequentiality. As in our previous study, we also considered effects of gender and verb valence, which requires stable norms for a large number of verbs. The corpus will facilitate future studies in a range of areas, including psycholinguistics and social psychology, particularly those requiring parallel sentence completion norms for both causality and consequentiality. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - As globalization increases worldwide, it redefines our conceptions of other cultures, the media we consume, and our day-to-day interactions. Despite this increased interconnectivity, we lack a fundamental understanding of how globalization is related to prejudicial attitudes between social groups. We hypothesized that economic inequality may shape the relationship between globalization and intergroup prejudice. We tested this prediction with data from over 66,000 respondents across 44 countries. We found that globalization—and particularly its social aspects such as tourism and migration—is related to increased prejudice in countries with high economic inequality and is related to decreased prejudice in countries with low economic inequality. These findings offer new insight into how and why globalization may shape intergroup relations around the world. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) is a valued patient-related outcome measure. HR-QoL is typically measured using a psychometric tool. Although there are a number of general and illness-specific HR-QoL measurement tools available globally, no tool has been validated for Australian Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children. The purpose of this study was to gather Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parent/carer perspectives of HR-QoL in children in order to inform the development of a culturally appropriate tool. Yarning circles and face to face interviews were used to document the experiences of parents and carers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who had experienced a chronic illness. Participants were recruited through word of mouth and via established social and professional networks in Queensland and the Northern Territory of Australia. Information collected was transcribed and analysed thematically and placed into a concept map. HR-QoL was defined as more than just physical, social and psychological wellbeing. Family and social support were valued aspects of HR-QoL, as was knowledge, communication and the relationship with the health system. Participants described the importance of being heard; their voice trusted and valued by health practitioners. Racism and prejudicial behaviour had negative impacts on HR-QoL. The concepts of HR-QoL identified in this study are not included in conventional HR-QoL measurement tools. Consideration should be given to concepts proposed by Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in order to adequately capture perceived HR-QoL. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Negative attitudes toward the nonreligious persist in America. This may compel some nonreligious individuals to conceal their identity to manage feelings of social identity threat. In one correlational study and one experiment, we found evidence of social identity threat and concealment behavior among nonreligious Americans. Our first study showed that Southern nonreligious individuals reported higher levels of stigma consciousness and self-reported concealment of nonreligious identity, which in turn predicted lower likelihood of self-identifying as “atheist” in public settings than in private settings. Our second study successfully manipulated feelings of social identity threat by showing that atheists who read an article about negative stereotypes of their group subsequently exhibited higher concealment scores than did atheists who read one of two control articles. Implications for how nonreligious individuals negotiate social identity threat and future directions for nonreligion research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Race and racism have long been identified as influences on state cash assistance policy under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF; “welfare” in the United States) and its predecessor programs. TANF is structured as a flexible block grant with a state contribution requirement and cash benefits now account for only about one-quarter of all program expenditures. Both proportion of effort devoted to cash assistance and change over time since passage of the 1996 welfare reform law vary by state. In this article, I consider the relationship between prevalence of negative stereotyping of blacks among whites in a state and emphasis on cash assistance as a TANF expenditure priority from 1998 to 2013. I find that prevalence of stereotyping of blacks among whites is related to TANF cash assistance effort, while evidence that it is related to the rate of decline in cash assistance over time is ambiguous. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization

AB  - Emory Bogardus' 1926 social distance survey revealed, not surprisingly, that native-born Americans tended to view Southern, Central, and Eastern (SCE) Europeans as far less desirable than Northern and Western (NW) Europeans for most social relationships. This well-known finding has been attributed to both racial/ethnic prejudice and social class prejudice. The present study investigates the relative contributions of these two forms of prejudice to the total prejudice against SCE Europeans, testing the prediction that social distance attitudes toward European groups in Bogardus' pioneering survey were significantly influenced by group differences in socioeconomic status (SES), net of the NW-SCE European distinction. The prediction is supported in analyses that consider survey respondents' uniquely intense desires for social distance from those SCE Europeans that were visible because of their relatively high SES, notably, Russian-ancestry Jews. The study concludes that social class prejudice substantially affected divisions among European ancestry groups in early twentieth-century America. © 2019 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society

AB  - Gender remains a key predictor of housework in modern society. However, previous studies have been relatively limited in their ability to adjudicate between possible mechanisms operating at the individual and social-interactional level that may cause this relationship. To address this gap, we employ a novel experimental design in which respondents view and evaluate photos of a relatively clean or messy room, which is ostensibly occupied by either a man or a woman. We find that men and women respondents do not differ in their perceptions of how messy a room is or how urgent it is to clean it up. In contrast, the gender of the room occupant has strong and significant effects on housework perceptions, moral judgments, perceived social consequences, and allocations of responsibility. Notably, when a relatively clean room is evaluated, female room occupants are held to higher standards of cleanliness, are believed to suffer more negative social consequences when they do not meet those standards, and are generally deemed more responsible for housework across a variety of work–family arrangements than their male counterparts. However, when a messy room is evaluated, gender effects are smaller and less systematic, in part because messiness activates negative stereotypes about men. Overall, findings underscore and refine the theory that gendered beliefs and accountability practices are a root cause of gendered behavior in the household. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Principles of intergroup conflict are a core issue in social psychology fields. Studies have found that social prejudice has a significant correlation with intergroup conflict, apart from the personal characteristics and the contextual factors. However, none of those studies concentrated on the triggering role of the prejudice to the social phenomena in Eastern culture. Accordingly, the dependent variable detection paradigms used in three experiments were the Emotional Stroop Task, the Lexical Decision Task (LDT), and the Story Completion Protocol (SCP), the present research took the patient–physician conflict in domestic China as the example to detect the effect of social prejudice on the attention selective bias, memory accessibility, and the explanation of attribution bias of the aggressive information processing during the triggering of patient–physician intergroup conflict. The result showed that there was social patient–physician prejudice dissociation, which means that implicit patient–physician prejudice was observed but explicit social prejudice was not. In addition, the implicit patient–physician prejudice priming had a significant effect on patients’ reaction times of Emotional Stroop task and SCP, but no effect of LDT. It indicated that the implicit prejudice did not improve memory accessibility in the later stages of information processing, but rather triggered selective attention bias and hostile attribution bias in preceding stages. Such a conclusion supported the Interpretation-First Model of aggressive information processing. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Within the framework of the System Justification Theory, this study tested on the archival data from 16 European countries the general hypothesis that homonegativity (HN), as an expression of gender binarism and heteronormativity, works as a legitimizing myth of gender hierarchy. Specifically, we hypothesized that (1) system justification (SJ) would positively relate to HN and (2) this relation would depend on the country level of gender hierarchy, (3) on the gender of respondents, and (4) on the interaction between gender hierarchy and gender. We selected the Gender Equality Index (GEI) as an indicator of the gender hierarchy of the country system and the items from the European Social Survey-Round 9 (ESS-9) as the indicators of the gender of respondents and the levels of SJ and HN. The Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) partially confirmed the hypotheses, suggesting HN to work as a blatant prejudice and being more viable as a legitimizing myth in females from countries with higher gender hierarchy and in males from more gender-equal countries. In both cases, HN serves as a myth to justify the ontological premise of participants that the world is fair and to counteract the cognitive dissonance generated by the perception of a gender-unequal system (in the case of a woman) or by the perception of a gender-equal system that can threaten gender privileges (in the case of a man). © Copyright © 2021 Ferrari, Imperato and Mancini.

AB  - People typically reject being negatively stereotyped but overlook the ways in which they are positively stereotyped. The current study focused on the attitude of Chinese women toward being evaluated based on the traditional positive stereotype that women are virtuous; family/work centrality as a boundary condition of these attitudes; and three perceptions that may mediate the link between this type of evaluation and attitudes of women. In experiment 1, female college students were identified as work-oriented or family-oriented based on their responses to a questionnaire regarding their focus on these two domains. They then read a vignette in which a man evaluated a female target under random assignment to one of three conditions, namely: group positive stereotype evaluation, individual positive stereotype evaluation, or unstereotypical positive evaluation. The participants rated how much they liked the female target, as an indicator of their attitude toward evaluations based on the stereotype that women are virtuous. In experiment 2, female college students were classified as work- oriented or family-oriented, and then read a vignette in which a man (the target) evaluated them. They were randomly assigned to the group positive stereotype evaluation, individual positive stereotype evaluation, or unstereotypical positive evaluation. Participants rated how much they liked the male target, as an indicator of their attitude toward evaluations based on the positive stereotype that women are virtuous. Across both studies, ANOVA showed that work-oriented women liked evaluations based on both group and individual stereotypes less than the family-oriented women. Regression-based analyses showed evidence of a mediation process in which work-oriented women viewed the virtuous positive stereotype as implying a prescriptive social demand that women should engage in family roles, resulting in a negative reaction to this type of evaluation. © Copyright © 2021 Song, Li, Liu and Ruan.

AB  - Previous research often suggests that people who endorse more essentialist beliefs about social groups are also likely to show increased prejudice towards members of these social groups, and there is even some evidence to suggest that essentialism may lead to prejudice and stereotyping. However, there are several notable exceptions to this pattern in that, for certain social groups (e.g., gay men and lesbians), higher essentialism is actually related to lower prejudice. The current studies further explored the relationship between essentialism and prejudice by examining a novel type of essentialism - transgender essentialism (i.e., essentializing transgender identity), and its relationship to prejudice towards transgender people. Study 1 (N = 248) tested the viability of transgender essentialism as a construct and examined the association between transgender essentialism and transprejudice, while Studies 2a (N = 315), 2b (N = 343), 3a (N = 310), and 3b (N = 204) tested two casual pathways to explain this relationship. The results consistently showed that the more that people endorse transgender essentialist beliefs, the warmer their feelings towards trans people (relative to cis people) were, echoing past research showing a similar relationship between essentialism and prejudice towards sexual minorities. However, the manipulations of both essentialism (Studies 2a and 2b) and prejudice (Studies 3a and 3b) were largely unsuccessful at changing the desired construct, meaning we were unable to provide direct causal tests. The one exception was a successful manipulation of the universality of trans experiences, but even here this resulted in no change in prejudice. The primary contribution of this work is in robustly demonstrating that greater transgender essentialism is associated with transprejudice. © 2021 University of California Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In two studies, we investigated how Hong Kong university students reacted to descriptions of China as multicultural vs. assimilatory, examining effects on emotions, prejudice toward Mainland Chinese, attitudes toward Hong Kong/China culture mixing, and cultural identities. Study 1 compared a multicultural priming condition to a control condition and found that the multiculturalism prime significantly reduced desire to socially distance from Mainland Chinese. Study 2 compared multiculturalism, assimilation, or control primes’ effects, and found that the multiculturalism prime, through increased positive emotions, indirectly reduced social distancing from Mainland Chinese and disgust toward culture mixing, and increased Chinese ethnic identity and multicultural identity styles; the assimilation prime had the opposite indirect effects through increasing negative emotions. Results show new evidence of the importance of emotion in how non-immigrant regional groups, who are both minority and majority culture members, react to different diversity models. Multicultural frames increased positive emotions, with downstream positive effects on both intergroup attitudes and integrated identities. © Copyright © 2021 Ye and Buchtel.

AB  - The arable-pastoral ecotone in northern China is ecologically fragile and the region has experienced substantial climatic variability, triggering population migrations, and the alternation of subsistence strategies during the historical period. However, the lack of continuous proxy records of arable and grazing activity has hampered our understanding of shifts in subsistence strategies and their relationship with climatic and societal changes. We obtained records of Sporormiella-type spores and crop pollen from Gonghai Lake in northern China to reconstruct changes in cultivation and grazing intensity over the past approximately 2000 years. The results show that intensive grazing and cultivation occurred during the Sui and early-middle Tang Dynasties (581–820 CE), when there was a relatively favourable climate, harmonious ethnic relations, and strong central government control. Conversely, weakened agricultural activity in the late Tang Dynasty (820–907 CE) corresponded to a deteriorating climate and frequent wars. High temperatures during the northern Song Dynasty (960–1127 CE) promoted the expansion of arable land in mountainous areas, whereas a cold climate and societal crises during the Era of Disunity (220–580 CE) and the Ming-Qing Dynasties (1368–1912 CE) limited the expansion of cultivated land and there was a shift to grazing as a subsistence activity. Time-series analysis reveals that the arable farming phases had a longer periodicity than the grazing phases, possibly because of the greater resilience of the former to climate change and the attachment of agriculturalists to their land. Our findings potentially help improve our understanding of the impact of land use on soil degradation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the role of religion in xenophobic responses to the threat of Ebola. Religious communities often offer members strong social ties and social support, which may help members cope with psychological and physical threat, including global threats like Ebola. Our analysis of a nationally representative sample in the U.S. (N = 1,000) found that overall, the more vulnerable to Ebola people felt, the more they exhibited xenophobic responses, but this relationship was moderated by importance of religion. Those who perceived religion as more important in their lives exhibited weaker xenophobic reactions than those who perceived religion as less important. Furthermore, social connectedness measured by collectivism explained the moderating role of religion, suggesting that higher collectivism associated with religion served as a psychological buffer. Religious people showed attenuated threat responses because they had a stronger social system that may offer resources for its members to cope with psychological and physical threats. The current research highlights that different cultural groups react to increased threats in divergent ways. © Copyright © 2021 Chuang, Eom and Kim.

AB  - The number of people with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been increasing worldwide. Anxiety about potential infection, fear of severe illness, death, economic problems, and loneliness and isolation brought on by social distancing are increasingly being experienced by people. Therefore, it is imperative to address and improve such mental health-related problems during COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the current mental health care and psychological intervention statuses related to COVID-19 in Japan. In a questionnaire survey, 55 of 69 (80%) mental health and welfare centers and 194 of 931 (21%) psychiatric institutions across Japan responded. COVID-19 patients, their family members, and the general public often consulted the mental health and welfare institutions through telephone. The questionnaire included various information of mental health difficulties related to COVID-19 such as the numbers and contents of the consultations, and the type of the interventions. The contents of consultation included psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and alcohol problems) and psychosocial problems (interpersonal problems, prejudice, and discrimination). Overall, 9% of mental health and welfare centers provided psychological first aid as psychological intervention and 28% of consultations involved cases requiring urgent care. In Japan, consultations about COVID-19-related mental health problems occurred mainly in mental health and welfare centers. There is urgent need to establish a system that enables mental health triage and brief psychological interventions that are feasible in the centers. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The Supreme Court of India struck down Section 377, the anti-sodomy law against homosexuality, on 6 September 2018. However, such a step seldom finds socio-cultural acceptance and inclusivity in the country. The silence around non-conforming gender expressions of queer lives exacerbates oppression, which invisibilises and normalises queerphobic violence. This qualitative exploratory study aims to map 'silence' in the growing up years of twenty respondents residing in Kolkata. The study documents derogatory language, inadequate terminologies, misguided exposure, limited same-sex representation, prejudiced fear, absence of parental-peer support and negotiation with attires that lead to internalised silence in a predominantly heteronormative Indian society. © 2021 Tata Institute of Social Sciences.

AB  - Translation plays a crucial role in today's globalised and interconnected world. Yet, it seems that no one can prevent an unqualified person from translating (Pym et al. 2012). This situation raises a number of fundamental questions: is it a problem that anyone can translate and, if so, to whom and how?; is translation a formal profession and, if not, should it become one?; if it is a formal profession or if it becomes one, should it be regulated and, if so, why and how? Before answering these questions, mostly by the affirmative, this article examines the current status of translation as a profession as well as the main causes and effects of this status. It shows that the concept of risk of prejudice due to incompetent translation should be at the heart of the positioning of translation as a profession. It also shows that prejudicial texts (see definition) must imperatively be translated by qualified translators and that social interest, namely ensuring public protection against erroneous translations, should take precedence over professional interest, i.e., the promotion of translators, for the full recognition of the translation profession. © 2021 University of Roehampton.

AB  - Objectives: the present article aims to analyze the social rights and employability of international immigrants in the State of Paraná in the pandemic conjuncture with the objective of delimiting the main contours of international migration in the State of Paraná from the perspective of social rights and employability in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methodology: The methodology used is deductive dialogic, starting from general concepts such as the migratory process to specific premises such as the social rights of immigrants in the State of Paraná and the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, privileging the dialogue of sources. To this end, it makes use of bibliographic research for the construction and development of the research. Results: the present research has shown that the immigrant population, especially that of the State of Paraná, the object of the present research, which already suffers numerous prejudices due to the migratory flow, has faced a state of hypervulnerability in this state of Covid-19 pandemic, especially, regarding the economic and social aspect and the absence of public policies to address this situation further aggravates the realization of social rights and employability of these people. Contributions: The main contribution of this paper is to present an overview of the migration flow in Brazil from this scenario to dialogue about the negative impacts of Covid-19 regarding the effectiveness of social rights, especially regarding the employability of these foreign citizens in the state of Paraná. © 2021, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

AB  - Amidst society’s segregation of the people among minorities on the basis of gender, race, caste and creed, it is difficult to locate the position of another extreme social minority, i.e. persons with disabilities. But the turn of the century has validated some art and activism performed by persons with disabilities due to which the disabled have marked their position in literature, film and media to some extent, yet they have not secured a position of dignity in the mainstream. To make disabled people visible, Syed Sallauddin Pasha (the father Indian dance therapy for persons with disabilities) initiates his own Natya Shastra i.e. Classical Wheelchair Dances for differently abled artists. Drawing upon Syed Sallauddin Pasha’s therapeutic dance choreography, the present paper studies performance arts in the context of differently abled people, and for this, the paper explores the intersection of Performance Studies and Disability Studies. In performing arts (or dance in particular), the body is the medium of representation, likewise, the body defines the identity in the context of disabled people. Therefore, the paper by studying the intersection of Disability Studies and Performance Studies, explores the stereotypes related to the body by scrutinising the disabled dance bodies on the stage. The paper further attempts to explore the idea of accessibility for persons with disabilities by taking into account the assistive devices and accessible architecture. The study then goes into an analysis of spectators’ response, stare and gaze towards disability dance performances. In a broader context, the paper offers to scrutinise the negative stereotypes attached to disability and disabled dancing bodies on stage by exploring the nuances in Syed Sallauddin Pasha’s choreography. © AesthetixMS 2021

AB  - Individuals are better at recognizing faces from their own ethnic group compared with other ethnicity faces-the other-ethnicity effect (OEE). This finding is said to reflect differences in experience and familiarity to faces from other ethnicities relative to faces corresponding with the viewers' ethnicity. However, own-ethnicity face recognition performance ranges considerably within a population, from very poor to extremely good. In addition, within-population recognition performance on other-ethnicity faces can also vary considerably with some individuals being classed as "other ethnicity face blind" (Wan et al., 2017). Despite evidence for considerable variation in performance within population for faces of both types, it is currently unclear whether the magnitude of the OEE changes as a function of this variability. By recruiting large-scale multinational samples, we investigated the size of the OEE across the full range of own and other ethnicity face performance while considering measures of social contact. We find that the magnitude of the OEE is remarkably consistent across all levels of within-population own- and other-ethnicity face recognition ability, and this pattern was unaffected by social contact measures. These findings suggest that the OEE is a persistent feature of face recognition performance, with consequences for models built around very poor, and very good face recognizers.

AB  - Since the reform and opening up program was initiated in 1978, China’s urbanization has made rapid progress, but urban development remains unbalanced and insufficient. From the perspective of social and cultural diversity, this paper explores the impact of dialect diversity on city size. Dialect diversity impedes the expansion of cities by causing a trust segmentation and impeding cross-regional factor flow and the factor agglomeration effect. Based on the regional dialect diversity indicator and the NPP-VIIRS city night-time light index of 2016, this paper offers an empirical study of the impact of dialect diversity on city size. Econometric results indicate that dialect diversity has a significantly negative impact on city size. On average, an increase of each dialect sub-category leads to a decrease in city size estimated by the night-time light index by 4.55%. Robustness test and causality identification reveal that the estimated results of this paper have a robust causal relationship. Further empirical research indicates that dialect diversity affects the expansion of city size by inhibiting the flow and agglomeration of labor, capital and technology factors. Our research suggests that the development of diverse and inclusive modern cities needs to balance the costs and benefits of cultural diversity and uniformity, break through cultural barriers, remove cultural prejudices, raise the level of social trust, and give play to the complementary effect of cultural diversity. © 2021, China Economist editorial department.

AB  - Sexual health, an essential component of individual's health, is influenced by many complex issues including sexual behavior, attitudes, societal, and cultural factors on the one hand and while on the other hand, biological aspects, genetic predisposition, and associated mental and physical illnesses. Sexual health is a neglected area, even though it influences mortality, morbidity, and disability. Dhat syndrome (DS), the term coined by Dr. N. N. Wig, has been at the forefront of advancements in understanding and misunderstanding. The concept of DS is still evolving being treated as a culture-bound syndrome in the past to a syndrome of depression and treated as 'a culturally determined idiom of distress.' It is bound with myths, fallacies, prejudices, secrecy, exaggeration, and value-laden judgments. Although it has been reported from many countries, much of the literature has emanated from Asia, that too mainly from India. The research in India has ranged from the study of a few cases in the past to recent national multicentric studies concerning phenomenology and beliefs of patients. The epidemiological studies have ranged from being hospital-based to population-based studies in rural and urban settings. There are studies on the management of individual cases by resolving sexual myths, relaxation exercises, supportive psychotherapy, anxiolytics, and antidepressants to broader and deeper research concerning cognitive behavior therapy. The presentation looks into DS as a model case highlighting the importance of exploring sexual health concerns in the Indian population in general and in particular need to reconsider DS in the light of the newly available literature. It makes a fervent appeal for the inclusion of DS in the mainstream diagnostic categories in the upcoming revisions of the diagnostic manuals which can pave the way for a better understanding and management of DS and sexual problems. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound health and social impacts. COVID-19 also affords opportunities to study the emergence of prejudice as a factor in taking protective actions. This study investigated the association of COVID-19 concerns, prejudicial beliefs, and personal actions that involve life disruptions among people not living with and people living with HIV. 338 Black/African American men not living with HIV who reported male sex partners and 148 Black/African American men living with HIV who reported male sex partners completed a confidential survey that measured COVID-19 concern, COVID-19 prejudice, and personal action and institutionally imposed COVID-19 disruptions. Participants reported having experienced multiple social and healthcare disruptions stemming from COVID-19, including reductions in social contacts, canceling medical appointments, and inability to access medications. Mediation analyses demonstrated that COVID-19 concerns and COVID-19 prejudice were associated with personal action disruptions, indicating that these social processes are important for understanding how individuals modified their lives in response to COVID-19. It is imperative that public health efforts combat COVID-19 prejudice as these beliefs undermine investments in developing healthcare infrastructure to address COVID-19 prevention. © 2021 Society of Behavioral Medicine.

AB  - Background: There is still an HIV epidemic in the United States, which is a substantial issue for populations bearing a disproportionate burden of HIV infections. Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has proven to be safe and effective in reducing HIV acquisition risk. However, studies document that PrEP awareness/usage is low. There is also limited understanding of social media platforms, such as Instagram, as PrEP information sources. Objective: Given the paucity of research on PrEP-related Instagram posts and popularity of this social media platform, the purpose of this research is to describe the source characteristics, image types, and textual contents of PrEP-related posts on Instagram. Methods: Using Crowdtangle Search, a public insights tool owned/operated by Facebook, we retrieved publicly accessible and English-language-only Instagram posts for the 12-month period preceding April 22, 2020, using the following terms: Truvada or “pre-exposure prophylaxis” or #truvada or #truvadaprep or #truvadawhore or #truvadaforprep. We employed a qualitative coding methodology to manually extract information from posts. Using a pretested codebook, we performed content analysis on 250 posts, examining message and source characteristics (ie, organization type [eg, government, news] and individual type [eg, physician]), including information about PrEP (eg, how it works, cost), and indicated users. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for all categorical variables. A Chi-square test was conducted to determine differences between source types on a variety of message characteristics. Results: Three-quarters of the posts (193/250, 77.2%) were posted by organizations. Of the 250 posts reviewed, approximately two-thirds (174/250, 69.6%) included a photograph, more than half (142/250, 56.8%) included an infographic, and approximately one-tenth (30/250, 12%) included a video. More than half defined PrEP (137/250, 54.8%), but fewer posts promoted PrEP use, explained how PrEP works, and included information on the effectiveness of PrEP or who can use it. The most commonly hashtagged populations among posts were men who have sex with men (MSM), but not necessarily bisexual men. Few posts contained race-/ethnicity-related hashtags (11/250, 4.4%). Fewer posts contained transgender-associated tags (eg, #transgirl; 5/250, 2%). No posts contained tags related to heterosexuals or injection drug users. We found statistical differences between source types (ie, individual versus organization). Specifically, posts from organizations more frequently contained information about who can use PrEP, whereas posts from individuals more frequently contained information describing adverse effects. Conclusions: This study is among the first to review Instagram for PrEP-related content, and it answers the National AIDS Strategy's call for a clearer articulation of the science surrounding HIV risk/prevention through better understanding of the current public information environment. This study offers a snapshot of how PrEP is being discussed (and by whom) on one of the most popular social media platforms and provides a foundation for developing and implementing PrEP promotion interventions on Instagram. © Eric Walsh-Buhi, Rebecca Fagen Houghton, Claire Lange, Ryli Hockensmith, John Ferrand, Lourdes Martinez.

AB  - It is well investigated that the expression of racial prejudice is often induced by news coverage on the internet, and the exposure to media contributes to the cultivation of long-term prejudice. However, there is a lack of information regarding the immediate effects of news delivered through television or television-like media on the expression of racial prejudice. This study provides a framework for understanding such effects by focusing on content-audience associations using the logs of an “online television” service, which provides television-like content and user experiences. With these logs, we found an association between the news-watching and comment-posting behaviors. Consequently, logs relevant to two distinct forms of racism, modern and old-fashioned racism, were extracted. Using mathematical modeling, which considers the different levels of program inducements to racist expression, personal inclinations of audiences to racism, and certainty of prediction of audience behaviors, we found three associative patterns between the news programs and audiences. The relevance of the topics covered to the basic beliefs of each form of racism was characterized into three clusters: expression as a reaction to news that is directly relevant to the basic beliefs of racism with weak inducements by non-bigots, minority abuse by distorting the meanings of news content indirectly relevant to the beliefs but with strong inducements by audiences with a strong bias, and racial toxic opinions independent of the news content by clear bigots. Our findings provide implications for inhibiting the expression of online prejudice based on the characteristics of these patterns. © 2021 Takano et al.

AB  - Transgender and gender diverse people have unique risks and needs in the context of sexual health, but little is known about sexual health care for this population. In 2018, a national, online survey of sexual health and well-being was conducted with trans and gender diverse people in Australia (n = 1,613). Data from this survey were analysed to describe uptake of sexual health care and experiences of interpersonal and structural cisgenderism and transphobia. Experiences of cisgenderism and transphobia in sexual health care were assessed using a new, four-item scale of 'gender insensitivity', which produced scores ranging from 0 (highly gender sensitive) to 4 (highly gender insensitive). Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to determine if experiences of gender insensitivity in sexual health care were associated with uptake and frequency of HIV/STI testing in the 12 months prior to participation. Trans and gender diverse participants primarily accessed sexual health care from general practice clinics (86.8%), followed by publicly funded sexual health clinics (45.6%), community-based services (22.3%), and general hospitals (14.9%). Experiences of gender insensitivity were common overall (73.2% of participants reported ≥2 negative experiences) but most common in hospitals (M = 2.9, SD = 1.3) and least common in community- based services (M = 1.3, SD = 1.4; p<0.001). When controlling for sociodemographic factors, social networks, general access to health care, and sexual practices, higher levels of gender insensitivity in previous sexual health care encounters were associated with a lower likelihood of recent HIV/STI testing (adjusted prevalence ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]:091,0.96, p<0.001) and less-frequent HIV/STI testing (B = -0.07, 95%CI:-0.10,- 0.03, p = 0.007). Given the high rates of HIV and other STIs among trans and gender diverse people in Australia and overseas, eliminating cisgenderism and transphobia in sexual health care may help improve access to diagnostic testing to reduce infection rates and support the overall sexual health and well-being of these populations. © 2021 Rosenberg et al.

AB  - LGBQ+ youth (youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, or with diverse identities other than straight or heterosexual) contend with unique stressors in the context of their peer relationships. They also access critical support from peers. These circumstances likely influence how LGBQ+ youth navigate and experience their relationships. Nevertheless, research remains limited in its breadth and depth of coverage of LGBQ+ youth's peer relationships. We suggest ways to advance such research within the following areas: (a) identity development in the peer context; (b) identity disclosure and “coming out” to peers; (c) initiating, developing, and maintaining friendships under marginalizing conditions; (d) homophily or diversity in LGBQ+ youth's friendships; (e) visualizing LGBQ+ youth's positions in their peer networks; (f) bias-based harassment, hypervigilance, and rejection sensitivity; and (g) peer action and advocacy. This work could yield richer understandings of how LGBQ+ youth cultivate meaningful, lasting peer relationships and thrive. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Personal transport is of high importance in our society and the 2020 pandemic situation has reinforced this situation. At the same time, transport contributes to local emissions, which need to be reduced in the face of climate change. Changing from vehicles with internal combustion engines to light electric vehicles could be one promising approach. Therefore, we need to understand mobility patterns and attitudes towards E-mobility to create sustainable transport solutions that will be broadly accepted. An online survey with N = 432 participants across Europe was conducted. The majority of respondents came from Germany, followed by Italy, Austria and Sweden. Generally, cars are the main vehicle for personal transport. PTWs are used for commuting as well as leisure activity. Driving experience, easier parking and lower maintenance compared to cars are major reasons to choose a PTW. No differences between younger and elderly participants were observed. E-PTWs are primarily avoided due to high costs, range anxiety and expected problems with the charging infrastructure. To support sustainable mobility, these obstacles need to be overcome. One aspect is definitely the provision of better charging infrastructure or electric vehicles with increased range. Hence, given typical trip lengths and purposes, it might seem equally important to tackle prejudices and increase the knowledge about E-mobility with all its potential benefits in the population. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The current context of growing religious and cultural diversity requires, from societies, an adequate management of the expression of religious diversity in different social spheres, including the workplace. Muslim women who wear the hijab are one of the social groups that most frequently suffer prejudice and discrimination in work settings due to the intersection of multiple forms of discrimination, including gender, ethnic origin, religion and the use of a visible religious symbol. With the aim of exploring the experiences of Muslim women with hijab and identifying barriers and opportunities in their access to employment in Catalonia (Spain), a qualitative study with a communicative orientation was conducted, involving twelve communicative daily-life stories with Muslim women who wear the hijab and eleven in-depth interviews with a communicative orientation with other relevant actors in the fields of training and employment (employers, managers of internship programs, political representatives, etc.). The findings revealed some pending challenges and effective pathways to improve the employment and social inclusion of Muslim women wearing the hijab. The implications of the study point to the need to incorporate respect for diversity as a necessary value to move towards more inclusive societies. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This thesis aims to understand the perspectives and experiences of older people regarding the concept of active ageing in their later working life with biographical narratives. This research adopted a biographical narrative interview for data collection. A total of 15 employed older people were interviewed by the researcher. The collected data were analysed using the biographical narrative analysis of Schütze (1983). The research findings are the following: in the first theme, the driving force to enable older people to choose active ageing in the workplace was their confidence in their work ability to include a challenging attitude at work. In the second theme, another driving force to enable older people to participate in economic activity that was considered was the individual work-ability of active older workers, including health rather than their chronological ageing in the labour market. However, in the third theme, research participants believed that the barrier of active ageing is a negative social prejudice on the working ability of older people. From this point of view, the research participants suggested that negative social prejudice for older workers should be overcome by active ageing experiences in age‐friendly working environments as the fourth theme. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Dance is proven to offer a myriad of physical, psychological, and social benefits. However, because dance has been frequently perceived as a feminine practice, there is a prevailing prejudice towards boys who dance, making it hard for them to engage in this physical activity. Social marketing has been presented as a promising framework to deal with different social problems, including prejudice, although its effectiveness is still difficult to establish. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a quasi-experimental study involving a sample of 436 children and adolescents, composed of 51.38% boys and 48.62% girls was implemented to measure the effectiveness of a Social Marketing Intervention (SMI) in reducing prejudice towards dance and boys who dance, in particular, and in increasing their intentions to practice this physical activity. The study furthermore aimed to compare the influence of the SMI on participants of two different stages of child development to ascertain when it is most effective to intervene. The questionnaire was used to collect information and included items derived from relevant literature. To assess differences between children and adolescents before and after the SMI, the analysis relied on independent t-tests and paired t-tests. Results suggest positive effects of the SMI on some dimensions of the TPB. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Stigmatizing attitudes against individuals diagnosed with mental illness could increase the severity of psychiatric symptoms, lead to delay in getting medical support, and decrease adherence to treatments. Identifying the groups most associated with stigmatization could orientate actions to reduce this prejudice and improve patients’ prognosis. Objective: To investigate variables associated with stigmatization toward psychiatric disorders in Brazil. Methods: A Web-based survey was sent out to assess the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception of mental illness. Included participants were composed of Brazilians aged 18 years or over, with access to the internet and social networks. The questionnaire was available from June to August 2018 on Facebook. Results: A total of 2414 respondents were included. The majority were female, white, aged between 18 and 29 years, and had more than 10 years of study. The variables associated with stigma were male sex, fewer years of education, lower household income, the presence of a psychiatric disorder in a first-degree relative, and internalized stigma. Conclusions: The present study identified variables associated with the stigma against psychiatric disorders. Future studies should propose intervention strategies, such as to foster education about mental illness and to promote the importance of seeking help from a mental health professional, to address this problem in Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the learning environment (ie, workload, program efficiency, social support, organizational culture, meaning in work, and mistreatment) and evaluate associations with burnout in general surgery residents. BACKGROUND SUMMARY DATA: Burnout remains high among general surgery residents and has been linked to workplace exposures such as workload, discrimination, abuse, and harassment. Associations between other measures of the learning environment are poorly understood. METHODS: Following the 2019 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination, a cross-sectional survey was administered to all US general surgery residents. The learning environment was characterized using an adapted Areas of Worklife survey instrument, and burnout was measured using an abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory. Associations between burnout and measures of the learning environment were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Analysis included 5277 general surgery residents at 301 programs (85.6% response rate). Residents reported dissatisfaction with workload (n = 784, 14.9%), program efficiency and resources (n = 1392, 26.4%), social support and community (n = 1250, 23.7%), organizational culture and values (n = 853, 16.2%), meaning in work (n = 1253, 23.7%), and workplace mistreatment (n = 2661, 50.4%). The overall burnout rate was 43.0%, and residents were more likely to report burnout if they also identified problems with residency workload [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.94], efficiency (aOR 1.74; 95% CI 1.49-2.03), social support (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.15-1.64), organizational culture (aOR 1.64; 95% CI 1.39-1.93), meaning in work (aOR 1.87; 95% CI 1.56-2.25), or experienced workplace mistreatment (aOR 2.49; 95% CI 2.13-2.90). Substantial program-level variation was observed for all measures of the learning environment. CONCLUSIONS: Resident burnout is independently associated with multiple aspects of the learning environment, including workload, social support, meaning in work, and mistreatment. Efforts to help programs identify and address weaknesses in a targeted fashion may improve trainee burnout. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies show that radical right parties in Europe receive relatively low levels of supports from Christian voters, despite that Christian value is highlighted in the European radical right agenda. However, the mechanism remains largely untested. The study investigates the factors underlying Christians voting or not voting for populist radical right parties across Europe, using Round 8 European Social Survey data. It is shown that there is no general relationship between Christian religiosity and radical right voting across European countries. In most countries, Christians are neither more nor less likely to vote for the radical right parties compared to the non-religious. When Christians are underrepresented in radical right supporters, it can hardly be explained by tolerance towards immigrants, pro-social values or social capital presumed to be fostered by Christian religion and church engagement. In some other cases, where Christians are more likely to vote for radical right parties, it is likely to be driven by anti-immigrant attitudes, authoritarian values and moral conservative values. In addition, Christians could have been more mobilizable for radical right parties due to their authoritarian and moral conservative values, which have not been fully capitalized. The study suggests that Christian religiosity does not serve as an “antidote” to the radical right. Tolerance towards immigrants, pro-social values or social capital are rarely the mechanisms driving European Christians away from supporting radical right parties. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - How do different forms of group alignment influence our attitudes toward outgroups? To answer this, the current fieldwork study explored how identification and identity fusion differentially impact outgroup anxiety, prejudice, and hostility toward rival football fan supporter groups in Australia. The community participants (N = 100) were members of two active fan groups who had experienced a history of intergroup tensions. The findings from the full path model confirmed that the predictor group alignment variables of identification and fusion were correlated, and the two outcome variables of outgroup prejudice and hostility were correlated, as predicted. The findings also revealed that fusion with one's club predicted outgroup hostility, but not prejudice, whereas identification with one's club predicted outgroup prejudice, but not hostility. Additionally, outgroup anxiety was found to significantly mediate the relationship between ingroup identification and outgroup prejudice, whereas a similar relationship was not found for fusion. These findings highlight the differential impact of group alignment (i.e., identification and identity fusion) on social constructs of outgroup anxiety, prejudice, and hostility. Empirically, this is the first study to demonstrate the workings of these distinct group alignment pathways in an applied setting involving hard-core football fans. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for a fuller understanding of the drivers of intergroup tensions and conflict. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The researcher examined the experiences of Black British female managers (BBFM) who worked for Children and Young People's Services (CYPS) operating in the UK. The following research questions guided this study: How do Black British female managers experience racial microaggressions and how do they cope with it? Purposive and theoretical sampling were used to recruit 10 BBFM who worked for CYPS and who had similar demographic characteristics (i.e., racial/ethnic background and managerial experience). Interview transcripts were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006a). Over 200 codes were identified and extracted from individual interview transcripts. Organizing the codes into categories resulted in five themes that highlighted the challenging practices that BBFM perceived thwarted their careers (i.e., The Organizational Culture, On the Outside Looking In, Stereotype Threat, Prejudice, and Discrimination and Institutional Racism and Espoused Practice vs. Reality), and one theme that described their coping strategies (i.e., The Silent Catastrophe). Although the study is centered on a multisectorial sample, two main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, gendered racism curtails the career development of BBFM in ways that are not experienced by their White counterparts. Second, BBFM perceive that their experiences in CYPS was fundamentally negatively disproportionate and aversive. The implication is that CYPS leaders must give racial and gender equality, diversity and inclusion greater priority. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of this study was to understand the impact of the opioid overdose epidemic on the social lives of people suffering from chronic pain, focusing on interactions within their personal and professional circles. The study was based on 22 in-depth interviews with people living with chronic pain in Canada. Using thematic analysis, we documented three main impacts of the opioid overdose epidemic: (a) increased worries of people in pain and their families regarding the dangers of opioids; (b) prejudices, stigma, and discrimination faced during conversations about opioids; and (c) stigma management attempts, which include self-advocacy and concealment of opioid use. This study represents important knowledge advancement on how people manage stigma and communicate about chronic disease during everyday life interactions. By showing negative effects of the epidemic’s media coverage on the social experiences of people with chronic pain, we underscore needs for destigmatizing approaches in public communication regarding opioids. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: With the increase in internet use, new forms of child victimization like Online Sexual Abuse (OSA) have emerged. Children and adolescents rarely disclose these incidents and most disclosure happens around peers. Objective: This research addresses the perspective of adolescents (not victims of OSA), potential recipients of the disclosure, within the context of disclosure of OSA committed by either adult or peer perpetrators. Methods: The study was performed in two stages. We interviewed adolescents in Scotland and then conducted focus groups with adolescents from Chile. Participants and setting: 51 adolescents (6 from Scotland and 45 from Chile) aged 15–20 years participated. Results: Despite differences in age and cultural contexts, there were similarities in responses. Obstacles of disclosure included lack of clarity of OSA, prior levels of personal vulnerability, and gender factors (stereotypes and stigmatization). On the other hand, the disclosure process would be easier for adolescents with more personal resources (e.g. self-confidence) and when they have a supportive social environment, which includes parents, but especially peers. Conclusion: Disclosure of OSA is considered similar to the disclosure of offline sexual abuse. However, differences such as a lack of clarity regarding the boundaries of the relationships on the Internet, and presence of a generational gap between adolescents and their parents or tutors in the use of internet makes early disclosure of OSA highly challenging. Plans to facilitate disclosure should consider different components: behavioral (risky behaviors), emotional (feelings of fear and shame) and cognitive (lack of information, self-blame, stigma). This should be focused on adolescents, potential recipients of disclosure (parents, authorities and peers) and society, where the prejudices and practices that prevent disclosure begin. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS, MIM# 1359200) is a multisystem congenital disorder characterized by coarse facial features, hypoplasia of the fifth digits and nails, and intellectual disability. It is a genetically heterogeneous condition caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins of the BAF (BRG1-associated factors) chromatin modeling complex and its downstream transcriptional factor. To date over 220 CSS individuals with pathogenic variants found have been described in the literature. This case series reported 18 molecularly confirmed Chinese individuals (17 with ARIDIB (OMIM*614556) variants and one with SMARCB1 (OMIM*601607) variant) from 17 unrelated families in Hong Kong. The clinical features of these 18 Chinese CSS patients together with two previously reported Chinese patients with ARID1B variants were reviewed. Among the 19 Chinese patients with ARID1B variants, our data suggested a lower prevalence of feeding problem, autistic features, agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) or partial/hypoplasia of corpus callosum, and sparse hair when compared with previous reports. There was appearing higher prevalence of digital hypoplasia. Digital hypoplasia was observed to become less noticeable with time in some patients. This report highlighted the age-dependent phenotypic presentation of CSS and ethnicity-related effect on ARID1B-CSS phenotype. Moreover, this series included the first family with molecularly confirmed maternal somatic mosaicism of ARID1B variant leading to familial CSS recurrence. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - According to the dual model, outgroup members can be dehumanized by being thought to possess uniquely and characteristically human traits to a lesser extent than ingroup members. However, previous research on this topic has tended to investigate the attribution of human traits that are socially desirable in nature such as warmth, civility and rationality. As a result, it has not yet been possible to determine whether this form of dehumanization is distinct from intergroup preference and stereotyping. We first establish that participants associate undesirable (e.g., corrupt, jealous) as well as desirable (e.g., open-minded, generous) traits with humans. We then go on to show that participants tend to attribute desirable human traits more strongly to ingroup members but undesirable human traits more strongly to outgroup members. This pattern holds across three different intergroup contexts for which dehumanization effects have previously been reported: political opponents, immigrants and criminals. Taken together, these studies cast doubt on the claim that a trait-based account of representing others as ‘less human’ holds value in the study of intergroup bias. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Confrontation research has primarily focused on what drives individuals' intentions to confront strangers who express prejudicial attitudes (i.e., interpersonal bias; for reviews see Ashburn-Nardo & Karim, 2019; Kawakami, Karmali, & Vaccarino, 2019). However, bias manifests in multiple forms, including biased policies and institutional practices (i.e., structural bias) or bias perpetrated by close others (e.g., friends), and little is known about what factors impede (or facilitate) intentions to confront these different manifestations of bias. Across three experiments, European Americans reported wanting to confront instances of structural racial bias more than interpersonal racial bias. This was driven by perceptions that the examples of structural bias were more harmful and that confronting would be more effective in changing the perpetrator's behavior, compared with examples of interpersonal bias. Additionally, participants expressed greater intentions to confront friends over strangers (Studies 1–2), due to participants' perceptions that they personally would be effective confronters and that friends would be more receptive. This work provides insight into people's intentions to confront varying manifestations of bias, namely biased structures and close others. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Approximately 52% of young women report receiving threatening messages, sharing of their private photos by others without their consent, or sexual harassment online – examples of cyber-aggression towards women. A scale to measure endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women was developed to be inclusive of the many contemporary ways that women are targeted online. We examined sociopolitical ideologies (right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) and perceived threats (based on the Dual Process Motivational Model of Ideology and Prejudice, as well as Integrated Threat Theory) as predictors of endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women in three studies (Pilot Study, n = 46; Study 1, n = 276; Study 2, n = 6381). Study 1 and 2 participants were recruited from online video gaming communities; Study 2 comprised responses collected during or after a livestream of YouTubers doing the survey went viral. The YouTubers criticized feminism and alleged that female gamers had privilege in the gaming community. In all three studies, exploratory factor analyses suggested endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women is a unidimensional psychological construct and the scale demonstrated great internal reliability. In path analyses, social dominance orientation emerged as the most consistent predictor of endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women, mediated, in part, by perceived threats. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Prior research has identified the divergence across different stakeholder groups in the semantic choice of language when describing autism, as members of the autism and autistic community preferred to use identity-first language (autistic person), whereas professionals were more likely to use person-first language (person with autism). This study explored 803 e-learners’ responses from their comments across two massive open online courses on autism education held between 2017 and 2019. Comments from members of the autistic and autism community and professionals were analysed together using thematic analysis, to identify shared opinions on what, why and how language should be used when describing autism across stakeholder groups. Learners agreed that autistic individuals should guide others on which terminology to use when describing autism and that the diagnostic label is a way to facilitate understanding across stakeholder groups and help the individual gain access to support. Semantic language choices may matter less as long as the person’s difficulties are clearly acknowledged, with adaptations made to meet their specific needs. Adding to a growing body of literature on terminology use in autism research and practice, we highlight that consideration for semantic choice of language use should focus on communicating an individual’s strengths and differences. Lay abstract: Within the neurodiversity movement, one recent divergence is in the semantic choice of language when describing autism, as members of the autism and autistic community preferred to use identity-first language (autistic person), whereas professionals were more likely to use person-first language (person with autism). This study explored 803 e-learners’ responses from their comments across two massive open online courses on autism education held between 2017 and 2019. Learners agreed that autistic individuals should guide others on which terminology to use when describing autism, and although identity-first language acknowledges autism as part of an individual’s identity, it can also conjure up negative stereotypes and be stigmatising. Although family, friends and professionals highlighted that the diagnostic label is a way to facilitate understanding across stakeholder groups and help autistic individuals gain access to support, autistic self-advocates found the process of disclosing autism as a form of disability to conflict with their sense of identity, and broader terms such as ‘autism spectrum’ failed to capture individual strengths and weaknesses. Semantic language choices may matter less as long as the person’s difficulties are clearly acknowledged, with adaptations made to meet their specific needs. Adding to a growing body of literature on terminology use in autism research and practice, we highlight that language used when describing autism should follow the autistic individual’s lead, with the primary focus on communicating an individual’s strengths and difficulties, to foster a sense of positive autism identity and inclusivity, and enable access to appropriate support. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Research summary: Combining insights from research on firm-level stakeholders with the well-established micro literature on social categorization, we develop and test a theory regarding the relative survivorship of female-owned and male-owned businesses. The theory is based on proportional representation within geographic areas, defined as each area's female-owned proprietorship count divided by its total proprietorship count. Analyzing survivorship of over one million proprietorships, we find a robust positive relationship between proportional representation and survival. We then examine effects of local stakeholders such as banks, customers, and network opportunities, in combination with proportional representation. Our research suggests that the effects of female proportional representation are more pervasive than previously considered, influenced by communities of business stakeholders, and, in some cases, leveling the playing field for female entrepreneurs. Managerial summary: We analyzed relative survival duration of one million female- and male-owned proprietorship businesses. We argued that a higher proportional representation of female business owners among all owners in a geographical area would combat negative stereotypes about women's business competence. We found that female-owned businesses survived relatively longer than their male-owned counterparts in areas with substantial proportional representation of female owners and that the relative benefits for women were magnified in the presence of local banks (which provide capital) as well as in customer-rich and network-rich areas. Business ownership has been proposed to be a “great equalizer” for women frustrated by the glass ceilings of corporate employment. We find this is true, but only in areas with a high proportional representation of women among business owners. © 2021 Strategic Management Society

AB  - Intergroup conflict and bias often occur between subgroups nested within a superordinate group. In these situations, the leader of the superordinate group plays a key role, as an intergroup leader, in reducing conflict. To be effective, an intergroup leader should avoid (1) threatening the subgroups' distinctive identities, and (2) being viewed by one or both groups as ‘one of them’ rather than ‘one of us’. Intergroup leadership theory (Acad Manag Rev, 37, 2012a, 232) posits intergroup leaders can improve subgroup relations by promoting an intergroup relational identity. Two studies (Ns = 178 and 223) tested whether an out-subgroup or in-subgroup leader could improve intergroup attitudes, even among strong subgroup identifiers, by promoting either an intergroup relational identity or a collective identity. We hypothesized an interaction of these variables demonstrating the effectiveness of an intergroup relational identity message for an out-subgroup leader in lessening ingroup bias, especially among strong subgroup identification. Our results, and a meta-analytic summary across both studies (N = 401), supported our hypothesis and intergroup leadership theory, demonstrating an intergroup relational identity is an effective strategy for improving intergroup relations. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Weight bias towards individuals with obesity exists among medical professionals; yet, there is less evidence of the extent to which weight biases exist in different types of nursing professions. This study aimed to describe pediatric surgery and school nurses' weight biases towards children with obesity and examine factors associated with weight biases. Design and methods: Pediatric surgery (n = 108) and school nurses (n = 177) completed a single online survey that assessed their attitudes towards weight regarding children with obesity. Responses were categorized as % agreement (responded “agree” or “strongly agree” to a given statement). Nurses also reported % time spent working with children who had obesity. Results: Almost all nurses (>93%) agreed it was important to treat patients with obesity with compassion and respect. However, many nurses endorsed statements stating that patients with obesity are often non-compliant with treatment recommendations (47%) and can be difficult to deal with (35%). Only about half of school nurses (53%) and surgical nurses (56%) felt professionally prepared to effectively treat patients with obesity. Nurses commonly reported hearing/witnessing other professionals in their field make negative comments (69%) or convey negative stereotypes (55%) about patients with obesity. School nurses who spent a greater % of time working with children with overweight had more positive weight attitudes (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Negative attitudes towards patients with obesity were relatively prevalent in this population of pediatric surgery and school nurses. Practice implications: There is a need for more educational opportunities, professional trainings, and policy initiatives to reduce weight bias among nurses. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Non-autistic adults often hold explicit and implicit biases toward autism that contribute to personal and professional challenges for autistic people. Although previous research indicates that non-autistic adults with higher autism knowledge and familiarity express more inclusionary attitudes, it remains unclear whether training programs designed to promote autism acceptance and understanding affect subsequent implicit and explicit biases toward autism. In this study, non-autistic adults (N = 238) completed an autism acceptance training featuring factual information and engaging first-person narratives, a general mental health training not mentioning autism, or a no-training control, then responded to surveys assessing their autism knowledge, stigma, and impressions of autistic adults, and completed a novel implicit association task about autism. Non-autistic adults in the autism acceptance training condition reported more positive impressions of autistic adults, demonstrated fewer misconceptions and lower stigma about autism, endorsed higher expectations of autistic abilities, and expressed greater social interest in hypothetical and real autistic people. However, training had no effect on implicit biases, with non-autistic adults associating autism-related labels with unpleasant personal attributes regardless of training condition. These findings suggest that the autism acceptance training program in this study, designed to increase autism knowledge and familiarity among non-autistic people, holds promise for reducing explicit but not implicit biases toward autism. Lay abstract: Autistic adults face prejudice from non-autistic people. They are often judged unfairly and left out of social activities because of their differences. This can make it difficult for autistic people to make friends and find jobs. Some training programs have tried to teach autistic people to act more like non-autistic people to help them gain acceptance. Fewer have focused on teaching non-autistic people how to be more autism friendly. In this study, we used a short training video that teaches people about autism. The video was created with the help of autistic adults and included clips of real autistic people. We found that non-autistic people who watched this video had better knowledge about autism and showed more autism-friendly attitudes than those who watched a video about mental health or those who did not watch any video. They were more open to having a relationship with an autistic person and had more positive beliefs about autism. However, our video did not affect people’s unconscious attitudes about autism. People in our study connected autism with unpleasant traits, even if they had watched the autism training video. This suggests that teaching non-autistic people about autism may promote more autism-friendly attitudes, but some beliefs may be harder to change. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Early in life, greater exposure to diverse people can change the tendency to prefer one's own social group. For instance, infants from racially diverse environments show less preference for their own-race (ingroup) over other-race (outgroup) faces than infants from racially homogeneous environments. Yet how social environment changes ingroup versus outgroup demarcation in infancy remains unclear. A commonly held assumption is that early emerging ingroup preference is based on an affective process: feeling more comfortable with familiar ingroup than unfamiliar outgroup members. However, other processes may also underlie ingroup preference: Infants may attend more to ingroup than outgroup members and/or mirror the actions of ingroup over outgroup individuals. By aggregating 7- to 12-month-old infants’ electroencephalography (EEG) activity across three studies, we disambiguate these different processes in the EEG oscillations of preverbal infants according to social environment. White infants from more racially diverse neighborhoods exhibited greater frontal theta oscillation (an index of top-down attention) and more mu rhythm desynchronization (an index of motor system activation and potentially neural mirroring) to racial outgroup individuals than White infants from less racially diverse neighborhoods. Neighborhood racial demographics did not relate to White infants’ frontal alpha asymmetry (a measure of approach-withdrawal motivation) toward racial outgroup individuals. Racial minority infants showed no effects of neighborhood racial demographics in their neural responses to racial outgroup individuals. These results indicate that neural mechanisms that may underlie social bias and prejudices are related to neighborhood racial demographics in the first year of life. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Having close relationships with outgroup members is an especially powerful form of intergroup contact that can reduce prejudice. Rather than examine the consequences of forming close outgroup relationships, which has previously been studied as part of intergroup contact theory, we examine how outgroup relationships—relative to ingroup relationships—form in the first place. We collected 7 years of data from Jewish Israeli and Palestinian teenagers attending a 3-week summer camp at Seeds of Peace, one of the largest conflict transformation programs in the world. We tested how being assigned to share an activity group (e.g., bunk, table, dialogue group) influenced relationship formation among outgroup pairs (Jewish Israeli–Palestinian) compared with ingroup pairs (Israeli–Israeli, Palestinian–Palestinian). Existing research offers competing theories for whether propinquity is more impactful for the formation of ingroup or outgroup relationships; here, we found propinquity was significantly more impactful for outgroup relationships. Whereas 2 ingroup participants were 4.46 times more likely to become close if they were in the same versus different bunk, for example, 2 outgroup participants were 11.72 times more likely to become close. We propose that sharing an activity group is especially powerful for more dissimilar dyads because people are less likely to spontaneously engage with outgroup members in ways that promote relationships. Thus, structured, meaningful engagement can counteract homophily. Furthermore, in this setting, propinquity proved to be an even better predictor of outgroup (vs. ingroup) relationship formation than that pair’s initial outgroup attitudes. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for intergroup processes and relationship formation.

AB  - A growing population of biculturals—who identify with at least two cultures—often frame switch, adapting their behavior to their shifting cultural contexts. We demonstrate that frame switching biculturals are perceived as inauthentic by majority Americans and consequently seen as less likable, trustworthy, warm, and competent compared to biculturals who do not frame switch or a neutral control (Studies 1–3, N = 763). In Study 2, describing the bicultural’s behavior as authentic despite its inconsistency partly alleviated the negative effects of frame switching. In our preregistered Study 3, majority American women were less romantically interested in and less willing to date a bicultural who frame switched in his dating profiles (mediated by inauthenticity). The way biculturals negotiate their cultures can have social costs and create a barrier to intercultural relations. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Stereotype threat theory argues that reminders of negative stereotypes about one’s stigmatized identity can undermine performance, but few studies have examined this phenomenon among Black Americans. Drawing from the literature on the impact of mass media on stereotype activation, we examine whether exposure to rap music induces stereotype threat among Black men. In two studies, incidental exposure to violent/misogynistic rap, but not conscious hip-hop or pop music, impaired Black (but not White) men’s cognitive performance (Experiments 1 and 2), but only when the artist was ostensibly Black (vs. White; Experiment 2). These effects were conditionally mediated by stereotype activation, such that listening to a Black (but not White) rapper activated negative stereotypes about Black people for both Black and White participants but only impaired performance among Black participants (Experiment 2). This suggests that exposure to some forms of artistic expression may activate culturally shared stereotypes and obstruct academic success among stigmatized groups. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Amid protracted conflict, children are raised in divided contexts that shape the development of their intergroup attitudes and behaviors. Social identity development theory (SIDT) suggests that in-group preference may contribute to more negative out-group attitudes and behaviors in middle childhood. In such contexts, in-group favoritism may shape resource distribution, a key indicator of prosocial behavior. This study examined the predictors of resource distribution among 387 children (age: M = 9.59, SD = 2.34) of majority (Jewish) and minority (Arab-Muslim) groups in Israel. Rooted in SIDT, a multiple-group chain mediation found that the effect of age on out-group prosocial giving was serially mediated by the child’s in-group symbol preference and negative out-group attitudes. The mediation held across both majority and minority groups, highlighting the underlying developmental process of prosocial giving across group lines in a divided society. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Gay and heterosexual single fathers through surrogacy may be targets of microaggressions (i.e., subtle and implicit stigma-related stressors), as they present highly contested aspects of family formation: single parenthood, surrogacy conception, and, in the case of gay single fathers, nonheterosexual orientation. However, to date, no research has addressed whether experiences of microaggression impact the quality of the father–child relationship and the factors that mediate this process. The present study investigated the indirect effect of family-related microaggressions on observed sensitivity and rough-and-tumble play (RTP) via rumination in 35 gay and 30 heterosexual single-father families (n = 65), with children (3–10 years of age) born through surrogacy. Both groups of fathers showed high sensitivity and RTP quality during parent–child interactions. However, regardless of their sexual orientation, single fathers who perceived more frequent microaggressions also reported a higher tendency to “brood” in response to stress, and this was, in turn, linked to lower sensitivity—but not RTP quality—with their child. The findings provide a unique contribution to the fathering literature, as these underscore—for the first time—that although explicit and overt forms of stigmatization may differ in form and content, subtle and ambiguous forms of prejudice are equally detrimental to the parent–child relationship. Accordingly, the findings emphasize the need to raise awareness in practitioners and the broader society about the ways in which values and ideological assumptions about parenting, families, and conception may affect the lives of gay and heterosexual single fathers and their children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement: The findings underscore that frequent experiences of family-related microaggressions can devalue single fathers’ perception of their social identity as a parent, and their attempts to restore this identity via rumination may diminish the resources they have available to sensitively interact with their child. As both explicit and implicit prejudice against new family forms is common and widespread, the present study advances our understanding of the challenges faced by single fathers through surrogacy in parenting their children. The findings provide insight into the need to raise awareness in practitioners and the broader society about the ways in which values and ideological assumptions about parenting, families, and conception may negatively impact the quality of the father–child relationship.

AB  - The conventional wisdom is that racial attitudes, by forming through early socialization processes, are causally prior to most things political, including whites' party identifications. Yet a broad literature demonstrates that partisanship can shape mass attitudes. The author argues that this influence extends even to presumptively fundamental predispositions like racial attitudes. The study applies cross-lagged models to panel data from the 1990s and 2000s to demonstrate that whites align their racial attitudes with their party loyalties. The results demonstrate that partisanship has a more pronounced influence in the latter time period, which is consistent with a view that changes in the political context can make partisanship a more likely causal force on other attitudes. Racial concerns not only provide a foundation for political conflict: my results reveal that political processes can increase or decrease racial animus. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2020.

AB  - Sexual prejudice refers to negative attitudes towards individuals based on their sexual orientation. Scholars have shown an interest in identifying the factors that may increase the probability of prejudice against sexual minorities. The current study investigates in particular the main and interactive effects of the participants’ social dominance orientation (SDO) and gender role orientation on their attitudes toward gay men and lesbians in a Turkish sample. It examines whether the effect of SDO on prejudiced attitudes would be stronger among individuals with high adherence to traditional gender roles. A total of 250 heterosexual university students filled out a questionnaire consisting of items designed to measure their SDO, gender role orientation and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The results overall revealed that SDO, femininity (among females) and masculinity (among males) are positively related to prejudiced attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Supporting expectations, SDO and femininity interact in predicting sexual prejudice. However, masculinity does not interact with participants’ SDO. The supplementary analyses also revealed that the effect of SDO on prejudiced attitudes was stronger among female participants with high femininity scores and among male participants with lower femininity scores. These findings indicate that a general preference for group inequality and endorsement of traditional gender role predispose individuals to be prejudiced against gay men and lesbians. Thus, the present study supplements the related literature by examining the interactive effects of SDO and gender role orientation in Turkey, a non-Western cultural context. It also provides important implications for researchers and practitioners in terms of developing strategies to reduce prejudice against sexual minorities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Over 80% of bias-motivated violent victimization is motivated by race or ethnicity and over 50% of bias victimization occurs in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Our aim was to determine the risk and health impacts of race/ethnicity-motivated violent victimization by victim race/ethnicity. We examined data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (2003-2015) to estimate violent victimization risk by victim race/ethnicity across race/ethnicity bias victimization, other types of bias victimizations, and non-bias violent victimizations. We examined incident and offender characteristics for race/ethnicity-motivated victimization by victim race/ethnicity. The risk of race/ethnicity-motivated violent victimization was greater for non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) and Hispanics than for NHWs (incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.0, 2.0], and IRR = 1.6; 95% CI = [1.2, 2.1]). This translates into an additional 46.7 incidents per 100,000 person-years (95% CI = [1.4, 92.1]) for the NHB population and an additional 60.3 incidents per 100,000 person-years (95% CI = [20.3, 100.4]) for the Hispanic population. Violent incidents for NHB victims more frequently resulted in injury or medical care. Nearly 40% of NHB victims reported difficulties at school or work related to the incident where only 21.5% of NHWs and 11.7% of Hispanic victims reported similar problems. Roughly 37% of NHB victims identified a NHW offender and 45% of NHW victims identified a NHB offender. Hispanic victims identified NHB or NHW offenders in over 70% of incidents. Although literature suggests that NHWs account for the majority of bias victimizations, the risk of non-fatal violent victimization motivated by race/ethnicity is greater for NHBs and Hispanics. Crimes perpetrated against NHBs are likely more severe and victim/offender racial incongruity is common. Findings provide empiric evidence on race/ethnicity-related structural disadvantage with adverse health consequences. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Our study concerns the factors leading to the electoral success and failure of LGBTQ candidates in the context of the changing nature of prejudices. We hypothesize that more positive views toward “respectability candidates,” as captured by familial status, has replaced explicit prejudice toward out LGBTQ candidates in societies where acceptance of sexual minorities in general has grown. In a survey experiment conducted with a sample of Canadian voters, one of the first countries to legalize marriage equality, we find suggestions that voters are more likely to reward lesbian and gay candidates who adopt heteronormative relationships (married with children vs. single) than those who do not. These patterns become more evident when we explore causal heterogeneity with controls for individual-level characteristics and attitudes that typically predict support toward lesbian and gay candidates. Here we find these predictors rewarded single lesbian and gay candidates, whereas lesbian and gay candidates with families were simply more supported across the board.

AB  - A stereotype threat arises when a negative stereotype about group to which an individual belongs is activated. It affects the achievement and interest of students in a particular academic domain, e.g., girls at math or boys at language arts. Hence, it is important to assess the level of stereotype threat at school (STaS) in order to identify the vulnerability of students to its negative consequences. This study devised and validated two parallel versions of the STaS scale: girls in mathematics and boys in language arts in a nationally representative sample of Polish secondary school students (N = 1,241; 13–16 years). The results of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a complex sample approach showed one general factor. Furthermore, a multiple-group CFA confirmed metric invariance and partial scalar invariance. The variances for boys and girls were equal. This suggests that the construct of stereotype threat is similarly conceptualized by both genders despite being in different domains. Finally, the comparison of means of latent variables revealed a higher level of stereotype threat among boys in the language domain than girls in mathematics. Possible theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Bedyńska, Rycielski and Jabłońska.

AB  - Black college students attending historically and predominantly White institutions are increasingly encountering online racial discrimination. This exposure may increase psychological distress and undermine academic performance. Although White bystanders may be well-positioned to challenge racist posts, limited research has examined interventions to increase White students’ willingness to confront online racial discrimination. The present study used multiple methodologies to characterize the nature and frequency of online racial discrimination college students face, understand its impact on Black students, and increase challenges to online discrimination among White bystanders. Study data include content scraped from campus-related social media platforms over a 3-month period, transcripts from 8 focus groups conducted separately with Black (n = 35) and White (n = 33) college students, and data from an online experiment with 402 White college students. Taken together, study findings indicated that Black students encounter online racial discrimination with nontrivial frequency and are harmed by this exposure. Black students noted, however, that harm is mitigated when online racial discrimination is challenged by their White peers. Further, findings indicated that White students may be more likely to publicly confront racist posts if they (a) are aware of the harm it causes their Black peers; (b) perceive social norms that support confronting discrimination; and (c) receive guidance on what to say. © 2021.

AB  - Background: The mental health of international students studying abroad has been neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This mixed-method study examined perceived public attitudes, personal beliefs, practice and stress toward facemask wearing as a preventive measure against COVID-19 among international University students from Hong Kong studying in the United Kingdom (UK) in the early stage (January–March 2020) of the pandemic. Methods: Our study included 2 parts: (i) an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling strategy was used to recruit 91 Chinese students studying in the UK to complete an online questionnaire survey, and (ii) online Zoom focus group interviews were conducted with 16 students who completed the online survey to gain an in-depth understanding of their experiences and coping methods during the pandemic. Results: Of the 91 students, 92.3% reported the UK public did not view facemask wearing as a preventive measure. 98.9% believed facemask wearing was an effective preventive measure, but 56% wore facemasks more than half of the time when out in public. 50.5% had internal conflicts of stress both when wearing and not wearing facemasks, which was more common in females than males [(62.5 vs. 31.5%), P = 0.004, Relative Risk (RR): 1.99 (1.17, 3.38)]. 61.5% reported public prejudiced attitudes against facemask wearing, also more common in females than males (71.4 vs. 45.7%), P = 0.02, RR: 1.56 (1.05, 2.32). The qualitative findings corroborated with the quantitative findings and reported that peer and family support were important for them to face such difficulties, and positive thinking and adaptability were effective methods on stress management. Conclusions: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Chinese international students have been faced with a difficult, confusing, and sensitive situation. Owing to the ongoing pandemic, rising xenophobia and racist behaviors and the resumption of students' studies studies in the U.K., support from global communities are needed in their pursuit of quality education overseas. Our findings have significant implications on the proactive roles that governments should have, and the need for clear and accurate public health messaging to change public attitudes and mitigate prejudice. Academic institutions and mental health professionals need to proactively provide additional support to Chinese international students. © Copyright © 2021 Lai, Sit, Lai, Wang, Kong, Cheuk, Feng, Ip and Lam.

AB  - Test conditions eliciting negative stereotypes of aging among older adults can prompt age-based stereotype threat (ABST), which results in worse performance on cognitive and memory tests. Much of this research explores ABST as a phenomenon that impacts the performance of older adults. Little is known about the experience of ABST beyond performance settings and how it manifests in everyday contexts across different age groups. Gaps also remain in understanding the wider impacts of ABST, such as effects on task motivation and engagement. The current research addresses this by exploring the contexts in which age-based judgement, a theorized precursor to ABST, occurs across a wide age range of participants. The two studies in this paper present mixed-methods survey data for a total of 282 respondents aged 18–84 years. Study 1 presents a thematic analysis of open-ended responses to identify the stereotypes and settings that underpin perceived age-based judgement. The settings and stereotypes identified are discussed in relation to which contexts lend themselves to adverse ABST effects. Study 2 then asked respondents to rate the extent to which they experience threat-based concern within 12 contexts identified from Study 1. Results indicate differences in threat-based concerns between young, middle-aged and older adults for physical activity, driving, using public transport, using technology, in leadership and relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. The studies provide a foundation for future research to investigate (1) the motivational and behavioural consequences of threat-based concerns for younger adults’ driving and leadership, and in the context of the pandemic; (2) cues to ‘old’ age stereotypes and threat-based concerns among late middle-aged adults within the workplace; (3) the role of broad stereotypes of ‘incompetence’ and being ‘past-it’ on middle-aged and older adults’ engagement with technology and physical activity and (4) potential ABST effects resulting from stereotypes of older people as a burden and a problem in the context of a national crisis. Overall, this research extends our understanding of ABST by identifying further contexts and age groups that could be impacted by a wider range of ABST effects. © Copyright © 2021 Lamont, Swift and Drury.

AB  - Given rising populist nationalism and multiplying meanings of “right” and “left,” this paper assesses whether Europeans who identify as extremely left-wing on the political spectrum hold anti-immigrant attitudes. In contrast to right-wing xenophobes, we further examine whether the political left, who conventionally emphasize class conflict, oppose immigrants less for cultural reasons and more for materialist reasons. We also consider whether socioeconomic status and values traditionally associated with the political left—favoring redistributive policies, egalitarianism, or social rights to benefits and services for immigrants—temper left- more than right-wing xenophobia. We find that a surprisingly large share of those who identify as far left do express extremely xenophobic attitudes, and we profile them in contrast to far right xenophobes. With logistic regression analysis of nine waves of the European Social Survey (2002–2018), we find that, all things equal, socioeconomic status influences far left xenophobia more than far right xenophobia, but inegalitarian values, less support for redistributive policies, and welfare chauvinism can only partially account for far left xenophobia and unexpectedly do not distinguish it from far right xenophobia. This implies that far left parties might adopt anti-immigrant policies to try to retain their loyal voters, even though such policies do not comport with broader left-wing values and may increase racial and ethnic inequality. Controlling for demographic and attitudinal differences reduces the probability of xenophobia among the far left by about sixty percent, but there remains some residual anti-immigrant attitudes among this group still to be explained. © Copyright © 2021 Kopyciok and Silver.

AB  - As a particularly vulnerable group, children from rural areas in China whose families migrate to urban areas often encounter social exclusion, prejudice, and discrimination as they adjust to city life. Hence, migrant children may experience a sense of relative deprivation when they feel they are treated unjustly when compared to their urban counterparts. Although previous research has demonstrated that relative deprivation is a risk factor for prosocial tendencies, this association has not yet been examined in the population of migrant children in China. Further, few studies have revealed the mediating and moderating mechanisms between relative deprivation and prosocial tendencies. Therefore, this study constructed an integrated model examining the possible mediating role of perceived social support and moderating role of in-group identity on the association between relative deprivation and prosocial tendencies. A large sample of 1,630 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant children (845 girls; Mage = 12.30, SD = 1.74) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires regarding relative deprivation, prosocial tendencies, perceived social support, in-group identity, and demographic variables. The results indicated that relative deprivation was negatively correlated with migrant children's prosocial tendencies and this connection was partially mediated by perceived social support. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that in-group identity moderated the effect of perceived social support on prosocial tendencies, with a high level of in-group identity strengthening the positive association between perceived social support and prosocial tendencies. Parents, educators, and other members of society concerned about migrant children's psychosocial adaptation should provide adequate social support resources and help them foster positive in-group identity to migrant populations to mitigate the adverse effects of relative deprivation and promote their prosocial tendencies. © Copyright © 2021 Xiong, Xiao and Ye.

AB  - Objectives: Suspect motives, conceptualized as beliefs that Whites’ interracial motives are primarily driven by desires to avoid appearing prejudiced have been found to shape a number of intergroup outcomes for People of Color (POC). However, it is unclear what factors lead individuals to become suspicious of Whites’ motives. Two correlational studies tested whether childhood racial socialization experiences relate to suspect motives. Methods: 223 Black participants (94.2% female; M age = 42.01, SD age = 16.62) recalled childhood racial socialization experiences and completed the Suspicion of Motives Index (SOMI; Study 1). 226 Black parents (80.8% female; M age = 37.39, SD age = 9.17) reported racial socialization strategies and goals for their children to be cognizant of Whites’ potentially suspect motives (Study 2). Results: Driven by cultural socialization, racial socialization was significantly related to suspicion (Study 1). Racial socialization predicted parental desires that children recognize Whites’ suspect motives and a combined measure of cultural socialization and preparation for bias was most strongly related to parental hopes (Study 2). Conclusions: These studies link racial socialization and suspicion of Whites’ motives. These results suggest that among POC, racial socialization may shape beliefs about Whites’ interracial motives.

AB  - The current study unravels religious practices, politics and perceptions as forms of multiple identities within and amongst different types of migrant groups in South Africa. Using purpose sampling from members of the Christ Assembly Church of Africa, we explore how the appeal to religion is a form of identity construction that differentiates Congolese from other groups of migrants. We utilized social identity theory in showing how Congolese use religious practices at the mentioned church to assert and reaffirm their identity and use it as a form of resilience to any external threat to the existence of their 'culture'. Our findings reveal that there exists a complex relationship between religion and Congolese refugees in Durban that is an identity maker that acts as a form of mobilization and resilience to any form of external threats to the identity of the Congolese community in Durban. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the negotiation and construction of Congolese identity through religious practices at Christ Assemblies Church of Africa can play an important role in determining how prejudices and behaviour that reject, exclude and often vilify persons based on the perception that they are outsiders or foreigners to the community are constructed. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Social Identity Theory (Tajfel; Tajfel and Turner) is rooted in the premise that individuals construct their own identities based on social categorization and group membership, and this attachment of people to groups is sufficient “to produce prejudices both in favor of members of one’s own group and sometimes against members of another group” (Dovidio et al. 4). In this article, I analyze how the characters in “A Private Experience” (2009), by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and “Hora de Partir” (2007), by César Mba A. Abogo, resist group categorization and minimize stereotyping and group distinctions by experiencing intergroup relationships and enhancing their individualities. While the story “A Private Experience” portrays a Muslim and a Christian woman who defy the Muslim-Christian conflict in Nigeria by means of their peaceful and close connection, the interracial couple in “Hora de Partir” challenges racial and social prejudices through their love relationship. Thus, both narratives depict resistant subjects who confront the hegemonic ideologies resulting from group categorizations by the mutual interest between individuals who belong to conflicting groups and the depiction of a fruitful amalgam of transcultural elements within the stories that endorses diversity as a positive social value. By means of establishing harmonious relationships with outgroup members, these literary voices delegitimize intergroup conflict, trigger a transcultural dialogue, and find an effective way to resist the social constraints imposed by group categorization. © 2021, Indiana University.

AB  - While many Cubans of all racialized identities often insist that there is no race or racism in Cuba, they still experience ongoing forms of prejudice and discrimination. This article analyzes the translocal processes through which the logics of racialization and racism circulate in contemporary Cuba. Based on long-term ethnographic research in Santiago de Cuba, known as Cuba’s Blackest City, I analyze the local construct level of culture as central to ongoing processes of racialization in Santiago. I trace Cubans’ experiences of racialization from Santiago to Havana to the United States, connecting their experiences of race and racism to broader transnational forms of anti-Blackness that date back to the colonial era. I show the ways in which the translocal process of racialization through level of culture is not another form of Cuban exceptionalism, but rather links the Cuban experience to broader regional constructs of race, respectability, and culture.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to identify factors (biological, psychological, interpersonal, and contextual factors) associated with the weight bias internalization of the Korean girls in early adolescence. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design. Data was collected from 233 girls aged 12~14 years with a self-reported questionnaire. With multiple regression analysis, the factors associated with the weight bias internalization of the girls in early adolescence were analyzed. Results: Of psychosocial factors, fear to fat (anti-fat attitude) (β=.43, p<.001) was associated with the weight bias internalization of the girls in early adolescence. In addition, attachment with teachers (β=-.11, p=.029) of an interpersonal factor and perceived socio-cultural pressure regarding weight control (β=.34, p<.001) of a contextual factor were associated with the weight bias internalization of the girls in early adolescence. Conclusion: For releasing the weight bias internalization of the girls in early adolescence, decreasing anti-fat attitude and socio-cultural pressure regarding weight control should be primarily required through social efforts including community and school based interventions. © 2021 Korean Academy of Community Health Nursing.

AB  - Pharmacological neuroenhancement refers to the non-medical use of prescription drugs, alcohol, illegal drugs, or the so-called soft enhancers for the purpose of improving cognition, mood, pro-social behavior, or work and academic performance. This phenomenon is undoubtedly more frequent than previously supposed especially amongst university students. The aim of the present paper was to carefully review and comment on the available literature on neuroenhancement, according to Prisma guidelines. The results showed a great use of all prescribed drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, nootropic compounds, and especially stimulants) as neuroenhancers amongst healthy subjects, although probably the real prevalence is underestimated. The use of illicit drugs and soft enhancers is similarly quite common. Data on the improvement of cognition by other compounds, such as oxytocin and pheromones, or non-pharmacological techniques, specifically deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, are still limited. In any case, if it is true that human beings are embedded by the desire to overcome the limits of their intrinsic nature, neuroenhancement practices put into question the concept of authenticity. Therefore, the problem appears quite complex and requires to be deepened and analyzed with no prejudice, although within an ethical conceptual frame. © Clinical Neuropsychiatry.

AB  - The naming of pathogens and their associated syndromes is a thorny process which unfolds in a complex geopolitical environment. This brief piece offers perspective on the multitude of forces that shape the name of a pathogen and summarizes the story of Sin Nombre Virus, with some reference to the ongoing saga of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A monopoly on names and circulating monikers rarely exists, and certain communities become disproportionately impacted by misunderstandings or stigmatization. By acknowledging these processes, we can better serve as allies to affected communities dealing with both pandemic and prejudice. © 2021.

AB  - Teacher judgments and the disciplinary sanctioning of pupils can be understood as a function of the ethnic match, which means whether or not teachers and pupils have the same ethnic background. According to social identity theory, teachers should be motivated to protect positive self-esteem and therefore favour pupils of their ethnic in-group over pupils of their ethnic out-group. Following system justification theory however, it must be assumed that teachers also base their judgments and their disciplinary behaviour on the acceptance of social hierarchies. According to this theory, ethnic minority teachers should therefore favour ethnic majority pupils over ethnic minority pupils. We test these hypotheses by conducting an experimental study among 196 preservice teachers. The results suggest that ethnic majority participants do not discriminate against ethnic minority pupils. However, although ethnic minority participants seem to explicitly favour their in-group, they also implicitly tend to have more negative stereotypes about them. Moreover, the more negative explicit and implicit stereotypes ethnic minority participants have against pupils of their in-group, the more severely they punish pupils of their out-group. This could suggest that ethnic minority participants felt the desire to compensate for a negative view of their in-group by treating their out-group more harshly. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, we report on an intervention across continents and disciplines that brought together differently positioned students in South Africa and the USA. A collaboration between our classes—an introductory Geographic Information Systems (GIS) class in South Africa and a composition class in the United States—was facilitated and investigated by us. The point of departure of the intervention was to service socially just and anti-racist pedagogies through experimentation. Drawing on posthumanist, feminist, and new materialist theory, we investigate the hauntings of several prejudices and stereotypical tropes that foster racism. We link the concept of hauntology to Plumwood’s (1993) theorization of dualisms. We then draw a cartography of geomatics education in South Africa, focusing on the subjectification of geomatics graduates in particular and engineering graduates in general. We then zoom to our collaboration, and focus on several interactions amongst the cohorts to show instances of hauntings that perpetuate anti-Black, anti-Muslim, and related silences. We find that analysis of dualisms can highlight racist hauntings, and can also provide guidance on how to flatten hierarchies. Our transdisciplinary activism allows us to harness the positivity of difference to trouble binaries. We conclude with some thoughts on pandemic pedagogy in an unequal world. © 2021, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE).

AB  - This paper intends to analyse the current political and social situation in Brazil and show how this context has influenced the management of the public health crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, the authors conducted an investigation into Brazil’s historical roots, which have not only engendered deep class differences but, also, social psychopathologies such as dissociation and perversion. Finally, this paper presents a symbolic analysis of social exclusion and how the mythical figure of Sophia can inspire a renewed movement of inclusion and tolerance. © 2021, The Society of Analytical Psychology

AB  - This study aims to examine the underlying causes of the hate against Asian Americans in relation to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Using discourse analysis, the author analyzes interview data collected before the outbreak of the pandemic in the Bay Area of the United States. Anti-Asian sentiment did not start after the beginning of the outbreak. Rather, it has existed in American society, and people in the Asian community have faced prejudice and hate incidents before the outbreak as well. This study examines the discourse in two ways: discourse as practices and discourse as language in use. Through the analysis of interview data, this study aims to 1) shed light on Asian Americans' experiences and reveal the racism Asians are subjected to; 2) examine how the discourse affects the identity and situation of Asians under a certain dominance; 3) analyze how discourse reproduces systemic violence against Asian Americans. The analysis shows that the same discourse which has positioned Asians as the “other” is reproduced both socially and politically and that is a reason for violence against Asian Americans. However, it is further revealed that Asian people construct their identity through these discourses, by either internalizing or opposing them. © Fushe Yanjiu yu Fushe Gongyi Xuebao/Journal of Radiation Research and Radiation Processing 2021.

AB  - In a highly diverse world, cultural literacy is an essential tool for living together in harmony, and dialogic teaching may be a way to promote and develop it among children and adolescents. We define cultural literacy as a set of attitudes (inclusion, tolerance, and empathy) and skills (dialogic argumentation) needed to understand others in our everyday lives. This paper focuses on the effect of a professional development programme to promote dialogue and argumentation to help children and adolescents overcome pre-existing stereotypes and prejudices and foster students’ participation in discussions that contrast divergent viewpoints. This was done through debates on social responsibility issues, living together, and belonging as presented in books and short films addressing the following topics: citizenship, the celebration of diversity, democracy, globalisation, human rights, cooperation, sustainable development, and climate change. After the professional development programme was implemented, we video-recorded two of the 15 student-teacher interaction sessions during the project’s implementation (session #3 and session #8). We analysed the data using a validated coding scheme across three educational levels (three preschool, four primary school, and four secondary school classrooms). We observed moderate gains in secondary education and preschool, but statistically significant gains in primary education. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Three studies using pre-existing (Studies 1 and 3) and minimal (Study 2) groups tested the hypothesis that ingroup status shapes whether “conflict’” with an outgroup is strategically acknowledged or downplayed. As predicted, high (vs. low) ingroup status led group members to downplay conflict, but only to an outgroup rather than ingroup audience (Studies 1 and 2; Ns = 127 & 292), and only when the status difference was unstable (vs. stable) and the outgroup's action was perceived as illegitimate (Study 2). High-status group members also collectively communicated with the outgroup in a manner designed to defuse conflict (Study 2). Survey data of industrial (manager–worker) relations further indicated that company managers (high-status) characterized manager–worker relations as less conflictual than did workers (low-status) in the same companies (Study 3; N = 24,661). Findings imply that high-status groups play down conflict as a “benevolent” (but unacknowledged) means of maintaining intergroup status hierarchies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: The potential exists for unconscious bias to influence decisions throughout the admission process to nursing school and derail holistic admission review processes. Although little is known about unconscious bias in nursing school admissions, unconscious bias has been demonstrated in nurse educators at levels similar to the general population. Method: This article examines concepts of unconscious bias, factors that may interfere with accurate and fair assessment of applicants to nursing school, and ways to mitigate unconscious bias in the application and admission decision processes. Results: Interventions that have shown success in reducing unconscious bias center on increased awareness of the presence of unconscious bias and cognitive strategies that include motivation and effort to counter the unconscious bias. Conclusion: Creating structures in the admission process that promote fairness and reduce the risk of relying on automatic judgments can minimize the influence of unconscious bias on admission decisions. © 2021 Slack Incorporated.

AB  - Speeches by modern-day White supremacists often include such statements as “Jews will not replace us.” In 1934, the French-speaking medical interns of Montreal's Roman Catholic hospitals went on strike because, they alleged, a Jew “replaced” a Roman Catholic French Canadian. Anti-Semitic social and economic boycotts and educational quotas were in existence in Canada from the 19th through the mid-20th century. There were particularly strong anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic feelings in the first half of the 20th century in Quebec, along with anti-Semitic pro-fascist political parties. In 1934, Montreal's Hôpital Notre-Dame (HND), a teaching hospital of the Universite de Montreal (UM) medical school, was unable to hire a full complement of medical interns from among the newly graduated French-speaking Roman Catholic medical students. The hospital hired a French-speaking Jewish graduate of UM, Samuel Rabinovitch. The prospective interns at HND submitted a petition demanding that Rabinovitch be fired, stating, “We do not want him because he is a Jew.” On 14 and 15 June 1934, HND's interns went on strike to prevent Rabinovitch from taking up his duties. The strike spread to multiple hospitals in Montreal. A Jewish urology trainee at the Hôtel Dieu hospital, Abram Stilman, was also targeted. Rabinovitch resigned in order to bring the strike to an end. The strike buttressed the case in the first half of the 20th century for American and Canadian Jewish hospitals and medical schools to ensure the education of Jewish physicians, reminds us of the origins of the slogans of modern White supremacists, and reinforces the historical basis of efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in medical education. © 2021 American College of Physicians.

AB  - With the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), the term disability is consolidated in its dynamic meaning as a condition that is defined by the interaction between personal factors and the environment in which one lives (WHO, 2001). The characteristics of the reference context that can be an obstacle or facilitation are evaluated with greater emphasis, including the perception of disability by teachers as a factor that will mediate the implementation of different behaviors and methodologies stemming from it. The purpose of the present survey, which includes 422 teachers attending a specialization course for support activities and was conducted through the administration of a questionnaire, was precisely to evaluate this perception. In particular, it evaluated the following: the differences in starting and finishing the specialization course for the achievement of the teaching qualification in support, the impact of previous experience with the disability, and the motivation to teach. Outcomes display a progressive normalization in the characteristics of a person with disabilities. The teaching strategies undergo a change between the beginning and the end of the course, with a focus from the general to the particular, becoming more targeted and detailed. In terms of opinions, emotions, and concerns, familiarity with disability seems to produce a less prejudicial and stereotyped representation, as does the teaching experience with a disabled pupil. The importance of active previous experience is confirmed in order to develop a better representation with a consequent reduction in prejudice. Further data emerge in terms of increased ability, at the end of the course, to verbally discriminate the concepts of inclusion and integration, with probable differences in approaches. The motivation for teaching is confirmed to be connected to job placement and therefore should be further investigated with scales that control the social desirability of the response. The present study shows the importance of both the perception of familiarity with disability and specialized education in supporting disabled students. We hope that future research might further investigate this area in order to improve the quality of life of disabled people through better relations with teachers and better academic outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Empirical attention on online intercultural contact and prejudice reduction are increasing. Nevertheless, still little is known on processes that could influence the contact-prejudice relation as well as the relation between online contact and anti-racist behavior. Based on literature on intergroup contact, the present study aims to fill these gaps, focusing on online intergroup relationships between people from different countries. Specifically, it examines whether and to what extent empathic feelings and online community commitment mediate the relationship between online intergroup contact and both perceived ethnic discrimination and anti-racist behavior on Facebook. We collected data from a predominantly Italian sample of 1018 Facebook users (Mage = 30.03, SDage = 11.09; females: 80.01%); participants filled in an online questionnaire. A semi-full Structural Equation Modeling was used to test hypotheses. The results confirmed that when intergroup contact was established, such contact was able to increase the sense of being committed to the online community, which increased the perception of online discrimination towards ethnic and racial minorities, which in turn was able to increase the anti-racist behavior. The ambivalent role of the empathy in online contexts will be discussed. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This article explores how multiple health risks in municipalities with Roma settlements in Slovakia are related to the varieties of local governance and the authorities’ conduct towards the local Roma population. The first part of the paper describes the situation in Roma settlements from the perspective of unequal access to sewerage and water pipelines. Introduced here are data on identified contagious diseases that correlated multiple health risks with the lack of sanitation and/or water infrastructure. The second section of the paper put forth typologies of government approaches towards the Roma, which based on ethnographic fieldwork, allows us to identify factors of attitudinal, structural and policy-oriented nature. Research results point to a “triad” of key circumstances: these are the structural conditions in municipalities and the history of local inter-ethnic relations and attitude of authorities towards Roma. Finally, possible solutions and approaches regarding how to mitigate the multiple health risks are discussed. It is suggested that on the one hand, in many villages there is a profound institutional discrimination of Roma with respect to water and sanitation infrastructure; on the other hand, water services are increasingly becoming an expensive commodity that not everyone can afford. The article concludes with discussion on enabling conditions and ways to ensure access to basic infrastructure in rural Roma communities. The solution is not only a compliance with principles of non-discrimination and existing technical norms and standards but also in securing the accessible funding for construction of the sanitation infrastructure in a smart way, including innovations and operation of cheaper and environmentally responsible sanitation technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Weight stigma is prevalent across the world. However, little is known about whether and how the harmful health consequences of weight stigma may vary across countries. The current study examined the association between experiences of weight stigma and multiple eating and exercise-related indicators among a large, multinational sample of adults. Methods: Adults enrolled in an international weight management program residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States completed identical Web-based surveys in the dominant language for their country. Participants (N = 13,996) reported on their personal experiences of weight stigma and health, including eating behaviors, attitudes toward exercise, and perceived stress. Results: More than half of all participants in each country reported experiencing weight stigma. Participants who had experienced weight stigma reported engaging in more eating to cope, gym avoidance, and self-monitoring behaviors, as well as higher levels of stress and reduced eating self-efficacy. These associations were documented over and above sociodemographic characteristics and BMI and did not vary across countries. Conclusions: Study findings document uniform health-related correlates of weight stigma within a multinational context and underscore the need for global initiatives to curtail weight stigma in order to support population health. © 2021 The Obesity Society

AB  - Black women have long experienced racism in various areas of their lives. Pregnancy is one of the times in a woman's life when she is most vulnerable, and she should not have to worry that her health care will be subpar simply because she is Black. Most health care providers do not intend to harm their patients; however, systemic racism and the unconscious biases we hold may cause harm. Training nurses and other health care providers about implicit bias is one step toward eradicating racism from maternity care. © 2021 AWHONN

AB  - Despite growing evidence that COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting communities of color, state-reported racial/ethnic data are insufficient to measure the true impact.We found that between April 12, 2020, and November 9, 2020, the number of US states reporting COVID-19 confirmed cases by race and ethnicity increased from 25 to 50 and 15 to 46, respectively. However, the percentage of confirmed cases reported with missing race remained high at both time points (29% on April 12; 23% on November 9). Our analysis demonstrates improvements in reporting race/ethnicity related to COVID-19 cases and deaths and highlights significant problems with the quality and contextualization of the data being reported.We discuss challenges for improving race/ethnicity data collection and reporting, along with opportunities to advance health equity through more robust data collection and contextualization. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on racial/ethnic minorities, accurate and high-quality demographic data are needed and should be analyzed in the context of the social and political determinants of health.

AB  - Although casual sex is increasingly socially acceptable, negative stereotypes toward women who pursue casual sex remain pervasive. For example, a common trope in television, film, and other media is that women who engage in casual sex have low self-esteem. Despite robust work on prejudice against women who engage in casual sex, little empirical work has focused on the lay theories individuals hold about them. Across six experiments with U.S. adults (N = 1,469), we found that both men and women stereotype women (but not men) who engage in casual sex as having low self-esteem. This stereotype is held explicitly and semi-implicitly; is not driven by individual differences in religiosity, conservatism, or sexism; and is mediated by inferences that women who have casual sex are unsatisfied with their mating strategy—yet the stereotype persists when women are explicitly described as choosing to have casual sex. Finally, the stereotype appears to be unfounded; across experiments, the same participants’ sexual behavior was not significantly correlated with their self-esteem. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In light of the negative effects of historical and contemporary colonialism on the Labrador Innu, healing initiatives grounded in self-determination, renewal of cultural practices, and non-reliance on Western bio-medicine, are known, taught and widely practiced among the Innu. The value of Indigenous healing practices in the treatment of Indigenous people is well-recognized in Indigenous wellness literature, yet non-Indigenous health practitioners know little about healing processes. Moreover, to our knowledge, no studies have examined any contemporary Labrador Innu healing process. The main aim of this paper is to describe the process of healing among the Innu. Although there may be multiple processes of healing, we shed light on a major process that emerged from interviews and focus groups with 39 participants. Five stages of healing were described: being “under the blanket”; finding spiritual strength; extending hands out; finding strength and power; and helping others. Findings highlighted enablement of healing through spiritualities, support from Elders, return to culture, and resistance to negative stereotypes. We provide health professionals with valuable information for considering Innu healing as a model that expands their views for the benefit of Innu seeking mental health services. Implications for non-Innu health and social service providers are about broadening their understanding of the significant role of self-determination among Innu, learning Innu ways-of-knowing and being, recognizing one's own biases, and acknowledging the power imbalances between themselves and Innu people. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - This article focuses on xenophobia in the South African labour market and the effect it can and does have on foreign employees. In contrast to current scholarship that portrays xenophobia in South Africa as a consequence of anti-immigrant sentiments and stereotypes that stem from social, political, economic and cultural misconceptions, this paper argues that the causes of xenophobia are much more complex than that. In addition to those misconceptions, it is argued, xenophobia in South Africa may well have its genesis in the pre-1994 apartheid and colonialism era which sought to impose segregation and instill hatred between and among black people. The main argument in the paper, however, is that the South African legal framework and its implementation do not go far enough in addressing the problem of xenophobia in the workplace. As a result, the rights of foreign employees are negatively impacted and not sufficiently protected. To underscore this point, the paper undertakes a discussion on the legal framework and the pertinent human rights implications of xenophobia in the South African labour market before making some recommendations on what can be done to protect the rights of foreign employees better and reduce or prevent xenophobic attacks against them. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Escaping Nazi annexation of Austria, Sigmund Freud and his family left there in 1938 to live the rest of their lives in exile in the house now known as the Freud Museum in London. This paper is based upon the author’s Holocaust Day Memorial Lecture delivered virtually at this museum on January 27, 2021, which marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi death camp. Besides remembering those who were lost during World War II, the content of this paper includes a description of different types of massive traumas, with a focus on disasters at the hand of the Other, and their impact on individuals and large groups. Sigmund Freud’s ideas about relationships between communities and countries with adjoining territories, as well as large-group psychology, are updated, and individuals’ and large groups’ needs to grasp onto large-group identities is explained and illustrated with case reports. © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis.

AB  - Stereotypes are cognitive constructs that make available a suite of traits and behaviors relevant to a social target. However, they also fuel social biases against social targets based on their perceived social group membership. Traditional approaches to social bias reduction focus primarily on the affective component—prejudice—on cognitive control as a regulatory tool, and on changing stereotype content. Here, I focus instead on changing the initial categorization processes, moving away from stereotype activation to trait inferences during person perception. Specifically, I argue that traits, another cognitive construct, can be promoted instead as the default social categorization. This can occur if cultural narratives highlight behavior rather than social groups, making trait inferences more salient as an initial categorization process rather than stereotype activation. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Communication around finances is essential to relational satisfaction and the acquisition of financial skills. Nevertheless, people avoid financial discussions. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (n = 8,006), this study explored how race/ethnicity relates to financial discussions through the lens of capital theory. Findings show that Black and Hispanic households had the lowest rates of financial discussions. When discussions did occur, the odds of them happening were higher with friends and lower with spouses/partners or family. Family and consumer science professionals can use the results to encourage financial communication in multiple types of relationships and households. © 2021 American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences

AB  - This study aims to investigate the narratives of some “mature” students who are challenging the widely-shared view that studying, and learning new things, is a prerogative of young people. Twenty-five narrative interviews were conducted with older people enrolled at the University of Padua, Italy, to shed light on the motives, values, self-image, and personal solutions that supported their decision to resume and successfully pursue a path of studies at a “non-canonical” age. Starting from perspectives that emphasize the social dimension of meaning-making activity, we explore the counter-narratives functional to the deconstruction of “age prejudice”. The results that emerge from a thematic and structural narrative analysis show some common themes and three different counter-narratives through which respondents try to challenge the idea that they are too old to study. The paper ends with some considerations on the degree of efficacy with which these counter-narratives can resist age prejudice, identifying cases in which they favor change on a personal, social, or cultural level. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: History has taught us that Mexican culture has been largely supported by women, despite gender prejudice from the society. Neurosurgery has not been the exception. Therefore, we investigated the challenges and influence of female neurosurgeons in Mexico. Methods: We conducted a review of the literature and an analysis of the internal database of the Mexican Society of Neurological Surgery focusing on 3 topics: 1) the historical presence of women and gender inequality in Mexico; 2) the life and legacy of the woman who became the first neurosurgeon in Mexico and in Latin America; and 3) the participation of women in neurosurgery in the past 3 decades. Results: In Latin America, the first woman in neurosurgery was María Cristina García-Sancho, who completed her neurosurgical training in 1951. Currently, women represent 6.2% of the total members of the Mexican Society of Neurological Surgery (MSNS). This percentage is still low, although data collected in this study suggest that it might increase in the next few years because 16.7% of Board Directors of the MSNS are women, the next elected president is a female neurosurgeon, and 14.5% of neurosurgery residents are women. Conclusions: Although a steady increase has occurred of women in neurosurgery in Mexico, there is still work to do, especially to overcome the barriers related to the old assumptions of the cultural and social roles of women. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sri Lanka, once a colony of Britain, gained independence in 1948. However, especially the health sector continues to use English as its main medium of communication. Such language bias leads to marginalization of those less fluent in English, and hinders achieving a higher level of health literacy. Discrimination of people or social groups based on their language is termed linguicism. Tackling linguicism requires an understanding of its historic roots and an exploration of potential links to colonial racial prejudices. Published literature presents evidence that traces linguicism to language policies of the British colonial government (1815–1948). Though an exhaustive survey of historical records is not presented, there is reasonable evidence to suggest a close link. British colonial rule derived its justification from supremacist and racist ideology. As a result, English became the medium in all forms of official communications, a situation that persisted after independence. A similar situation exists in many parts of the worlds. We should recognize language-based discrimination and linguicism as public health issues. They are detrimental to health of vulnerable groups and have the potential to worsen health disparities. © 2021, National University of Singapore and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - For the first time in Ecuador a hate crime was tried in court and led to a conviction. This was the case of Michael Arce, a young Afro-Ecuadorian former cadet who won the trial against Captain Fernando Encalada of the Eloy Alfaro Military School (ESMIL). ESMIL belongs to the Ecuadorian Armed Forces, a state institution considered to be of great prestige and a guarantor of citizens’ rights and democracy, but not for all. Arce suffered in ESMIL 2 months of humiliation and torture. Through a socio-legal analysis this article demonstrates the normalization of racial stereotypes and prejudices, and the sometimes subtle existence of structural and institutional racism in the education and judicial systems. This case represents a pioneering judicial action in Ecuador that legally established and defined new pretrial and trial proceedings in regard to litigation concerning violation of human rights, racial discrimination and hate crimes. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Evolutionary and neuroscientific approaches to intergroup bias have been highly generative, but research has yet to consider how these two approaches can build on each other. Here, we review neuroscientific methods findings on intergroup bias. We then review the emerging perspective that views intergroup bias as a psychological adaptation to pressures present in ancestral ecologies. We conclude by considering evidence that collectivist and individualist cultures evolved in response to unique ecological threats. As such, members of each should be differentially susceptible to environmental cues connoting threats to pathogens. We then propose future directions for neuroscientific research that assesses intergroup bias from an evolutionary perspective. Consideration of cultural factors should enable improved understanding of intergroup bias, with proper consideration of how biology and psychology have adapted to the social environments faced in ancestral populations. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Weight-based oppression, including negative attitudes about body weight, and harassment, stigma, and discrimination based on body weight, is a widespread phenomenon that leads to considerable distress and poor health and wellbeing outcomes. Conversely, body positivity is a multi-faceted concept that encompasses body acceptance, body appreciation, and body love, and adaptive approaches protective of health and wellbeing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a brief health promotion activity informed by Health at Every Size® and critical health promotion principles on body positivity and internalized weight-based oppression in female students at Qatar University. A quasi-experimental mixed methods pre-post evaluation design was used, with quantitative assessment of body positivity and internalized weight-based oppression before the activity, immediately afterwards, and 10 weeks later, and qualitative assessment at the 10-week follow up. Measures used were the Body Appreciation Scale 2, Modified Weight Bias Internalization Scale, Fat Attitudes Assessment Toolkit Size Acceptance and Self Reflection on Body Acceptance subscales, and an open-ended questionnaire. Body acceptance and appreciation increased significantly after the activity. Qualitative results suggest that these improvements were sustained at follow up. Brief Health at Every Size® informed health promotion activities show potential to improve health and wellbeing. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Internalized weight stigma (IWS) is associated with various health concerns, regardless of body size. One weakness of existing IWS research is that it largely lacks diverse study populations. One recent exception, however, found increasing IWS was associated with higher levels of food insecurity (FI) in a low-income, majority Latinx sample. Using the same sample (N = 530), the present study further explored levels of IWS as compared to documented (mostly White/European) samples; we also investigated IWS in relation to three dichotomous eating disorder (ED) outcomes (e.g., any/no vomiting). Finally, based on previous qualitative findings regarding dietary restraint in the most severe level of FI, we explored the independent contribution of dietary restraint and IWS to cross-sectional risk of ED pathology. Results indicated that individuals living with FI experience IWS at concerning levels. Additionally, IWS played a small yet significant role in cross-sectional risk for ED pathology regardless of FI severity, while dietary restraint contributed to independent risk only in those with the most severe FI. Findings suggest that IWS is prevalent in this marginalized population, associated with ED pathology, and that the effect of dietary restraint on risk for ED pathology appears to uniquely impact those living with severe FI. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Whilst the consequences of weight bias and weight bias internalisation (WBI) have been explored, less is known about the factors contributing to their development. Some research has explored the role of social exposure in weight bias and WBI but has been limited in its definition of exposure and focused solely on western countries. The present study therefore aimed to assess the role of social exposure defined in terms of both population and personal exposure in predicting weight bias and WBI, in an international sample. Methods: Participants (N = 1041) from 33 countries, aged 18–85 years completed online measures of demographics, weight bias, WBI, and population and personal social exposure. Population exposure was defined using national obesity prevalence data from the World Health Organisation to classify countries as low (obesity rates ≤19.9%; n = 162), medium (20.0–29.9%; n = 672) or high prevalence (≥30%; n = 192). Personal exposure was defined in terms of personal contact and health and attractiveness normalisation. Results: Using regression analysis, greater weight bias was significantly predicted by being younger, male, less educated, and personal exposure in terms of normalisation beliefs that thinner body types are healthier and more attractive, greater daily exposure and overall exposure to thinner friends. The strongest predictors of weight bias (adj R2 = 13%) were gender (β = −0.24, p &lt;.001), and personal exposure in terms of normalisation beliefs that thinner body types are more attractive (β = −0.13, p =.001). The strongest predictors of WBI (adj R2 = 6%) were attractiveness normalisation (β = −0.23, p &lt; 0.001) and participants’ perceived body shape (β = −0.27, p &lt; 0.001). Population exposure did not predict either weight bias or WBI. Conclusions: Personal exposure is more important than population exposure in predicting both weight bias and WBI. Findings hold implications for improving the wellbeing and lived experiences of those living with overweight and obesity. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The stigmatization of larger bodies is omnipresent in Western society and may be associated with fear of fat, one of the core elements of body image and eating concerns. To date, while much work has focused on sociocultural influences towards thinness, parallel work exploring sociocultural influence on fear of fat is lacking. This study therefore aimed to develop and evaluate a measure of sociocultural influences on fear of fat (SI-FAT). Study 1 included N = 235 women, mean (SD) age = 19.75 (1.35) years; a subsample of whom provided additional data two-weeks later (n = 140). Exploratory factor analyses supported a four-factor structure with 4-item media, peer, family, and partner subscales. These subscales revealed excellent internal and test-rest reliability. In addition, support for convergent validity with body dissatisfaction, fear of fat, and rigid dietary control emerged. Study 2, among N = 317 women, 19.82 (SD = 1.5) years, further supported the factor structure and provided additional evidence of convergent validity with weight-based teasing, divergent validity with anti-fat attitudes, and incremental validity in the prediction of dietary restriction above and beyond anti-fat bias. Together, findings suggest that the SI-FAT is a useful tool for assessing sociocultural influences on fear of fat. © 2021

AB  - Research indicates that 40 % of men experience weight-related stigmatization. Yet perceptions of body size continue to be understudied in men and the stereotype content of men's weight status remains largely unknown. Grounded in Stereotype Content Model, the research aims to uncover men's stereotype content associated with distinct body sizes. A pilot study tested the methodological design using a representative measure of BMI-specific images among a sample of undergraduate men (N = 80). Study 1 included the BMI-specific images to assess stereotype content among a broad online sample (N = 142) and explored how participant BMI relates to such perceptions. Study 2 included images of real men to increase the ecological validity of our findings (N = 152). We also included empathy and protestant ethics to examine possible interaction effects. Results revealed that normal to overweight men scored highest on warmth and competence, while underweight and obese classes were perceived less favorably and, evidently, stereotype perceptions were increasingly severe with adiposity. Empathy moderated evaluations of warmth toward stigmatized groups, and protestant ethics moderated warmth appraisals for underweight and normal weight targets but did not influence perceptions of competence. Overall, weight stereotype content should be considered when understanding stigma-related experiences in men. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Weight stigma is pervasive and has a range of deleterious effects. Among the most promising approaches for modifying this form of stigma are cognitive dissonance and social consensus. Due to their theoretical connection, this study tested the effects of an experimental manipulation of cognitive dissonance blended with social consensus for targeting weight stigma. It also added to research investigating the effects of cognitive dissonance on weight stigma by investigating a broader range of stigma measures. Participants were university students aged 18–35 years (N = 98) who were randomly allocated to one of four experimental conditions: blended cognitive dissonance, standard cognitive dissonance, blended control or standard control. Stigma measures included the perceived characteristics of, affective reactions towards, social avoidance of, and blameworthiness attributed to a higher-weight individual, and general weight stigma. Results showed that those in the cognitive dissonance conditions reported significantly lower weight stigma than those in the non-dissonance, control conditions. Moreover, those in the blended cognitive dissonance condition with higher in-group identification reported less negative affective reactions than those with lower in-group identification. The results provide consistent support for cognitive dissonance as an approach for reducing weight stigma and some additive support for an integrated cognitive dissonance and social consensus approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous developmental research has consistently detected the presence of an explicit and implicit ingroup preference among preschoolers. More recent research has also demonstrated that this general ingroup bias is influenced by perceived social status when “real” groups are involved (i.e., groups with a previous history of interactions). Indeed, ingroup bias is significantly tempered among low-status group members. The main aim of the current study was to further investigate the role of social status by assessing both implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes in the context of newly formed groups. More specifically, children were randomly assigned to one of two fictitious groups on the basis of trivial criteria, thereby forming the so-called “minimal” groups. To manipulate group status, participants were then informed that one specific group—either the ingroup or the outgroup—was typically better than the other group during competitions. Finally, implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes were assessed. Overall, results showed that children rapidly formed implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes toward newly formed groups. Most important, the perceived status of the groups modulated such intergroup attitudes. Indeed, on both types of measures, ingroup bias emerged when the ingroup was associated with a high status, whereas it disappeared when the ingroup was in a low-status position. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Past research has found intergroup contact to be a promising intervention to reduce prejudice and has identified adolescence as the developmental period during which intergroup contact is most effective. Few studies, however, have tested whether contact-based interventions can be scaled up to improve intergroup relations at a large scale. The present research evaluated whether and when the National Citizen Service, a large-scale contact-based intervention reaching one in six 15- to 17-year-olds in England and Northern Ireland, builds social cohesion among adolescents from different ethnic backgrounds. In a diverse sample of adolescents (N = 2099; Mage = 16.37, age range: 15–17 years; 58% female), this study used a pretest–posttest design with a double pretest to assess the intervention’s effectiveness. Controlling for test–retest effects, this study found evidence that the intervention decreased intergroup anxiety and increased outgroup perspective-taking—but not that it affected intergroup attitudes, intergroup trust, or perceptions of relative (dis-)advantage. These (small) effects were greater for adolescents who had experienced less positive contact before participating and who talked more about group differences while participating. These findings suggest that the intervention might not immediately improve intergroup relations—but that it has the potential to prepare adolescents, especially those with less positive contact experiences before the intervention, for more positive intergroup interactions in the future. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - COVID-19 represents a multidimensional threat with the potential to worsen intergroup relations, but perceiving a common belonging with various outgroups may prevent intergroup tensions. During the Italian lockdown, we conducted an online survey with 685 Italian participants investigating whether perceptions of common belonging (belonging to a common group, sharing a common destiny, perceiving the difficulties faced by other groups) with disadvantaged and national outgroups were associated with perceived COVID-19 threat and prejudice-related individual differences, namely social dominance orientation (SDO), need for cognitive closure (NFC), deprovincialization, pre-lockdown positive and negative face-to-face contact with immigrants. We also explored the moderating roles of individual differences in the link between perceived threat and perceptions of common belonging. Results showed that common belonging was negatively associated with COVID-19 perceived threat, SDO, and NFC, and positively associated with deprovincialization and positive contact, with differences depending on the common belonging index and on the type of outgroup. Moderations showed that negative relationships between common belonging and COVID-19 threat held only at low levels of NFC (floor effect), deprovincialization, and positive contact. Summarizing, positive contact with minorities and openness to other cultures can favor a sense of communion with other social groups in a global health emergency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Individuals who perceive themselves as “overweight” experience higher negative body-related self-conscious emotions than those who do not. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests internalized weight stigma may be an important mediator of the relationship between weight perception and self-conscious emotions. Overcoming common measurement limitations and sampling limitations, the present study investigated whether gender moderates the associations among weight perceptions, internalized weight stigma, and negative body-related self-conscious emotions in 104 young adults (64 % women). Individuals who perceived themselves as too heavy (52 %) experienced higher body-related shame and guilt compared to those who perceived themselves as about right. Internalized weight stigma mediated these associations in women but not men, such that perceiving oneself as too heavy was associated with higher internalized weight stigma, which was associated with higher body-related shame and guilt in women. Results underscore the importance of internalized weight stigma as a potential target for intervention among women of diverse weight statuses who are prone to experiencing body-related shame and guilt. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aimed to expand weight stigma theoretical models by accounting for central tenets of prominent eating disorder (ED) theories and increasing the generalizability of existing models for individuals across the weight spectrum. College students (Sample 1: N = 1228; Sample 2: N = 1368) completed online surveys assessing stigma and ED symptoms. In each sample, separately, multi-group path analyses tested whether body mass index (BMI) classification (underweight/average weight, overweight, obese) moderated a model wherein weight stigma experiences were sequentially associated with weight bias internalization, body dissatisfaction, and five ED symptoms: binge eating, purging, restricting, excessive exercise, muscle building behaviors. Results supported the assessed model overall and for individuals in each BMI class, separately. Although patterns of associations differed for individuals with different BMIs, these variations were limited. The present findings suggest that the adverse impact of weight stigma on distinct ED symptoms is not limited to individuals with elevated BMIs and that these associations are generally explained by the same mechanisms. Weight stigma interventions that focus on decreasing weight bias internalization and body dissatisfaction are recommended for individuals across the weight spectrum. Further examination of associations between weight stigma and multiple ED symptoms, beyond disinhibited eating, is supported. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Making it onto the shortlist is often a crucial early step toward professional advancement. For under-represented candidates, one barrier to making the shortlist is the prevalence of informal recruitment practices (for example, colleague recommendations). The current research investigates informal shortlists generated in male-dominant domains (for example, technology executives) and tests a theory-driven intervention to increase the consideration of female candidates. Across ten studies (N = 5,741) we asked individuals to generate an informal shortlist of candidates for a male-dominant role and then asked them to extend the list. We consistently found more female candidates in the extended (versus initial) list. This longer shortlist effect occurs because continued response generation promotes divergence from the category prototype (for example, male technology executives). Studies 3 and 4 supported this mechanism, and study 5 tested the effect of shortlist length on selection decisions. This longer shortlist intervention is a low-cost and simple way to support gender equity efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Managing immigration is a challenge at the political, economic, and social levels. Clarifying the social psychological antecedents behind the onset of negative attitudes towards immigrants might help overcome this challenge. The present study investigates the relationships between people’s experience of social exclusion, feelings of generalized interpersonal trust, and anti-immigrant attitudes across 23 European countries. We used data from the European Social Survey 8 (2016), employing a representative sample of the European population. A 1–1–1 multilevel mediation model showed that: (a) the higher the experience of social exclusion, the lower the generalized trust towards others; (b) the experience of social exclusion related positively and directly with anti-immigration attitudes; and (c) generalized interpersonal trust mediated the relationship between experienced social exclusion and anti-immigrant attitudes so that the experience of being socially excluded reduced feelings of generalized interpersonal trust that, in turn, promoted hostile attitudes towards immigrants. Taken together, these results create a platform for future research on the emergence of negative attitudes towards immigrants and factors that might facilitate the development of a climate of integration and acceptance. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Intercultural dialogue (ICD) refers to a process of contact, interaction and exchange of views on the basis of equality, respect, and mutual understanding between individuals or groups from diverse backgrounds. A large body of research has discussed ICD and its potential value for fostering social cohesion and peaceful coexistence across difference. However, there is a lack of robust benchmark data that precludes researchers and practitioners from empirically testing assumptions and hypotheses pertaining to ICD. This article discusses the development of the Intercultural Dialogue Index (ICDI), a proposed composite index for measuring the extent to which ICD is being pursued and implemented as a diversity management tool within different countries. The index builds on the conceptual assumptions underpinning ICD, uses publicly accessible data, and applies methods that allow for replication, upgrading and comparability with relevant indices. This article assesses ICD prevalence for 51 countries based on three interrelated dimensions covering legislative and structural environments as well as opportunities for intercultural encounters. Altogether, 31 indicators across the three dimensions are identified and grouped under 10 broad components to capture both macro- and micro-level factors affecting ICD and intergroup relationships nationally and globally. The article briefly summarises some preliminary ICDI findings and discusses key methodological constraints and conceptual challenges. Theoretical and practical implications of ICDI are also provided. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - LGB affiliate stigma, the prejudicial and discriminatory attitudes toward individuals who have close associations with LGB people, is a particularly harmful form of stigma against close others (e.g., family members, friends) of LGB individuals. Compared to individualistic cultures, affiliate stigma could be more prevalent in collectivistic cultures due to the heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationship and social harmony; however, only a limited number of cross-cultural and quantitative research is available on this topic. The current research effort looked to explore potential social-cultural predictors of gay and lesbian affiliate stigma using a sample recruited from two urban Chinese communities. Univariate regression analysis showed that female gender, more prior contact with gay/lesbian, higher levels of perceived biogenetic causes of sexual orientation, higher endorsement of Western culture, lower levels of perceived public stigma, and lower homophobia predicted lower levels of gay and lesbian affiliate stigma. However, only endorsement of Western culture, public stigma, and homophobia were significant in multiple regression analysis. The current findings shed light on the potential effects of culture and social influences on Chinese individual’s perceptions of gay and lesbian affiliate stigma and highlight the importance of increasing exposure of sexual minority issues and education among the general public. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Schools around the world are increasingly diverse in ethnicity. Given the importance of peer acceptance in children’s well-being and development, it is a pressing concern for educators to promote intergroup acceptance in schools. Aims: First, to examine the developmental trends of acceptance of outgroup members in both the ethnic minority and majority students. Second, to investigate how outgroup acceptance is subject to the interplay between perceived norm of prejudice, a risk factor in the macrosystem, and teacher support, a protective factor in the microsystem. Sample: The participants were 3,723 students (ethnic majority: 61%; boys: 51.9%; mean age: 13.7) at Grade 2, 5, 8, and 11 from 24 schools in Hong Kong. Methods: The students were asked to complete a battery of questionnaires regarding their willingness to accept outgroup members in schools, perceived societal norm of prejudice against ethnic minority group, and teacher support they received in schools. Results: It was found that ethnic minority students accepted outgroup members more than ethnic majority students accepted them. The difference was primarily driven by the low outgroup acceptance of ethnic majority students in Grades 2 and 5. The results of multi-level analysis revealed that outgroup acceptance was associated negatively with perceived norm of prejudice but positively with teacher support. The negative association between outgroup acceptance and perceived norm of prejudice was attenuated in schools with supportive culture. Conclusions: The results point to the need of early intervention and the importance of cultivating school culture with strong social emotional support. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Negative stereotypes about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) hinder PrEP uptake among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Prior research suggests community homophobia may be linked to negative PrEP attitudes. Conversely, individuals with high gay community attachments (GCA) may have more access to credible PrEP information/resources. Among 285 YMSM recruited online, we estimated structural equation models to test competing conceptual models that inform pathways from perceived stigmas, GCA, and negative PrEP stereotype endorsements to PrEP uptake. In Model A, perceived stigma was directly associated with PrEP uptake, partially mediated by stereotype endorsement (β = − 0.05; 95% CI [− 0.09, − 0.01]) and GCA (β = − 0.06; 95% CI [− 0.11, 0.02]). In Model B, perceived stigma was associated with PrEP uptake (β = − 0.07; 95% CI [− 0.14, − 0.01]) through stereotype endorsement among high GCA YMSM. Complemented by anti-stigma initiatives, PrEP outreach for YMSM should utilize sex-positive messaging and disentangle negative PrEP stereotypes within gay-centric social spaces. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has vastly reduced racial health insurance disparities, but efforts continue to repeal this health care law. It is not clear, however, whether this policy is rejected because of its health care provisions, or if the ACA is interpreted primarily as a social welfare policy aimed at providing resources specifically to non-white Americans. In this paper, we assess whether the racial divide in opposition to the Affordable Care Act is unique to this law or represents a reflection of a longer history of racialized social welfare policies in the U.S. The for this research come from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016 Time Series Study which targets United States-based citizens aged 18 and older. We conducted logistic regression to understand how racial attitudes and support for social policies relate to opposition to the ACA. Perceptions of the ACA, especially among white Americans, were related to both support for affirmative action in hiring and education and racial resentment more generally. Attitudes toward the ACA were unrelated to support for policies that have not been explicitly framed as benefitting non-white Americans. As public debates related to whether to amend the ACA or repeal and replace it altogether continue, scholars and public health practitioners should emphasize the role that racism and racial resentment more specifically play in health policy debates. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The psychological concept of “microaggression” has refocused interest on what counts as prejudicial action. It redirects attention from standard socio-cognitive explanations of overt prejudice among social groups toward recipients’ perspectives of largely unwitting and subtle everyday racism. Microaggression studies define common implicit identity challenges faced by minority groups, including kinship carers. However, criticisms of the “microaggressions program” raise difficulties inherent in establishing prejudicial action from accounts of necessarily ambiguous actions, and contend that reliance on self-reporting inevitably lacks validity. This conversation analytic (CA) study offers a complementary approach: from videos of ten kinship carer support groups it shows how participants construct accountabilities for prejudicial actions in their retrospective reports of questions, challenges and suspicions in ways that build these actions as microaggressive. It addresses methodological shortcomings in microaggression studies, and extends CA research on accountability in offense construction, and on prejudicial social actions that are contested and difficult to analyze. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The left-cradling bias is the tendency to cradle an infant on the left side, regardless of the individuals’ handedness, culture or ethnicity. Many studies revealed associations between socio-emotional variables and the left-side bias, suggesting that this asymmetry might be considered as a proxy of the emotional attunement between the cradling and the cradled individuals. In this study we examined whether adult females with high levels of prejudice toward a specific ethnic group would show reduced left-cradling preferences when required to cradle an infant-like doll with ethnical features of the prejudiced group. We manipulated the ethnicity of the cradled individual by asking 336 Caucasian women to cradle a White or a Black doll and then assessed their prejudice levels toward African individuals. Significant correlations were shown only in the Black doll group indicating that the more the prejudice toward Africans, the more the cradling-side preferences shifted toward the right. Furthermore, participants exhibiting low levels—but not those exhibiting high levels—of ethnic prejudice showed a significant left-cradling bias. These findings show that ethnic prejudice toward the specific ethnic group of the cradled individual can interfere with the left preference in the cradling woman. The present study corroborates our suggestion that the left-cradling bias might be considered as a natural index of a positive socio-communicative relationship between the cradling and cradled individuals. On the contrary, the right-cradling bias might be considered as a cue of the presence of affective dysfunctions in the relationship. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study aimed to verify the role of three parameters on the formation of equivalence classes between Black faces and a positive symbol, in children who demonstrated negative bias toward Black faces in a pretest. Maintenance was also verified 6 weeks after equivalence tests. Forty-six children (11 Black; 27 girls) who demonstrated racial bias in a pretest were divided into four groups. All groups first learned AB relations (A1 and A2 were, respectively, a positive and a negative symbol, and B were abstract stimuli) and then BC relations (C1 was a Black face and C2 was an abstract stimulus). The Control Group then advanced immediately to equivalence tests (AC, and CA, without differential consequences). For the Mixed Training Group, a block of trials mixing AB and BC relations, with differential consequences, preceded equivalence tests. For the Feedback Reduction Group, equivalence tests were preceded by a trial block mixing AB and BC relations, but with feedback in 50% of trials. The Symmetry Group received symmetry tests after training of each baseline relation. Thirty-three children showed class formation relating Black faces and the positive symbol, and 27 maintained at least one of the equivalence relations after 6 weeks. Average biases toward Black faces were positive in a posttest, for participants who formed equivalence classes, and remained negative for those that did not form classes. The Control Group showed less pronounced bias reduction and maintenance of relations after 6 weeks, suggesting that these outcomes may be affected by training parameters. © 2020, Association for Behavior Analysis International.

AB  - Although diversity approaches attempt to foster inclusion, one size may not fit all. In five studies, African Americans (N = 1,316), who varied in strength of racial identification, contemplated interviewing at a company with a multicultural or colorblind approach. Participants in the multicultural condition anticipated pressure to be prototypical group members relative to colorblind and control conditions. Only weakly identified participants reacted to this pressure, experiencing more anxiety and inauthenticity in the multicultural relative to colorblind (not control) company. Strongly identified participants experienced less anxiety and inauthenticity in the multicultural relative to colorblind and control companies. Inauthenticity among weakly identified participants was apparent in self-descriptions and linked with worse hiring outcomes in multicultural relative to colorblind and control contexts. Despite predictions, there were no self-stereotyping effects. Diversity approaches that make some group members more comfortable may prove simultaneously constraining for others, highlighting the complexity in how diversity approaches affect individuals. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Integrating theory on interpersonal relationships and intergroup relations, this research examined the role of common ingroup recategorization (i.e., perceiving outgroup members as belonging to the same superordinate group as oneself) in fostering communal interracial relationships. A cross-sectional study (Study 1) and a short-term intensive longitudinal study (Study 2) involving Black and White friendship and romantic dyads suggested that recategorization predicted greater communal motivation and security via perceived similarity. These effects were found in terms of both enduring characteristics and changes over time. In turn, communal motivation and security predicted greater self-reported prosocial behavior and relationship satisfaction, suggesting that they are beneficial to interracial relationship quality. Communal motivation also predicted increases over time in recategorization and perceived similarity, suggesting bidirectional effects. Taken together, these results suggest a reciprocal process in which common ingroup recategorization and perceptions of similarity promote and derive from the communal nature of interracial relationships. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Women drop out of male-dominated majors (MDMs) at a higher rate than men (Blickenstaff 2005). Research is needed to better understand contextual factors in the major, such as social interactions in major classes, that may increase women’s engagement in MDMs and ultimately reduce attrition (Lawson et al. in Sex Roles 78:542–560, 2018). The present study examined whether women in MDMs differed from men in MDMs and women in gender-neutral majors (GNMs) in terms of (1) levels of daily student engagement in major classes; and (2) the association between daily social interactions in classes and student engagement. Daily data were collected from 120 students (40 women in MDMs, 40 men in MDMs, 40 women in GNMs) about social interactions (talking to a peer, interacting with a professor one-on-one, and class discussions) and student engagement (perceived performance, enjoyment, and feelings of comfort) in major classes at the end of the day over a two week period. Results indicated that women in MDMs reported lower levels of daily engagement in major classes, relative to their peers. Talking with a peer and class discussions were associated with higher levels of student engagement, but these associations were qualified by group. Overall, the daily association between social experiences and student engagement were stronger for women in MDMs, relative to their peers. Results support the social-contextual model of prejudice (Murphy et al in Policy Insights Behav Brain Sci 5:66–74, 2018) in that classroom experiences disadvantaged women in MDMs, but daily social interactions may be particularly beneficial for women in these contexts. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Joseph Conrad’s classic novella Heart of Darkness has been the object of a controversy, and harsh condemnations were formulated against the work. Notably, it was targeted as an example of colonialist as well as racist prejudice and prominent author like Achebe and influential theorists like Eagleton and Said have launched far reaching criticisms again this work long considered as part of modern literary canon. This paper argues that these criticisms failed to demonstrate their relevance as literary analysis and ignored crucial features of the novella as a work of art. If we put the story in the context of its creation and read the text in the way as Conrad intended much of the accusations would appear superficial and wide of the mark. Moreover, it is argued that literary figures should be judged by themselves for their aesthetic values as literary creation and not as prototypes of some social category. The specificity of a literary work lies in the fact that it is fundamentally different from political and sociological discourse. © 2020, Fudan University.

AB  - This article investigates how experiencing Virtual Reality (VR) Disability Simulation (DS) affects information recall and participants' implicit association towards people with disabilities (PwD). Implicit attitudes are our actions or judgments towards various concepts or stereotypes (e.g., race) which we may or may not be aware of. Previous research has shown that experiencing ownership over a dark-skinned body reduces implicit racial bias. We hypothesized that a DS with a tracked Head Mounted Display (HMD) and a wheelchair interface would have a significantly larger effect on participants' information recall and their implicit association towards PwD than a desktop monitor and gamepad. We conducted a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment in which participants experienced a VR DS that teaches them facts about Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with factors of display (HMD, a desktop monitor) and interface (gamepad, wheelchair). Participants took two Implicit Association Tests before and after experiencing the DS. Our study results show that the participants in an immersive HMD condition performed better than the participants in the non-immersive Desktop condition in their information recall task. Moreover, a tracked HMD and a wheelchair interface had significantly larger effects on participants' implicit association towards PwD than a desktop monitor and a gamepad. © 1995-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The long run viability of stable multiethnic residential integration is perennially in question. This study compares the intergenerational reproduction of racially segregated residential contexts to the reproduction of multiethnic contexts to provide new insight into the social processes that influence residential integration. The data for this study come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the U.S. Census. Conditional logit models analyze patterns of residential reproduction and mobility for white and black families across a comprehensive typology of racially segregated and integrated neighborhoods. The results provide some support for the premise of a “diversity effect,” that children raised in integrated settings are more likely to attain diverse neighborhood environments in adulthood. The results also demonstrate a far stronger propensity to reproduce predominantly white and predominantly black neighborhood contexts than multiethnic contexts. The comparative ease through which racially segregated contexts are reproduced presents a challenge to the future growth and stability of multiethnic residential integration. The implications for theories of spatial incorporation that frame debates about race and ethnic relations are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: The young are often considered to be among the most open-minded age group, especially as compared to older adults. Millennials have been regarded as particularly interested in commitment to social justice and diversity issues, including LGBTQ acceptance. Yet recent political and socio-cultural shifts along with the emergence of “dude bros” (typically young (millennial), straight, White cisgender males of privilege who express masculinity in entitled, obnoxious, and toxic ways) may be related to a trend in decreasing LGBTQ support among millennial men that drastically contradicts previous research that suggests that being “young” and being “woke” are one in the same. Methods: Data collected via online panelists in November 2018 are utilized to investigate how being a millennial cisgender man relates to attitudes toward LGBTQ people (lesbian women, gay men, bisexual women, bisexual men, trans women, trans men, non-binary people, queer women, queer men) among a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 18–64 stratified by US Census categories of age, gender, race/ethnicity, and census region (N = 3104). Results and Conclusions: Findings show that being a millennial cis man is robustly related to the stigmatization of LGBTQ people and that overlapping layers of patriarchy, aversion to being “hit on” by other men, and the use of anti-LGBTQ slurs (“fag,” “faggot,” “queer,” “dyke,” “tranny,” “no homo,” and “that is so gay!”) relate to these patterns in diverse ways. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other social controls during epidemic outbreaks is trust-or rather distrust. Much like news reporting and social media, popular culture such as fictional novels, television shows and films can influence people's trust, especially given that the information provided about an epidemic disease is sometimes seen as grounded in 'scientific fact' by societies. As well as providing information on the 'correct science' behind disease transmission, spread and illness in films and literature, popular culture can also inform societies about how to feel and how to react during epidemics-that is to say create some expectations about the kinds of societal responses that could potentially occur. In this article we closely analyse three films that centre around epidemic diseases-Contagion (Steven Soderbergh, 2011), Blindness (Fernando Meirelles, 2008) and The Painted Veil (John Curran, 2006)-in order to highlight three categories of distrust that have recently been identified and conceptualised in broader discussions regarding trust and health: institutional, social and interpersonal. These films raise two key issues about trust and social responses during epidemics. First, while certain aspects of trust are badly diminished during epidemic disease outbreaks, epidemics can also interact with pre-existing structural inequalities within society-based on race, gender or wealth-to create mixed outcomes of discord, prejudice and fear that coexist with new forms of cohesion. Second, the breakdown in trust seen at certain levels during epidemics, such as at the institutional level between communities and authorities or elites, might be mediated or negotiated, perhaps even compensated for, by heightened solidity of trust at the social level, within or between communities. ©

AB  - This study offers a critical content analysis of thirty-six contemporary realistic picturebooks featuring transracial Chinese adoption. The theoretical framework of critical literacy highlights significant sociocultural implications of these portrayals: in particular, negative stereotypes and ideologies, in an attempt to call for inclusivity and respect. Though these adoption tales provide an opportunity for Chinese adoptees to explore sociocultural identities and for other young readers to perceive the world of adoption-created families from a different perspective, negative depictions of certain aspects suggest that transracial Chinese adoption narratives are highly contested in terms of how Chinese adoptees are viewed and what family configurations are valued. The stories sometimes omit or simplify the complexities and nuances involved in the practice, the voices of birth parents and adoptees are noticeably absent, and certain ideologies prevail in some adoptive narratives. The complex picture of what transnational adoption looks like and means for those involved needs to be more critically explored and extended by children’s literature researchers as unveiling discourses on belonging and exclusion are informed by values that will be passed on to the new generation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.

AB  - The present study conducted in the Netherlands examines citizen's attitudes towards asylum seekers. We collected data in a large (N = 993) heterogeneous adult sample in November 2015, in the midst of the European "refugee crisis". Our first aim was to map the reactions of citizens towards asylum seekers. Our second aim was to examine the role of right-wing ideological attitudes (i.e., Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation) in explaining these reactions. With respect to the first research aim, it was revealed that, on average, our respondents were rather unwilling to help asylum seekers. Moreover, respondents were more welcoming towards legitimate asylum seekers (who are on the run from war and violence in their home country) compared to economic asylum seekers. With respect to the second research aim, we found that right-wing attitudes were related to stronger negative reactions towards asylum seekers. Moreover, individuals higher on right-wing ideological attitudes were more likely to perceive asylum seekers as being economic asylum seekers and less as legitimate asylum seekers, which related to stronger feelings of threat and ultimately, to more negative reactions towards asylum seekers. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The current study investigates parasocial relationships as the underlying mechanism explaining prejudice reduction following extended exposure to mediated outgroups. Heterosexual participants viewed a fictional television series for 10 weeks depicting outgroup (gay) characters in which the outgroup attribute (sexuality) was accentuated or sanitized. Parasocial relationships with outgroup characters grew significantly over the course of the study regardless of condition. White participants and participants who reported the strongest pretest prejudice experienced the most intense growth. Outgroup prejudice decreased significantly over time for participants in both experimental conditions. Parasocial relationships predicted both prejudice reduction over time and behavioral responses to the outgroup. Parasocial relationships with an ingroup character engaged in intergroup contact did not contribute to prejudice reduction beyond parasocial relationships with outgroup characters. This research suggests that audiences can develop socioemotional bonds with outgroup television characters that can influence attitudes and behaviors much the same as direct, interpersonal intergroup contact. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Recent evidence indicates that partisans discriminate against those from the opposing party. However, it is still unclear whether partisan out-group prejudice reveals a desire for out-group harm or in-group help. We investigate the conditions under which these tendencies arise. Using one observational survey and three survey experiments, we show that when given the chance to either harm the out-group or help the in-group, people tend to choose the latter. Yet while the tendency to help the in-group appears to be primary, we also show that under situations of symbolic threat to partisan identity, respondents shift gears and opt for harming the out-group as a strategy to defend the status of their political group identity. These results add to our understanding of how partisan identity and polarization works in non-elites. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Research shows that nonoffending mothers are frequently held at fault for child sexual abuse (CSA), by both society and professionals, with contradictory explanations for the fault. For example, the same maternal characteristic can be used to assign blame or alleviate blame (i.e., single mothers have been held more at fault for their child’s CSA and less at fault). The purpose of this study was to assess a theoretically based model that could account for these different reasons. We tested the stereotype content model (SCM), which examines the content of stereotypes toward target groups, by focusing on perceptions of that group’s levels of warmth and competence. We sampled 136 undergraduate participants who read a vignette describing CSA, and completed the SCM with the mother of the victim as the target, and measures of mother fault. Our results showed that participants fell into three SCM groups of mother fault: (a) Moderate Contemptuous Prejudice (i.e., low competence, low warmth); (b) Admiration (i.e., moderate competence, high warmth); and (c) Very Contemptuous Prejudice (i.e., very low competence, very low warmth). Each cluster also held unique emotions toward the mother, as predicted by the SCM. Results further showed that assigned levels of fault were significant, but that fault did not vary by SCM group, lending support to the ideas that the SCM can be applied to this group and that different participants assign fault for different reasons. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Disgust is one of the basic emotions and is part of the behavioral immune system, which evolutionarily protects humans from toxic substances as well as from contamination threats by outgroup members. Previous works reveal that disgust not only activates humans’ defense against potential individual and collective threats, but also leads to severe moral judgments, negative intergroup attitudes, and even conservative political orientations. As is already known, nationalism is an ideology that features both negative feelings toward outgroups and beliefs about native superiority or privileges. Evidence from previous studies suggests that disgust is related to nationalism’s several components but lacks direct research on nationalism and disgust. The current study examines the relationship between disgust and nationalism in China at both individual and regional levels. In study 1, participants temporally induced disgust (vs. control) increasing the adoption of nationalism. In Study 2, we analyzed covariation in disgust expression in the Chinese micro-blog Weibo and the nationalism index as part of an online large-scale political survey http://zuobiao.me/ at the province level across Mainland China. The results show that online expression of disgust positively predicts nationalistic orientation at the regional level. Finally, we discuss how the findings shed light on research concerning online emotion expression and potential future directions. © Copyright © 2021 Gao, Chen, Lai and Qian.

AB  - This research draws from three distinct lines of research on the link between emotions and intergroup bias as springboard to integrative, new hypotheses. Past research suggests that emotions extrinsic to the outgroup (or “incidental”), and intrinsic to the outgroup (or “integral”), produce valence-congruent effects on intergroup bias when relevant or “applicable” to the outgroup (e.g., incidental/integral anger and ethnic outgroups). These emotions produce valence incongruent effects when irrelevant or “non-applicable” to the outgroup (e.g., incidental/integral sadness and happiness, and ethnic outgroups). Internally valid and ecologically sound tests of these contrasting effects are missing; hence we examined them experimentally in meaningful settings of interethnic contact. To this end, we hybridized established research paradigms in mood and intergroup contact research; this approach enabled us to use same materials and induction methods to instigate incidental and integral emotions in a single research design. In Experiment 1, White Australian students (N = 93) in in vivo real face-to-face contact with an ethnic tutor in their classroom displayed less interethnic bias when incidentally sad (vs. happy) or integrally happy (vs. sad). In Experiment 2, White American males' (N = 492) anti-Arab bias displayed divergent effects under incidental vs. integral (non-applicable) sadness/happiness and similar effects under incidental vs. integral (applicable) anger. The role of perceptions of agency in the emotion-inducing situation is also explored, tested, and explained drawing from mainstream emotion theory. As expected, integral and incidental applicable emotions caused valence congruent effects, at the opposite sides of the subjective agency spectrum, by encouraging the generalization of dislike from the outgroup contact partner to the outgroup as a whole. On the other hand, incidental-non-applicable emotions caused valence-incongruent effects on bias, under high agency conditions, by encouraging (non-partner-centered) heuristic processing. Because of the improved methodology, these effects can be regarded as genuine and not the byproduct of methodological artifacts. This theory-driven and empirically sound analysis of the interplay between emotion source, emotion applicability and subjective agency in intergroup contact can increase the precision of emotion-based bias reduction strategies by deepening understanding of the emotion conditions that lead to intergroup bias attenuation vs. exacerbation. © Copyright © 2021 Paolini, Harwood, Logatchova, Rubin and Mackiewicz.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal detection (PND) has benefits for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and transposition of the great arteries (TGA), but associations between sociodemographic and geographic factors with PND have not been sufficiently explored. This study evaluated whether socioeconomic quartile (SEQ), public insurance, race and ethnicity, rural residence, and distance of residence (distance and driving time from a cardiac surgical center) are associated with the PND or timing of PND, with a secondary aim to analyze differences between the United States and Canada. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, fetuses and infants <2 months of age with HLHS or TGA admitted between 2012 and 2016 to participating Fetal Heart Society Research Collaborative institutions in the United States and Canada were included. SEQ, rural residence, and distance of residence were derived using maternal census tract from the maternal address at first visit. Subjects were assigned a SEQ z score using the neighborhood summary score or Canadian Chan index and separated into quartiles. Insurance type and self-reported race and ethnicity were obtained from medical charts. We evaluated associations among SEQ, insurance type, race and ethnicity, rural residence, and distance of residence with PND of HLHS and TGA (aggregate and individually) using bivariate analysis with adjusted associations for confounding variables and cluster analysis for centers. RESULTS: Data on 1862 subjects (HLHS: n=1171, 92% PND; TGA: n=691, 58% PND) were submitted by 21 centers (19 in the United States). In the United States, lower SEQ was associated with lower PND in HLHS and TGA, with the strongest association in the lower SEQ of pregnancies with fetal TGA (quartile 1, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64–0.85], quartile 2, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.64–0.93], quartile 3, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69–1.00], quartile 4, reference). Hispanic ethnicity (relative risk, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.72–0.99]) and rural residence (relative risk, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64–0.95]) were also associated with lower PND in TGA. Lower SEQ was associated with later PND overall; in the United States, rural residence and public insurance were also associated with later PND. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that lower SEQ, Hispanic ethnicity, and rural residence are associated with decreased PND for TGA, with lower SEQ also being associated with decreased PND for HLHS. Future work to increase PND should be considered in these specific populations. © 2021 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - The present investigation used ERPs to detect the activation of implicit stereotypical representations associated to different ethnic groups, by means of an implicit paradigm. 285 sentences were presented to 20 Italian Caucasian participants while EEG signals were recorded from 128 scalp sites. Sentences could either violate (Incongruent condition), non-violate (Congruent condition) or be neutral (Neutral condition) with regard to stereotypical concepts concerning non-Caucasian ethnic groups (e.g. Asians, Africans, Arabs). No awareness or judgment about stereotypes was required. Participants were engaged in a fictitious task, ignoring the overall study's purpose. The results showed that Incongruent terminal words elicited a greater anterior N400 response (300–500 ms) compared to Congruent and Neutral words, reflecting a difficulty in integrating the information incongruent with pre-existing stereotypical knowledge. The participant's individual amplitude values of the N400-Difference Wave (Incongruent – Congruent), showed a direct correlation with the individual racism scores obtained at the Subtle and Blatant Prejudice Scale, administered at the end of the experimental session. Intra-cortical sources explaining the N400 involved areas of the social cognition network such as the medial frontal cortex (BA10) and the inferior temporal gyrus (BA20) which are known to support processing of information about other people and impression formation. Moreover, Congruent terminal words evoked a greater P300 response (500–600 ms) compared to the other conditions, possibly reflecting the merging of incoming inputs with anticipated semantic information. A late post-N400 frontal positivity (650–800 ms) was found to be larger to sentences concerning other-race characters (ether congruent or incongruent) compared to sentences involving own-race characters (neutral). The study corroborated the effectiveness of neurophysiological measures to assess implicit complex semantic representations and circumventing social desirability-related problems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective To determine the association between country-level structural ageism and prevalence of violence against older persons. Design Country-level ecological study. Setting Structural ageism data were drawn from the nationally representative World Values Survey 2010-2014 (WVS), global databases from the WHO, United Nations and the World Bank. Violence data were based on the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study 2017. Participants Analysis of 56 countries that represented 63.1% of the world's ageing population aged 60 and over across all six of WHO regions. Exposure Structural ageism, following established structural stigma measures, consisted of two components: (1) discriminatory national policies related to older persons' economic, social, civil and political rights, based on the four core components of human rights protection in Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging and (2) prejudicial social norms against older persons, measured by negative attitudes toward older persons in 56 national polls in WVS aggregated to country-level. These components were z scored and combined such that higher score indicated greater structural ageism. Main outcomes and measures Prevalence rates of violence per 100 000 persons aged 70 and over in each country was based on extensive epidemiological surveillance data, survey, clinical data and insurance claims in GBD and compiled by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. Results There was a wide variation in levels of structural ageism across countries. As predicted, structural ageism was significantly associated with the prevalence rates of violence in multivariate models (β=205.7, SE=96.3, p=0.03), after adjusting for relevant covariates. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings. That is, structural ageism did not predict other types of violence and other types of prejudice did not predict violence against older persons. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence of the association between higher structural ageism and greater violence against older persons across countries. ©

AB  - Hate crimes against members of the Jewish community have increased dramatically over the past few years. According to federal data, the number of hate crimes directed at Jews now appears to exceed those directed at many, if not most, minority groups. Yet, despite the number of hate crimes aimed at Jews, little recent scholarship has considered the issue of anti-Semitism. To address this gap in the profession's literature, this article examines the issue of anti-Semitism in the United States. Toward that end, the Jewish population is described and data on anti-Semitism are reviewed along with factors that contribute to this prejudice. The article concludes by discussing strategies that social work educators, practitioners, and researchers might pursue to help create a more socially just society for the Jewish community in the United States and elsewhere. For instance, social workers might seek to address spiritual microaggressions aimed at members of the Jewish community. As part of this process, social workers might help create a culture that respects religious freedom, a fundamental human right, and advocate for equitable portrayals of Jewish people and perspectives in diverse media. Particular attention should be paid to Orthodox Jews, who are often targets of anti-Semitism. © 2021 National Association of Social Workers.

AB  - Over the last couple of years, the topic of White fragility has garnered a considerable degree of attention. White fragility is considered a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress can become intolerable and trigger a range of emotional and behavioral reactions intended to restore a sense of racial comfort (DiAngelo, White fragility: Why it’s so hard for White people to talk about racism, 2018, Beacon Press). In effort to measure the expression of White fragility, we developed and evaluated the psychometric properties of the 21-item White Fragility Scale (WFS). Data consisted of two independent samples of White participants recruited from M-Turk (327) and a Midwest University’s Psychpool (234). Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence for a bifactor model consisting of one general White fragility factor and three specific factors of Emotional Defensiveness, Accommodation of Safety, and Exceptionism. Ancillary bifactor indices supported treating the WFS as a unidimensional measure of White fragility yet also revealed meaningful utility of the Accommodation of Safety subscale. Concurrent validity evidence for the WFS was established through significant associations with modern racism, general and specific dimensions of colorblind racial attitudes, and social dominance orientation. In addition, nonsignificant, near-zero correlations with social desirability provided support for divergent validity. Recommendations for future research involving the WFS are provided as well as practical implications for professionals whose work requires a certain degree of racial stamina.

AB  - Children from historically disadvantaged castes face systemic hurdles in education in India-ill-equipped schools, poorly trained teachers, discrimination-leading to high failure and dropout rates. Children from disadvantaged castes also face subtler psychological impediments. One such impediment is consciousness of negative stereotypes. Via an experiment, this study illustrates how caste consciousness could affect academic performance, and finds that children from disadvantaged castes perform poorly in tests when made aware of their caste and reservation status than otherwise. The study underlines the need for reform in how India implements its reservation policy to narrow some of the inter-caste differences in educational attainment. © 2021 Economic and Political Weekly.

AB  - The far right typically performs worse in local elections than in national ones. We propose that a key reason for this underperformance is the difference in how intergroup attitudes manifest and are informed in local and national settings. We document the existence of a local-national gap in intergroup attitudes through survey experiments and open-ended survey questions that randomly vary whether study-participants are asked about the national or the local setting. In the first experiment, we find a substantial local-national gap, where the influx of refugees during the refugee crisis was seen as instigating changes in the national setting, but rarely locally. In the second experiment, we investigate the perceived amount and nature of public discussions about refugees and immigration. We again find a substantial local-national gap. Compared to discussions in the local setting, there is a perception of more discussion in the national setting, and the nature of those discussions are perceived as more heated, conflictual, and biased than local discussions. We also find a local-national gap in information sources about refugees and immigration in a final study. In local questions, native citizens are more likely to rely on everyday experiences and social networks. In national questions, they are more likely to rely on media representations. These local-national gaps are seen in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Importantly, we also find the gap among respondents who had an asylum seeker center established in their local community recently. The local-national gaps in intergroup attitudes revealed here can account for patterns in far-right electoral performance that so far have remained puzzling, and they deserve further attention in future research both in political science and social psychology.

AB  - This article draws from a broader research project Transnational childhoods, illuminating the agency and experiences of children and young people migrating from Poland and Romania to Sweden under the age of 18. Focusing on young people born in Poland and having social relationships post-migration as central theoretical component, the article explores the role that the Polish Catholic community in Sweden plays in the lives of young Polish migrants. It does so by grounding the analysis on 23 qualitative interviews, combined with network maps and life-lines, produced by the young Polish participants. The study identifies three important dimensions in the role of the Polish Catholic community. These are comprised of the community's role for young Poles' spiritual development and religious identity, for building new friendships and making sense of common migration and religious experiences, and guidance by specifically Polish Catholic priests in the young migrants' family relationships and in future life projects. The article concludes that while practicing religion and building significant social relationships within the Polish congregations the young migrants shape feelings of belonging and inclusion, however primarily within the limits of their own ethnic community. Further research is needed on the wider implications of primarily mono-ethnic relational practices for the young Poles' lives within the increasingly ethnically heterogeneous Swedish society. © Copyright © 2021 Shmulyar Gréen, Melander and Höjer.

AB  - This paper questions the belief that intercultural romantic relationships are the primary path to integration in Italy. I use the paradigm of intergenerational solidarity – bonds of affection, association and mutual assistance that bind different generations of a family – as a heuristic device for ascertaining a broader understanding of intercultural couples’ lives and their family relationships in everyday settings. Drawing on narratives collected from ethnographic interviews and hand-drawn personal networks in the metropolitan area of Milan (2018-2020), this paper explores intercultural couples struggling with families’ prejudices and expectations, in contrast to their own feelings of true love. Social discrimination and a lack of support from one’s social network – especially parental rejection – are among the factors that explain why friendship bonds are becoming more important than relationships to (nuclear) families for both well-being and lifelong support in Italian mixed couples. Establishing distance from unsympathetic families functions to reclaim the intimate and independent dimension of intercultural loving. The article considers how agency comes into play as the couples take risks and venture beyond their given families for a public affirmation of «families of choice». © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

AB  - Frame of the research: We aim to inform family business literature and family business managers on the effect to include women as managers by providing empirical evidence on their impact on innovation. Purpose of the paper: The paper investigates the impact of female directors on innovation in Family Businesses (FBs). We assume that the presence of women, due to recent generations with the presence of daughters or due to marriages involving third parties, could be more common than in non-FBs. Methodology: We tested our hypotheses on a sample of 755 Italian FBs through a count data model. Findings: Our findings show how and when the invisible women became visible and their effect on innovation performance. Prejudice against women in FBs is detrimental to innovation; however, both the presence of female family members in control positions and the presence of a critical mass helps to mitigate the effect of prejudice on innovation. Research limits: The sample is limited to Italian firms only. The social dynamics and the role of women in the entrepreneurial arena are strongly influenced by the institutional system in which the firm operates. Practical implications: Our findings will be relevant to family business owners and managers with regard to their innovation strategy. A greater understanding of the relationship between female directors and innovation may contribute to increasing the number of women in these important roles. Originality of the paper: We extend our understanding of the effects on innovation of the involvement of female family members on the board of directors. We discuss the invisibility of female family members. We enhance our growing knowledge on female directors in family businesses by studying women’s roles as president or vice president, in relation to innovation. © 2021 Fondazione Cueim.

AB  - The emergence of the COVID-19 virus in 2019 and its global spread in 2020 presented unprecedented challenges to the world. Prior to the pandemic, the disparities between women and men in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) persisted despite the many efforts to achieve gender parity, and it is important to note that women who are racial or ethnic minorities have been more significantly disadvantaged. To illustrate the disparity between women and men in STEM, the National Science Foundation3 reports that 41% of science and engineering doctorates were awarded to women in 2017 despite the fact that women made up 51.5% of the population in the US. The reasons for women being underrepresented are complex and involve a range of social and environmental factors, including negative stereotypes and implicit biases that propagate from schools to the workforce.

AB  - Background: Despite the implementation of multidrug therapy by WHO to treat Hansen's disease (HD), new case detection rates are still high indicating active transmission. Aims and Objectives: To study the clinical profile of HD in central India along with its epidemiological characteristics. Materials and Methods: Medical records of clinically diagnosed Hansen's patients were recruited retrospectively during January 2015 to December 2018. Case records were evaluated with respect to demographic, clinical, histopathological, and bacteriological investigations, development of reaction, and deformities. Patients were classified based on Ridley Jopling classification and treated accordingly. Statistical analysis was done using proportion, mean, and percentage. Results: A total of 400 new patients were enrolled and males outnumbered females. Maximum cases, 115 (28.75%), were in the age group of 31-40 years. Sixteen (4%) cases belonged to the pediatric age (less than 18 years) group. Most common clinical spectrum was borderline lepromatous (n = 156, 39%) followed by lepromatous HD (n = 120, 30%). Eleven patients had pure neuritic HD and nine had histoid HD. Grade 2 deformity was found in 52 and grade 1 deformity was found in 16 patients. Most common lepra reaction was type 2 lepra reaction (n = 112, 28%). Thirteen (3.25%) patients were of relapse of HD among which maximum eight were BL HD followed by LL HD three (0.75%) and TT HD two (0.5%). Conclusion: Early diagnosis is very important for timely and proper implementation of treatment which will prevent sequelae and physical disabilities that can have an impact on the individual's social and working life, which are responsible for stigma and prejudice regarding the disease. Detection of this huge number of cases signifies a high burden of HD in this area even in the post elimination era. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Damage to the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) can cause maladap-tive social behavior, but the cognitive processes underlying these behavioral changes are still uncertain. Here, we tested whether patients with acquired VMPFC lesions show altered approach– avoidance tendencies to emotional facial expressions. Thirteen patients with focal VMPFC lesions and 31 age-and gender-matched healthy controls performed an implicit approach– avoidance task in which they either pushed or pulled a joystick depending on stimulus color. Whereas controls avoided angry faces, VMPFC patients displayed an incongruent response pattern characterized by both increased approach and reduced avoidance of angry facial expressions. The approach bias was stronger in patients with higher self-reported impulsivity and disinhibition and in those with larger lesions. We further used linear ballistic accumulator modeling to investigate latent parameters underlying approach–avoidance decisions. Controls displayed negative drift rates when approaching angry faces, whereas VMPFC lesions abolished this pattern. In addition, VMPFC patients had weaker response drifts than controls during avoidance. Finally, patients showed reduced drift rate variability and shorter nondecision times, indicating impulsive and rigid decision-making. Our findings thus suggest that VMPFC damage alters the pace of evidence accumulation in response to social signals, eliminating a default, protective avoi-dant bias and facilitating a dysfunctional approach behavior. © 2021, MIT Press Journals.

AB  - The Dominican Republic is a uniquely valuable context in which to study children’s racial stereotyping and prejudice, in part because multiracial individuals comprise the majority of the population and race is viewed largely as a continuous rather than dichotomous construct. In two studies, we use developmental and social theories to ground an exploration of Dominican children's racial biases. In studies 1 (n = 54; ages 6–11) and 2 (n = 122; ages 6–11), children were given measures of racial identity, preference, stereotyping, and/or status. As expected, children identified their own race in a manner consistent with others (e.g., their teachers). Across a variety of tasks, children failed to consistently favor members of a specific racial group—as indicated by differing levels of racial stereotyping and associations of social status with different races. They did, however, sometimes systematically express greater liking of individuals of mixed racial heritage, a finding that was contingent on the modality of assessment (i.e., whether race was framed as a continuous vs. dichotomous category, and measured via nonforced vs. forced-choice methods). Implications for current theories of racial attitude development are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - This study investigated children’s and adolescents’ predictions regarding intergroup inclusion in contexts where peers differed on two dimensions of group membership: race and wealth. African American and European American participants (N = 153; age range: 8–14 years, Mage = 11.46 years) made predictions about whether afterschool clubs would prefer to include a peer based on race or wealth and reported what they personally thought should happen. Between late childhood and early adolescence, European American participants increasingly expected that afterschool clubs would include a same-wealth peer (even when this peer was of a different race) whereas African American participants increasingly expected that the afterschool clubs would include a same-race peer (even when this peer was of a different level of wealth). Both European American and African American participants themselves thought that the clubs should include a same-wealth peer over a same-race peer, and with age, were increasingly likely to reference perceived comfort when explaining their decision. Future studies on the development of racial preferences will benefit from including wealth status information given that, with age, perceived comfort was associated with same-wealth rather than same-race status.

AB  - Introduction. In high-income countries, sexual minorities are at a higher risk for disordered eating behaviors. It is not known whether these findings can be extrapolated to Mexico. Objective. Determine whether there are any differences in disordered eating behaviors among Mexican youth according to sexual orientation and analyze the potential role of experiences of violence and discrimination as mediators of these differences. Method. Data from a representative sample of Mexican youth (12 to 29 years old, n = 27,876) were analyzed. Three groups were identified: young people who were not in love (NIL), who were in love with people of the opposite sex (ILOS), or in love with people of the same sex (ILSS). Restrictive behaviors, secret eating, and self-induced vomiting were identified through a scale created for the survey. Results. ILSS men had a higher risk of restrictive thoughts and behaviors (B = .31), secret eating (OR = 2.21), and self-induced vomiting (OR = 3.65) than ILOS youth. Among women, there was only a difference in self-induced vomiting (RM = 2.49). In both sexes, being a young ILSS had an indirect effect on restrictive behaviors through its association with experiences of violence, discrimination at school, and sexual violence. Discussion and conclusion. Mexican sexual minority men are at a higher risk of disordered eating behaviors, whereas sexual minority women are at a higher risk of purging. Part of the differences in restrictive behaviors were explained by the increased risk for experiences of prejudice faced by sexual minority youth. © 2021

AB  - (1) Background: By April 2021, over 160 million Chinese have been vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study analyzed the impact of vaccination on discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients and the determinants of discrimination among intended vaccinated people. (2) Methods: A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect data on COVID-19 associated discrimination from nine provinces in China. Pearson chi-square tests and a multivariate ordered logistic regression analyzed the determinants of COVID-19-related discrimination. (3) Results: People who intended to be COVID-19 vaccinated displayed a high level of discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients, with only 37.74% of the intended vaccinated without any prejudice and 34.11% displaying severe discrimination. However, vaccinations reduced COVID-19-related discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients from 79.76% to 62.26%. Sex, age, education level, occupation, geographical region, respondents’ awareness of vaccine effectiveness and infection risk, and COVID-19 knowledge score had a significant influence on the COVID-19 related discrimination (p < 0.05). (4) Conclusions: Vaccination significantly reduced COVID-19 associated discrimination, but discrimination rates remained high. Among the intended vaccinated respondents, females, the older aged, people with high school and above education level, retirees, migrant workers, and residents in central China were identified as key targets for information campaigns to reduce COVID-19 related discrimination. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Applying a longitudinal design, we tested the directions of the relationships between moral foundations and attitudes toward Muslim immigrants. The study was conducted during the official campaign period of the Hungarian parliamentary elections in 2018. It was found that moral foundations are consequences of intergroup attitudes. Latent change modeling showed that while individualizing foundations were independent of anti-Muslim attitudes, longitudinal change in binding foundations was predicted by prior anti-Muslim attitudes, but not the other way around. Furthermore, this relationship was moderated by exposure to the anti-Muslim and anti-immigration campaigns led by the government. These results suggest that people are motivated to harmonize their moral concerns with their prior social beliefs, and they actively utilize available political messages in this process. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - We described public views toward harm reduction among Canadian adults and tested a social exposure model predicting support for these contentious services, drawing on theories in the morality policy, intergroup relations, addiction, and media communication literatures. A quota sample of 4645 adults (18+ years), randomly drawn from an online research panel and stratified to match age and sex distributions of adults within and across Canadian provinces, was recruited in June 2018. Participants completed survey items assessing support for harm reduction for people who use drugs (PWUD) and for seven harm reduction interventions. Additional items assessed exposure to media coverage on harm reduction, and scales assessing stigma toward PWUD (α = .72), personal familiarity with PWUD (α = .84), and disease model beliefs about addiction (α = .79). Most (64%) Canadians supported harm reduction (provincial estimates = 60% - 73%). Five of seven interventions received majority support, including: Outreach (79%), naloxone (72%), drug checking (70%), needle distribution (60%) and supervised drug consumption (55%). Low-threshold opioid agonist treatment and safe inhalation interventions received less support (49% and 44%). Our social exposure model, adjusted for respondent sex, household income, political views, and education, exhibited good fit and accounted for 17% of variance in public support for harm reduction. Personal familiarity with PWUD and disease model beliefs about addiction were directly associated with support (βs = .07 and -0.10, respectively), and indirectly influenced public support via stigmatized attitudes toward PWUD (βs = 0.01 and -0.01, respectively). Strategies to increase support for harm reduction could problematize certain disease model beliefs (e.g., "There are only two possibilities for an alcoholic or drug addict-permanent abstinence or death") and creating opportunities to reduce social distance between PWUD, the public, and policy makers. © 2021 Wild et al.

AB  - In this study we explore the ongoing social changes and internal differences within the Chinese communities in Britain with regard to language practices, ethnic and cultural affiliations, and intra-community communications. Drawing on the notions of "pride"and "profit", we report on how migratory experiences influence the linguistic practices of the Chinese communities. We argue that "pride"and "profit", as manifested in language practices, are rooted in "prejudice", a consequence of linguistic hierarchies related to broader socio-historical and socio-political systems. Data sources include ethnographic interviews with 15 stakeholders from three community pillars. The data analysis shows three major differences and changes within the communities: the multi-layered make-up of the Chinese communities whose members come from different countries and regions; the replacement of Cantonese with Putonghua as the communities' lingua franca; and the increasing visibility of the Chinese communities in mainstream society. The findings suggest that social changes and language practices are associated with the social meanings of belonging, affiliation and reality, involving a form of symbolic struggle filled with "prejudice". The study emphasises that "pride"and "profit"can make visible and explicit the sources of social inequality that tend to be concealed by neoliberal ideologies and discourses. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.

AB  - Objective: The authors examined whether shifts in mental health-related stigma differed across racial-ethnic groups over the course of a California statewide antistigma campaign and whether racial-ethnic disparities were present at the beginning of the campaign and 1 year later. Methods: Participants had taken part in the 2013 and 2014 California Statewide Surveys (CASSs), a longitudinal, random-digit-dialing telephone survey of California adults ages $18 years (N=1,285). Surveys were administered in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Khmer, and Hmong. Results: Compared with Whites, Latino and Asian respondents who preferred to take the survey in their native language had higher levels of mental health-related stigma on several domains of the 2013 CASS. Specifically, Latino and Asian respondents who completed the survey in their native language were more likely than White respondents to report social distance, prejudice, and perceptions of dangerousness toward people with mental illness. These racial-ethnic disparities persisted 1 year later on the 2014 CASS. Latino-Spanish respondents experienced significant decreases in social distance over the course of the campaign but not to a degree that eliminated disparities on the 2014 CASS. Of note, perceptions of dangerousness of people with mental illness significantly increased among Latino-Spanish respondents between the 2013 and 2014 CASSs. Conclusions: Future research is needed to better understand which components of antistigma campaigns are effective across racial-ethnic minority groups and whether more targeted efforts are needed, especially in light of the persistent and growing racial-ethnic disparities in mental health care. © 2021 American Psychiatric Association.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed a rise in support for political parties with an anti-immigration sentiment and nationalistic rhetoric as their distinguishing traits. Within this context, our study, through a survey, analyses the relation of prejudice toward immigrants with ideological postulates of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance and outgroup threat. With a sample of 247 individuals (54.7% men and 45.3% women), our results reveal that positions favouring right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance and perception of realistic and symbolic threat have an influence on negative attitudes toward immigrants. At the same time, greater prejudice is found in those individuals scoring high in authoritarianism and symbolic threat. These results confirm, on one hand, the dual process motivation model of ideology and prejudice, and on the other, the bifactor structure of outgroup threat. As a conclusion, we propose that in order to foment peaceful coexistence and reduce hostility towards minority groups within today’s social context, it is important to consider the relevance of ideological postulates and outgroup threat. It is a priority to design public policies that favour the inclusion and integration of minority groups with the goal of building more sustainable societies that respect human rights. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This article articulates and explores a localist conception of citizenship that stands in contrast to more liberal, neoliberal and cosmopolitan conceptions. A localist orientation, and some real sympathy, is evident in specifically ethnographic accounts of voters who supported Trump, Brexit and populism more broadly, including such accounts by Arlie Hochschild, Robert Wuthnow, Kathy Cramer and Justin Gest. This localist orientation echoes the Antifederalist opponents of the American Constitution, Jacksonian Democrats, Tocqueville’s account of American democracy and the American populists. I consider both the virtues and vices of localism. The possible benefits include local practices of nested reciprocity, special obligations, specifically local ‘social bases of selfrespect’ – in the terminology of John Rawls – and feelings of belonging and home (what the Germans call Heimat). However, localism also has its downsides: its resources can empower prejudice and exclusion. I end with a reflection on localism and exclusion in Lorraine Hasberry’s A Raisin in the Sun. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: We summarize research on the public stigmatization of persons with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in comparison with other mental health conditions and embed the results into a conceptual framework of the stigma process. Methods: We conducted a systematic search using Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and PsycINFO (via Ovid), and Web of Science for population-based studies on the public stigma in AUD and at least 1 other mental health condition, published between October 1, 2010 and December 20, 2020, thus including all studies published since the last systematic review on this topic. The study is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020173054). Results: We identified 20,561 records, of which 24 met the inclusion criteria, reporting results from 16 unique studies conducted in 9 different countries. Compared to substance-unrelated mental disorders, persons with AUD were generally less likely to be considered mentally ill, while they were perceived as being more dangerous and responsible for their condition. Further, the public desire for social distance was consistently higher for people with AUD. We found no consistent differences in the public stigma toward persons with AUD in comparison with other substance use disorders. Conclusion: The stigmatization of persons with AUD remains comparatively high and is distinct from that of other substance-unrelated disorders. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In this article, we report on the results of an experimental study to estimate the effects of delivering information about racial disparities in COVID-19-related death rates. On the one hand, we find that such information led to increased perception of risk among those Black respondents who lacked prior knowledge; and to increased support for a more concerted public health response among those White respondents who expressed favorable views towards Blacks at baseline. On the other hand, for Whites with colder views towards Blacks, the informational treatment had the opposite effect: it led to decreased risk perception and to lower levels of support for an aggressive response. Our findings highlight that well-intentioned public health campaigns spotlighting disparities might have adverse side effects and those ought to be considered as part of a broader strategy. The study contributes to a larger scholarly literature on the challenges of making and implementing social policy in racially-divided societies. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Apart from direct contact, people also familiarize themselves with other groups through indirect information. For example, as previous studies have revealed, indirect information on personality traits of outgroup members have influences on intergroup attitudes. Extending existing work, the current study specifically examined the effects of such indirect information on people's endorsement of multiculturalism, a set of attitudes regarding the attainment of harmonious coexistence among diverse cultural groups. Based on the Stereotype Content Model, two experiments were conducted to investigate how media coverage and social consensus information about moral, social and competence-related traits of foreign residents in China would affect local people's endorsement of multiculturalism. In experiment 1, when participants learned from the news that foreigners in China possessed high competence, they expressed more appreciation towards the cultural diversity that foreigners brought to the local society, but less support for foreign residents maintaining their own cultural traditions. In experiment 2, participants who learned that other local people perceived foreign residents as having high sociability, morality or competence showed more appreciation towards cultural diversity and more support for maintaining such diversity. Furthermore, in both experiments, perceived anxiety played a mediating role in how indirect trait-related information affected local people's support for maintaining cultural diversity. Lastly, possible explanations for some unexpected findings and implications for future research are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Police force interaction rates with individuals with mental health conditions are on the rise. International research reveals that the presence of a mental health condition increases the risk for detention and use of force by police officers. Stigmatization of individuals with mental health conditions as dangerous and unpredictable is assumed to have an impact on the likelihood of police use of force. The following study examines a trialogical intervention to reduce stigmatization of individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia in a police officer sample. Method: 1318 police officers participated in a trialogical contact-based intervention with the aim to reduce stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs. Emotional reactions, stereotypes and social distance were assessed prior to and after the intervention in a one-group design. Results: Negative stereotypes were positively associated with social distance in individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and were positively associated with anxiety. Dependent sample t-test revealed reduced anxiety towards individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, less negative stereotypes, and less social distance post intervention. All results were significant, and all effect sizes showed a small to moderate effect. Conclusions: Trialogical contact-based, short-term anti-stigma interventions appear to reduce stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with mental health conditions in a large police force sample. A missing control group is a key study limitation. Further research is needed to examine the effectiveness of the intervention in a randomized-controlled trial. However, the results clearly suggest that anti-stigma interventions could be beneficially introduced into police training. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Prejudices can lead to discrimination, social exclusion, and violence particularly among young male adults. Previous findings suggest that the degree of holding prejudices is linked to low levels of empathy, while low levels of empathy have been associated with alexithymia, the inability to experience one's own feelings. We tested the hypothesis that the impact of a lack of empathy on reporting blatant and subtle prejudices is moderated by the inability to identify one's own feelings. In a sample of n = 136 young male adults aged 21 years (mean = 21.5 years; sd = 0.3), we conducted correlation and moderator analyses to determine possible relationships between prejudices, empathy, and alexithymia as assessed by self-report questionnaires. Prejudices were assessed by the Blatant and Subtle Prejudice Scale (BSPS), empathy was assessed by the German modified version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and alexithymia by the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Self-reported empathy levels were correlated with the strength of subtle and blatant prejudices. The moderation analyses revealed that the negative association between empathy and subtle prejudice increased with decreasing alexithymia. The negative association between empathy and blatant prejudice, on the other hand, was significant only for participants with low levels of alexithymia. These results suggest that empathy can limit the expression of blatant and to some degree also subtle prejudice when subjects are capable to identify their own feelings in a group of young males. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Striving to be faithful to the moral core of medicine and to spiritual, moral, and social teaching of the church, Catholic physicians see their role as an extension of the healing ministry of Jesus. When faced with a situation in which a large number of gravely ill people are seeking care, but optimal treatment such as ventilation in intensive care unit cannot be offered to all because of scarcity of resources, Catholic physicians recognize the need to consider the common good and to assign a priority to patients for whom such treatments would be most probably lifesaving. Making these evaluations, physicians will use only objective medical criteria regarding the benefits and risks to patients and will be mindful that all persons deserve equal respect for their dignity. Discrimination or prejudicial treatment against patients based on factors such as age, disability, race, gender, quality of life, and possible long-term survival cannot be morally justified. Triage process should incorporate respect for autonomy of both the patient and the professional and opportunity for an appeal of a triage decision. Other principles and values that will affect how a triage protocol is developed and applied are proportionality, equity, reciprocity, solidarity, subsidiarity, and transparency. The current coronavirus pandemic can provide valuable lessons and stimulus for reforms and renewal. Summary: Catholic physicians strive to continue the healing ministry of Jesus Christ and be faithful to the moral core of medicine. In situations such as pandemic, the scarcity of personnel and technological resources create serious challenges and even moral distress. Church teachings on dignity, the common good and protection of the vulnerable help guide decisions based on public medical criteria and shared decision-making. © Catholic Medical Association 2021.

AB  - One prominent social-cognitive model of internalized stigma by Corrigan and his colleagues (2012; 2002) proposes that individuals are exposed to societal stereotypes about mental illness, at least tacitly agree with them, and may apply them to oneself, engendering harmful self-beliefs. There is limited empirical support for this model in serious mental illness. Moreover, it is not clearly established how internalized stigma and its associated factors impact recovery in this population. The current study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the social-cognitive model's goodness of fit in a sample of Veterans with serious mental illness (Veteran sample, n = 248), and then validates the model in a second and independent sample of individuals receiving community-based psychiatric rehabilitation services (community sample, n = 267). Participants completed the Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (SSMIS; Corrigan et al., 2006) and measures of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and recovery attitudes. Consistent with Corrigan and colleagues' formulation of internalized stigma, SEM analyses showed a significant indirect pathway from stereotype awareness, to stereotype agreement, to application to self, to self-esteem decrement, to poorer recovery attitudes. Additionally, there was a significant direct effect from stereotype awareness to self-esteem. This study shows that individuals with serious mental illness experience psychological harm from stigma in two ways: (1) through perceived public prejudice and bias, and (2) through internalizing these negative messages. In particular, stigma harms individuals' self-esteem, which then reduces their recovery attitudes. © 2021

AB  - Online and social media platforms employ automated recognition methods to presume user preferences, sensitive attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and opinions. These opaque methods can predict behaviors for marketing purposes and influence behavior for profit, serving attention economics but also reinforcing existing biases such as gender stereotyping. Although two international human rights treaties include explicit obligations relating to harmful and wrongful stereotyping, these stereotypes persist online and offline. By identifying how inferential analytics may reinforce gender stereotyping and affect marginalized communities, opportunities for addressing these concerns and thereby increasing privacy, diversity, and inclusion online can be explored. This is important because misgendering reinforces gender stereotypes, accentuates gender binarism, undermines privacy and autonomy, and may cause feelings of rejection, impacting people's self-esteem, confidence, and authenticity. In turn, this may increase social stigmatization. This study brings into view concerns of discrimination and exacerbation of existing biases that online platforms continue to replicate and that literature starts to highlight. The implications of misgendering on Twitter are investigated to illustrate the impact of algorithmic bias on inadvertent privacy violations and reinforcement of social prejudices of gender through a multidisciplinary perspective, including legal, computer science, and critical feminist media-studies viewpoints. An online pilot survey was conducted to better understand how accurate Twitter's gender inferences of its users’ gender identities are. This served as a basis for exploring the implications of this social media practice. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper deals with the challenging issue of illegal building in Italy with a view to clearing up the picture on this subject matter. This phenomenon is scarcely treated from an analytical/scientific point of view, especially in international literature. However, it is very present in the social and journalistic debate. Our research highlights the objective lack of data needed to gauge this offence, which is less endemic than is believed. Furthermore, it proves that existing data are insufficient to produce results, which often range between reality and prejudice, depicting some areas of the country in an extremely negative way. The first part of this paper describes the extreme complexity in acquiring “real” data and the total nation-wide lack of technical-administrative structures and methods capable of producing acceptably reliable information. In the second part, an emblematic case study is presented and its history traced back. We show that the multiform phenomena associated with illegal building create an enormous and rhetorical stratification of actions that ultimately do not lead to any appreciable result. This underscores the powerlessness of the administrative, regulatory and technical apparatus towards this particular infringement of territorial law. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recycled water is an effective way to ease regional water resource shortages and promote environmental protection. The public is a direct user of recycled water, so their attitudes and acceptances are key links in the implementation of recycled water reuse projects. However, in the practical process of the implementation of recycled water reuse projects, the concept is frequently rejected by the public because of the negative perception that it is sourced from sewage. To gain a deeper understanding of this negative perception, this study attempts to take a cognitive neuroscience approach for assessing the stereotypes of recycled water end uses with different human contacts based on a temporal analysis of event-related potentials (ERP) and decision-making data. The results are as follows. First, in general, the stereotypes of recycled water reuse are deeply rooted among the public and are significantly negative. Second, compared with recycled water for car-washing, descriptions of recycled water for potable use with positive adjectives could evoke more significant N400 responses. In other words, the public perceive that recycled water for potable use is harmful, dangerous, and disgusting. Third, for recycled water with different levels of human contact, the negative stereotypes vary greatly. With increasing human contact levels, negative stereotypes will be increasingly enhanced. This study can provide scientific references for the promotion of recycled water end-use projects and optimal allocation of water resources. © 2021

AB  - How do mass publics react to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) advocacy efforts in socially conservative societies? We consider how the first-ever LGBT+ Pride in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina influences ordinary citizens' attitudes and behavior regarding LGBT+ support. Using nationwide and local panel surveys, we find that support for LGBT+ activism increased locally after the Pride but did not diffuse nationwide, signaling how proximity mechanisms reinforce Pride effects. In survey experiments, we show that subjects are responsive to both mobilization and counter-mobilization appeals by local activists. We also find evidence from a behavioral experiment that the Pride had a positive effect on shifting the allocation of financial resources toward local pro-LGBT+ activists and away from opposition groups. Finally, in-depth interviews with local LGBT+ activists underscore the challenges facing LGBT+ activism in socially conservative societies but also point to the substantial possibilities of collective action on behalf of minorities at risk. ©

AB  - Objective: Vignette research on binge-eating disorder (BED) stigma is limited and lacking methodological rigor. Existing studies lack control vignettes and typically present characters with overweight or obesity, introducing the confound of weight stigma. This study examined BED stigma while addressing these limitations. Method: Participants (N = 421) were assigned to read one of six vignettes describing a woman with either BED or no BED as well as either no mention of weight, a recommended weight, or an obese weight. Four questionnaires examined personality stereotypes, emotional reactions to the character, desire for social distance from the character, and blame attributions. Results: The character with BED was ascribed more negative personality characteristics and faced less positive emotional reactions than the character without BED, regardless of weight status. However, BED stigma did not emerge for social distance or blame attributions. Regarding weight stigma, evidence was limited and moderated by the presence of BED, suggesting no additive effect between BED stigma and weight stigma. In fact, blame attributions toward the character with obesity were reduced by the presence of BED. Discussion: The results reveal that BED is a highly stigmatized eating disorder and suggest that weight stigma may be driven by assumptions about a person's eating behavior rather than their body size per se. Future studies must consider the relationship between BED stigma and weight stigma when assessing either form of stigma. The results also indicate new information to be integrated into anti-weight stigma campaigns as well as policy and public health initiatives. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Context: There is growing concern that during their education medical students come to believe that ‘race’ is a biological construct and that differential treatment of patients based on ‘race’ is clinically beneficial. How ‘race’ is presented to medical students may influence both their implicit biases and future clinical practices, potentially widening racial disparities in care. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with twenty-two pre-clinical mostly non-White medical students attending a public medical school in a major metropolitan area in the northeastern United States. Interview content focused on how medical students experience the presentation of race in medical education, use race in their learning experiences, and envision using race as physicians in future clinical encounters. Transcripts were analysed using the framework method and emergent themes were identified. Results: Participants described being most aware of the presentation of race in board-style questions and least aware of the presentation of race during lectures. They described being aware of race in problem-based learning (PBL) modules if the case revolved around a likely race-disease association. They identified imprecision in how race was presented during lectures and insufficient explanations of causes of racial disparities in health. Participants described feeling ill-prepared to obtain racial self-identification and receiving mixed messages around the utility of race in diagnosing a patient. Participants reported experiences of cognitive dissonance around the presentation of race in board-style questions and lectures. Conclusions: Critical evaluation of the presentation of and instruction around ‘race’ is needed to address whether it is presented as a biological vs. social construct, the level of precision of racial categorisation in curricular content, and the causes of and mechanisms behind race-disease associations. This has the potential to minimise false beliefs about race as a biological construct and the resultant negative impacts on clinical care. Future research could evaluate whether problem-based or experiential (OSCE) learning, in contrast to board-style questions and didactic lectures, are the most effective way to educate students around race in health and illness. Additionally, future research can investigate if the mission (ie social) and composition (Predominantly White Institution or Historically Black College/University) of the faculty impacts student experiences of the presentation of race. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education

AB  - The authors have underlined the influence of issues of power and ideology on the stigma of schizophrenia. The dual-process cognitive-motivational model of ideology and prejudice has shown that for deviant and derogated groups, such as people with schizophrenia, both authoritarianism and social dominance orientation can predict prejudice. However, this model has not been tested in relation to the stigma of schizophrenia. In this paper, we apply the Dual Process Model to the study of stigmatizing attitudes, in two contexts where the model has not been tested before, France (N = 224), and Greece (N = 238). We tested the relation of the model's two pathways (dominance-competitiveness and authoritarianism-dangerousness) to stigmatizing attitudes, while making the hypothesis that both would be associated with the latter since people with schizophrenia are perceived as both derogate/subordinate and deviant/threatening. Our results show that the models adequately fit the data and partly confirm the pathways predicted by previous research. However, for the Greek sample, the dominance-competitiveness component was not significantly associated with stigmatizing attitudes, suggesting that for this sample, people with schizophrenia are mainly stigmatized in terms of deviance/threat. Our results provide evidence for the DPM's application to the study of the stigma of schizophrenia in two contexts where the model has never been applied and underline the importance of ideological and socio-cognitive factors for community interventions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Immigration is a highly polarized issue in the United States, and negative attitudes toward immigrants are common. Yet, almost all Americans are descended from people who originated outside the country, a narrative often evoked by the media and taught in school curricula. Can this narrative increase inclusionary attitudes toward migrants? We draw from scholarship showing that perspective-taking decreases prejudice toward out-groups to investigate whether reminding Americans about their own immigration history increases support for immigrants and immigration. We propose that priming family experiences can indirectly stimulate perspective-taking and induce empathy toward the out-group, which we test with three separate survey experiments conducted over two years. Our findings show that priming family history generates small but consistent inclusionary effects. These effects occur even among partisan subgroups and Americans who approve of President Trump. We provide evidence that increased empathy for immigrants constitutes one mechanism driving these effects. ©

AB  - This study examined how intergroup processes and social-cognitive factors shape bystander responses to bias-based and general bullying. Participants included sixth and ninth graders (N = 179, M = 13.23) who evaluated how likely they would be to intervene if they observed bullying of immigrant-origin and nonimmigrant-origin peers. Adolescents’ grade, intergroup attitudes, and social-cognitive abilities were evaluated as predictors of bystander responses. Nonimmigrant-origin adolescents reported that they expect they would be less likely to intervene when the victim is an immigrant-origin peer. Furthermore, participants with more intergroup contact and higher theory of mind were more likely to expect they would intervene in response to bias-based bullying. Findings have important implications for understanding factors that inform antibullying interventions that aim to tackle bias-based bullying against immigrants. © 2020 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Objectives: This study addresses a need for quantitative research examining factors supporting the frequent use of homophobic language (e.g., fag) in male team sports which has a range of negative health impacts on gay and bisexual males. Intervention methods are needed to stop this behaviour, but little is known about why this language remains common. Design: Cross-Sectional survey. Method: Male Rugby Union (n = 97; ages 16 -18 years) and Ice Hockey players (n = 146; ages 16 - 31 years) self-reported their use of homophobic language and completed measures of homophobic attitudes and descriptive and injunctive norms related to language use on their team. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined factors associated with this behaviour. Results: Over half of participants (53.8%) self-reported using homophobic language at least once in the previous two weeks. No relationship was found between homophobic attitudes and language use. In contrast, norm measures had a strong, positive relationship with this behaviour. In multivariate analyses, norms uniquely accounted for almost one-half of the variance in language use. The addition of descriptive norms into the full model led to the largest increase in R2 of .340 (F(1,200) = 130.816, p &lt; .001). Conclusions: Homophobic language use was related to norms, rather than homophobic attitudes. Interventions targeting changes to these norms could be an effective method to change this behaviour. This finding contributes to a growing body of evidence that norms are associated with a range of negative behaviours by male athletes. © 2020 Sports Medicine Australia

AB  - Intergroup interaction can be hindered by legacies of conflict and group biases. Many studies have looked at intergroup attitudes and pro-sociality in the wake of intergroup conflict, but few have explicitly studied how the group affiliation of another person affects the willingness to interact economically, especially when the interactions concern contested issues. In this study, I investigate the effect of group affiliation on the willingness to engage in economic interactions with others among individuals exposed to violent intergroup conflict, using a sample of refugees from the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Based on the theory of indirect reciprocity, it is predicted that the tradeoff paradigms, that is, the willingness to engage in economic transactions with another individual, will depend on previous actions of other members of that individual's group. Participants tended to adopt a communal sharing tradeoff paradigm with ingroup members, and they tended to adopt a market pricing paradigm with outgroup members. However, this was the case only for those who reported that outgroup members had taken actions to harm them or their family in the conflict. For those who reported being harmed by members of the ingroup, a market pricing paradigm was employed also with ingroup members. The results suggest that group biases and indirect reciprocity after violent conflict do not necessarily arise from group identities alone, but as a function of past interactions with outgroup members. © 2020 The Author

AB  - People with disabilities, an understudied population in human resource development, are often constructed as deficient and unproductive in the workplace. Such a phenomenon can largely be attributed to ableism, which is intensified by the widespread organizational emphasis on productivity. With the recognition of people with disabilities as political agents, this study examined the discursive practices of employees with disabilities in Deliberately Developmental Organizations (DDOs). DDOs as a research site were purposefully selected given their commitment to employees' continuous learning, growth, and development distinct from productivity as the main organizing principle. The critical discourse analysis of seven employees with disabilities in DDOs revealed two ways in which the participants countered the negative stereotypes associated with them: (a) the participants resisted ableism by openly communicating the scope of their ability, and (b) the participants resisted ableism by stepping outside the category of people with disabilities. These two radical ways in which the participants challenged ableism by drawing upon the empowering discursive resources in DDOs did not have ableism's reproducing effects and therefore illuminates the potential of continuing to research DDOs as a promising alternative organizational space for inclusion. This study expands our knowledge of disability identity in the workplace by highlighting that a DDO culture provides a unique context under which the distinct identity work of employees with disabilities can be observed and theorized. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Despite persistent stigmatization of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the globe, group identification among these individuals may serve to counteract the detrimental effect of prejudice and discrimination associated with the stigmatized identity. Drawing on resilience theory and social identity theory, this study examined how multiple dimensions of group identification (i.e., in-group ties, in-group affect, and centrality) function to buffer and neutralize the negative impact of HIV stigma. A total of 281 PLHIV were recruited from the only community-based public HIV clinic in Hong Kong to participate in this study. The results revealed a protective effect of in-group affect, which moderated the relationship between HIV stigma and mental health, such that HIV stigma was not associated with mental health among people with higher positive in-group affect. In addition, a positive compensatory effect of in-group ties was found in people with higher HIV identity centrality. Given the protective effect of in-group affect, it is important to re-story the lives among PLHIV by challenging their maladaptive beliefs about being PLHIV and building a positive sense of identity in their personal narratives. Community-based interventions should be provided to individuals with higher HIV identity centrality by offering peer support groups and engaging them in community work. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To survive in the long term, business needs to profit, controlling environmental impacts with social responsibility. Sustainability programs involve the integration of social and environmental issues in business models and organizational processes. The assessment of sustainability programs is a problem of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This work presents applications of MCDA for the assessment of sustainability programs in the textile industry. Applied methods for MCDA are analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for the order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The reasons to apply AHP and TOPSIS include providing an assessment index, ranging from 0 to 1, and that the MCDA model is expected to have more criteria than alternatives. Therefore, an application of other methods, such as data envelopment analysis, could be prejudiced. Concepts from the triple bottom line, economic, social as well as environmental criteria were inserted in the proposed model. Sustainability programs of six leading companies from the Brazilian textile industry were evaluated. The main finding of the research is that AHP and TOPSIS resulted in similar evaluations for sustainability programs. Both methods resulted in the same rank of alternatives. However, with TOPSIS, companies' sustainability indices were more disperse, varying from 0.10 to 0.92 against a range from 0.23 to 0.69 with AHP. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Within increasingly diverse societies, school is considered an important arena for social inclusion, as it ensures that all students can participate in social life within and outside the class. The Norwegian national curriculum emphasizes physical education (PE) as a particularly relevant subject for social inclusion, yet studies have revealed that some students experience discrimination and marginalization in PE because of their ethnicity, race, religion, social class, sexuality, and/or gender. This paper aims to examine how female students’ diverse backgrounds influence their positioning among classmates and to investigate how inclusion and exclusion in PE can be understood in light of social relations in multi-ethnic classes. The article is based on an intersectional perspective. The data consist of written fieldnotes and semi-structured interviews from ethnographic fieldwork in two coeducational, multi-ethnic PE classes at a public school in Oslo, Norway. Three female students’ narratives are discussed. The findings reveal that gender was the most significant factor in the girls’ stories of inclusion and exclusion in PE. With regard to ethnic relations, the narratives show that ethnicity intersected with gender, social class, religion, and race, creating hierarchical boundaries in the peer group. However, these boundaries were less prevalent in the girls’ PE experiences. The findings indicate that gender overshadows other differences in PE, making it difficult to see how exclusion is also clustered around other parts of students’ positionalities. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Building on growing evidence that relative economic gratification may be associated with prejudice toward minorities, such as immigrants, the question remains when and why prosperity and wealth may enhance opposition to immigration. In a correlational study (Study 1, N = 498), we show that increased fear of falling in the future (individually or collectively) is associated with greater opposition to immigration. We then experimentally studied the effects of potential (Study 2, N = 294) and actual (Study 3, N = 166) downward mobility among the relatively wealthy, as well as of relatively stagnating wealthy in the context where an initially poorer group is quickly gaining wealth over time (Study 4, N = 151). We find that fear of falling among the wealthy is associated with more opposition to immigration, mediated by collective angst. We conclude that the anticipation that the economic future looks less rosy than the present evokes collective angst, which, in turn, fuels prejudice toward immigrants. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - The present study systematically assesses the influence of hookup culture endorsement on the acceptance of female rape myths (i.e., false, stereotypical, or prejudicial beliefs regarding sexual assault involving female survivors) and male rape myths (i.e., false, stereotypical, or prejudicial beliefs about sexual assault involving male survivors). Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to assess the primary hypotheses that a particular form of hookup culture endorsement (i.e., the belief that hookups elevate an individual’s social status) would act as the primary predictor of male and female rape myth acceptance among a sample of 376 U.S. college students. As with prior research, a complex relationship emerged for both male and female rape mythology in which acceptance increases or decreases based upon the form of hookup culture endorsement examined, as the endorsement of beliefs reflecting heterosexual power dynamics (e.g., harmlessness and status attainment) functioned as positive predictors of rape myth acceptance, while beliefs challenging such assumptions (e.g., sexual freedom) served to decrease rape myth acceptance. Results supported the primary hypotheses that beliefs concerning hookups and status attainment would be the largest predictor of male rape myth acceptance and female rape myth acceptance. Consistent with prior research, the predictive power of gender and religiosity was initially significant across both male and female rape myth acceptance yet diminished when controlling for levels of hookup culture endorsement. Furthermore, analyses indicated gender differences among the influences of hookup culture endorsement for female rape myth acceptance alone, as even though beliefs concerning status served as an aggravating factor for female rape myth acceptance, beliefs concerning sexual freedom served as a mitigating factor for women only. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Recreational boating is a significant nature-based activity, which is especially popular in the Mediterranean region. This study analyses this activity in the last decade in the Portofino MPA, a popular recreational boating area in the Ligurian Region (northwest of the Italian peninsula) in order to evaluate the maximum turnout and to provide management considerations to better achieve conservation and environmental management of a MPA. Monitoring activities were carried out during the summer from 2006 to 2016 and allowed locating the most critical sectors of MPA in consideration of different factors and kinds of boats. From the results of this long-term monitoring, the first conducted in Italy, it is evident that only some anchoring sectors of the Portofino MPA may suffer impacts from recreational boating and that the boats have different spatial and temporal distribution depending on the different summer months, on the public holidays and on weather conditions which mainly affect the boats units < 10 m (73% of the monitored boats). Due to direct impact of the anchorage on the seafloor, which hosts peculiar natural habitats, and the fairly constant presence of the recreational boaters over the years, different solutions for better protect the seabed without excessively prejudicing the enjoyment of recreational boating are discussed. Since the San Fruttuoso seagrass-friendly mooring area is one of the most visited sectors in the MPA, an increase in the number of seagrass-friendly moorings combined with a higher delimitation of the areas with special habitats may represent an optimal strategy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since the 1980s, everyday racism has gained ground within the social sciences. However, the theory of everyday racism has not been properly adopted and, consequently, varies across different research fields. The main goal of this study is to improve the scientific rigor within research on everyday racism in the human and social sciences. Following a review of the ground-breaking work of Philomena Essed, three main components in everyday racism literature are theoretically distilled and conceptualized: (1) repetitiveness and familiarity, (2) racism and (3) the interdependent link between micro-interactions and macro-structures. This is followed by a critical assessment of what everyday racism means and how it is assessed in research today, by performing a systematic electronic review of qualitative-methods papers. We make three suggestions towards a more complete and sophisticated understanding of everyday racism. Firstly, the concepts of everyday racism and microaggressions need to be disconnected from each other. Secondly, research should focus more on the symbiotic relation between micro-interactions and macro-structures and should also identify relevant situational features at the spatial meso-level. Lastly, it is important to be cautious of the pitfall of cultural determinism that is still a popular perspective in today's field of (everyday) racism. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The importance of first impressions for various intrapersonal, social and societal outcomes is well established. First impressions towards refugees as individual members of one of the most heatedly discussed social groups in Western societies should play a key role in facilitating or impeding successful social integration. However, this issue is currently underexplored. To help understand first impressions towards refugee individuals, we conducted two studies, in which German perceivers (total N = 938) evaluated 60 (Study 1) or 48 (Study 2) male target photos of Western individuals (presented as Germans) and Middle Eastern individuals (presented as refugees). In Study 2, we included information about targets’ religious affiliations (Christian, Muslim) and religiousness (weakly religious, devout). Targets’ facial characteristics (physical attractiveness, smiling) were coded, and perceiver attitudes (right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, right-wing political ideology) were assessed. Results showed (a) no overall devaluation of refugees or Muslims, (b) strong effects of target attractiveness and smiling on evaluations across individuals of different group affiliations, (c) strong effects of perceiver attitudes towards refugees and Muslims, and (d) no interactive effects of perceiver attitudes and target cues on evaluations. It is important to note that these results should not be interpreted as any doubt about the profound experiences of discrimination and prejudices faced by minorities such as refugees. Instead, they underline the utility of an individual differences approach to better understand the circumstances under which devaluations of minoritized individuals suchs as refugees are amplified or reduced. © 2021 University of California Press.

AB  - Only recently research in social psychology has started to systematically investigate intergroup attitudes among members of stigmatized minority groups. In particular, the study of the way people with mental health problems perceive the social groups around them is so far very scarce. In this work, we focused on people with schizophrenia, analyzing their attitudes toward another stigmatized group, namely Black individuals. In Study 1, the attitudes toward White and Black people were assessed in a sample of respondents with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and in a sample of non-clinical individuals. Results showed the presence of less negative attitudes toward the minority outgroup (i.e., Black people) among the clinical sample. In Study 2, we aimed at investigating what members belonging to the majority group (i.e., White non-clinical people) believe about the attitudes toward Black people held by individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. In general, results suggested a general awareness in lay persons that people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as compared to people with no history of mental disorders, hold reduced negative attitudes toward Black individuals. Overall, these results may help to enrich our knowledge about social cognition among members of stigmatized groups in general and, more specifically, among individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. © Copyright © 2021 Castelli, Carraro, Valmori, Uliana and Paparella.

AB  - Opposition to sexual minority rights in Poland is among the highest in the EU. Populist political actors in the country repeatedly scapegoat gays and lesbians, presenting them as a threat to the Polish nation and its shared norms and values, particularly those derived from religion. Building upon previous research which shows how discourse constructing homosexuality as a threat to the nation has been used by social and political actors to legitimize homophobic rhetoric and behaviour, our paper shows whether nationalism - understood here as national collective narcissism - predicts prejudice towards gays and lesbians at the level of individual beliefs. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Importance: The lack of standards in methods to reduce bias for clinical algorithms presents various challenges in providing reliable predictions and in addressing health disparities. Objective: To evaluate approaches for reducing bias in machine learning models using a real-world clinical scenario. Design, Setting, and Participants: Health data for this cohort study were obtained from the IBM MarketScan Medicaid Database. Eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) Female individuals aged 12 to 55 years with a live birth record identified by delivery-related codes from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2018; (2) greater than 80% enrollment through pregnancy to 60 days post partum; and (3) evidence of coverage for depression screening and mental health services. Statistical analysis was performed in 2020. Exposures: Binarized race (Black individuals and White individuals). Main Outcomes and Measures: Machine learning models (logistic regression [LR], random forest, and extreme gradient boosting) were trained for 2 binary outcomes: postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum mental health service utilization. Risk-adjusted generalized linear models were used for each outcome to assess potential disparity in the cohort associated with binarized race (Black or White). Methods for reducing bias, including reweighing, Prejudice Remover, and removing race from the models, were examined by analyzing changes in fairness metrics compared with the base models. Baseline characteristics of female individuals at the top-predicted risk decile were compared for systematic differences. Fairness metrics of disparate impact (DI, 1 indicates fairness) and equal opportunity difference (EOD, 0 indicates fairness). Results: Among 573634 female individuals initially examined for this study, 314903 were White (54.9%), 217899 were Black (38.0%), and the mean (SD) age was 26.1 (5.5) years. The risk-adjusted odds ratio comparing White participants with Black participants was 2.06 (95% CI, 2.02-2.10) for clinically recognized PPD and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.33-1.40) for postpartum mental health service utilization. Taking the LR model for PPD prediction as an example, reweighing reduced bias as measured by improved DI and EOD metrics from 0.31 and -0.19 to 0.79 and 0.02, respectively. Removing race from the models had inferior performance for reducing bias compared with the other methods (PPD: DI = 0.61; EOD = -0.05; mental health service utilization: DI = 0.63; EOD = -0.04). Conclusions and Relevance: Clinical prediction models trained on potentially biased data may produce unfair outcomes on the basis of the chosen metrics. This study's results suggest that the performance varied depending on the model, outcome label, and method for reducing bias. This approach toward evaluating algorithmic bias can be used as an example for the growing number of researchers who wish to examine and address bias in their data and models.. © 2021 American Medical Association.

AB  - Nostalgia is a fond longing for the past that has been shown to increase feelings of meaning, social connectedness, and self-continuity. Although nostalgia for personal memories provides intra- and interpersonal benefits, there may be negative consequences of group-based nostalgia on the perception and acceptance of others. The presented research examined national nostalgia (a form of collective nostalgia), and its effects on group identification and political attitudes in the United States. In a sample of US voters (N = 252), tendencies to feel personal and national nostalgia are associated with markedly different emotional and attitudinal profiles. Higher levels of national nostalgia predicted both positive attitudes toward President Trump and racial prejudice, though there was no evidence of such relationships with personal nostalgia. National nostalgia most strongly predicted positive attitudes toward president Trump among those high in racial prejudice. Furthermore, nostalgia's positive relationship with racial prejudice was partially mediated by perceived outgroup threat. Results from this study will help us better understand how the experience of national nostalgia can influence attitudes and motivate political behavior. © Copyright © 2021 Behler, Cairo, Green and Hall.

AB  - As a member of the team that created elements 104 and 105 at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, James Andrew Harris [1932-2000] was the first African American credited in the discovery of an element. This factoid has been posted on social media, used in a quiz game, and repeated on numerous Web sites. The story (if any context is offered at all) is often the same - a narrative beginning with prejudice, which is overcome with perseverance, and a discovery as pay-off. It is a good story, and this article does not doubt its veracity. But there are questions that need asking. These questions can be basic: what role did Harris play in the discovery of these elements? Or, they can be complicated: what did Harris do before or after these discoveries? At present, there is a surprising lack of detailed information about James Harris's life and career that is easily discoverable. This article is both a call to chemistry students and educators to help uncover more of Harris's story as well as an example of how three simple guidelines can aid the discovery process. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Despite significant advances in recent years, Argentina’s transgender community still faces structural social exclusion. For a vast majority of transvestites and transgender women, early expulsion from the family home and the educational system results in having to resort to prostitution as their only option for surviving. Police edicts and other similar devices are used to penalize prostitution and persecute transgender people in public places, showing that prejudice and violence against their identities also manifest in the control of urban space. Here I present the results of an in-depth qualitative linguistic analysis of a 2018 television news report about the temporary relocation of the transgender sex workers from their usual location in the Bosques de Palermo, the biggest public park in the City of Buenos Aires. The theoretical frame is Critical Discourse Analysis and the methodology is inductive and qualitative. The analysis centers on the linguistic resources that define the socio-discursive representation about the transgender sex workers in relation with urban space and the city’s government. The bases of the analysis are the Synchronic-Diachronic Method for the Linguistic Analysis of Texts and the Method of Converging Linguistic Approaches. These methods revealed, in the first place, that the transvestites and transgender women are represented as mere occupants of public space through their close association with the discursive category of Space. In the second place, they are represented as fundamentally passive in relation to the Government of the City of Buenos Aires; while, at the same time, the government’s responsibility for their displacement is systematically mitigated. Finally, the lack of work alternatives to prostitution for the transgender community is naturalized through the persistent association of the discursive categories connected with transgender people, prostitution and urban space. If we compare these results with those of previous research, we can see that these discursive features—none of which challenge the status quo—remain one of the basic components of the socio-discursive representation of transgender people elaborated by the mainstream media. © Copyright © 2021 Soich.

AB  - By many accounts politics is becoming more polarized, yielding dire consequences for democracy and trust in government. Yet a growing body of research on so-called false polarization finds that perceptions of 'what the other side believes' are inaccurate - specifically, overly pessimistic - and that these inaccuracies exacerbate intergroup conflict. Through a review of existing work and a reanalysis of published data, we (i) develop a typology of the disparate phenomena that are labelled 'polarization', (ii) use that typology to distinguish actual from (mis)perceived polarization, and (iii) identify when misperceived polarization gives rise to actual polarization (e.g. extreme issue attitudes and prejudice). We further suggest that a specific psychological domain is ideal for developing corrective interventions: meta-perception, one's judgement of how they are perceived by others. We review evidence indicating that correcting meta-perception inaccuracies is effective at reducing intergroup conflict and discuss methods for precisely measuring meta-perception accuracy. We argue that the reputational nature of meta-perception provides a motivational mechanism by which individuals are sensitive to the truth, even when those truths pertain to the 'other side'. We conclude by discussing how these insights can be integrated into existing research seeking to understand polarization and its negative consequences.

AB  - Research investigating how social conditions influence attitudes about immigrants has focused primarily on demographic and economic factors as potential threat inducing contexts that lead to anti-immigrant sentiment. However, the empirical evidence supporting this link is mixed, while social cohesion indicators such as the influence of social trust, have largely been left unexamined. This article uses the European Social Survey (2002–2016) to test how differences in social trust, both within and between countries influence attitudes about immigrants. Results from longitudinal analyses show that countries with higher levels of social trust have more favorable attitudes toward immigrants, and while changes in social trust over time are small, they result in comparably large changes in anti-immigrant attitudes, even when controlling for other social factors. These results are robust across different model specifications and data sources. © Copyright © 2021 Mitchell.

AB  - Diversity in the lines of public institutions, such as hospitals, schools, and police forces, is thought to improve provision for minority group members. Nonetheless, whether and how diversity in public institutions shapes majority citizens' prejudice toward minorities are unclear. Building on insights from the intergroup contact literature, I suggest that diversity in public institutions can facilitate positive intergroup contact between majority group members and minorities in elevated social positions. Such unique interactions, which exceed the equal status condition for effective intergroup contact, can serve to reduce prejudice and facilitate more inclusive attitudes among majority group members. To test this expectation, I focus on health care provision-a leading sector with regard to minority representation. Leveraging a natural experiment unfolding in 21 Israeli medical clinics where Jewish patients are haphazardly assigned to receive care from Jewish or Arab doctors and embedding prejudice-related questions in a routine evaluation survey, I demonstrate that brief contact with an Arab doctor reduces prejudice. Specifically, contact with an Arab doctor reduces Jewish patients' exclusionary preferences toward Arabs by one-sixth of an SD and increases Jewish patients' optimism about peace by a 10th of an SD. The modest magnitude of these effects is similar to the impact of well-powered interventions recently reviewed in a meta-analysis of prejudice reduction experiments. These findings emphasize how the demographic makeup of public institutions can reduce mass prejudice, even in a context of intractable conflict. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Stereotype is a type of social bias massively present in texts that computational models use. There are stereotypes that present special difficulties because they do not rely on personal attributes. This is the case of stereotypes about immigrants, a social category that is a preferred target of hate speech and discrimination. We propose a new approach to detect stereotypes about immigrants in texts focusing not on the personal attributes assigned to the minority but in the frames, that is, the narrative scenarios, in which the group is placed in public speeches. We have proposed a fine-grained social psychology grounded taxonomy with six categories to capture the different dimensions of the stereotype (positive vs. negative) and annotated a novel StereoImmigrants dataset with sentences that Spanish politicians have stated in the Congress of Deputies. We aggregate these categories in two supracategories: one is Victims that expresses the positive stereotypes about immigrants and the other is Threat that expresses the negative stereotype. We carried out two preliminary experiments: first, to evaluate the automatic detection of stereotypes; and second, to distinguish between the two supracategories of immigrants’ stereotypes. In these experiments, we employed state-of-the-art transformer models (monolingual and multilingual) and four classical machine learning classifiers. We achieve above 0.83 of accuracy with the BETO model in both experiments, showing that transformers can capture stereotypes about immigrants with a high level of accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - How people understand ethnoracial inequality, or their stratification beliefs, is an important concern for social scientists. Stratification beliefs can be highly influential in the development of individuals’ political attitudes and support for social policies. Despite this, research on stratification beliefs is limited in a number of ways. First, whereas much attention has been given to Whites’, and to some degree Blacks’, stratification beliefs, the attitudes of those in the “racial middle” have been largely neglected, despite their growing demographic presence. Second, much of the literature on stratification beliefs has focused on whether individuals adopt cultural or structural explanations for ethnoracial inequality, with less understanding of how people use a combination of these explanations to interpret inequality. Finally, theoretical and empirical knowledge of stratification beliefs is based largely on survey data. In an attempt to address these gaps, this research draws on interview and supplemental survey data from 70 Mexican Americans to provide an in-depth exploration of their stratification beliefs. The authors pay particular attention to respondents’ use of mixed explanatory modes, illustrating how they draw on cultural and structural discourses to make sense of the world around them. Ultimately, the authors argue that scholars need to pay attention to the interconnections among ideology, everyday experiences, and identity to understand the complexities of stratification beliefs. © American Sociological Association 2020.

AB  - The linguistic diversity and geographical proximity between southern and northern Nigeria abound with political and cultural inclinations grounded in the history and patterns of literary consumption in these culturally diverse backgrounds. The horizontal movements of cultures and cultural parity in Nigeria exist, as depicted in Return of Amina (2008), Return of Hamza (2009), Karangiya (2012) and Oga Abuja (2013).However, of recent, there seems to be a kind of disintegration of community bonds among Nigeria's diverse communities. The aim of this paper is to use video films as modes of discourse on this threat and propose measures for battling prejudices, stereotypes and barriers. Can Nollywood and Kannywood enhance cultural and language integration among Nigeria's disintegrating communities? Are culture and language important tools of effective coexistence? These are some of the questions that require investigations and which the paper attempts to provide answers to.Therefore, the paper looks at films from two video film industries-Nollywood and Kannywood-to show how, despite Nigeria's diversity,English, Hausa, Igbo and Nigerian Pidgin languages are employed in the films and how speakers of these languages come in contact with one another. The paper examines the cross-pollination of these languages and how they have been used in the films to indicate how similarly southern and northern Nigeria are projected in a country that is culturally diverse. The paper found that the films highlight artificial hindrances to cultural and linguistic harmonyin addition to how the major cities in Nigeria are intertwined.The paper concludes by suggesting that intra-nationality and inter-culturality can be used to investigate the cultural similarities in the various languages the films employed to show a somewhat unified Nigeria. Therefore, I argue that cinematic connections bolster social pursuits such as justice, rights and equal opportunity. The paper avers that what is needed today is a global peaceful coexistence. For a people with cultural and linguistic diversity to develop, there is a need for them to not only evolve and dwell on a more elaborate skill of shared life, they must be ready and willing to accept differences. © 2021 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

AB  - We conceptualized and developed a measure of right-wing protective popular nationalism (RWPPN) - a specific form of popular nationalism where people seek to protect the national culture from outgroup influences. RWPPN is derived from a sociological analysis of rightwing popular nationalism in Australia and is theoretically related to several key psychological constructs, including right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and symbolic threat. We conducted two surveys using nationally representative samples of Australian citizens. In study 1 (n = 657), participants completedmeasures of RWPPN and related constructs. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis resulted in a 10-item scale. Construct validity was tested and confirmed across divergent, convergent, predictive, and concurrent validation domains. Additional convergent validation with RWA and SDO was tested in study 2 (n = 316). Together, RWPPN was found to relate to expressions of national identity, prejudice, perceived outgroup threat, opposition to multiculturalism, and aggressive tendencies toward ethnic minorities. These effects remained significant when controlling for nationalism (measured as a concern for national superiority) and blind patriotism. In study 2, the effect on aggressive tendencies held when controlling for RWA and SDO and RWPPN mediated the relationship between RWA and aggressive tendencies. Reflecting the conservative nature of Australian popular nationalism, RWPPN correlated with rightwing political alignment. The research was conducted in Australia, but given the rise in right-wing populism internationally, RWPPN may be a phenomenon in other countries. Therefore, this paper offers a new construct and scale to investigate it in Australia and internationally. © 2021 American Psychological Association Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasingly, race scholars define racism as a structural and systemic phenomenon, rather than a matter of personal prejudice alone. Various theories of racism have been developed by asking “What causes racial inequality?” and defining as racist those mechanisms that reproduce it. In this essay, I ask a different question to expand the toolkit from which scholars can identify the racisms that characterize the contemporary era. Acknowledging that dramatic changes to systems of racial oppression are historically brought about by social movements, I ask, “What causes anti-racist movements to fail?” and define as racist those factors that prevent anti-racist movements from mobilizing supporters in the pursuit of change. I thus propose, define, and describe two forms of racism that connect theories of race and racism to theories of social movements. To enable success, social movements engage in (among other tasks) diagnostic and prognostic framing—that is, they identify conditions as problems and propose solutions. I thus propose the following forms of racism that manifest as sentiments that prevent anti-racist movements from successfully carrying out these tasks: diagnostic racism and prognostic racism. In conclusion, I explain how this conceptualization of racism complements and extends prevailing theories of race and racism and underscores the utility of bridging theories of race and racism and social movement theories in studies of race relations. © American Sociological Association 2020.

AB  - Social behaviour and filial background define the formation and development of a character that is bound by cultural influence in South Asian fiction. Ru Freeman weaves numerous characters and their stories in a single lane as a synecdoche of Sri Lankan history. On Sal Mal Lane (2014) showcases the different social groups defining the Sri Lankan conflict in the 1980s with the presence of child characters who are unaware of the extent of the ethnic conflict swirling in the background of the narrative. This paper tries to define the concepts of heroes, villains, and victims through the socio-emotional development of the characters to determine the contradiction between their intentions and subsequent actions. The study uses Character Theory and elements of Affect Control Theory for critical analysis. The paper analyses the change in personality traits of child characters in response to the violence wrought by Sri Lankan ethnic prejudices and the extent of destructive development from the unstable familial and societal environment. © AesthetixMS 2021.

AB  - The media, including popular media such as music and films, often generate conversations about different spectrums of society. Due to an overabundance of imagery and sounds from the media, including television, film, advertising, social media and the internet, audiences are constantly bombarded with stereotypes and ideologies about other races and identities. As an exponentially growing popular culture industry, Nollywood – the Nigerian movie industry – positions itself as a source of knowledge and popular discourse about issues emanating from the continent and other places. With this growth, Nollywood seems to have been given a spot in the political circle of identity politics, giving it the power to represent the ‘Others’. This study interrogates the theme of identity construction in African films by focusing on the ways in which some select Nollywood films of the early and late 2000s and early 2010s frame and construct foreign races and foreign societies, using critical ideological analysis and the framework of critical race theory. Representations and portrayals of difference in the analysed movies could be serving some ‘revenge’ of sorts, transgressing age-long representations of Black people in Blaxploitation films. The multiplex representations as seen in the analyses serve the primary purpose of such stereotypes: to reproduce and to reaffirm prejudices that over time become naturalized and normalized. The study thematically specifies the significant use of labels, stereotypes and certain orthodoxies that aim to frame and characterize foreign societies in popular Nigerian films and suggests some broader implications of the findings. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - How is racism negotiated by those who are otherwise victims of racism? Social psychologists show the relevance of categorization in negotiating racism. In the present article I focus on a setting where the majority group itself can be considered a target of racism: racism against Black-Africans in India. I examine how victim categorization of the majority group is developed and used through a membership categorization analysis of broadcast media news debates. Analysis shows that, first, victim categories complicated the use of racial prejudice as an explanation for the attacks. Second, victim categorizations were developed in relation to social groups that were removed from the present setting. These allowed for accomplishing specific actions: denials and rejections of racism, moral concerns in racism, and acceptance of Black-Africans' claims about racism. Together, the findings show that racism can be negotiated in terms additional to racial/ethnic group membership: as victims or perpetrators of racism. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Blaming immigrants seems to be in part motivated by the need for control. However, three alternative explanations have been proposed as to why blaming bolsters feelings of control. First, blaming may restore a sense of an orderly world in which negative events can be attributed to a clear cause (causal attribution). Second, blaming others may strengthen in-group identities thereby facilitating group-based control (in-group identification). Finally, blaming low-status groups may enhance individuals' perceptions of dominance and superior status (hierarchy enhancement). Addressing these arguments, we conducted two survey experiments in the German context. In the first experiment, we examined the control-bolstering functions of causal attribution and in-group identification. Participants were primed with an economic crisis threat and then, given the opportunity to either blame out-groups (immigrants and managers), blame an abstract cause (globalization), or affirm their national identity. In the second experiment, we examine control enhancement in the context of political conflict and status hierarchies. Participants had the opportunity to either express prejudice toward low-status out-groups (immigrants and obese people) or indicate their opinion on the polarized issue of representation of the far-right. Both studies replicate earlier findings showing that anti-immigrant blaming and prejudice enhances the feelings of control. Neither mere causal attribution nor mere in-group identity salience produce similar control-bolstering effects. Instead, findings suggest that intergroup conflict and status differences benefit control the enhancement processes supporting accounts of both group-based control and social dominance. Findings are discussed with respect to social cohesion and the appeal of populist frames promoting antagonistic, unequal intergroup relations. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In several shows prepared for children and adults in the media, the representation of “individuals with special needs” can ensure that other members of the society empathize with disability and the characteristics of disabled people, and make it easier that prejudices are replaced by social acceptance through gaining information. Finding a place frequently used in children’s literature, children’s reality satisfies the curiosity and experience-gaining demands of children about the cases they encounter for the first time using various examples, and helps them internalize the information and experience they gain. Children’s shows and cartoons have an effective power in influencing the viewpoint of children as target group for disabled people within the framework of “children’s reality” by means of the representation of children with special needs who are socially disadvantaged. In this context, the purpose of this study is to evaluate and examine in terms of various factors the social representation style of main characters with Down Syndrome represented in “My Brother Ozi” and “Punky” cartoons broadcasted on local children television channels and internet sites where cartoons for children can be found. 51 episodes of both cartoons (26 and 25) were viewed in the framework of the study and findings were analyzed using “document analysis” method which is a qualitative research method. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This study, theoretically based on integrated threat and image theory, explored (1) the mental constructs produced by the Slovak majority in relation to cooperation with the Roma minority and (2) differences in thinking about different Roma demographic groups. In Slovakia, prejudice towards Roma people is a long-standing phenomenon. In this study there were 228 participants, mostly young adults, who produced 22 categories of associations, explored using content and network analyses. The frequency of category associations in the first and second research group was mostly the same, but the distribution differed for the demographic groups considered by the third research group, which was asked to produce associations separately for each Roma demographic group. The largest difference measured was between integrated and segregated Roma people - the associations were mostly positive for the first and negative for the second. These results provide the first empirical exploration of cooperation intentions with Roma people in the Slovak context and suggestions are made for future discourse on Roma. © 2021 Institute for Research in Social Communication, Slovak Academy of Sciences 2021.

AB  - Often people who may not personally express racist beliefs nevertheless have a passive orientation to racism and tolerate racist statements and acts by others. We examine individual differences in willingness to accept racist views or acts in others, labelled tolerance of racism (TOR), in four online survey studies (total N = 2,008). We demonstrate that TOR is distinct from, although correlated with, established forms of bias, such as symbolic and modern racism and social dominance orientation, which measure bias toward marginalized groups rather than tolerance of people who express racism (typically members of dominant groups). Across studies, results indicate that Whites exhibited higher TOR than did people of color, although Black, Latinx, and other people of color still exhibit considerable TOR. Further, people high in TOR minimized the severity of racist acts and were less likely to confront them. They also expressed less concern about current events reflecting racial discrimination and hate and less support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which challenges societal racism. Thus, TOR reflects a passive orientation to racism that influences interpersonal behavior as well as views of macro-level discrimination, leading to the perpetuation of racial inequality. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Due to stigma, discrimination and economic insecurity, persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) are highly vulnerable to housing instability. For instance, PLWHAs are more likely to either remain stable in inadequate homes or change residence. Yet, few studies explore the contexts of housing stability and change among PLWHAs, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority reside. This study used qualitative in-depth interviews to explore the narratives of 38 PLWHAs on the contexts of housing stability and the circumstances leading to change in residence. On diagnosis with HIV, the majority of PLWHAs (58%) changed housing locations, mostly from bad to worse conditions. Reasons for change include: eviction due to stigma and discrimination, inability to afford rent, quest to hide HIV status and death of a cohabiting partner. Our findings suggest policy makers should pay attention to the deplorable and poor housing conditions of PLWHAs in Ghana. © 2020 The Author(s). All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Sexual minority women are more likely to drink alcohol, engage in heavy drinking, and experience alcohol-related problems than heterosexual women. However, culturally tailored interventions for this population have been slow to emerge. Objective: This type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial examines the feasibility and efficacy of a gamified, culturally tailored, personalized normative feedback (PNF) alcohol intervention for sexual minority women who psychologically identify as lesbian, bisexual, or queer (LBQ). Methods: The core components of a PNF intervention were delivered within LezParlay, a fun, social media-inspired, digital competition designed to challenge negative stereotypes about LBQ women and increase visibility. The competition was advertised on the web through social media platforms and collaboration with LBQ community organizations. After 2 rounds of play by a large cohort of LBQ women, a subsample of 500 drinkers already taking part in the competition were invited to participate in the evaluation study. Study participants were randomized to receive 1 of 3 unique sequences of PNF (ie, alcohol and stigma coping, alcohol and control, or control topics only) over 2 intervention rounds. Randomization was fully automated by the web app, and both researchers and participants were blinded. Results: Analyses will evaluate whether PNF on alcohol use reduces participants' drinking and negative consequences at 2 and 4 months postintervention; examine whether providing PNF on stigma-coping behaviors, in addition to alcohol use, further reduces alcohol use and consequences beyond PNF on alcohol alone; identify mediators and moderators of intervention efficacy; and examine broader LezParlay app engagement, acceptability, and perceived benefits. Conclusions: This incognito intervention approach is uniquely oriented toward engaging and preventing alcohol-related risks among community populations of LBQ women who may view their heavy drinking as normative and not in need of change because of the visibility of alcohol use in sexual minority community spaces. Thus, this intervention strategy diverges from, and is intended to complement, more intensive programs being developed to meet the needs of LBQ women already motivated to reduce their consumption. © Sarah C Boyle, Joseph W LaBrie.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the obesity related prejudices and negative attitudes of university students who study in health and non-health fields. Subjective and Methods: This is a descriptive study conducted to determine the obesity prejudice levels of students studying in health and social fields. A total of 732 students (577 females, 155 males) of different faculties of a university participated in the study voluntarily. The Prejudice was measured with Obesity Prejudice Scale (OPS). Analysis of Variance and Covariance were used to investigate relationships between of OPS scores and factors. Results: A total of 732 students, 577 (78.8%) females and 155 (21.2%) males, participated in this study, which was conducted to determine obesity prejudices of university students. According to their mean OPS scores, 18.4% of the students were found to be unprejudiced, 55.1% prone to be prejudiced, and 26.5% prejudiced. The intragroup comparisons of mean OPS scores of health and social field students indicated that the differences between the prejudiced and the unprejudiced were statistically highly significant (p<0.0001). Conclusions: In order to prevent the development of internalized obesity prejudices emerging as a result of prejudices against obese individuals in the society and their stigmatization, this problem must be solved at an early age, especially during university education. It is necessary that state policies should be established to monitor the attitudes of individuals towards obesity, people should be educated and supervised on this subject, and that further research representing the society on this topic should be conducted. © 2021 Mattioli 1885.

AB  - African-American women have elevated rates of cardiovascular disease compared with women of other races or ethnicities, and race/ethnicity-related stressors may play a role. We examined the association between a race/ethnicity-related stressor, midlife loss, and a marker of cardiovascular risk, carotid intima media thickness (IMT), in 1,410 African-American, White, Chinese, and Hispanic women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Participants were queried about losses annually over 12 years (1996-2013), with IMT assessed in year 12-13 via ultrasound. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between cumulative upsetting losses and IMT, adjusting for covariates. In minimally adjusted models in the full cohort, 3 or more upsetting losses (vs. none) were associated with IMT (β = 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01, 0.05; P = 0.0003). Results were more robust among African-American women (β = 0.042, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07; P < 0.01) than White (β = 0.014, 95% CI:-0.01, 0.03; P = 0.21), Chinese (β = 0.036, 95% CI:-0.03, 0.10; P = 0.25), or Hispanic (β = 0.036, 95% CI:-0.07, 0.14; P = 0.51) women, although associations among women from racial/ethnic minorities overall were of similar magnitude. Results persisted in fully adjusted models (P for interaction with race/ethnicity = 0.04). Midlife loss may be a pathway through which race/ethnicity influences cardiovascular risk for African-American women and, potentially, Chinese and Hispanic women. © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - As cultural diversity is increasing around the globe, a more nuanced understanding of the cultural diversity climate in classroom settings is needed, including how its different aspects relate to student outcomes. We developed the Classroom Cultural Diversity Climate Scale (CCDCS), integrating theory and research from social psychology and multicultural education and including novel facets like polyculturalism, which has not been studied in the school context before. We then studied associations with intergroup relations, socio-emotional adjustment, and school achievement among students of immigrant and non-immigrant background at the individual and classroom levels. The scale includes six subscales in the two broad dimensions of equality and inclusion: contact and cooperation, (un)equal treatment, and color-evasion, and cultural pluralism: heritage and intercultural learning, critical consciousness, and polyculturalism. Using data from 1,335 secondary school students in Germany (Mage = 14.7; 51% male; 51% immigrant background), the scale demonstrated measurement invariance by immigrant background, gender, and school track, and reliability at individual and classroom levels. A more positive diversity climate, with better intercultural relations (equality and inclusion) and more opportunities to learn about cultural diversity (cultural pluralism), was associated with more positive student outcomes. Interestingly, polyculturalism was not associated with negative effects observed for other facets of cultural pluralism. Relations for different climate aspects also varied by outcome and students’ immigrant background. This underscores the importance of a nuanced perspective when evaluating different approaches to cultural diversity in context. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, disabled people remain a significantly underrepresented part of the workforce. Recent data suggests that about 20% of undergraduates in the United States have disabilities, but representation in STEM fields is consistently lower than in the general population. Of those earning STEM degrees, only about 10% of undergraduates, 6% of graduate students, and 2% of doctoral students identify as disabled. This suggests that STEM fields have difficulty recruiting and retaining disabled students, which ultimately hurts the field, because disabled scientists bring unique problem-solving perspectives and input. This essay briefly explores the ways in which ableism - prejudice against disabled people based on the assumption that they are "less than"their nondisabled peers - in research contributes to the exclusion of disabled scientists and suggests ways in which the scientific community can improve accessibility and promote the inclusion of disabled scientists in academic science. © 2021 Peterson.

AB  - Two experiments tested whether the Dutch possessive pronoun zijn ‘his’ gives rise to a gender inference and thus causes a male bias when used generically in sentences such as Everyone was putting on his shoes. Experiment 1 (N = 120, 48 male) was a conceptual replication of a previous eye-tracking study that had not found evidence of a male bias. The results of the current eye-tracking experiment showed the generically-intended masculine pronoun to trigger a gender inference and cause a male bias, but for male participants and in stereotypically neutral stereotype contexts only. No evidence for a male bias was thus found in stereotypically female and male context nor for female participants altogether. Experiment 2 (N = 80, 40 male) used the same stimuli as Experiment 1, but employed the sentence evaluation paradigm. No evidence of a male bias was found in Experiment 2. Taken together, the results suggest that the generically-intended masculine pronoun zijn ‘his’ can cause a male bias for male participants even when the referents are previously introduced by inclusive and grammatically gender-unmarked iedereen ‘everyone’. This male bias surfaces with eye-tracking, which taps directly into early language processing, but not in offline sentence evaluations. Furthermore, the results suggest that the intended generic reading of the masculine possessive pronoun zijn ‘his’ is more readily available for women than for men. Copyright: © 2021 Redl et al.

AB  - Knowledge of the processes of aggression and victimization in couple relationships cannot be approached through the treatment of single variables. It needs a multidimensional perspective that establishes a web of relationships between variables of different types. The objectives of the present study were: (i) to explore the interrelationships between and interdependence of empathy, moral disengagement, homophobic attitudes, and prejudice as explanatory variables of discrimination and violence towards couples due to gender issues; and (ii) to delimit predictive indicators of the manifestation of aggressive attitudes and prejudices towards homosexual couples. The sample comprised 778 young people of ages 18 to 24 years (M = 19.9; SD = 1.6). Through the use of four instruments, it was found that empathy is a strong protector against homophobic attitudes, while moral disengagement is a predictor of aggressive attitudes towards same-sex couples. The results make it possible to delimit homophobic profiles and obtain predictive indicators that will be key elements in the design of programs and measures to prevent violence towards couples for reasons of gender. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In a laboratory setting, we explore strategic discrimination in principal-agent relationships, which arises from mutually reinforcing expectations of identity-contingent choices. Our experimental design isolates the influence of the strategic environment from effects of other sources of discrimination, including statistical differences between subpopulations and outright prejudice. We find that, in a strategic setting, principals who reward agents on the basis of outcomes more readily attribute high performance to effort when they share the agent’s group identity. No such bias exists either for principals whose reward decisions are outcome independent or for principals in a nonstrategic environment. Agents in the strategic setting tend to anticipate higher demands from out-group principals and condition their effort choice on that expectation. Because they underappreciate this conditionality, principals tend to underestimate the effort from outgroup agents. © 2021 by the Southern Political Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: An interesting debate in the literature is about the role of race/ethnicity not only as a risk factor for eating disorders (EDs), but also as a moderator of the relations between other risk factors and ED symptoms. The following research question was explored: Does race/ethnicity moderate the relations between the implicit belief that high-fat food is shameful and ED symptoms? Methods: About 15,000 (N = 14,964) volunteers (67.7% White, 7.7% Asian, 7.4% Hispanic, 6.9% Black) completed the Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring the implicit associations between high-fat (vs. low-fat) food and shameful (vs. acceptable) on the Project Implicit mental-health website (https://implicit.harvard.edu) between 2011 and 2017. ED symptoms and demographics were measured via self-report. Results: Race/ethnicity moderated (beta = 0.087, p = .002) the relations between IAT and ED symptoms, adjusting for BMI, age, sex, education, such that the IAT was related to ED symptoms among Whites (r = 0.113, p < .001), Hispanics (r = 0.086, p = .004), and Asians (r = 0.097, p = .001), but not Blacks (r = 0.056, p = .071). Discussion: Although the effect size was small, findings imply that some ED risk factors may vary among racial/ethnic groups. Future studies should use prospective designs to examine whether implicit biases actually represent a risk factor for ED symptoms and whether this varies by race/ethnicity. © 2021

AB  - Ethnic and racial disparities in educational outcomes, such as test scores, are a core issue of educational research. While the role of student and family factors in the formation of such disparities is well established, existing studies fail to draw a similarly clear picture of how teachers contribute to ethnic and racial achievement gaps. In contrast to previous studies, which focussed on the consequences of rather blatant forms of discrimination, such as in teachers’ grading practices, this study investigates rather subtle processes that might result in discrimination of ethnic and racial minority students. In particular, I address stereotypes among teachers and analyse if they induce bias in their achievement expectations for ethnic minority school beginners. Additionally, I analyse if such bias results in a self-fulfilling prophecy and contributes to ethnic achievement gaps at the end of first grade. Multilevel regressions applied to a sample of 1007 children and 64 teachers in German primary schools reveal that different teachers internalize distinct stereotypes regarding ethnic achievement gaps and the achievement-related attributes of ethnic minority students. I also find that teachers with more negative stereotypes expect lower mathematics and reading achievements for ethnic minority students at the beginning of first grade. However, although I replicate the finding that inaccurate teacher expectations result in a self-fulfilling prophecy, I find no statistically significant effects of teacher stereotypes on ethnic differences in the development of students’ reading and mathematical skills throughout first grade. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Outness, or self-disclosure of sexual orientation, plays a key role in the sexual identity development of LGB individuals and is linked with mental health. Lower outness has been consistently linked with higher internalized sexual prejudice; however, no extant research has explored the relationship between generalized self-disclosure and outness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incremental validity of general self-disclosure to explain variance in outness beyond what is accounted for by internalized sexual prejudice among young adults (N = 387; 46 lesbians; 78 gay men; 49 bisexual men; 214 bisexual women). Self-disclosure explained additional variance in outness beyond internalized sexual prejudice. While outness is related to internalized sexual prejudice, general personality characteristics such as self-disclosure may also play a role in LGB individuals’ disclosure of their sexual orientation. These findings suggest that while internalized sexual prejudice is still the primary driver of lower outness, lower general self-disclosure may also play an important role. Closeted individuals may be weighing the risks and benefits of disclosing their sexual orientation, as they would with any other personal information. For those struggling with self-disclosure of sexual orientation, clinicians should attend to internalized sexual prejudice while also noting an individual’s comfort with general self-disclosure. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - During the last decade critical social psychologists have developed an interest in studying locational dimensions of intergroup relations and temporal aspects of social identity. At the same time critical social psychological research on acculturation has emphatically stressed the dynamic and situated nature of the processes of migrant integration and/or exclusion. Building on these strands of research, the present paper argues that spatial/temporal aspects of migrant integration need to be further explored and their critical social psychological study could benefit by insights from the interdisciplinary field of urban studies. Specifically, the notion of urban citizenship can enable an actor-centered, bottom-up perspective in the research of integration, considering it as part of the process of “becoming local” rather than as a process of interaction between homogenous ethnic groups. Furthermore, emphasis on the local and temporal dimensions of appropriating (or being excluded from) urban/community resources can contribute to a multifaceted and situated dynamic approach to migration, to avoid reified conceptualizations of integration, to highlight the discontinuities and disruptions that characterize new mobilities and to question binary oppositions between receiving and sending societies and host and guest populations. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This work examines whether racial attitudes—when measured by both explicit and implicit measures— are driven primarily by skin tone, facial physiognomy, or both in 5 to 12-year-old children. Participants evaluated faces varying in skin tone (from dark to light) and facial physiognomy (from Afrocentric to Eurocentric). In an explicit task, children rated how much they liked each face. In an implicit task, participants completed a child-friendly version of the Affect Misattribution Procedure, where they rated a Chinese character as “good” or “bad” following a racial prime. Results suggest that pro-White attitudes (especially those measured by the explicit task) are driven by both factors, vary by perceivers’ race, and are present in both White and non-White children, though skin tone exerts a larger influence than other features, at least in explicit evaluations. Our results also raise the possibility that pro-White biases might be more internalized by non-White children in the American South. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - To date the majority of the research on microaggressions has focused on the experiences of targets, rather than the perpetrators, of microaggresive behaviors. The present study set out to investigate 278 college students’ (Mage = 19.12, SD = 1.34, 52.52% cisgender women, 74.82% European American) reported types of experience (a) unaware, b) aware, c) observer, d) perpetrator, and e) target) with race- and gender-based microaggressive behaviors and the association between their experiences and ambivalent sexist and color-blind racial attitudes. Participants completed an online survey composed of a modified Racial and Ethnic Microaggression Scale (REMS), a modified Female Microaggression Scale (FMS), an Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, and a Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale. As hypothesized, participants were more likely to have heard of or seen than to report having been the target or perpetrator of microaggressions. In support of our second hypothesis, significant gender and race differences were found in the frequencies of type of exposure to microaggressions. Finally, as expected, exposure to microaggressions was associated with color-blind and ambivalent sexist attitudes. Unexpectedly, however, complete unawareness of the existence of microaggressions was not associated with social attitudes. This study’s findings highlight the importance of unpacking social experiences of discrimination to better understand what types of experiences contribute to being critical of and reducing the commission of microaggressions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objectives: Popular responses to the pandemic illustrate ageism's pervasiveness and the extent of collective acquiescence to its newest expressions. We explore these themes by analyzing Twitter reactions to "calculated ageism"- a term we use to refer to a political figure's edict that older adults should sacrifice their lives if it will mitigate the pandemic's economic damage to younger people. Method: Using thematic analysis, we examine tweets (n = 188) responding to Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick's March 23, 2020, statement that encouraged generational self-sacrifice. Themes that emerged included positions of support or opposition and tweeters' critiques. Results: The large majority of tweets - 90% - opposed calculated ageism, while only 5% supported it and 5% conveyed no position. Opposition centered on moral critiques, political-economic critiques, assertions of older adults' worth, and public health arguments. Support centered on individual responsibility and patriotism. Discussion: While prior research reveals ageism's entrenchment in popular culture, our study finds that it has limits and identifies the reasons underlying them. The most common reasons for opposing calculated ageism center on its immorality and on its privileging of the economic interests of the powerful few over the many, patterns suggesting that the boundaries of ageism are influenced by core beliefs about fairness. They also are shaped by a bedrock conviction that older lives have value. This intergenerational solidarity could be leveraged to reduce ageism during the pandemic and beyond. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis: The aim of this study was to examine how BMI influences the association between Asian ethnicity and risk of gestational diabetes (GDM). Methods: This population-based cohort study included pregnant women without pre-existing diabetes mellitus in Ontario, Canada between 2012 and 2014. Women of Chinese and South Asian ethnicity were identified using a validated surname algorithm. GDM was ascertained using hospitalisation codes. The relationship between ethnicity and GDM was modelled using modified Poisson regression, adjusted for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, previous GDM, long-term residency status, income quintile and smoking status. An interaction term between ethnicity and pre-pregnancy BMI was tested. Results: Of 231,618 pregnant women, 9289 (4.0%) were of South Asian ethnicity and 12,240 (5.3%) were of Chinese ethnicity. Relative to women from the general population, in whom prevalence of GDM was 4.3%, the adjusted RR of GDM was higher among those of South Asian ethnicity (1.81 [95% CI 1.64, 1.99]) and Chinese ethnicity (1.66 [95% CI 1.53, 1.80]). The association between GDM and Asian ethnicity remained significant across BMI categories but differed according to BMI. The prevalence of GDM exceeded 5% at an estimated BMI of 21.5 kg/m2 among South Asian women, 23.0 kg/m2 among Chinese women and 29.5 kg/m2 among the general population. Conclusions/interpretation: The risk of GDM is significantly higher in South Asian and Chinese women, whose BMI is lower than that of women in the general population. Accordingly, targeted GDM prevention strategies may need to consider lower BMI cut-points for Asian populations.

AB  - Background/objectives: Weight bias among registered dietitians (RDs) is a concern and effective interventions to reduce weight bias are sparse. Our objective was to determine if a short, attribution theory-based online video intervention would reduce weight bias in RDs. Subjects/methods: Dietitians from a nationally representative sample were recruited for a randomized, parallel-arm study with online surveys at pre-, post-intervention and 1-month follow-up. One hundred and forty-seven RDs who watched one of three videos embedded in an online survey from June to August 2019 were considered for the analysis. RDs were randomized to watch either the intervention, positive control, or negative control video. The primary outcome was the change in the “blame” component of the Anti-Fat Attitude Test (AFAT) from pre-to immediate post-intervention. Differences in changes in AFAT and Implicit Association Test (IAT) scores across treatment groups were assessed via linear models; multiple imputation were performed for missing data. Results: Baseline demographics, AFAT and IAT scores of the 147 participants who watched a video were not significantly different between the study groups (p > 0.05). The intervention group’s AFAT-blame score reduced by an average of 0.05 between pre- and immediate post-intervention but was not statistically significant (p = 0.76, confidence intervals (CI) = −0.40, 0.30). Furthermore, there were no significant changes for AFAT-social, AFAT-physical subscores, and IAT within or between groups between pre- and immediate post-intervention (p > 0.05). Due to high attrition rates, the changes at 1-month follow-up are not reported. Conclusions: This study was the first to explore the effectiveness of an online video intervention to reduce weight bias in RDs. This study was unable to detect a significant impact of a short, attribution theory-based video intervention on weight bias in practicing RDs and future larger studies are needed to confirm our findings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - This paper presents a survey of beliefs of secondary school youth and higher education students about elderly persons. The survey objective was to assess youth’s beliefs about the social functioning of elderly persons in the area of healthcare and social assistance, and to prepare practical recommendations for educational work aimed at counteracting negative stereotypes concerning elderly persons. The survey was conducted as part of a research project implemented under the auspices of the Committee for Pedagogical Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The survey encompassed 1084 persons, including 588 secondary school students and 496 higher education students. The survey was conducted using the diagnostic survey method and questionnaire technique in Poland between September 2018 and February 2019. The survey indicates that the secondary school youth and higher education students surveyed manifested varied beliefs about the functioning of elderly persons in the area of healthcare and social assistance, and that statistically significant differences occur between the groups surveyed with regard to the variables analyzed. While most of the youth surveyed did not manifest stereotypical beliefs about elderly persons, higher education students had more mature and well-thought-out views. Statistically significant differences occurred in certain aspects between the groups surveyed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Prior research has suggested that bilingual children demonstrate reduced social bias relative to their monolingual peers. In particular, they exhibit less implicit bias against racial outgroups. However, the cognitive determinants of racial bias in bilingual children remain unclear. In the current study, relationships between racial bias and three cognitive factors (inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and perspective-taking ability), along with language proficiency and parental education, were investigated in a sample of bilingual preschoolers (N = 55). Children were bilingual learners of English and Mandarin. Results demonstrated that implicit bias was predicted by cognitive flexibility, independent of variation in inhibitory control, second language vocabulary, perspective taking, and parental education. In contrast, explicit bias was predicted by parental education alone and not by cognitive or linguistic factors. Findings suggest that increased cognitive flexibility, often thought to be an outgrowth of bilingual experience, may also be associated with a reduction in implicit bias. Findings are discussed in terms of specific mechanisms that may link cognitive factors, bilingualism, and racial bias. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - One of the major drivers of societal conflict are the intergroup relations which rely mainly on social identity and which are rarely analyzed for immigrant groups. This article changes this point of view by investigating the extent to which national, ethnic, and religious identities relate to outgroup hostilities towards the majority of the German population, towards other immigrant groups, and towards Syrian refugees among immigrant-origin citizens. We employ a theoretical framework based on the social identity approach and use new representative survey data from 2017 for Germans of Turkish descent (N = 480) and Russian Germans (N = 471). Based on multivariate linear regression analysis, we show that ethnic identity has the strongest positive relation with outgroup hostilities, with the exception of the Russian-Germans' evaluation of the German majority population. National identity among Germans of Turkish descent lessens their hostility towards other immigrants. Our results show the importance of analyzing immigrant groups with different migration trajectories separately before making generalized claims. Not only are the identity relations different between an ingroup identification and various outgroup targets, but they are also different between the immigrant groups for the same ingroup identification and outgroup target. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In the Arab world, the recognized children of elite men and slave women could adopt the status of their father, ignoring the slave origin of the mother, owing to a system of patrilineal transmission. This regime co-existed with negative stereotypes toward slaves and blackness, despite the very fact that—as this study of notable families in Tetouan between 1859 and 1956 demonstrates—skin color was not the determinant factor to form part of this group. Rather, it was based on the social definition of filiation, leading to legal disputes between family members to delineate the boundaries of kinship. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Several scholars have noted that entrepreneurship, innovation, and market dynamism more generally —“creative destruction’— are largely absent from Smith's characterization of what his “liberal plan” tends to bring about. Indeed, in reading Smith's body of work, one gets the impression that Smith's opinion of innovation ranged from oblivious to skeptical. I argue, however, that the scant attention to innovation and market dynamism is not an oversight on Smith's part; nor did Smith believe that innovation was typically undesirable. Instead, I argue that we must read Smith esoterically. Smith recognizes that prejudices against commercial activity are ancient and deep—even natural. Market dynamism generates moral and social tumult. Innovation breaks from, and sometimes disrupts, traditional ways of living. A liberal order tends toward greater cultural detachment and moral fragmentation. Smith downplayed the tumultuous effects of market dynamism, and, on the surface, he did sometimes disparage the effects of innovation. Beneath the surface, however, Smith recognizes that innovation is an inherent component of the liberal package—a mixed blessing but, at any rate, an integral part of the liberal plan. In his work the careful reader can find guidance on how people can adjust to, and make the best of, a liberal order. The economic growth promised by liberalism hinges on innovation; the virtues of tolerance and reserve must be learned. To make the liberal plan palatable, Smith recognizes that he must adopt a pedagogy that leaves some of his teachings indirect or nonobvious. © 2020

AB  - This paper presents two cross-sectional survey studies, both conducted in Britain, which focus on how different cultural identities are managed in multicultural settings. Specifically, the studies explored the extent to which essentialism moderates the perceived compatibility of acculturation orientations, heritage culture maintenance and majority culture adoption. In study 1, participants (N = 198) were Somali minority members living in the UK. It was found when minority members essentialized Britishness themselves, and when they perceived that British people essentialized Britishness, they saw a desire to maintain the culture of origin and a desire adopt the majority culture as conflicting with each other. In study 2, participants (N = 200) were white British majority members living in the UK. Findings showed that when white British majority members essentialized Britishness, they too perceived the two acculturation preferences as being incompatible with each other. Taken together, these studies show that essentializing British identity can lead to a view that the majority and minority cultures are mutually exclusive. Implications for intergroup relations and integration into British society are discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Social movements pushing for social change are often met with reactionary counter-movements that defend the status quo. The present research examined this interplay by focusing on the role of racial majority group members claiming collective psychological ownership. We examined collective ownership that stems from being native to the land and from being founders of the nation. Study 1 found that in Malaysia, the Malay majority group endorsed more native ownership than Chinese and Indian minorities, which in turn predicted greater threat in response to protests demanding electoral reforms and subsequently greater support for a reactionary pro-government movement. Situated in the United States, Study 2 found that the more that White Americans endorsed founder ownership beliefs, the more they reported negative attitudes towards the Black Lives Matter protests, which in turn predicted more support for White nationalistic counter-protests. This effect was stronger among White people compared to people of colour. Study 3 examined both founder and native ownership in Australia. Founder (but not native) ownership beliefs predicted more negative attitudes towards Invasion Day protests, which subsequently predicted more support for counter-protests defending Australia Day celebrations. Implications of culture-specific beliefs about collective ownership for social movement research are discussed. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - This study explores the relationships between intergenerational social class mobility and attitudes towards immigration. We interpret a failure to keep up with parental social class (i.e., downward mobility) as an indicator that individual's status achievements lag behind expectations and contribute to subjective feelings of loss and decline. An innovative feature of this study is that we investigate both whether individual's mobility experience – micro level – and also whether opportunity structures – mobility on a macro level – are linked with attitudes towards immigration. In contexts with high downward-mobility, opportunities for moving up are limited and hence perceived economic decline and loss might lead to more hostility towards immigrants. We use the European Social Survey data (2002–2010) and conduct analyses on 30 countries using diagonal reference models that allow the effects of individual mobility trajectory to be disentangled from origin status and destination status. Our results show that the working classes hold stronger anti-immigration attitudes and parental class continues to exert an effect on attitudes in adulthood even after accounting for individual's own social class position. Being downwardly mobile from parental class does not appear to be associated with more hostility towards immigrants, except in a few European countries like Italy, Poland, and Greece. Our random-effects meta-regression models show, however, that people living in contexts of high downward mobility are more hostile towards immigrants compared to people in contexts with high upward mobility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The perceived collective continuity (PCC) of a national identity serves as a crucial source of stability and self-esteem for group members. Recent work has explored the consequences of perceived continuity when the meaning of a nation’s past is seen in a negative light, and the challenges this brings for the negotiation of a positive identity in the present, signalling the potential value of perceived discontinuity The current paper extends this literature by examining the role of intergroup relations in the construction of both collective continuities and discontinuities. Through analysing the discursive management of national identity in nine focus groups in a post-conflict context (Serbia, N = 67), we reveal how the tensions between continuity and discontinuity are embedded within a broader discussion of the nation’s relationship with relevant national outgroups across its history. The findings contribute to theoretical knowledge on the interlinking of national identity and PCC by illustrating the ways in which intergroup relations of the past shape the extent to which continuity is seen as desirable or undesirable. We argue that despite the psychological merits of collective continuity, discontinuity can become attractive and useful when there is limited space to challenge how a nation’s history is remembered and the valence given to the past. The paper concludes by offering an account of how social and political contexts can influence the nature, functions, and valence of PCC within national identities. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In two different intergroup contexts, three studies investigated the role of temporal distance in responses to intergroup violence from both victim and perpetrator perspectives. In the context of the conflict between Serbs and Bosniaks, Study 1 showed that whereas increased subjective temporal distance predicted less support for justice-restoring efforts and less outgroup empathy among the perpetrator group (Serbs), it predicted more conciliatory, pro-outgroup attitudes among the victim group (Bosniaks). Furthermore, Bosniaks perceived the war as temporally closer than did Serbs. In the context of the U.S.–Iran conflict, Study 2 provided a partial conceptual replication of Study 1 and demonstrated that ingroup glorification motivated more temporal distancing among perpetrators and less temporal distancing among victims. Study 3 further established the causal effects of temporal distance on intergroup outcomes, and that these effects were moderated by glorification. Implications for post-conflict peacebuilding are discussed. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Despite the increasing prevalence of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), little sociological research has focused on effects of diagnosis in schools. This study, which is grounded in the modified labeling approach, relies on three waves of Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K:2011) data to determine if teachers evaluate the academic performance of ADHD students as less promising than non-diagnosed peers. Results indicate that teachers are more likely to rate ADHD students as performing below grade level and are less likely to acknowledge these students as performing above grade level—regardless of demonstrated ability on subject-specific tests. The latter finding is, in part, a function of real and/or perceived behaviors in the classroom that inform teachers’ grade-level performance ratings. We argue that diagnosis may be a double-edged sword for children and their families, as it can provide access to special resources in the school but may activate teachers’ negative stereotypes about diagnosed students. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - While the suffering of Allied prisoners of war on the Thai-Burma railway during the Second World War is well documented, much less is known about the Asian labourers employed on the project. Focusing on Thai and Chinese workers in Thailand, this study argues that although Asian labourers often suffered in a way comparable to prisoners of war, they also exercised some agency in their dealings with the Japanese. Many workers were motivated to work on the railway by relatively high wages, and at times they employed physical resistance against their treatment. Those workers resident in Thailand often exercised the option of absconding from railway work sites. At times, as elsewhere in the war, race became a central issue and showed not merely social prejudice but political calculation as well. The Thai government acted to protect Thai workers from the excesses of Japanese employment, but this was often at the expense of Chinese labourers resident in Thailand, outsiders who bore the brunt of harsh treatment. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The present set of studies investigated the role of being religious in the prediction of various forms of prejudice. Following the threat-constraint model, we predicted that contexts characterized by high threat attenuate—or constrain—the relationship between individual differences in being religious on the one hand and antigay prejudice and sexism on the other. A worldwide investigation of these regional constraints was conducted in the Americas Barometer (125,984 individuals nested in 20 countries; Study 1), the World Values Survey (69,798 individuals nested in 45 countries; Study 2), and the European Social Survey (44,386 individuals nested in 274 Nomenclature des Unités Territoriales Statistiques regions; Study 3). Results identify a key moderating role of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, revealing strong associations between religion and prejudice in regions low in power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and collectivism, whereas the religion–prejudice association is constrained (i.e., weaker and often absent) in regions high on those cultural dimensions. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - National and European policies aim to facilitate the integration of Roma people into mainstream society. Yet, Europe’s largest ethnic group continues to be severely discriminated. Although prejudice has been identified to be at the core of this failure, social psychological research on anti-Gypsyism remains scarce. We conducted a study in six countries using student and community samples (N = 2,089; Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Norway, Italy, Spain) to understand how anti-Gypsyism among majority-group members predicts unfavorable acculturation preferences toward Roma people. Openly negative stereotypes predicted acculturation preferences strongly across the countries. However, stereotypes about the Roma receiving undeserved benefits were also relevant to some degree in East-Central Europe, implying that intergroup relations are framed there as realistic conflict. Stereotypes about traditional Roma culture did not play a central role in acculturation preferences. Our findings highlighted that anti-Gypsyism may be an impediment to integration efforts, and efforts should be context-specific rather than pan-national. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Unprotected sex is the primary mode of HIV transmission in China. In 2014, 25.8 per cent of newly diagnosed cases were attributed to unprotected sex between men (National Health and Family Planning Commission 2015). While the majority of the nation’s new HIV infections are due to heterosexual sex, HIV is deeply tied to homosexuality in public discourse in China. Standing at the intersection of a stigmatised disease and sexual dissidence, HIV-positive gay men are particularly ‘Othered’, suffering from intense prejudice and discrimination. However, we analyse how this intersection not only presents oppression, but also agency. Whereas Chinese mainstream discourses are often imbued with homo-negativity, the intersection of being gay and HIV-positive has allowed the creation of LGBTQ+ NGOs as heterotopia which do not only function as counter-sites where alternative social relations and norms can be imagined, but also as nodes in wider societal networks from where LGBTQ+ rights can be promoted. © 2020 Royal Dutch Geographical Society / Koninklijk Nederlands Aardrijkskundig Genootschap

AB  - This field experiment tested whether inducing common inclusive representations (i.e., one group, dual identity) during contact influences intergroup relations differently for ethnic majority and minority children by changing their metaperceptions and intergroup emotions differently. White (N = 113) and Black (N = 111) 8- to 10-year-old children were exposed to interactive mixed-ethnicity sessions in schools emphasizing either categorization as one group (national group), dual identity (national group with ethnic subgroups), or two ethnic groups. Overall, as predicted, for White children, one-group, but not dual-identity perceptions, improved behavioral intentions by influencing metaperceptions. For Black children, dual-identity, but not one-group, perceptions improved behavioral intentions through metaperceptions. Contrary to the expected, both dual-identity and one-group perceptions were associated with White and Black children’s intergroup emotions. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The present study examined the effects of antiprejudice norms on children’s ethnic attitudes by taking their antiprejudice motivations into account. In a sample of 767 native Dutch preadolescents we found evidence for both an internal and an external motivation to be nonprejudiced which were, respectively, positively versus negatively related to children’s out-group attitudes. Overall, children’s norm perceptions were linked to more positive ethnic attitudes, and this relation was partly explained by their internal antiprejudice motivation. Some normative aspects were found be less effective (moral rule to be nice and honest) than others (equality message) by stimulating an external motivation rather than undermining it and stimulating an internal one. Distinguishing between different normative sources further showed that parents and peers were more influential than teachers. Our findings underline the importance of including motivations in research on norms and out-group attitudes. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The social dominance–environmentalism nexus proposes that orientations for inequality and domination are expressed both in human–human and human–nature relations. In two studies, the present work applies and extends this proposition to understand endorsement of environmental values, concern with climate change, support for climate policies, and responsibility for climate action. In study one, using a representative random sample from Portugal (N = 1270, 53.3% female; European Social Survey, ESS8), social dominance orientation showed unique associations with concern with climate change. Moreover, opposition to immigration (as expression of anti-egalitarianism in intergroup relations) showed unique associations with all four measures of environmentalism. In study two, multi-level analyses using representative random samples from 20 other countries in Europe (N = 38830, 51.5% female; ESS8) confirmed the associations between opposition to immigration and environmentalism, controlling for a set of sociodemographic covariates, political orientation, and nesting at the country level. However, there were differences in the strength and direction of these associations based on country levels of societal development (i.e., Human Development Index; HDI). These differences reinforce the notion that context or situational variables may shape the links between diverse expressions of (anti-)egalitarianism and (anti-)environmentalism. Inputs for applied research on hierarchy-affirming tendencies toward others and the natural environment are proposed and discussed. © 2020 International Association of Applied Psychology

AB  - In the last decade, a growing body of research has revealed that morality is the most important driver of impression formation. As such, social targets lacking morality are disliked and kept at distance, while moral targets are liked and respected. Here, we investigated whether social targets lacking morality elicit positive reactions in the observer. Study 1 revealed that participants reported an enhanced self-view when confronted with an immoral (vs. moral) behavior performed by a political opponent. Study 2 revealed the key role of morality in this process, as differential perceptions of the target’s incompetence had no comparable effect on the observer self-view. Importantly, such results emerged when participants were highly identified with their ingroup. Taken together, these findings suggest that outgroup immorality can elicit positive self-related responses in the observer. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications for social judgment and intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - K. D. Williams (2009) theorized that chronic social exclusion would inescapably lead to a detrimental stage of resignation, characterized by depression, alienation, unworthiness, and helplessness. However, few studies empirically addressed this assumption. Considering immigrants as a population at risk of persistent exclusion, we investigated how social connections with the native-born majority and other immigrant minorities moderate the exclusion–resignation link. In Study 1 (N = 112 asylum seekers), participants mainly connected with other immigrants showed a significant association between chronic exclusion and resignation. Crucially, this link vanished for people with social connections mainly composed of native people. In Study 2, we replicated and extended these results running secondary analyses on a data set of 2,206 immigrants (CILS4EU). This work, suggesting that the exclusion–resignation link can be moderated by social factors, highlighted the relevance of immigrants’ connections with the native majority for counteracting the risk of segregation when tackling the social issue of immigrants’ everyday exclusion. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Integrating social identity threat and structural hole theories, this work examines how social network positions affect group-based identity threats. For individuals less well positioned to bridge (or “broker”) relations between unconnected friends, stigma-by-association concerns may constrain affiliation with stereotypic targets. Three experiments (Ns = 280, 232, 553) test whether women (vs. men) in male-dominated STEM (vs. female-dominated) majors avoid befriending a female target with feminine-stereotypic (vs. STEM-stereotypic) interests. Only STEM women with less brokerage (i.e., less ability to manage introductions to unconnected friends) in their existing friendship networks avoided befriending (pilot experiment) and socially integrating (Experiments 1 and 2) feminine- (vs. STEM-) stereotypic targets, despite standardized target similarity and competence. STEM women in particular anticipated steeper reputational penalties for befriending stereotypically feminine peers (Experiment 2). Social identity threat may lead women in STEM—especially those lacking brokerage—to exclude stereotypically feminine women from social networks, reinforcing stereotypes of women and STEM fields. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Several constructs have been identified as relevant to the juror decision-making process in hate crime cases. However, there is a lack of research on the relationships between these constructs and their variable influence across victim group. The purpose of the current study was to reexamine factors relevant to the juror decision-making process in hate crime cases within a structural model, and across victim group, to gauge the relative strength and explanatory power of various predictors. In the current study, 313 participants sentenced a perpetrator found guilty of a hate crime committed against either a Black man or a gay man; participants also responded to individual difference measures relevant to mock juror hate crime decision making, including prejudice toward the victim’s social group. Using path analysis, we explored the role of juror prejudice on sentencing decisions in hate crime cases as well as similarities and differences based on the victimized group. Results indicated that, when the victim was a Black man, modern racism influenced sentencing both directly and indirectly through perpetrator blame attributions, explaining 18% of the variance in sentencing. In contrast, when the victim was a gay man, modern homophobia did not directly predict sentencing, and the overall model explained only 4% of the variance in sentencing, suggesting variables beyond juror prejudice may be better suited to explain juror decision making in sexual orientation–based hate crimes. The current study suggests that the role of juror prejudice in hate crime cases varies as a function of the victimized group and raises questions about the importance of juror prejudice in the sentencing of hate crime cases, particularly antigay prejudice. The importance of blame attributions, social dominance orientation, and juror beliefs regarding penalty enhancements for hate crime cases, as well as policy implications, are also addressed. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to identify common barriers to employment of autistic people and reasonable adjustments that address those barriers; to define autistic strengths and see how the prevailing narrative of autism is affecting employment. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative review of an online consultation amongst a group of 34 autistic adults that took place during April–October 2019. It includes anecdotal accounts and reviews of the themes contained therein. Findings: Key barriers are, namely, deficit narrative of autism; misunderstandings and prejudices amongst senior management and work colleagues; bullying and peer pressure to isolate the autistic employee, leading to anxiety and mental health breakdown in absence of social support; managers making discriminatory choices believing it is the right business decision; the discriminatory nature of provisions, criteria and practices, failing to recognise strengths. Rather than imposing the manner of work, reasonable adjustments should be made to enable the autistic employee to function in his autistic way, achieving results. Research limitations/implications: Qualitative nature; small self-selecting sample online; functioning and diagnosis not verified, themes derived subjectively. Practical implications: The need to change the deficit narrative and redefine autistic strengths by autistic people themselves, to legitimise and normalise autistic way of functioning and adjust the managerial provisions, criteria and practices accordingly. Coaching autistic leaders to be the public role models would also help. Originality/value: Identifying barriers and reasonable adjustments, from the perspective of lived experience. A new framework of assessing autistic competence and suitability for employment is proposed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The social identity theory proposed by Tajfel et al. provides insight into how group membership and self-categorization cause intergroup prejudice and discrimination, finally leading to social conflicts. However, unanswered questions remain: under what conditions can an “in-group” and an “out-group” transform conflictual intergroup behavior into a more harmonious relationship and avoid social conflict? Opinion dynamics theory and social simulation are appropriate methods to answer this question. In this study, a new model of opinion dynamics proposed by Ishii is adopted, and we conduct simulations of intergroup conflicts. The new model, along with social simulations, presents how an in-group and an out-group can develop social harmony and avoid social conflict. According to our simulations, when the two groups trust their members 100%, the opinion inside an in-group converges. However, intragroup opinion diverges as trust within the group gets lower. On the other hand, intergroup opinion converges when the intergroup trust is higher than 50%. If intergroup trust is higher than 80%, then the intergroup opinions of the two perfectly overlap. Furthermore, if intragroup trust is 70% and intergroup trust is as low as 50%, the two groups' opinions completely polarize. We also calculated additional cases where intragroup trust was fixed at 70%, but for one-third of an in-group member trust an out-group with various values. Finally, a method to avoid further social crises can be obtained by examining real-world cases of partisan conflicts in recent America. © Copyright © 2021 Ishii, Okano and Nishikawa.

AB  - Background: Despite evidence-based national guidelines for ADHD in the United Kingdom (UK), ADHD is under-identified, under-diagnosed, and under-treated. Many seeking help for ADHD face prejudice, long waiting lists, and patchy or unavailable services, and are turning to service-user support groups and/or private healthcare for help. Methods: A group of UK experts representing clinical and healthcare providers from public and private healthcare, academia, ADHD patient groups, educational, and occupational specialists, met to discuss shortfalls in ADHD service provision in the UK. Discussions explored causes of under-diagnosis, examined biases operating across referral, diagnosis and treatment, together with recommendations for resolving these matters. Results: Cultural and structural barriers operate at all levels of the healthcare system, resulting in a de-prioritization of ADHD. Services for ADHD are insufficient in many regions, and problems with service provision have intensified as a result of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Research has established a range of adverse outcomes of untreated ADHD, and associated long-term personal, social, health and economic costs are high. The consensus group called for training of professionals who come into contact with people with ADHD, increased funding, commissioning and monitoring to improve service provision, and streamlined communication between health services to support better outcomes for people with ADHD. Conclusions: Evidence-based national clinical guidelines for ADHD are not being met. People with ADHD should have access to healthcare free from discrimination, and in line with their legal rights. UK Governments and clinical and regulatory bodies must act urgently on this important public health issue. © Copyright © 2021 Young, Asherson, Lloyd, Absoud, Arif, Colley, Cortese, Cubbin, Doyle, Morua, Ferreira-Lay, Gudjonsson, Ivens, Jarvis, Lewis, Mason, Newlove-Delgado, Pitts, Read, van Rensburg, Zoritch and Skirrow.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to use the lens of the stereotype threat theory to explore older consumers’ age identity and experiences with service providers. Design/methodology/approach: This study used semi-structured interviews with Australian consumers aged between 55 and 69. Data were examined using thematic analysis. Findings: Older consumers justify a younger cognitive age by distancing themselves from the negative stereotypes associated with ageing and by associating themselves with attitudes and behaviours consistent with a younger age identity. Older consumers are confronted with age-based stereotype threats in a services context through four practices. Exposure to these threats results in service failure and can have a negative impact on both consumers’ ability to function effectively as consumers and their overall well-being. Research limitations/implications: A more diverse sample is required to identify the extent to which age-based stereotype threats are experienced and which services marketing practices have the most detrimental impact on older consumers. Practical implications: The findings provide insight for services marketers seeking to effectively cater for older consumers and have implications for service staff training, service technology and communications. Social implications: The findings have implications for the well-being of older consumers in terms of their self-efficacy and self-esteem as well as their ability to function effectively as consumers. Originality/value: This study contributes to the nascent understanding of older consumers’ experiences and their expectations of service interactions and advertising communication. The findings also extend the literature on service failure by demonstrating how age-based stereotypes threaten age identity, resulting in a negative customer experience. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Attitudes toward minority employees are hard to predict, and there is no enough information about the variables that are associated with increased and decreased prejudice toward them. The Jewish and Arab education systems in Israel are, for the most part, segregated, which may potentially contribute to prejudice and alienation between the two populations. The integration of Israeli–Arab teachers in Jewish schools has been suggested to reduce prejudice. The current study sought to examine Israeli teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of Arab teachers in Jewish schools (AJ) and its relation to degree of religiosity, minority status and demographic variables. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,644 teachers completed an online 22-item questionnaire that surveyed background variables such as gender, mother tongue, seniority and degree of religiosity, the two independent variables, religiosity and minority status, and the dependent variable, attitude toward the inclusion of AJ. Findings: Overall, teachers exhibited positive attitudes toward the integration of AJ. Multiple linear regression indicated that among Jewish teachers, the degree of religiosity was the strongest predictor of the teachers' attitudes toward inclusion but was a poor predictor among Arabs. Conversely, minority status was the strongest predictor among Arab teachers but was a poor predictor among Israeli Jews. Not only did religiosity differ in its prediction of attitudes among Arabs and Jews but also the patterns of religiosity were quite different among these two groups. Research limitations/implications: While the overall sample was wide, the specific minority groups that were examined were small and did not allow deep exploration of minority nuances. The study's generalizability is hampered by the given exceptionality of the Israeli context, where “Church” and State are not separated. Religiosity was examined in a unidimensional way and failed to explore other related factors that may be relevant, such as political inclination. Practical implications: The study further refutes the notion of commonality among minorities. It proposes to place more emphasis on religion's role in attitudes toward minority employees. Further research into the role of religiosity in Israeli Jews' attitudes toward Arabs is needed. Social implications: The findings suggest that the degree of religiosity might be a central factor in Israeli Jews' attitudes toward the Arab minority in general. Originality/value: The research calls attention to the association of Judaism and nationalism as well as segregation, contributing to negative attitudes and prejudice toward the Arab minority. Unlike previous research using contact theory, the authors call attention to the importance of examining willingness to make contact prior to examining the impact of contact itself. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Biotechnology describes a range of human activities in medicine, agriculture, and environmental management. One biotechnology in particular, gene technology, continues to evolve both in capacity and potential to benefit and harm society. The purpose of this article is to offer a policy bridge from unproductive descriptions of gene technology to useful methods for identifying sources of significant biological and socioeconomic risk in complex food systems. Farmers and the public could be voluntarily and involuntarily interacting with new techniques of genome editing and gene silencing in entirely new ways, limiting the usefulness of previous gene technology histories to predict safety. What we believe is a more consistent, verifiable, and practical approach is to identify the critical control points that emerge where the scale effects of a human activity diverge between risk and safety. These critical control points are where technical experts can collaborate with publics with different expertise to identify and manage the technology. The use of technical terminology describing biochemical-level phenomena discourages publics that are not technical experts from contesting the embedded cultural perspectives and uncertainty in “scientific” concepts and prejudice the risk discourse by ignoring other issues of significance to society. From our perspective as gene technologists, we confront the use of pseudo-scale language in risk discourse and propose an escape path from clashes over whether risks that arise spontaneously (from nature) can be perfectly mimicked by gene technology to a discussion on how to best control the risks created by human activity. Scale is conceptually implicit and explicit in gene technology regulation, but there is no agreement about what scales are most useful to managing risk and social expectations. Both differentiated governance (risk-tiered) and responsible research and innovation models could accommodate the critical control points mechanism that we describe. Copyright: © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Good science communication should give the public the tools to make informed decisions and take action, which can be particularly important for nature conservation. The crisis in invertebrate conservation might be rooted in public prejudices against invertebrate animals, which are perceived as the unpopular 97% of Earth’s animal biodiversity. As such, how we approach science communication regarding those animals might yet play a critical role in their conservation. Given how specialized a topic invertebrate biology is, a large part of its communication fall to scientists. Here, we surveyed both scientists and members of the public about the former’s approaches and assumptions and the latter’s interest and expectations regarding invertebrate science communication, confronting the results of each survey. Our findings show that scientists and the public are only tangentially aligned; there is plenty of ground scientists and communicators need to pay attention to and explore better in order to achieve more meaningful and balanced science communication. Among other findings, topics and approaches that could be used to greater effect include (depending on age groups of the audience) history, folklore, pop culture, and pathology. Our results have unveiled some issues in science communication of invertebrates and are thus a good first approach to start defining the way forward. © Copyright © 2021 Salvador, Tomotani, O’Donnell, Cavallari, Tomotani, Salmon and Kasper.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda inclusive, implemented lockdowns, curfew, banning of both private and public transport systems, and mass gatherings to minimize spread. Social control measures for COVID-19 are reported to increase violence and discrimination globally, including in Uganda as some may be difficult to implement resulting in the heavy deployment of law enforcement. Media reports indicated that cases of violence and discrimination had increased in Uganda's communities following the lockdown. We estimated the incidence and factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination among Ugandans during the COVID-19 lockdown to inform control and prevention measures. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data under the International Citizen Project (ICP) to assess adherence to public health measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda. We analyzed data on violence and discrimination from the ICP study. We performed descriptive statistics for all the participants' characteristics and created a binary outcome variable called experiencing violence and/or discrimination. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination. RESULTS: Of the 1726 ICP study participants, 1051 (58.8%) were males, 841 (48.7%) were currently living with a spouse or partner, and 376 (21.8%) had physically attended work for more than 3 days in the past week. Overall, 145 (8.4%) experienced any form of violence and/or discrimination by any perpetrator, and 46 (31.7%) of the 145 reported that it was perpetrated by a law enforcement officer. Factors associated with experiencing violence or discrimination were: being male (AOR = 1.60 CI:1.10-2.33), having attended work physically for more than 3 days in the past week (AOR = 1.52 CI:1.03-2.23), and inability to access social or essential health services since the epidemic started (AOR = 3.10 CI:2.14-4.50). CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of Ugandan residents experienced violence and/or discrimination during the COVID-19 lockdown, mostly perpetrated by law enforcement officers. We recommend mitigation of the collateral impact of lockdowns with interventions that focus on improving policing quality, ensuring continuity of essential services, and strengthening support systems for vulnerable groups including males.

AB  - Professional development has been recognized as one of the strategies to effectively combat sexual prejudice and negative attitudes against lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning/queer (LGBQ+) individuals and sexual minorities. Nevertheless, studies related to LGBQ+-inclusive training are rarely found in the Chinese Hong Kong context, where sexual prejudice still prevails without the establishment of antidiscrimination law. Sociocultural considerations, such as religious and parental influences, are obstacles to discussing the reduction of sexual prejudices, both within wider society and social work organizations, without institutional support. This paper aims to understand social workers’ perspectives on prejudice reduction training themes and perceived cultural barriers through qualitative in-depth interviews with 67 social workers. Qualitative thematic analysis yielded the following themes: (1) understanding sexuality; (2) initiating training legitimately; (3) contesting religious and cultural assumptions; (4) resolving value and ethical dilemma; (5) selecting relevant knowledge; (6) implementing diverse training strategies. The study suggests that social workers and service providers need to understand how sexual prejudice is manifested in Hong Kong through unique cultural forces. LGBQ+-inclusive content, addressing updated concepts and prejudice-free language, should be incorporated into the training curriculum. Intergroup contact, professional reflection, and experiential learning are suggested as training strategies (190). © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - We studied the acculturation processes of Syrian refugees in the Netherlands, based on semi-structured in-depth interviews. The study aims to investigate how Syrian refugees perceive the cultural distance caused by the differences and boundaries between Syrian and Dutch culture; how they cope with the boundaries and prejudice that they perceive; and which acculturation orientations they prefer. The research builds mainly on the framework of Berry's acculturation model. Religion emerges as a prominent issue in the acculturation process and is found to impact acculturation as it is perceived to be a cause of cultural distance, a salient social identity, a bright boundary and a source of prejudice in the host country. Our findings suggest that refugees' religious identity strongly influences their coping strategies and preferred acculturation orientations. Refugees with low/no religious affiliation were more in favour of an assimilation orientation whereas refugees with strong religious identity preferred an integration orientation. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - With the growth in political, ethnic, and religious conflicts across the globe, intolerance is manifested across different societies especially in the context of (forced) migration and refugees. The purpose of this study is to examine intolerance as a complex social problem. Specifically, this research seeks to explore the perceptions and conceptions of (in)tolerance between refugees from Syria and host communities in Lebanon identifying the degree and the different forms in which tolerance and intolerance materialize. This will allow different agents such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policymakers, and relevant authorities to develop adequate interventions to tackle this phenomenon through a social marketing approach and improve (refugee) crisis response plans. The situation has emerged following the Syrian conflict (2011-present) and the arrival of 1.5 million refugees into Lebanon. This number thus constitutes a challenge to both the hosts and the refugees in Lebanon, a small country. A qualitative study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews to investigate the perceptions and conceptions of the target audiences, citizens, refugees, leaders, and NGO staff/volunteers. Results show the existence of a phenomenon of intolerance; its relevant aspects, namely discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes, racism, and scapegoating; and the rise of violence-tension and fear as emerging themes of intolerance manifestations in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Many of the refugees who have recently arrived in Denmark and other European countries are young people. In order to support refugee youth, it is important to understand how institutions and initiatives in the receiving countries may best facilitate their social inclusion. Drawing on the concept of social capital, this article explores school practices supporting refugees through a qualitative case study of a Danish folk high school - an informal residential college for young people. At the school, participant observation, 10 interviews (with school management, four refugee students and four majority ethnic Danish students) as well as two focus groups (with majority ethnic and refugee students, respectively) were carried out. We discuss the school resources that help create a setting in which students and teachers may work collaboratively to support the integration of young refugees, highlighting four key dimensions: (i) intensive instruction in the local language, (ii) a commitment to nurturing positive inter-ethnic relationships, (iii) a sense of collective responsibility and (iv) an inclusive school ethos. We conclude with a discussion on how lessons from our case study can inform a wider conceptualization of a 'refugee-competent school' setting. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The recent anti-immigrant sentiment portrayed through elections, policies, current events and media in the United States should be a concern for localities with regard to the wellbeing of refugees. This exploratory study was in response to the current climate in an attempt to capture how locals perceive refugees and what possible interventions locals believe are occurring to integrate refugees in the community. Semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with 26 members of the community who currently live in the same location as their place of birth. Themes found include participant concerns, sympathy for refugees and community strategies for refugee integration. This study contributes to a more complex depiction of how some community members may perceive refugees in the current national climate of xenophobia, racism and/or nativism. Existing interventions identified by community members in this study indicate what may be working at the local level. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - PURPOSE: This article is part of an ongoing body of investigation examining the experiences of lawyers with diverse and multiple minority identities, with particular focus on lawyers with disabilities; lawyers who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer ("LGBTQ+" as an overarching term); and lawyers with minority identities associated with race and ethnicity, gender, and age. The focus of this article is on discrimination and bias in their workplaces as reported by the lawyers experiencing it. METHODS: We employ survey data from the first phase of this investigation, gathered from the survey responses of 3590 lawyers located across all states in the United States and working in most types and sizes of legal venues. The data were collected between 2018 and 2019, before the 2020 pandemic. We estimate differences across three categories of discrimination reported-subtle-only discrimination, overt-only discrimination, and both subtle and overt discrimination. We estimate the nature and magnitude of associations among individual and organizational variables, and we use multinomial logistic regression to illustrate relative risks of reports of discrimination for intersecting identities. RESULTS: As compared to non-disabled lawyers, lawyers with disabilities show a higher likelihood of reporting both subtle and overt discrimination versus no discrimination. Similarly, lawyers who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer ("LGBQ") show a higher likelihood of reporting both subtle and overtdiscrimination, and subtle-only discrimination, as compared to lawyers who identify as straight/heterosexual. Women lawyers and lawyers of color are more likely to report all three types of discrimination. In general, younger lawyers are more likely to report subtle-only discrimination when compared to older lawyers. Lawyers working at a private firm are less likely to report all types of discrimination, while working for a larger organization is associated with a higher relative risk of reporting subtle-only discrimination versus no discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: The current study represents a next, incremental step for better understanding non-monochromatic and intersectional aspects of individual identity in the legal profession. The findings illustrate that primary individual and multiple minority identities, as identified by disability, sexual orientation, gender, race/ethnicity, and age, are associated with reports of discrimination and bias in the legal workplace.

AB  - Ageist views have typically held that older persons are poor, frail, and resistant to change. One facet of this portrait of the older population has to do with their lower willingness and capability to learn and with their decreased openness to change (Cutler). Many of these ageist views are held by young people, resulting in a bias about the development and designs of different technologies. However, these same views are sometimes shared by older people themselves, resulting in a reluctance to adopt different technologies and the underestimation of their own performance or technology skills (Beckers et al.). In the current work, we analyze the reciprocal relationship between ageist stereotypes and technology, focusing on the implications of negative stereotypes of older people. We emphasize the self-fulfilling prophecy that technology, designed mostly by young people with the youth market in mind, creates prototypes that are more difficult for older people to use and algorithms that often fail to predict the habits, interests, and values of older people (Rosales and Fernández-Ardèvol). We also examine the role of stereotype threat impacting older people’s performance and technology adoption; for example, situation-specific anxiety when older people face younger adults who present greater digital skills (Ivan and Schiau). © university of toronto press

AB  - The positive role of religion in reducing prejudice has remained a neglected theme in Psychology of religion, concerning itself mostly with prejudice and fundamentalism. Recently, noting the absence of a positive antithesis to prejudice and fundamentalism, faith development theory presents xenosophia as going beyond mere tolerance to a creative engagement with other religious faiths to develop new insights and broaden one’s own worldview. The current research undertakes a study of Muslim faith contents to get insights into how these beliefs shape construction of self in relation to other faith communities. Conducting inductive thematic analysis of faith development interviews from 12 Muslim participants from three major religious affiliations in Pakistan (equally divided for gender and ages ranging from 31 to 76 years) in an earlier research, the research analyzes a range of xenological patterns from xenophobia to xenosophia with associated potentials for inter-faith dialogue. Focusing on residents of a country with a dense Muslim population, the study carries implications for religious socialization and religious education in a globalized world. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Social Identity Theory (SIT) is commonly applied to explain social change. We aim to revive interest in the concept of social creativity in order to provide a SIT perspective on bolstering and challenging social stability. Social creativity allows people to maintain or achieve a positive social identity through re-interpreting intergroup relations. Despite this crucial role in shaping intergroup comparisons, the causes and effects of social creativity are largely unknown. To understand how social creativity can contribute to social stability, we argue for a return to SIT's dynamic nature of constantly renegotiating intergroup relations, involving both higher- and lower-status groups. Within these dynamics, we propose that social creativity can play the roles of coping with, promoting, and questioning social stability. Additionally, we outline a research agenda for future research on social creativity and discuss the impact that social stability can have in societies. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In Ireland, negative stereotypes of the Traveller population have long been a part of society. The beliefs that surround this minority group may not be based in fact, yet negative views persist such that Travellers find themselves excluded from mainstream society. The language used in discourse plays a critical role in the way Travellers are represented. This study analyses the discourse in the public policy regarding Travellers in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) 2017–2021. This study performs a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of the policy with the overall aims of showing signs of the power imbalance through the use of language and revealing the discourses used by elite actors to retain power and sustain existing social relations. The key findings show that Travellers are represented as a homogenous group that exists outside of society. They have no control over how their social identity is constructed. The results show that the constructions of negative stereotypes are intertextually linked to previous policies, and the current policy portrays them in the role of passive patients, not powerful actors. The discursive practice creates polarity between the “settled” population and the “Travellers”, who are implicitly blamed by the state for their disadvantages. Through the policy, the government disseminates expert knowledge, which legitimises the inequality and supports this objective “truth”. This dominant discourse, which manifests in wider social practice, can facilitate racism and social exclusion. This study highlights the need for Irish society to change the narrative to support an equitable representation of Travellers. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The Theses deal with the theoretical foundations and methodological implications for scholarly research that arise from the development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into society's daily life. The reader is introduced to age-old intellectual debates about AI and recent research concerning human-centered AI, artificial sociality (AS), and online culture. The paper presents the working definition of AI. It claims that AI has to be examined in relation to AS. The paper argues that the human-machine-interdependence is a new reality of artificial sociality. It envisages AI research as multidisciplinary and potentially a-disciplinary scientific activity. The questions the Theses raise: What should we be concerned about as artificial intelligence advances? Can AI technologies solve modern society's problems and bring human beings to a new level of community and well-being? Are there 'no-AI areas' in society? Do human biases and prejudices influence AI technologies? The paper's essential assertion is that the challenges posed by AI technologies and AS should be addressed apropos three P's of the capitalist society: private property, profit, price. © 2021 Russian Public Opinion Research Center, VCIOM.

AB  - The development of social robots has the potential to address significant societal concerns, however, most people have limited experience of such technology. The present research investigated whether techniques borrowed from the psychology of intergroup relations – namely direct and extended contact – affect people's attitudes towards robots. Participants were provided with either direct contact with a social robot or extended contact (these participants watched a video recorded by a friend who had met the robot) before their explicit and implicit attitudes towards robots were measured. Results indicated that direct contact affected both explicit and implicit attitudes, while extended contact affected implicit attitudes. The implication of these findings is that contact with a robot, direct or indirect, can change attitudes; much as previous research has shown that contact with a person who is a member of an out-group can change attitudes towards that group. We conclude that methods and theories from the study of human intergroup relationships can be usefully applied to understand attitudes toward social robots. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - This article provides a contextual analysis of Janakaraliya ('Theatre of the People'), a theatre company acclaimed for its excellence in theatre for social justice and peace building in Sri Lanka. It discusses the governing conditions that enable its practice and evaluates its impact, whether this be the biopower of the state and non-state actors during periods of political violence, donor funding frameworks, or the Janakaraliya archive itself as an actant shaped by donor rationalities. Drawing on a recent research project entitled The Theatre of Reconciliation, the article builds an argument for changing the terms on which the arts in peace building are evaluated, and for a shift in the dominant narrative on Janakaraliya which collapses its sophisticated aesthetics to a binary of Sinhala-Tamil ethnic relations. The logic of this revision would be fuller acknowledgement of the troupe's aesthetic forms and styles as a more robust signifier of the pluralities that constitute Sri Lankan society today and therefore of post-war reconciliation itself. © 2021 International Federation for Theatre Research.

AB  - The Afro-Hispanic creole, Palenquero, has been spoken (together with Spanish) in the village of San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia, for centuries. Until recently, Palenquero was endangered due to prejudice, but language revitalization efforts are underway, and younger speakers are learning Palenquero, but with little reinforcement out of school. The school instruction involves no grammatical explanations, almost no student production, or critical feedback. Adult speakers usually do not address younger speakers in Palenquero, thus leaving school-acquired forms suspended with-out reinforcement. This represents a unique scenario of heritage acquisition of a language with no bidirectional communication between younger and adult speakers. The present study focuses on the use of preverbal particles and prenominal plural marker by heritage speakers of Palenquero before and after explicit instruction. Communication activities explicitly presented the prenominal plural ma and preverbal particles, such as zero morpheme (simple present), asé (habitual), ta (progressive), a (perfective/simple past) and tan (future). Participants performed better at the post-test and results suggest that explicit explanation of grammatical rules, practice, repetition, and corrective feedback improved the usage of ma and tan. This result lines up with previous studies that posit the amount of time and exposure that learners need in order to acquire complex morphology. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Patients and families each present unique microcultures, mixing and blending numerous broadly conceptualized cultural identity groups. Within individuals and families, cultural identities are experienced and enacted as complex matrices of intersecting identities that, to varying degrees, complement, assimilate, accommodate, or clash. In these patterns, individuals' relationships to cultures are not necessarily categorically distinct ("multicultural"). Instead, they are often "polycultural," defined as partial and plural; rather than interpreting different cultural traditions as separate and independent, they are, within the lives of individuals and families, better understood as systems that interact with and influence one another.Cultural identity groups extend beyond those traditionally considered by transcultural psychiatry-that is, beyond ethnic, racial, and language groups. They encompass (in alphabetical order) educational, ethnic, extended family, gender-oriented, generational, geographic, language and dialect, organizational, physical or psychiatric disability, political, professional, racial, religious, sect, social class, and vocational identity groups, among others. Simplistic assumptions and generalities about identity groups risk cultural stereotyping that may negatively bias clinical assessments. Therefore, practitioners striving for cultural sensitivity need to adopt nuanced strategies for approaching broad polycultural identity questions in clinical practice. Accordingly, this article suggests frameworks and strategies for (1) assessing and confronting one's own cultural preconceptions and prejudices, and (2) developing etic (objective quantitative data) and emic (insiders' experiential worldviews) perspectives pertinent to clinical anthropathology. Both etic and emic perspectives are necessary for polyculturally nuanced, respectful, comprehensive inquiries pertinent to patients' and family's health beliefs, psychiatric difficulties, and health practices. Supplementary material from the DSM-5 section on cultural formulation is adapted and discussed, along with the implications of polycultural psychiatry for education and training in psychiatry.

AB  - Background Caste plays a significant role in Indian society and it influences women to health care access in the community. The implementation of the maternal health benefits scheme in India is biased due to caste identity. In this context, the paper investigates access to Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) among social groups to establish that caste still plays a pivotal role in Indian society. Also, this paper aims to quantify the discrimination against Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (SCs/STs) in accessing JSY. Methods This paper uses a national-level data set of both NFHS-3 (2005–06) and NFHS-4 (2015–16). Both descriptive statistics and the Fairlie decomposition econometric model have been used to measure the explained and unexplained differences in access to JSY between SCs/ STs and non-SCs/STs groups. Results Overall, the total coverage of JSY in India is still, 36.4%. Further, it is found that 72% of access to JSY is explained by endowment variables. The remaining unexplained percentage (28%) indicates that there is caste discrimination (inequity associated social-discrimination) against SCs/STs in access to JSY. The highest difference (54%) between SCs/STs and non-SCs/STs in access to JSY comes from the wealth quintile, with the positive sign indicating that the gap between the two social groups is widening. Discussion and conclusion It is necessary for the government to implement a better way to counter the caste-based discrimination in access to maternal health benefits scheme. In this regard, ASHA and Anganwadi workers must be trained to reduce the influence of dominant caste groups as well as they must be recruited from the same community to identify the right beneficiaries of JSY and in order to reduce inequity associated with social-discrimination.

AB  - We investigated whether collective narcissism (i.e., believing that the in-group is exceptional but insufficiently recognized by others) and in-group satisfaction (i.e., believing that the ingroup is a source of satisfaction) have opposite, unique associations with intergroup aggression via belief in the hedonistic function of revenge (i.e., an expectation of emotional reward from harming others in response to feeling oneself harmed). Results of two studies conducted in Poland (N = 675) found that collective narcissism is positively related to belief in the hedonistic function of revenge, whereas in-group satisfaction is negatively related, and both are related to intergroup aggression. These relationships were found only when the overlap between collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction was partialled out. The results shed a new light on the mechanisms linking in-group positivity to out-group derogation, and highlight the importance of investigating revenge motivations in the intergroup relations. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

AB  - In a prior publication, I used structural equation modeling of multimethod data to examine the construct validity of Implicit Association Tests. The results showed no evidence that IATs measure implicit constructs (e.g., implicit self-esteem, implicit racial bias). This critique of IATs elicited several responses by implicit social-cognition researchers, who tried to defend the validity and usefulness of IATs. I carefully examine these arguments and show that they lack validity. IAT proponents consistently ignore or misrepresent facts that challenge the validity of IATs as measures of individual differences in implicit cognitions. One response suggests that IATs can be useful even if they merely measure the same constructs as self-report measures, but I find no support for the claim that IATs have practically significant incremental predictive validity. In conclusions, IATs are widely used without psychometric evidence of construct or predictive validity. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Sensory analysis is unusual in sustainability research, although it can offer a neoteric aspect of nature and wild animals’ perception. The study’s objective was to identify consumers’ attitudes towards plant and animal products from wild and conventional foods and put these findings into a broader social context. A blind sensory evaluation with 80 semi-trained assessors was used, segmented by gender, age, education, income, place of origin, family status, number of children, and willingness to pay. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was chosen as an example of an overpopulated animal species occurring in the wild, which could be considered a partial substitute for pork. Statistical testing in these blind evaluations proved that wild boar meat is not considered less tasty. Therefore, wild boar meat could represent a partial substitute, complementing pork, on which consumers are willing to spend the same amount of money. Despite the mostly indifferent sensory evaluation, focus group responses showed considerable barriers to wild food. This paper concludes that possible educational and popularizing procedures are presented, including forest pedagogy, eliminating consumers’ prejudices. A mixed-methods approach within quantitative and qualitative methodology was chosen. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Intergroup contact research has expanded exponentially in the last few decades, with researchers employing a widening range of methods to offer new insights into the effects of both positive and negative contact experiences. In this commentary, we discuss the contributions of three papers to this special issue of the Journal of Social Issues on advances in intergroup contact research, namely Schäfer et al.’s (2021) review of research on negative intergroup contact experiences, Hässler et al.’s (2020) review of research on intergroup contact and social change, and O'Donnell et al.’s (2021) review of technological and analytic advances in contact research. Having outlined the key arguments of each paper, we then offer some theoretical and methodological reflections, also discussing potential gaps, connections, opportunities, and future directions along the way. We end by reflecting on a common theme that permeates our commentary: the need to contextualize adequately the dynamics of intergroup contact across a range of everyday settings. Here we argue that to fully understand how to promote beneficial forms of intergroup contact, we need to consider more carefully how contact is experienced, enacted, and evaluated “on the ground” by participants themselves. This requires work of both theoretical and methodological innovation. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This article presents the 2021 JSI special issue on intergroup contact, which we designed to offer a fresh outlook on a rapidly expanding literature on the antecedents, dynamics, and consequences of interactions between members of opposing groups in society—or intergroup contact. We start by discussing the results of a bibliographic search of intergroup contact research between 1937 and 2021 and organizing our analysis around two distinct phases of this research, as they are demarcated in volume and quality by Pettigrew and Tropp's landmark meta-analysis in 2006. We then turn our attention to an overview of the 12 review and commentary articles contributing to the special issue, which reflect advancements in themes, methodologies, and analytics of the last 15 years of research. We argue that this second generation of research has effectively addressed influential and legitimate critiques of the literature and, as a result, led to a more complex and nuanced understanding of intergroup contact that can now be readily harnessed by social cohesion practitioners and policy makers to increase the efficacy of contact-based interventions in society. We conclude by calling on a third generation of research on intergroup contact that fully harnesses diversity of ideas, peoples, and minds and keeps in close check unproductive dynamics that stifle scientific progress, and pose a threat to healthy and safe research communities. Together with the 50 diverse contributors of this special issue, we commit to making the intergroup contact research community, like the topic of intergroup contact itself, diverse and inclusive. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - This paper, which is authored by members of the Japanese Association of Family Therapy (JAFT), describes the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan from a family systems perspective. The authors are active members of JAFT and include current and past presidents and officers. We describe the course of the pandemic and the ways in which government policies to mitigate the pandemic have affected Japanese families. Challenges that affect Japanese families include the inability to participate in family and social rituals, prescribed gender roles that specifically affect women, high suicide rates, and prejudice against those who are at risk of spreading the infection. The need to shelter in place has also forced family homes to function as a workplace for parents, classrooms for children, and day care services for frail elders, which has resulted in psychological distress among individuals and conflicts among families. We discuss ways that therapists have worked with Japanese families using online therapy. © 2021 Australian Association of Family Therapy

AB  - Concerns about intergroup contact have a long and somewhat tortuous history. Shaped largely by Social Darwinism dogma, early theorizing anticipated negative effects. Following World War II, however, a more optimistic view took hold, and social psychological research began to study the phenomenon. Allport's (1954) influential book, the Nature of Prejudice, focused social psychological attention on intergroup contact and shaped research on it for the rest of the 20th century. Now the domain has developed into a complex and intricate theory, complete with multiple forms of contact and numerous moderating and mediating variables—as demonstrated in the articles throughout this JSI issue. Within this historical context of the theory's development, this article then comments on each of the previous articles and their further advances to the theory. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Conversations about digital inequality in education often revolve around access to technology. However, research into youth culture has shown that many Black and Latinx teens are able to access technology and have developed the same digital skills as their white peers. Social scientist Matt Rafalow observed three California middle schools where students had similar levels of access to digital technologies despite being from different racial and class backgrounds and found that teachers perceived students’ technological abilities differently. Wealthy white students’ digital play was seen as essential to learning, while Asian American and Latinx students’ skills were seen as either a threat to their learning or irrelevant to it. Addressing digital inequality will require schools to also address the racial and class prejudice that leads teachers to view students’ abilities differently. © 2021 by Phi Delta Kappa International.

AB  - W. E. B. Du Bois often appropriated and deployed the metaphor of “Prometheus,” drawing from Hesiod’s Theogony, Aeschylus’s Prometheus Bound, Goethe’s poem “Prometheus,” and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Throughout Du Bois’s career, he employed this figure in order for the reader to better understand the racialized social order in general and White supremacy in specific. In what follows, I cover the eighteenth and nineteenth century use of the Prometheus metaphor in regard to critiques of racism and slavery. I then establish how Du Bois stepped into this tradition to advance a multifaceted critique of global White supremacy that continues to resonate today. Precisely, Du Bois rendered this character in six patterned forms: (1) as an embodiment of de jure and de facto segregation; (2) as newly conscious Black people that would soon revolt against White supremacy; (3) as the paradoxical capture and harm of White people by their own design; (4) as the prejudice, discrimination, and racism born of White supremacist politics; (5) as the struggle of Black folks against White supremacy; and (6) a Black-centered spiritual worldview of eventual liberation. Together, these six deployments signal the early manifestations of both critical race theory and Afrofuturism—two modes of inquiry that help us to reconsider not only the material repercussions of racial inequality but the pathways and roadblocks toward racial utopia. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recent studies have indicated a positive association between patriotism and environmentalism; however, the correlation between them has not yet been quantitatively verified. Additionally, differences in “good” versus “blind” patriotism have been ignored in environmental behavior studies; thus, theoretical concepts related to their effects on environmentalism have not been empirically tested. The present study aims to reveal the effects of good patriotism and social consideration on pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and the mediating effect of social consideration on the relationship between patriotism and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, while removing national or political prejudice or ideology from the measurement of patriotism. Data collected using a self-report questionnaire were analyzed for Chinese university students and workers. Results of multiple hierarchical linear regression analysis of five pro-environmental attitudes/behaviors estimation models showed that patriotism was correlated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and this correlation was completely mediated by individual social consideration, which was strongly and positively correlated with both patriotism and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Our findings show that patriotism encourages people to focus on societal structures and environmental problems. The effect of good patriotism on individual pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors is clearly different from that of blind nationalism, as shown in previous literature. The present study highlights implications for future policy-making and education on patriotism and environmentalism in China. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Intergroup relations in settler societies have been defined by historical conflict over territorial ownership between indigenous peoples and settler majorities. However, the indigenous groups were there first, and first arrival is an important principle for assigning ownership to a group. In two studies among Australians of Anglo-Celtic origin (N = 322 and N = 475), we argued and found that the general belief in entitlements for first comers (i.e. autochthony) is related to more support for reparations in terms of apology and instrumental compensation for Aborigines, as well as to less topic avoidance. We further proposed that the group-based emotions of collective guilt, moral shame and image shame account for these associations. We found that majority members who endorsed autochthony belief experienced more guilt (Study 1 and 2), moral shame (Study2) and image shame (Study 2). In turn, guilt and moral shame were related to more support for reparations and less topic avoidance, whereas image shame was related to more topic avoidance, thereby partially suppressing the negative association between autochthony belief and topic avoidance. Our research points at the importance of considering autochthony belief and different types of moral emotions in research on past transgressions and current attempts to restore social justice for indigenous peoples. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The modes of intergroup contact, both direct and indirect, have become a focal point for the contact literature over the past decade or more. As part of our developing understanding of when and why certain types of contact improve intergroup relations, this paper examines some theoretical concepts useful for organizing modes of contact, building on previous schemes in the literature. It explores the idea that experiences in one type of contact generalize to other modes of contact. It then considers the degree to which individuals have choice about which mode of contact to use, and indeed whether they have choice about having contact at all, as well as whether such choices are associated with the valence of the contact. These ideas are developed into a model of flexibility in if and how to engage in contact, including the positive and negative consequences thereof. The model contributes to the literature's ability to consider both whether contact occurs and how it happens in a single framework. The paper considers whether societal inequality is reflected in the kinds of contact choices available to those with privilege and those without. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Intergroup contact is an established pathway to improve intergroup relations. Research has long focused on mainly positive intergroup contact and its capability to improve intergroup relations. Yet, if members of different groups meet, they will not only make positive, but possibly also negative intergroup contact experiences. Recent research considering both positive as well as negative intergroup contact has raised concerns about potentially stronger effects of negative compared to positive contact. These new insights and the increasing awareness of potentially detrimental effects of contact could lead to doubts about whether it is always sensible to bring individuals from different groups together. Our article first updates the latest review on joint effects of positive and negative intergroup contact. We find that there is no clear tendency for either positive or negative intergroup contact to yield stronger effects on intergroup relations, and we portray factors that might influence these effects. Such factors—for example an individual's prior experiences—could play a crucial role in defining the relevance of negative contact in everyday settings. We continue by answering calls to increase a more qualitative understanding of what kinds of experiences are seen to be intergroup contact, and where intergroup contact in everyday life is experienced from a lay understanding, with new qualitative data from British White and British Asian individuals. Our results demonstrate that positive as well as negative contact is often rather casual and happens in public spaces and at work. Interventions explicitly addressing these spaces may help to reach more people. We also demonstrate that positive contact is much more frequent than negative contact. This finding is confirmed in the third section, which reviews the relative frequency of positive and negative intergroup contact. Last but not least, we discuss the implications of our review for practitioners and researchers alike. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Stereotype threat theory suggests that negative stereotypes and devaluing content in the media impair the cognitive and educational achievement of members of the negatively portrayed groups (e.g., Latino Americans, women), whereas nonstereotyped recipients are not affected or even show reversed effects (stereotype lift). A meta-analysis of 33 experiments (n = 1,831) yielded an overall mean effect size of d = −0.38 (random effects model) in support of the stereotype threat assumption. The results further involve a check on publication bias and moderator analyses with respect to the portrayed group, the dependent variable (academic identification vs. performance), the media format (ads vs. news vs. entertainment), and the world region in which the study was conducted. A second meta-analysis on the stereotype lift hypothesis yielded an overall mean effect size of d = 0.17 (k = 12, n = 589, nonsignificant, random effects model). Our meta-analytical findings are in support of stereotype threat theory, indicating that negative stereotypes and devaluing content in the media impair members of negatively stereotyped groups, whereas nonmembers are not affected. Implications and open research questions are outlined. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Numerous attempts to improve diversity by way of changing the hearts of decision makers have fallen short of the desired outcome. One underappreciated factor that contributes to bias resides not in decision makers’ hearts, but instead in their minds. People possess images, or mental representations, for specific roles and professions. Which mental image or representation springs spontaneously to mind depends on the current status quo within a field. Whether or not an individual or groups’ appearance matches visual stereotypes results in perceptually mediated preferences and prejudices, both of which harbor pernicious assumptions about who belongs in a professional setting and why. Leveraging these scientific insights can enact change. Shifting visible exemplars can change people’s mental representations and their heart’s evaluative reactions to others. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: The objective of the current study is to investigate whether an area-level measure of racial sentiment derived from Twitter data is associated with state-level hate crimes and existing measures of racial prejudice at the individual-level. Methods: We collected 30,977,757 tweets from June 2015–July 2018 containing at least one keyword pertaining to specific groups (Asians, Arabs, Blacks, Latinos, Whites). We characterized sentiment of each tweet (negative vs all other) and averaged at the state-level. These racial sentiment measures were merged with other measures based on: hate crime data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program; implicit and explicit racial bias indicators from Project Implicit; and racial attitudes questions from General Social Survey (GSS). Results: Living in a state with 10% higher negative sentiment in tweets referencing Blacks was associated with 0.57 times the odds of endorsing a GSS question that Black-White disparities in jobs, income, and housing were due to discrimination (95% CI: 0.40, 0.83); 1.64 times the odds of endorsing the belief that disparities were due to lack to will (95% CI: 0.95, 2.84); higher explicit racial bias (β: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.18); and higher implicit racial bias (β: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.14). Twitter-expressed racial sentiment was not statistically-significantly associated with incidence of state-level hate crimes against Blacks (IRR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.90), but this analysis was likely underpowered due to rarity of reported hate crimes. Conclusion: Leveraging timely data sources for measuring area-level racial sentiment can provide new opportunities for investigating the impact of racial bias on society and health. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Objectives: The ‘Black Lives Matter’ (BLM) movement in 2020 exemplifies efforts to counter prejudices and the colourist narrative. Harmful use of topical skin lightening agents continues worldwide despite interdiction or restricted use under domestic, European and international regulations. Study design: Commentary. Methods: Narrative review. Results: In this Short Communication, we consider the significance of societal perspectives of skin colour, glocalized whiteness, efforts to attain self-esteem and social mobility through skin lightening practices, and the role of cosmetic products in fuelling this phenomenon. Conclusions: Addressing the inadvertent (or indeed conscious) vehicles of systematic racism and sustaining of skin colour prejudices and stereotypes of fair skin beauty by cosmetic companies is warranted. Targeted health messaging is an imperative. © 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic medical students in different countries were mobilized to support healthcare systems during the emergency. This study presents the experience of 580 students of a single medical university in Poland who served as volunteers at different healthcare units during the first six months of the first case being recorded in the country (March–September 2020). The mean ± SD hours and days spent on volunteering in the studied group were 52 ± 36 h and 144 ± 126 d, respectively, the collective number of worked hours amounted to 83,460 h. Compared to other fields of study students of medicine engaged in volunteering for more hours and for more days. The main tasks performed by the surveyed group included triage, servicing call-centers for patients and working at the admission ward, hospital clinics, emergency departments and diagnostic labs. The level of fear at the beginning of volunteering was relatively low in the studied group and did not increase over the course. The majority of students received positive feedback from families, friends, patients and healthcare workers, revealed a high level of satisfaction from volunteering (also when experiencing COVID-19-related prejudice), while gaining professional experience and a sense of giving real aid were among the most frequently indicated benefits. The results of the present study demonstrate that although medical students are not essential workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, they can be of real assistance to healthcare systems during times of emergency, and should be considered as such in the future in case such a need arises again. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Intergroup contact is one of the most promising and effective strategies for reducing prejudice. Importantly, intergroup contact not only improves attitudes towards an encountered outgroup member but also to the outgroup as a whole (i.e., primary transfer effects), to other outgroups (i.e., secondary transfer effects), and even enhances cognitive functioning beyond intergroup relations (i.e., tertiary transfer effect). In this article, we first review the recent developments on primary, secondary, and tertiary contact generalization. We then summarize mechanisms that underlie and condition each of these generalizations. Third, we highlight key critiques against the contact literature identifying avenues for future research on generalization processes. Lastly, we underline the policy value of research on generalization effects. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - This mixed-methods study examined the experiences of belonging/otherness among Arab teachers in Israel. A group of boundary-crossing teachers: Arab teachers in Jewish schools (AJ; N = 57) was compared with Arab teachers teaching in their own community (AA; N = 103). We found that the AJ group had a multicultural orientation, unlike the AA group, who were community-orientated. These orientations are reflected in different otherness sources, different motivations for selecting a workplace, and differences in identity ratings. While professional and social sources promoted teachers’ sense of belonging in the two groups, the source of AJs' sense of otherness was the national divide as opposed to community-oriented aspects in AAs. Selfefficacy ratings were high in both groups with a significant advantage for AJs, an unanticipated finding given that most of them were women, had attended teacher training colleges rather than universities, and were rarely homeroom teachers. Arab teachers' involvement in Jewish schools was partial with a low proportion of classroom educators or teachers in managerial roles. AJs tend to leave their national identity outside the school, and are not involved in political discourse or in the staffroom power relations. The phenomenon of integrating AJs is relatively new, and within a segregated education system that limits the opportunities for Jews and Arabs to meet, it can provide a viable, albeit limited, tool to inhibit prejudice and antagonism between Jews and Arabs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the wake of the global refugee crisis, children are exposed to negative attitudes from public and private spheres. Previous research has identified family, peer, and school norms as significant predictors of children's inter-ethnic attitudes. We extend this literature by examining normative influence from wider society, which has received substantially less attention. Among 266 children (Mage = 11.24), this study investigates the relative contributions of norms from five ingroups (family, class-peers, Irish, religious and all-humanity) to predict children's anti-refugee bias. Perceptions of positive family and religious norms were the strongest unique predictors of contact intentions and warmth towards refugees. Intergroup anxiety and perceived threat mediated these relationships. Social dominance orientation mediated family normative influence only. These findings highlight the importance of broader groups (beyond that of proximal ingroups) for understanding children's intergroup attitudes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, a multitude of intergenerational contact programmes and interventions has emerged to counteract ageism among young adults. Research on these programmes and its supposed effect on ageism often start from the assumption that intergenerational contact follows a largely linear process in which a high level of encounters, in the right setting, decreases ageism and negative stereotyping. The purpose of this article is to critically examine this assumption by focussing on the underlying process of intergenerational contact, rather than examining the positive or negative outcome. Using in-depth interviews with 35 young adults, we found that although conditions and mediating factors during the contact do play a role in the outcome of intergroup contact, the process of contact is rather varied and does not follow a linear path. The results reveal that whether or not a positive contact experience translates into a changed group image of older people is related to the positioning of such experience within the young adults' personal frame of reference. We found that this has to do with the young adults having diverse and both positive and negative previous experiences, their grandparent-grandchild relationship, stories from others and personal characteristics. With this study, we point to the complexity of intergenerational contact and highlight potential pathways leading to varying group images of ‘the old’. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze by immigrants’ characteristics their participation in and social integration performance on the Korea Immigration and Integration Program (KIIP), which the Korean government provides for education in Korean language and basic knowledge about Korea to support the social integration of immigrants; on that basis, it suggests policy implications. For this purpose, I surveyed 1,014 immigrants, including 800 participants and 214 non-participants of the KIIP; among these individuals, 46.1 % had experienced discrimination. There were several reasons they felt they had been discriminated against; general prejudice against immigrants in South Korea and lack of Korean language ability were the most common. The immigrants who participated in KIIP included several groups: visiting relatives, those who had moved to be with their families, immigrants living in Seoul, Vietnamese people, non-Korean spouses, longer-term non-Korean residents, and non-Han Chinese individuals. Those immigrants who participated in KIIP showed a high degree of adaptability to Korean culture. Korean language proficiency, a key output of KIIP, was the most important factor in improving immigrants’ cultural adaptation, sense of societal belonging, and economic conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consistent with the intergroup contact literature, cross-political relationships (e.g., friendships or romantic relationships between different partisans) may help reduce inter-political group prejudice. Given that unfavorable attitudes based on the political group membership are particularly heightened at present in the United States, we explored whether having cross-political friendships (Study 1) or romantic relationships (Study 2) predict more positive interpersonal or intergroup attitudes among American Democrats and Republicans. In Study 1, using a social network measure (N = 301), where participants reported on their closest friends, cross-political (versus same-political) friendship was associated with less positive interpersonal attitudes when this relationship was unsatisfying. Having any (versus no) or more (versus less) cross-political group friendships was not associated with holding more positive intergroup attitudes. In Study 2, cross-political romantic relationships were examined (N = 392). Having a cross- (versus same-) political romantic relationship was associated with relatively less positive attitudes toward the political outgroup via lower empathy when relationship satisfaction was low. Study findings highlight the potential limitations of the beneficial effects of intergroup contact. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Recent research has begun to explore the experiences of Christian undergraduates and faculty in biology to illuminate reasons for their underrepresentation. In this study, we focused on the experiences of graduate students and explored Christianity as a concealable stigmatized identity (CSI) in the biology community. We constructed interview questions using this CSI framework, which originates in social psychology, to research the experiences of those with stigmatized identities that could be hidden. We analyzed interviews from 33 Christian graduate students who were enrolled in biology programs and found that many Christian graduate students believe the biology community holds strong negative stereotypes against Christians and worry those negative stereotypes will be applied to them as individuals. We found that students conceal their Christian identities to avoid negative stereotypes and reveal their identities to counteract negative stereotypes. Despite these experiences, students recognize their value as boundary spanners between the majority secular scientific community and majority Christian public. Finally, we found that Christian students report that other identities they have, including ethnicity, gender, nationality, and LGBTQ+ identities, can either increase or decrease the relevance of their Christian identities within the biology community. © 2021 The American Society for Cell Biology.

AB  - This article explores prejudicial and racist discourse in reader comments in internet news discussion forums. Based on data from an online debate among Czech commenters on the mainstream iDnes.cz news site, it seeks to contribute to the existing critical linguistic approaches to discursive strategies of othering. Analysing user comments referencing a news article on a sensitive social topic, namely the complicated reception of Central European Roma immigrants in the UK, the paper focuses on three salient themes found in the data: (a) the re-education of the ethnic minority; (b) the users’ perception of the media as politically correct and siding with the outgroup; and (c) the outgroup’s negative stereotype associating it with criminality. The paper argues that the discourse on these topics simultaneously relies on and reinforces the negative stereotype of the ethnic group, while revealing a complicated relationship between three stakeholders: the ingroup, represented by the commenters; the outgroup, made up of members of the ethnic groups; and the media, as representatives of the authorities and the elites. The findings reveal how quasi-humorous comments that involve such stereotypical representations contribute to the normalization of everyday racism against ethnic outgroups.1. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: People with intellectual disability (ID) are often socially isolated, and many experience stigma and discrimination. Increased contact with the general public is thought to overcome prejudices. This large-scale international study had three main aims: to determine the type and frequency of contact that the general public has with people with ID; to identify the personal characteristics of those who have greater contact; and to examine the public's level of comfort at the prospect of having contact with people with ID. Method: Self-completed online questionnaires were administered to nationally representative panels of respondents in 17 countries; totally 24 504 persons. Multivariate analyses were used to identify respondents more likely to have had frequent personal contact with persons with ID from those with infrequent or no contact and those respondents who were most comfortable at meeting a person with ID. Results: Internationally around one in four of the general population reports having frequent personal contact with people who have an ID although this varied from 7% in Japan to 46% in Panama. The principal forms of contact were through friendships, neighbours or extended family members. Over all countries, volunteering and engagement with Special Olympics were the two main predictors of frequent personal contact followed by employment in the education, health or social care field, being a parent of children under 18 years, playing sports and being employed. People who reported frequent personal contact were also more comfortable at meeting a person with ID. Conclusions: This international dataset provides a baseline against which public contact can be compared across countries and changes monitored over time. The findings suggest ways in which greater contact can be promoted and making the public more comfortable at meeting people with ID. © 2021 The Authors.

We adopted an experimental design with two treatment groups (Hypothetical target vs. Real target) and one control group (no intervention), one pretest and two posttest measures. Participants, who were 437 students aged 11–17 years (M = 14.28; SD = 1.17), were randomly assigned to the various conditions on a classroom basis. Perspective-taking was facilitated asking participants to travel in a wheelchair on a path that simulated a real pavement in the presence (or not) of an individual with a motor disability. Findings showed that perspective-taking in the presence of a real target was more effective in reducing prejudice toward people with disabilities than perspective-taking task without encountering an outgroup member. Perspective-taking with a hypothetical target was not sufficient to increase participants' empathy toward people with disabilities, which instead was enhanced when the task was performed at the presence of a real member of that group. Positive effects produced by perspective-taking (with both a hypothetical and a real target) were transferred to immigrants and homosexuals. These findings suggest that, when possible, perspective-taking in the presence of the target, which can improve empathy by favoring a two-way exchange process, is highly recommended to improve attitudes toward different stigmatized groups, not necessarily targeted by the intervention. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - In recent years—particularly since the beginning of the refugee crisis in 2015—the political debate about issues of Islamophobia and resentment of Muslims has gained new momentum. Our research contributes to the growing experimental literature focusing on these phenomena. Unlike most previous empirical investigations, the present study does not examine “large scale” discrimination against Muslim minorities in situations which occur only periodically throughout an individual's life (e.g., on the rental-, labor-, or partner market); rather, it sheds light on (minor) discrimination events that occur on a day-to-day basis. Such “everyday discrimination” has been shown to be particularly detrimental to physical and psychological health. Specifically, our research examines the effect of open displays of religious identification—wearing a Muslim headscarf—on everyday discrimination against female Muslims. We report the results of two natural field experiments in Switzerland designed to examine such forms of day-to-day discrimination. Study 1 focuses on differential sanctioning, whereas study 2 investigates differences regarding helping behavior. We found pronounced discrimination against women wearing a headscarf in two distinctly different types of everyday interactions. In both scenarios, headscarf-wearing confederates were treated less favorably than bare-headed ones: they were sanctioned more often for violating the “stand right, walk left”-norm on escalators and received less help when asking for a favor (borrowing a mobile phone for an urgent call). © 2021 London School of Economics and Political Science

AB  - This paper discusses the ethical implications of racism and some of the various costs associated with racism occurring at the institutional level. We argue that, in many ways, the laws, social structures, and institutions in Western society have operated to perpetuate the continuation of historical legacies of racial inequities with or without the intention of individuals and groups in society. By merely maintaining existing structures, laws, and social norms, society can impose social, economic, and health costs on racial minorities that impinge on their well-being and human dignity. Based on a review of multidisciplinary research on racism, particularly focusing on healthcare, we demonstrate how institutional racism leads to social and economic inequalities in society. By positing institutional racism as the inherent cause of avoidable disparities in healthcare, this paper draws attention to the ethical significance of racism, which remains a relatively neglected issue in bioethics research. © 2021, Journal of Bioethical Inquiry Pty Ltd.

AB  - Structural prejudices and unconscious biases within the construction industry have negatively impacted the construction workforce. Workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion are major concerns in the construction industry. The goal of the present study is to enable the assessment of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry by identifying and determining the level of influence of applicable indicators revealing diversity, equity, and inclusion at the workforce level. A two-round survey and a panel of 16 experts were utilized to achieve the research goal. After collecting and analyzing the responses, 10 indicators were found to be influential in terms of achieving a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment and were therefore considered measures of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion. These indicators are (1) ethnic and racial diversity at the company level; (2) gender diversity and inclusion at the workforce level; (3) a corporate policy statement on diversity and inclusion; (4) gender/ethnic diversity in leadership/management positions; (5) knowledge and skill diversity; (6) equitable pay/compensation at the industry level; (7) equality, social justice, and nondiscrimination policy statement; (8) pay structure transparency; (9) equitable pay/compensation at the company level; and (10) merit-based transparent recruitment and promotion. The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a means of assessing workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry. It is expected that utilizing the identified indicators would help managers and human resources specialists/professionals in construction perform a thorough assessment of the level of diversity, equity, and inclusiveness of the workforce within their organizations and identify opportunities for enhancing the workforce diversity, equity, and inclusiveness. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Previous studies have examined the link between creativity and stereotyping, with most reports indicating that encouraging stereotype-confronting thinking can foster creativity. We hypothesized that encouraging creative thinking can also influence intergroup relations. In two experiments with adolescents, we tested whether creative imagination (N = 211) and divergent thinking (N = 317) had an impact on prejudice. We found that stimulating creative thinking elicited lower social distance toward minority groups (Experiments 1 and 2) and higher general tolerance (Experiment 2). In Experiment 2, a manipulation in which experimental stimuli were schema-consistent resulted in a decrease in prejudice; however, schema-inconsistent stimuli did not. We discuss potential implications in the context of addressing discrimination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: To examine how neighborhood characteristics are associated with health outcomes among older adults with osteoarthritis. Methods: In multilevel, cross-sectional, and longitudinal analyses we examined whether 4 neighborhood characteristics were associated with depressive symptoms and reported knee impact scores, and whether the neighborhood characteristics interacted with race/ethnicity among older adults with radiographic knee osteoarthritis (n = 656 for cross-sectional analyses and n = 434 for longitudinal analyses). The data came from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project, a prospective cohort study in North Carolina designed to examine risk factors for osteoarthritis. Results: Although few longitudinal associations were found, cross-sectional results suggested that greater perceived neighborhood social cohesion (B = –0.04, P < 0.001) and perceived neighborhood resources for physical activity and walking (B = –0.03, P < 0.001) were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, and that greater perceived neighborhood resources for physical activity and walking were associated with higher (better) knee impact scores (B = 0.48, P = 0.008). We also observed 2 significant interactions among neighborhood characteristics and race/ethnicity related to depressive symptoms (P < 0.01); for African American adults, greater perceived neighborhood resources for physical activity and walking were associated with fewer depressive symptoms (B = –0.03, P < 0.001), but for White adults, greater perceived neighborhood safety was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (B = –0.04, P = 0.003). Conclusion: In a sample of older adults with radiographic knee osteoarthritis, neighborhood context mattered, but in nuanced ways. Interventions aiming to improve mental and physical functioning of older adults with knee osteoarthritis can look to this study as evidence for the importance of neighborhood characteristics. © 2019, American College of Rheumatology

AB  - Should self-driving vehicles be prejudiced, e.g., deliberately harm the elderly over young children? When people make such forced-choices on the vehicle's behalf, they exhibit systematic preferences (e.g., favor young children), yet when their options are unconstrained they favor egalitarianism. So, which of these response patterns should guide AV programming and policy? We argue that this debate is missing the public reaction most likely to threaten the industry's life-saving potential: moral outrage. We find that people are more outraged by AVs that kill discriminately than indiscriminately. Crucially, they are even more outraged by an AV that deliberately kills a less preferred group (e.g., an elderly person over a child) than by one that indiscriminately kills a more preferred group (e.g., a child). Thus, at least insofar as the public is concerned, there may be more reason to depict and program AVs as egalitarian. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Higher weight individuals experience frequent weight-related discrimination, which is associated with exercise avoidance. Exercise is a health behavior with multiple physical and mental health benefits and should be accessible to all. The current study examined another factor that might influence exercise in addition to weight stigma: social anxiety (SA). Given the often public nature of exercise, individuals with SA may feel scrutinized when exercising, which may lead to avoidance. This study examined whether SA moderates the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and exercise and whether SA and its interaction with BMI predict exercise behavior after accounting for weight stigma. We administered an online survey to 603 undergraduates (72 % female, 60 % White). SA was not significantly associated with BMI, but it was positively associated with weight stigma and exercise-avoidance motivation and negatively associated with self-reported exercise. SA moderated the relationship between BMI and exercise-avoidance motivation; individuals with higher BMIs were motivated to avoid exercise, but only if they reported higher SA. This interaction predicted exercise-avoidance motivation after accounting for weight stigma and its interaction with BMI. However, SA did not moderate the relationship between BMI and self-reported exercise. SA may be associated with exercise avoidance among higher weight individuals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Emphasizing the potential impact of publics’ ethnic identities in crisis situations, the main purpose of the study is to explore how two ethnically different publics respond to the United Airlines’ dragging crisis. Using semantic network analysis and thematic analysis, the research examined how Twitter messages written in both English and Chinese reflect themes around ethnicity. The results showed that the Chinese publics explicitly present the ethnicity identity of the Asian group, demonstrating that language and words reflect social media users’ ethnic identity. The research provides both theoretical and practical implications for crises involving the issue of ethnicity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Previous research has shown that positive intergroup contact among disadvantaged group members may predict a so-called sedative effect according to which positive contact is associated with reduced support for social change. Conversely, positive contact is associated with increased support for social change toward equality among advantaged group members. This raises the important question of under which circumstances intergroup contact can encourage support for social change among both disadvantaged and advantaged groups. In this theoretical article, we tackle this question by introducing a new Integrated Contact-Collective Action Model (ICCAM). We first provide an up-to-date review of how intergroup contact may promote or hinder social change for both disadvantaged and advantaged groups. We, then, use ICCAM to examine when the many forms of intergroup contact promote or hinder support for social change, proposing the existence of two different paths for disadvantaged and advantaged group members. Finally, we discuss the implications of the model for social intervention and make policy recommendations stemming from a review of available evidence. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Did some early Christian groups worship the emperor or other Graeco-Roman gods? In his essay ‘Going All the Way? Honouring the Emperor and Sacrificing Wives and Slaves in 1 Peter 2.13-3.6’, Warren Carter has proposed a provocative reading of 1 Pet. 2.13–3.6, arguing that this author exhorts the audience to participate in cultic sacrifices to the emperor as part of a strategy to overcome the social-prejudice currently faced by the audience. In this article I offer an analysis of Carter’s position, as well as offer a detailed response to his argument. I begin by responding to his suggestions regarding Paul, the Apocalypse of John and the Governor Pliny. This is followed by a detailed look at two specific strands of evidence in 1 Pet. 1.18 and 4.3 and the audience’s experience of suffering, which indicate that Carter’s thesis is mistaken. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The two authors intend to underline the continuities and discontinuities that organize the Milan Approach, after the splitting from Selvini Palazzoli and Prata; they intend to tell the teachings of Luigi Boscolo and Gianfranco Cecchin from the beginning of training in 1978 till nowadays. After having spoken of some important stages in the work till the death of the two masters, the article underlines two major new aspects. 1. We speak about the corporeal turn: embodied experience as preconceptual know-how from which concepts are structured. We speak about the connections between bodies and social issues that enact forms of knowledge and understanding. 2. In this period of war, violence, and tyranny, we speak about epistemology and ontology as complementary stances: the need to let others disclose themselves, by allowing them to speak their own terms of engagement. The therapeutic effort is one of deactivating the dangers of one’s own presuppositions and prejudices that limit one’s capacity to describe and make hypothesis. There are social ontologies, communities with strong moral intensity, historical and social realities that need therapists to take position, since they need to take side and be aware of the categories they utilize. Historical and social ontology deals with the continuous change of symptoms in connection to the continuous change of the social panorama in the context we live in. We live by the bodies we are. © 2020 Family Process Institute

AB  - While some media perpetuate weight stigma and an ideal of thinness, certain advertising campaigns, such as Aerie Real and Dove Real Beauty, have attempted to promote body acceptance. The current study evaluated the influence of exposure to these campaigns on weight bias, internalized weight bias (IWB), self-esteem, body image, and affect relative to exposure to a campaign perpetuating the thin ideal and a documentary on weight stigma. 475 female participants were randomized to one of five conditions: Aerie, Dove, Victoria's Secret, an HBO documentary, or control (i.e., neutral video clip). Participants completed measures of weight bias, IWB, self-esteem, body image, and affect one week prior to and immediately after watching the assigned video clip. Results showed positive effects of the Aerie and Dove campaigns on women. While global measures of weight bias and IWB were unchanged, women who viewed the Dove and Aerie campaigns reported significantly improved self-esteem and positive affect. Further, women found the campaigns to have positive, uplifting, and empowering messages. Aerie's and Dove's acceptance-promoting advertising campaigns positively influenced self-esteem and mood, and they are potential tools for weight bias reduction. Advertisements and media have the potential to impact weight-based attitudes in society. © 2020

AB  - We conducted an experimental intervention to test the effectiveness of vicarious contact in the relationship between Turkish and Syrian elementary school children; the participants were Turkish children. We used a mixed-methods approach, investigating effects by using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Participants in the experimental condition were asked to read stories on positive contact between Turkish and Syrian children over the course of six weekly sessions. The results revealed that vicarious contact, compared to a control condition where participants did not engage in any activity, led to greater intentions to help outgroup members. Importantly, effects only emerged among children who reported higher initial negative outgroup attitudes. Results from qualitative data revealed that vicarious contact produced richer, more positive, and complex representations of the relationships and friendships between groups. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The goal of this study was to examine the consequences of helping an outgroup in an intergroup context where the threat to the ingroup and outgroup varied. Fourth and eighth graders (N = 126; fourth graders: Mage = 9.07 years, SD = 0.38; eighth graders: Mage = 12.84 years, SD = 0.34) were asked whether excluding an ingroup member who helped an outgroup by sharing equally or not was acceptable. Equal helping or outgroup helping occurred when the groups had equal need for a vital resource, the outgroup needed it more, or the ingroup needed it more. Overall, excluding the helpful ingroup member was viewed as unacceptable. It was least acceptable when the outgroup needed the help and was given more help than the ingroup. Exclusion was judged to be most acceptable when both groups needed the same amount of help, or the ingroup needed more help, but more help was given to the outgroup, and these findings were driven by fourth graders. Participants’ social cognitions regarding perceptions of group interest, group identification, and approval of the helping act predicted their acceptability of excluding the helping member. Concerns for group loyalty were used to justify exclusion, but appeals to the emotional harm of exclusion, generosity, and the low salience of the act of helping were used to reject exclusion. The findings contribute to developmental research on intergroup relations and exclusion from peer groups. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Teachers' decisions to nominate the students whom they think are gifted and talented can seriously be negatively influenced by their possible prejudices and lack of knowledge. In this respect, it is considered that it is important to compare the teachers' nomination decisions with the tests used to officially identify gifted and talented students. In this study, it is aimed to identify the relationship between the teachers’ nominations and the results from the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) of students who are identified as gifted or non-gifted. Also, the effects of gender on teacher's nominations or RSPM results have been examined. The relational survey model, one of the quantitative research models, was used in the research. The number of students to be included in the research was determined by using stratified sampling, which is one of the probabilistic sampling methods. Accordingly, 385 students studying from the 1st grade to the 4th grade in the selected schools formed the sample of the research. In this study, RSPM was used to determine whether students are gifted or not. Teachers were also given a form in which they could list the students' names, surnames, and gender to nominate the gifted students. Chi-square test was used in the analysis of the data obtained from the research. If the relationship was significant as a result of the chi-square test analysis, the strength of the relationship was examined by using Phi & Cramer V test. According to the obtained results, although there was an acceptable significant relationship between RSPM results and teacher's nominations in diagnosing gifted students, it was observed that success of the teachers’ nomination was not sufficient, and RSPM results, teachers’ nominations and gender factor were not related. Also, the results indicate that teachers showed a bias towards male students in nomination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Today, physical and psychological barriers can reduce opportunities for the type of direct face-to-face intergroup contact first identified by Gordon Allport. Consequently, social psychological researchers have identified, developed and tested a burgeoning array of different forms of indirect contact, including, extended contact, Electronic- or E-contact, imagined contact, vicarious contact and parasocial contact. In addition to providing a critical review of each of these forms, we argue that indirect contact is more than just a simple “replacement” for direct contact, but instead has the potential to improve intergroup relations for both minority and majority members in its own right. Relatedly, we acknowledge that indirect contact occurs within specific normative contexts embodied in legislation, institutions, and media and political contents. In fact, we recognize that indirect contact requires an integrative understanding of the role of intergroup norms and affective processes in order to effectively achieve public policy objectives to optimize effects on prejudice reduction. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Essentialist lay-theories can reflect a belief in genetic, social, and metaphysical determinism. These three types of essentialist beliefs are similar as they can be linked to a set of motives and each of those beliefs is related to stereotyping and prejudice. Nevertheless, the available evidence indicates that the three types of essentialist thinking are largely unrelated and it is unclear why some individuals endorse one type of essentialism and reject another. Examining the association between the endorsement of essentialist beliefs and personal values, our results based on N = 348 respondents indicate that specific value profiles build the motivational basis for specific essentialist beliefs. Specifically, conservation values are associated with belief in genetic and metaphysical determinism, while self-transcendence and self-enhancement are associated with belief in social determinism. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Research among adults suggests that weight stigma is associated with worsened cardiometabolic health. However, these relationships have not been examined among youth. Objective: Assess associations between weight-based teasing (WBT) and metabolic and inflammatory markers among two samples of youth: (1) a non-treatment-seeking sample and (2) a weight loss treatment-seeking sample with obesity. Method: Weight, height, adiposity, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured. Fasting blood samples were collected for metabolic (triglycerides, glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and inflammatory analytes (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in Study 1 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in both studies). Youths completed the Perception of Teasing Scale, a measure of WBT. Metabolic and inflammatory indices were compared between those with and without teasing, adjusting for demographics and body composition. Results: Study 1 enrolled 201 non-treatment-seeking youth (Mage = 13.1y; 54.2% female; 44.8% non-Hispanic White; 32.8% with overweight/obesity); 15.4% reported WBT. Study 2 enrolled 111 treatment-seeking adolescents with obesity (Mage = 14.0y; 66.7% female; 37.8% non-Hispanic White); 73.0% reported WBT. Adjusting for covariates, WBT was not associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in either study. Conclusions: WBT was not associated with worsened cardiometabolic health. Longitudinal research is needed to elucidate associations between WBT and health in youth. © 2020 World Obesity Federation

AB  - Background: Identifying and safeguarding ethics in eHealth services from the service users’ perspective in social care and healthcare is important. The use of eHealth services should not prejudice the quality of services or the social interaction required in care. There is a lack of studies about the ethics of eHealth services from the service users’ perspective. Aim: The aim of this study is to identify and analyse ethical issues related to eHealth in social care and healthcare from the service users’ perspective. Research design: An integrative literature review. Ethical considerations: The review followed good scientific conduct. Research context and data sources: A systematic literature search was performed using CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Academic Search Premier to find relevant empirical studies published in English from their earliest up to 30 November 2018. In addition, reference lists from the identified research papers were searched. A quality appraisal of each paper included in the review was conducted before thematic analysis. Results: In total, 26 studies were included in the review, and from these four ethical themes were identified: (1) privacy in eHealth, (2) beneficence and nonmaleficence in eHealth, (3) justice in eHealth and (4) trust in eHealth. The ethical issues within these themes were related to information sharing; ownership; access to information and data protection; informed consent; defence of rights; and equity, equality and proportionality of response. Conclusion: eHealth inequality occurs in social care and healthcare. eHealth service designers and social care and healthcare professionals need to act to maintain and improve user access and data accuracy and provide different levels of security in eHealth services, relative to the information stored. There is a need for further research about ethical issues of eHealth from the user’s perspective, including the customer-oriented availability and usability of eHealth services which avoid discrimination. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background and objectives: Approaching the thin-ideal and avoiding the stigma of fatness are motivational tendencies resulting from the internalisation of sociocultural appearance norms. Individual differences in subclinical levels of eating disorder symptomatology may be related to variation in motivational tendencies regarding thin vs. non-thin bodies. Methods: To empirically investigate this hypothesis, the current study employed a novel touchscreen approach-avoidance task with the capacity to effectively simulate compatible approach-avoidance movements. Eighty-four undergraduate females pulled closer or pushed away images depicting either bodies or objects, in response to weight category (underweight bodies vs. overweight bodies) and object category (kitchen items vs. office tools), by means of arm movements. Results: Unexpectedly, results revealed relatively faster approach of overweight bodies and relatively faster avoidance of underweight bodies. Moreover, speeded approach towards overweight bodies, relative to underweight bodies, correlated positively with elevated eating disorder symptomatology. Limitations: The current sample was restricted to undergraduate women. Conclusions: The current study provides initial evidence for the utility of a touchscreen-based measure of approach-avoidance tendencies in body image, albeit comparison with other bias assessments would be necessary. Moreover, our findings suggest that a greater tendency to approach overweight bodies is associated with elevated eating disorder symptomatology. Future extensions of the current work are necessary to clarify the function of motivational tendencies in the body image context. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A large body of research has examined public perceptions of police behavior. Many of these studies have raised concerns about perceptions of unequal treatment of citizens by law enforcement and the effects such disparate treatment might have on police–community relations. This scholarship has largely examined global perceptions of police behavior rather than asking about actual encounters with officers. Relying on global opinions of police, however, tends to distort perceptions as it tends to illicit prejudiced and stereotypical views about law enforcement rather than lived experiences. This article offers a more precise approach to measuring police behavior during encounters with citizens by assessing views of those who have had recent contact with law enforcement. Specifically, we examine how perceptions of police behavior during both traffic stops and street stops of pedestrians might vary according to a citizen’s sociodemographic background and geographic location and how such factors might influence perceptions of the legitimacy of their encounter with the officer. Results from our multivariate analyses suggest that youth, African Americans, the poor, and those living in large urban areas are significantly more likely than others to believe they were treated outside of the scope of acceptable police conduct. Furthermore, ethnic minorities, the poor, and those in urban areas are much more likely to perceive the stop as illegitimate. Our results suggest that much of this might be explained by differences in police behavior according to the size of the place and across different social groups. © 2020 Georgia State University.

AB  - Meta-dehumanization, the perception your group has been given less than human qualities, contributes to a vicious cycle of outgroup dehumanization and hostility, such as hate crimes and support for discriminatory policies. Minimal research has investigated potential benefits of meta-humanization, or perceiving your group has been given dignified qualities. Across 7 studies (N = 1,261) in Canada and the United Kingdom, we focus on Muslim–non-Muslim relations and provide the first empirical evidence to suggest that (a) there is an indirect effect of meta-humanization through outgroup humanization that reduces prejudice and (b) that perceived high intergroup threat moderates the indirect effect of meta-humanization. Studies 1a and 1b reveal that humanization mediates the indirect effect of meta-humanization on prejudice. Studies 2a and 2b replicate these results as well as demonstrate that perceived threat moderates the indirect effect, and Study 2c extends this by testing the perspective of Muslims. Studies 3a and 3b further demonstrate an interaction between high threat and meta-humanization on prejudice and interest in intergroup contact. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the growing literature on meta-dehumanization, meta-humanization, and intergroup relations more broadly.

AB  - Although people with depression are stigmatized in many parts of the world, the negative prejudice and discrimination against individuals with depression may be particularly problematic for Chinese individuals. Previous attribution theory–guided studies indicate that reducing perceptions of controllability can indirectly increase willingness to provide social support to acquaintances and close others with depression through increased sympathy and reduced anger. Moreover, these studies indicate that strengthening beliefs regarding the temporary nature of depression indirectly increases willingness to provide support for close others but not acquaintances. Although these findings offer insight into how the harms of stigma can be reduced in the United States, it is unknown whether these results will generalize to the Chinese population. In the current study, participants from an urban city in China (N = 302) were randomly assigned to think of a close other or an acquaintance experiencing depression and then respond to measures of affect and help provision (willingness to provide social support, willingness to provide general support, and desire for social distance). Moderated mediation analyses indicated that participants were significantly less sympathetic when they perceived depression as controllable and this effect was significantly stronger toward acquaintances. Additionally, sympathy was significantly lower when participants perceived their close other's depressive symptomatology as stable. This effect was not observed among participants who perceived their acquaintances’ experience with depression as stable. Findings suggest that Weiner's attribution theory could be a useful framework in reducing stigmatization of depression in China, but interpersonal relationships should be taken into consideration.

AB  - Stereotypes of religion (particularly Christianity) as incompatible with science are widespread, and prior findings show that Christians perform worse than non-Christians on scientific reasoning tasks following reminders of such stereotypes. The present studies (N = 1,456) examine whether these reminders elicit stereotype threat (i.e., fear of confirming negative societal stereotypes about one’s group), disengagement (i.e., distancing oneself from a domain perceived as incongruent with the values of one’s group), or both. In Studies 1 and 2, Christians demonstrated lower task performance and greater subjective feelings of stereotype threat (but did not spend less time on the task) relative to non-Christians when beliefs about Christianity–science incompatibility were chronic or made salient. Furthermore, the effects of incompatibility stereotypes on performance were most pronounced among Christians who identified strongly with science and hence worried most about confirming negative stereotypes (Studies 3–4). Implications for Christians’ responses to religion–science conflict narratives and participation in science are discussed. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Dialogue about race-based topics is essential to combat prejudice, foster mutual understanding, and improve race relations. This study describes the extent to which political conversations-especially those about race-related topics-are taking place within and across racial and political groups. This national survey with a Black oversample found racially diverse discussion networks to be more likely among Blacks than Whites, but politically diverse networks to be more likely among Whites than Blacks. Blacks were more likely than Whites to talk about race-related topics such as police treatment of Blacks (and less likely about several topics not explicitly tied to race), but by no means did Whites entirely avoid race-related topics, even in their same-race discussions. Moreover, there was evidence that discussion in cross-race dyads affected the mix of topics Whites and Blacks discussed, revealing the potential for cross-race interaction to alter political agendas. Rather than being less likely to talk about police treatment of Blacks with Blacks, Whites were more likely to discuss this topic when in mixed-race dyads, while Blacks talked about it less often with Whites than with other Blacks. Findings are discussed in the context of political disagreement and intergroup contact theory.

AB  - Introduction: Sexual minority women (SMW) may have different experiences of macro-level events, such as changes in marriage laws or election outcomes, related to their multiple identities. African American, Latina/x, and White identities intersect with gender/sex and sexual identity to influence experiences at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, social, and political levels of the socio-ecological environment. Methods: Participants include 100 African American, 35 Latina/x, and 164 White SMW (N = 299) in wave 4 (2017–2019) of a longitudinal study of SMW’s health conducted in the USA (Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women Study). Responses to nine open-ended survey questions about marriage equality and the 2016 Presidential election were examined. Results: Thematic analysis noted similarities across groups and focused on group differences in four areas: (1) personal well-being (including fear and anxiety about discrimination; risk associated with masculine presentation; and religion as stress and support); (2) interpersonal relationships (including relationships with partners, family, and in a community); (3) societal discrimination and prejudice (including harassment in public spaces and concerns about travel); and (4) civil rights, government harassment, and police-state violence. Conclusions: Emerging differences emphasized the impact of race/ethnicity and the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender on experiences of marriage equality and the 2016 election. Policy Implications: Findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of the experiences of individuals with different racial/racialized identities and the intersection of race/ethnicity with sexual identities is essential to creating culturally competent and effective supports for SMW. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Problem and Background: Although the number of Muslim women in Canada and northwestern Ontario (NWO) is increasing, few studies have focused on their experiences of perinatal health care. Extant research has highlighted discrimination and care that lacks respect for cultural and religious norms. These factors may limit access to health services and increase unfavorable maternal and child health outcomes. Aim: To explore the perinatal health care experiences of Muslim women in NWO. Methods: A qualitative, descriptive study used purposive and snowball sampling to recruit a sample of 19 Muslim mothers. Ssemistructured interviews were conducted, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically. Findings: The mothers’ experiences were categorized into four themes: women's choices and preferences of health care providers (HCPs); attitudes toward prenatal classes and education; husbands’ involvement and support in the birthing process; and challenges to optimal care. Discussion and Conclusion: The findings show that NWO Muslim women's experiences were generally positive and their care choices and preferences were shaped by their religious beliefs and cultural practices. Factors that enhanced their experiences were HCPs’ awareness of and respect for the women's religious and cultural beliefs and practices. However, the women lacked personal knowledge of a range of care options and services. Respecting Muslim women's religious and cultural beliefs and practices will enhance their experience of care. Equity in access to quality services, care, and outcomes can be further enhanced if Muslim women are informed about the range of care options and services as early in their pregnancies as possible. © 2020 Australian College of Midwives

AB  - This study examines the role of individuals’ media diets in contributing to the growing support for right-wing populist parties. Drawing on social identity theory and the notion of populism as political communication, this study argues that socio-economic status and tabloid news use explain support for right-wing candidates through heightened out-group hostility. Using survey data from the Austrian National Election Study (N = 1161), we present a process model in the structural equation modeling framework, and we compare the direct and indirect effects of attention to tabloid versus broadsheet news on the probability to vote for the Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs. Results show that the link between social status and support for right-wing populism is mediated by attention to tabloid news and anti-immigration attitudes. Implications for democratic norms are discussed in light of the overlap between news media and politicians in their use of populist narratives. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - We examined how the journalistic differentiation of Muslims from Islamist terrorists and terror news proximity (i.e., proximity of terroristic acts to viewing audience) influence the effects of news reports about terrorism by the Islamic State on Islamophobic attitudes. Drawing from social identity theory, findings from two experimental studies revealed that coverage not clearly distinguishing Muslims from Islamist terrorists (i.e., undifferentiated coverage) activated negative stereotypes about Muslims and, in turn, heightened Islamophobic attitudes. However, terror news proximity did not affect audiences’ reactions of fear, negative stereotypes about Muslims, or Islamophobic attitudes. We discuss the implications of those findings for research on terrorism as well as for journalistic practice. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Student sex work is a current phenomenon all over the world, increasingly reported by the media in recent years. However, student sex work remains under-researched in Germany and is lacking direct first-hand reports from the people involved. Further, sex work remains stigmatized, and therefore, students practicing it could be at risk of social isolation and emotional or physical danger. Therefore, this study examines students working in the sex industry focusing on their personal experiences and attitudes toward them. An online questionnaire was completed by 4386 students from Berlin universities. Students who identified themselves as sex workers (n = 227) were questioned with respect to their motivations to enter the sex industry, characteristics of their job, feelings after the intercourse, and perceived risks. Student non-sex workers (n = 2998) were questioned regarding knowledge of and attitudes toward student sex workers. Most student sex workers reported that they entered the sex industry due to financial reasons (35.7%). The majority reported offering services involving direct sexual intercourse. Disclosing their job to friends, family, or others was associated with less problems with social isolation and in romantic relationships. With a total of 22.9%, student non-sex workers reported never having heard about students working in the sex industry. The most frequent emotions mentioned by them with regard to student sex workers were compassion and dismay (48.9%). There was no difference in happiness between student sex workers and non-sex working students. Through this research, it becomes evident that there are similarities between the student’s motivations to enter the sex industry, their feelings, and the problems they have to face. Moreover, prejudices still prevail about the life of student sex workers. Increasing understanding of student sex work might help those sex workers to live a less stigmatized life and thereby to make use of support from others. The universities as institutions could form the basis for this, e.g., by openly supporting student sex workers. This could help to encourage the rights of student sex workers and to gain perspective with respect to the sex industry. © Copyright © 2021 Ernst, Romanczuk-Seiferth, Köhler, Amelung and Betzler.

AB  - This study explores the effects of intergroup vicarious ostracism on individual prejudicial attributions and aggressive intentions. It takes Tibetan and Hui college students in northwestern China as participants. Study 1 and Study 2 explore the difference in observers' prejudicial attributions and aggressive intentions, respectively, when the group members who experienced ostracism (Tibetan college students) observed an in-group member being ostracized by out-group members versus an in-group member being ostracized by in-group members. Results show that those in-group participants, i.e., the Tibetan college students, who observed an in-group member being ostracized by out-group members, showed much higher prejudicial attributions, F(1, 106) = 19.65, p <.001, ηp=.156, and aggressive intentions, F(1, 108) = 10.51, p =.002, ηp=.089, toward ostracizers than those who observed an in-group member being ostracized by in-group members. In Study 3, Hui college students were recruited as participants to further test the results of Study 1 and Study 2. In addition, we also found that under the out-group conditions, prejudicial attribution mediates the effects of inclusionary status on aggressive intentions (95% bias-corrected confidence interval did not include zero; 95% CI [0.15, 0.69]). This study shows that ostracizers' group membership could affect observers' prejudicial attributions and their aggressive intentions toward the ostracizers. ©

AB  - Aims Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) face widespread prejudice in society. Whether SES disparities exist in treatment and survival following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is unclear. The aim of the current retrospective registry study was to examine SES disparities in IHCA treatment and survival, assessing SES at the patient level, and adjusting for major demographic, clinical, and contextual factors. Methods and results In total, 24 217 IHCAs from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation were analysed. Education and income constituted SES proxies. Controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidity, heart rhythm, aetiology, hospital, and year, primary analyses showed that high (vs. low) SES patients were significantly less likely to receive delayed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (highly educated: OR = 0.89, and high income: OR = 0.98). Furthermore, patients with high SES were significantly more likely to survive CPR (high income: OR = 1.02), to survive to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome (highly educated: OR = 1.27; high income: OR = 1.06), and to survive to 30 days (highly educated: OR = 1.21; and high income: OR = 1.05). Secondary analyses showed that patients with high SES were also significantly more likely to receive prophylactic heart rhythm monitoring (highly educated: OR = 1.16; high income: OR = 1.02), and this seems to partially explain the observed SES differences in CPR delay. Conclusion There are clear SES differences in IHCA treatment and survival, even when controlling for major sociodemographic, clinical, and contextual factors. This suggests that patients with low SES could be subject to discrimination when suffering IHCA. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - Given that mentally activating negative stereotypes about our social groups impairs our performance, can questioning the stereotype effectively disrupt this phenomenon? We experimentally tested an intervention of this type in several samples of athletes. Performance was consistently much improved, both in statistical and in practical terms, when participants were encouraged to question the stereotype than when they were merely reminded of the stereotype. These effects held regardless of the content of the stereotype and the group targeted. Process evidence suggests that questioning the stereotype buffers performance primarily via affect: the intervention stops athletes from worrying. Taken together, these findings indicate that adopting a simple yet powerful questioning stance protects targets of stereotypes against the performance impairments that they would otherwise typically experience.

AB  - Cross-ethnic friendships offer a unique opportunity for improving intergroup relations and reduce prejudice, yet ethnic segregation of friendship networks is often seen as a major obstacle to the integration of immigrant students in educational contexts. This article examines the role of perspective-taking abilities and prejudice towards low social class peers on the probability of cross-ethnic friendships in a sample of 242 students from five multicultural classrooms in Chile (Mage = 12.3; SD = 0.69, 45% girls). It was expected that students who reported high levels of perspective-taking abilities and low levels of prejudice towards low social class peers were more likely to form and maintain cross-ethnic friendships. Longitudinal network analysis (RSiena) was used to examine these hypotheses, confirming the role of both variables in fostering (and reducing) friendships among Chilean and immigrant adolescents. Results are discussed in light of an intersectional framework between social class and ethnicity. Implications for social-emotional interventions in multicultural educational contexts are also discussed. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Children of immigrants are often considered to be at increased risk of mental health problems due to families' immigration-related stress and perceived discrimination and prejudice from the host country. However, many studies found them to have better developmental outcomes than children with native-born parents in the U.S. This study aims to unfold this paradoxical phenomenon using data from a population-based cohort of children born in large U.S. cities. Specifically, we investigated differences in mental health outcomes between children of immigrants and those with native-born parents, stratified by children's race-ethnicity. We also explored the mediating role of child maltreatment risk in the association of parental nativity status and race-ethnicity with children's mental health. Our findings supported the immigrant paradox, with better self-reported and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing outcomes in Hispanic and Black children of immigrants than their same race-ethnicity peers and White children of native-born. Such immigrant-native variations were partially explained by parents' physically and psychologically abusive behaviors. Hispanic and Black children with immigrant parents were less likely to be physically or psychologically abused than their peers of native-born at ages 4–5, which translated into mental health advantages of children of immigrants at age 9. Our findings shed light on future research to further clarify the mechanism underlying different parenting practices between same race-ethnicity immigrants and native-born families so that culturally responsive interventions can be developed to safeguard racial-ethnic minority children's mental health. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Bo and Lu.

AB  - Americans are much more likely to be socially connected to copartisans, both in daily life and on social media. However, this observation does not necessarily mean that shared partisanship per se drives social tie formation, because partisanship is confounded with many other factors. Here, we test the causal effect of shared partisanship on the formation of social ties in a field experiment on Twitter. We created bot accounts that self-identified as people who favored the Democratic or Republican party and that varied in the strength of that identification. We then randomly assigned 842 Twitter users to be followed by one of our accounts. Users were roughly three times more likely to reciprocally follow-back bots whose partisanship matched their own, and this was true regardless of the bot’s strength of identification. Interestingly, there was no partisan asymmetry in this preferential follow-back behavior: Democrats and Republicans alike were much more likely to reciprocate follows from copartisans. These results demonstrate a strong causal effect of shared partisanship on the formation of social ties in an ecologically valid field setting and have important implications for political psychology, social media, and the politically polarized state of the American public. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Purpose: This study seeks to provide further testing of access in the context of government – community relations within the political context of the Republic of North Macedonia. The study analyses relationship cultivation strategy of access and explains how it contributes to achieving trust and relationship satisfaction in government–community relations. This paper also provides insights into the importance of access to achieving positive government–community relations based on mutual trust and satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: For this research, a qualitative inquiry was conducted, and qualitative in-depth interviewing was used as the main research method. In total, 39 interviews were conducted: 12 interviews with Macedonian civil servants, eight interviews with Albanian civil servants and 19 interviews with Albanians. Findings: The findings of this study showed citizens not to have enough access to government and its institutions. Besides, the results showed access to be crucial to building positive government–community relations based on mutual trust and satisfaction. In particular, discrimination and social distance were crucial in building trust between government and citizens. Originality/value: The study provided evidence on the importance and contribution of the cultivation strategy of access to government-community relationships in general and to the relational outcomes of trust and satisfaction in particular. The findings supported the initial assumptions that access constitutes an important factor in predicting the government–community relationship quality. © 2020, Mensur Zeqiri.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the social representations elaborated by high school and university students about obesity. The study enrolled 200 high school students from public and private schools and 200 university students from João Pessoa, Brazil. The instruments used were a sociodemographic questionnaire analyzed through descriptive statistics performed at SPSS software and a Free Word Association Test with "obesity" as the stimulus, analyzed through prototypic analysis at Iramuteq software. The analysis revealed common elements of the central core of these representations that shows an unifactorial conception regarding the causes of obesity, relating it mainly to poor nutrition and without considering the psychosocial aspects related to the phenomenon, which can lead to blame and prejudice. This study means to stimulate interventions that present accurate information about obesity, to clarify its multifactoriality and to reduce prejudice toward obese people. © Ciencias Psicologicas 2021.

AB  - This paper serves three specific goals. First, it reports the development of an Indian Asian face set, to serve as a free resource for psychological research. Second, it examines whether the use of pre-tested U.S.-specific norms for stimulus selection or weighting may introduce experimental confounds in studies involving non-U.S. face stimuli and/or non-U.S. participants. Specifically, it examines whether subjective impressions of the face stimuli are culturally dependent, and the extent to which these impressions reflect social stereotypes and ingroup favoritism. Third, the paper investigates whether differences in face familiarity impact accuracy in identifying face ethnicity. To this end, face images drawn from volunteers in India as well as a subset of Caucasian face images from the Chicago Face Database were presented to Indian and U.S. participants, and rated on a range of measures, such as perceived attractiveness, warmth, and social status. Results show significant differences in the overall valence of ratings of ingroup and outgroup faces. In addition, the impression ratings show minor differentiation along two basic stereotype dimensions, competence and trustworthiness, but not warmth. We also find participants to show significantly greater accuracy in correctly identifying the ethnicity of ingroup faces, relative to outgroup faces. This effect is found to be mediated by ingroup-outgroup differences in perceived group typicality of the target faces. Implications for research on intergroup relations in a cross-cultural context are discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Lakshmi, Wittenbrink, Correll and Ma.

AB  - It is unknown whether gastric dysrhythmias contribute to disgust avoidance. By normalizing gastric state with domperidone and measuring oculomotor avoidance of disgusting images, Nord et al. discover that domperidone reduces oculomotor disgust avoidance following an exposure task. This suggests that gastric rhythm is one cause of disgust avoidance. © 2020 The Author(s)
Rotten food, maggots, bodily waste—all elicit disgust in humans. Disgust promotes survival by encouraging avoidance of disease vectors1 but is also implicated in prejudice toward minority groups; avoidance of environmentally beneficial foods, such as insect protein; and maladaptive avoidance behavior in neuropsychiatric conditions.2–5 Unlike fear, pathological disgust is not improved substantially by exposure therapy clinically,6 nor in experimental work does behavioral avoidance of disgusting images habituate following prolonged exposure.7,8 Under normal physiological conditions, perception of disgusting stimuli disrupts myoelectrical rhythms in the stomach,9–13 inducing gastric dysrhythmias that correlate with neural signatures of disgust.11 However, the causal role of gastric rhythm in disgust avoidance is unknown. We manipulated gastric rhythm using domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2/D3 antagonist and common anti-emetic, at a dose (10 mg) that acts to convert gastric dysrhythmias to normal rhythms.9 In a preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design in 25 healthy volunteers (aged 18–25), we measured the effects of domperidone on core disgust avoidance, using eye tracking to measure implicit (oculomotor) avoidance of disgusting images (feces) before and after an “exposure” intervention (monetary reinforcement for looking at disgusting images).7,8 We find that domperidone significantly reduces oculomotor disgust avoidance following incentivized exposure. This suggests that domperidone may weaken the “immunity” of disgust to habituation, putatively by reducing gastric dysrhythmias during incentivized engagement with disgusting stimuli. This indicates a causal role for disgust-related visceral changes in disgust avoidance, supporting the hypothesis that physiological homeostasis contributes to emotional experience. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Aim: This research was planned and conducted as a cross-sectional descriptive study in order to determine the nutritional status, compliance with the Mediterranean diet, physical activity levels, and obesity prejudices of adolescents, and to evaluate the relationship between them. Methods: The research was conducted with 233 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years who studied at a high school in the Üsküdar district of Istanbul. A 3-day food consumption record and anthropometric measurements of the participants were made, and the KIDMED scale, IPAQ scale, and GAMS-27 scale were applied. Results: 50.2% of the adolescents participating in the study were girls and 49.8% were boys; the mean age was 15.57 ± 1.12 years. The mean BMI scores of the girls and boys were 22.55 ± 3.85 kg/m2 and 22.85 ± 3.52 kg/m2, respectively (p>0.05). The average waist / height ratio for girls was 0.45 ± 0.05, and for boys it was 0.47±0.05 (p <0.05). It was determined that girls consumed an average of 1673.28 ± 469.36 calories daily and boys consumed 1823.31 ± 576.70 calories (p<0.05). The mean KIDMED score of the participants was 4.31 ± 2.48, the mean IPAQ score was 3524.65 ± 2236.81 MET, and the mean GAMS-27 score was 82.56 ± 11.46. Discussion: As a result of the research, it was concluded that the participants complied with the Mediterranean diet at a lowmoderate level, were minimally active, and prone to having obesity prejudices. © Mattioli 1885.

AB  - Background: The study of adolescents’ behaviours and attitudes is crucial to define interventions for the containment of deviance and social discomfort. New ways of social interaction are crystallising violent behaviours which are moving more than ever on a virtual sphere. Bullying and cyberbullying share a common behavioural matrix that has been outlined through specific environmental and individual characteristics. Methods: A survey carried out in Italy in 2019 on a statistical sample of 3273 students highlighted the influence of several social and individual variables on deviant phenomena. Risk and protective factors in relation to the probability of involvement in bullying and cyberbullying have been shown through a bivariate analysis and a binary logistic regression model. Results: The study shows that presence of stereotypes and social prejudices, tolerance to violence and high levels of self-esteem have resulted as the main risk factors. On the other hand, low levels of tolerance related to the consumption of alcohol and drugs, high levels of trust towards family and friends and being female have been identified as protective factors. Conclusions: This research confirms the validity of several theories on bullying and cyberbullying phenomena. Furthermore, it identifies specific risk and protective factors and their influence on deviant behaviours, with a focus on environmental characteristics which appear as the key field of work to enhance adolescents’ well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, I offer a preliminary sketch of a culture-enabling Philosophy for/with Children practice. It is an approach to engaging philosophically with children that aims to encourage the exercise of critical reflection at the level of their respective cultures. This kind of P4wC practice hopes to address the challenges in facilitating philosophical dialogues with culturally/ethnically-diverse groups, especially when prejudice and negative stereotypes towards cultural/ethnic minorities are prevalent. Its focus is on helping children become cognizant of their cultural situatedness and its impact on their thinking and attitude towards dialogue. Underlying this practice is the assumption that Philosophy is fundamentally a worldview and a method that is embedded in the culture where it is created, validated, and used. Such a manner of doing philosophy recognizes that children are active bearers of culture and are entitled to educational opportunities, like P4wC, that can empower them to think for themselves and with others while staying grounded in their cultural backgrounds. Thus, the community of inquiry functions as a caring space where intercultural understanding and critical affirmation of cultures are fostered and sustained. In connection, I suggest that a culture-enabling P4wC teacher should have three desired traits: a) openness to various cultural resources and frames, b) a sense of critical positionality, and c) partiality to the culturally marginalized. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The stigma accompanying major depressive disorder (MDD) increases distress and misery worldwide and may incur worse consequences than the condition itself. Over the last decades public knowledge about mental illnesses has increased, but public mental illness stigma has not decreased. Recent research suggests that endorsement of the continuum perspective on mental illness, particularly depression, has the potential to reduce stigma. We examined the impact of the continuum perspective on mental illness stigma (social distance, negative stereotypes) regarding MDD, hypothesizing that an increased endorsement of the continuum perspective would be associated with lower levels of stigma. Participants, recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk, included 487 adults, randomly assigned to one of two conditions containing different information about the nature of depression (continuum vs. categorical perspective) or to a control condition with neutral information. After reading a vignette about someone suffering from depression, participants completed a continuum-beliefs measure and stigma-related questionnaires. Sociodemographic variables, along with the variable of positive former contact with someone experiencing mental illness, were measured. The intervention did not reduce stigma toward individuals with depression. Higher mental health continuum beliefs were related to lower stigma against people with MDD across groups. Moreover, people assigned to the continuum intervention had significantly higher continuum beliefs; positive former contact was positively related to both continuum beliefs and lowered stigma. While findings suggest continuum beliefs and stigma are correlated, we discuss reasons why interventions seem to not (or only partially) affect stigma directly.

AB  - This explorative study seeks to provide insights into the ways young Muslim adults experience and cope with Islamophobia in Flanders. For this purpose, in-depth interviews with 14 Muslims aged 19 to 33 were conducted in the spring of 2020. Our interviewees defined themselves as Muslims and all had been confronted with racism or anti-Muslim sentiment in their daily life. Depending on reported intentions, we identified seven coping strategies in the face of such sentiment: relativization, avoidance, communication, oppression, conciliation, reaction and passive coping strategies. These forms of coping are not mutually exclusive. They are often used in combination, and they may be interchangeable in some situations. This study seeks to complement and deepen the existing literature on anti-Muslim sentiment in Flanders. Its findings should be considered as a starting point for further deductive testing of the identified typologies, meant to inspire follow-up research and serve as evidence for future policymaking. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - We have seen massive global behavioral change as billions of people radically altered their ways of life in response to COVID-19. Here, we review how research on conformity and deviance can inform understanding of and effective responses to the pandemic. Group identities are critical for understanding who is influenced by whom, as well as how partisan divisions can obstruct cohesive and coordinated action. We identify several questions highlighted by the pandemic, including when people will react more harshly to ingroup members who violate health-protective norms (black sheep effect) or to outgroup members violating the same norms (intergroup hypocrisy). As a working hypothesis, we propose a goal-based approach, positing that differentially negative reactions to ingroup and outgroup deviants are likely influenced by the relative salience of goals to protect ingroup image, enforce group norms, maintain intergroup boundaries, and seek justice for potential victims put at risk by norm-violating behavior. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nations and individuals has almost certainly led to increased feelings of threat and competition, heightened uncertainty, lack of control, and a rise in authoritarianism. In this paper we use social psychological and sociological theories to explore the anticipated effects on xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes worldwide. Based on our analysis, we discuss recommendations for further research required during the ups and downs of the pandemic, as well as during recovery. We also discuss the need for research to address how to best counteract this expected surge in xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes. As the pandemic persists, it will be important to systematically examine its effects on xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes, and to develop and implement strategies that keep these negative attitudes at bay. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - COVID-19 is a challenge faced by individuals (personal vulnerability and behavior), requiring coordinated policy from national government. However, another critical layer—intergroup relations—frames many decisions about how resources and support should be allocated. Based on theories of self and social identity uncertainty, subjective group dynamics, leadership, and social cohesion, we argue that this intergroup layer has important implications for people’s perceptions of their own and others’ situation, political management of the pandemic, how people are influenced, and how they resolve identity uncertainty. In the face of the pandemic, initial national or global unity is prone to intergroup fractures and competition through which leaders can exploit uncertainties to gain short-term credibility, power, or influence for their own groups, feeding polarization and extremism. Thus, the social and psychological challenge is how to sustain the superordinate objective of surviving and recovering from the pandemic through mutual cross-group effort. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Since the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting social restrictions, children’s peer interactions have been altered. Peer interactions help children learn from each other to develop their understanding of conversation, emotion, and group norms. In addition, friendships can reduce intergroup bias and prejudice and increase independence. In this article, we review the ways that peers contribute to children’s cognitive and social development in informal and formal settings. Although restrictions are necessary to control the spread of the virus, social restrictions do not have to be to the detriment of peer relations. Based on evidence in developmental psychology, we end with suggestions for parents, teachers, and schools for how to continue to enable children to engage in peer interactions safely throughout future restrictions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Employees may continue to work remotely for a substantial amount of time, even after the end of the pandemic. Our established theories of group processes and intergroup relations can help us understand these new ways of working and online group experiences. However, there are key differences in computer-mediated and face-to-face (FtF) groups. In this essay, I present some of the extant robust theories and findings from computer communication research to understand virtual working within online groups. These perspectives include that group processes develop over a longer period of time as compared to FtF, informal communication is neglected, computer-mediated groups have some advantages over FtF groups, sociomateriality is a useful theoretical lens, and dispersion affects group member cognitions about each other. I use my own lab’s work on entitativity as an example of how moving from FtF to online group research can deepen our understanding of both FtF and online groups. The essay concludes with recommendations for future research. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Conspiracy theories started to appear on social media immediately after the first news about COVID-19. Is the virus a hoax? Is it a bioweapon designed in a Chinese laboratory? These conspiracy theories typically have an intergroup flavour, blaming one group for having some involvement in either manufacturing the virus or controlling public opinion about it. In this article, I will discuss why people are attracted to conspiracy theories in general, and why conspiracy theories seem to have flourished during the pandemic. I will discuss what the consequences of these conspiracy theories are for individuals, groups, and societies. I will then discuss some potential strategies for addressing the negative consequences of conspiracy theories. Finally, I will consider some open questions for research regarding COVID-19 conspiracy theories, in particular focusing on the potential impact of these conspiracy theories for group processes and intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The shortage of human resources in nursing is a global challenge, and males may play an important role in alleviating this shortage, especially in China. Just as single-sex education has a potentially positive impact on women in male-dominated professions, it may also have the same impact on men in nursing, which may promote male engagement in nursing. This study delved into the experiences and perceptions that are peculiar to male nursing students in a single-sex class. A qualitative, descriptive design was employed using conventional content analysis. A purposive sample of 12 male nursing students in a male-only class of a university in China participated. Individual semi-structured interviews were performed between January and March 2019. Data analysis revealed five themes. Considering the negative peer influence and potential communication barriers of a male-only nursing class, establishing a male nursing student alliance instead of a male-only nursing class may be a better choice. In Asian culture, reconstructing the current social norms of gender is crucial to eliminating prejudice and male dividends and changing the definitions of masculinity, all of which are conducive to the development of male involvement in nursing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Discriminatory behaviors among inter-ethnic relations in schools have long been noted and studied, but there are several correlations between discriminatory behaviors and other constructs that need further investigation. As an example, the relation between perceived discrimination and contextual problems-which include family, school and peer problems-among children and adolescents in Latin America has received little attention from previous studies. Further, the mediating role of ethnic identification and collective self-esteem in this relation also needs to be considered as they could be proven as protective factors for discriminatory behavior and its outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to, first, establish the relationship between perceived discrimination and contextual problems in inter-ethnic students aged 8-19 years living in Arica, Chile; and second, to identify the role that ethnic identification and collective self-esteem play within this relation. In order to investigate this matter, a cross-sectional study was carried out with 3700 students in 29 schools between the fourth year of primary education and the last year of secondary education, aged between 9-18 years, with 48.4% men and 51.6% women. The sample was divided into primary and secondary school groups. The scales utilized were the Everyday Discrimination Scale, Multi-Group Ethnic Identity Measure-Revised Scale, Collective Self-Esteem Scale and the dimensions of contextual family, school and peer problems, as well as the general index of contextual problems of the Child and Adolescent Assessment System. For data analysis, we tested a path analytic model at both the within and between levels to account for the relations between variables. In each group the models obtained an optimal fit. We found that perceived discrimination and ethnic identification were directly related to contextual problems (.23-.39), and collective self-esteem had only a mediating role. This study showed that strategized interventions focusing on ethnic identification and perceived discrimination should be utilized by schools to create a better developing environment.

AB  - This article addresses the extent to which economic downturns influence the perception of immigrants as an economic threat and through which channels this occurs. Our primary objective is an investigation of the specific mechanisms that connect economic conditions to the perception of immigrants as a threat. We therefore also contribute to theoretical discussions based on group threat and realistic group conflict theory by exposing the dominant source of competition relevant to these relationships. Furthermore, we investigate whether people react more sensitive to short-term economic dynamics within countries than to the long-term economic circumstances. Our database comprises all waves of the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2017. The macro-economic indicators we use include GDP per capita, unemployment, and national debt levels, covering the most salient economic dimensions. We furthermore control for the country’s migration situation and aggregate party positions toward cultural diversity. Our results show that the dynamic short-term developments of the economy and migration within countries are of greater relevance for perceived immigrant threat than the long-term situation. In contrast, the long-term political climate appears to be more important than short-term changes in the aggregate party positions. Further mediation analyses show that objective economic conditions influence anti-immigrant attitudes primarily through individual perceptions of the country’s economic performance and that unemployment rates are of primary importance. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Discrimination and prejudice against overweight people is common in Western societies. In this article we aim to understand whether these attitudes reverberate into the school setting, by investigating whether teachers grade overweight students more severely than comparable normal weight students. By relying on the Attribution-Value Model of Prejudice (AVMP) and previous studies, we test a series of hypotheses using data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS SC3) on a sample of students enrolled in the 7th grade (lower secondary education). We used hierarchical ordered logit regression to assess whether overweight and obese students receive systematically lower grades by their teachers in German and mathematics, adjusting for subject-specific competences measured with a standardized test, and a rich set of socio-demographic and socio-psychological students' characteristics (e.g. the "big five"). Results suggested that overweight and obese students were more severely graded in both subjects. The penalty for overweight students, and especially for obese students, was slightly larger in German and in the lowest part of the grade distribution. There was also indication of heterogeneous penalties by gender, with overweight male students being especially penalized in math. Possible ways to help teachers in assigning grades in a fairer way are discussed at the end. Copyright: © 2021 Dian, Triventi.

AB  - Scholars from across the social and media sciences have issued a clarion call to address a recent resurgence in criminalized characterizations of immigrants. Do these characterizations meaningfully impact individuals’ beliefs about immigrants and immigration? Across two online convenience samples (total N = 1,054 adult U.S. residents), we applied a novel analytic technique to test how different narratives—achievement, criminal, and struggle-oriented—impacted cognitive representations of German, Russian, Syrian, and Mexican immigrants and the concept of immigrants in general. All stories featured male targets. Achievement stories homogenized individual immigrant representations, whereas both criminal and struggle-oriented stories racialized them along a White/non-White axis: Germany clustered with Russia, and Syria clustered with Mexico. However, criminal stories were unique in making our most egalitarian participants’ representations as differentiated as our least egalitarian participants’. Narratives about individual immigrants also generalized to update representations of nationality groups. Most important, narrative-induced representations correlated with immigration-policy preferences: Achievement narratives and corresponding homogenized representations promoted preferences for less restriction, and criminal narratives promoted preferences for more. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Sexual prejudice is a negative attitude toward an individual due to their belonging to a group defined by sexual minority behaviors, attractions, or orientations. As no studies assessing sexual prejudice levels among self-identified politicians have been conducted in Portugal, this study was carried out to address this gap in the literature. In addition, we sought to compare differences in levels of sexual prejudice by gender, religiosity, and political orientation. The sample consisted of 302 self-identified active politicians in Portugal, of whom 157 were men (52%) and 145 were women (48%), with an average age of 45.98 years. Study measurement instruments included a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Sexual Prejudice Scale in the Portuguese Political Context. Participants responded to this study’s outreach online, and they received emails that referred them directly to the online survey. The principal results show that, despite moderate overall levels of sexual prejudice among the sample, men and participants with right-wing general, social, and fiscal political views demonstrated significantly higher sexual prejudice scores. Negative levels of political engagement and negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men were significant predictors of sexual prejudice. It is very important to raise awareness of this phenomenon among both politicians and the general public, so that it can be addressed accordingly. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Intergroup relations theory posits that cross-group friendship reduces threat perceptions and negative emotions about outgroups. This has been argued to mitigate the negative effects of ethnic diversity on generalized trust. Yet, direct tests of this friendship-trust relation, especially including perceptions of threat and negative affect as mediators, have remained rare at the individual level. In this article, we bridge this research gap using representative data from eight European countries (Group-Focused Enmity). We employ structural equation modelling (SEM) to model mediated paths of cross-group friendship on generalized trust via perceptions of threat and negative affect. We find that both the total effect as well as the (mediated) total indirect effect of cross-group friendship on generalized trust are weak when compared with similar paths estimated for prejudice. © 2021 Achbari et al.

AB  - Background: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people in Kenya face pervasive socio-cul-tural and structural discrimination. Persistent stress stemming from anti-SGM stigma and prejudice may place SGM individuals at increased risk for negative mental health outcomes. This study ex-plored experiences with violence (intimate partner violence and SGM-based violence), mental health outcomes (psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and depressive symptoms), alcohol and other substance use, and prioritization of community needs among SGM adults in Western Kenya. Methods: This study was conducted by members of a collaborative research partnership between a U.S. academic institution and a Kenyan LGBTQ civil society organization (CSO). A convenience sample of 527 SGM adults (92.7% ages 18–34) was recruited from community venues to complete a cross-sectional survey either on paper or through an online secure platform. Results: For comparative analytic purposes, three sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) groups were created: 1) cisgender sexual minority women (SMW; 24.9%), 2) cisgender sexual minority men (SMM; 63.8%), and 3) gender minority individuals (GMI; 11.4%). Overall, 11.7% of participants reported clinically significant levels of psychological distress, 53.2% reported clinically significant levels of post-trau-matic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and 26.1% reported clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms. No statistically significant differences in clinical levels of these mental health concerns were detected across SOGI groups. Overall, 76.2% of participants reported ever using alcohol, 45.6% home brew, 43.5% tobacco, 39.1% marijuana, and 27.7% miraa or khat. Statistically significant SOGI group differences on potentially problematic substance use revealed that GMI participants were less likely to use alcohol and tobacco daily; and SMM participants were more likely to use marijuana daily. Lifetime intimate partner violence (IPV) was reported by 42.5% of participants, and lifetime SGM-based violence (SGMV) was reported by 43.4%. GMI participants were more likely than other SOGI groups to have experienced both IPV and SGMV. Participants who experienced SGMV had significantly higher rates of clinically significant depressive and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Despite current resilience demonstrated by SGM adults in Kenya, there is an urgent need to develop and deliver culturally appropriate mental health services for this population. Given the pervasiveness of anti-SGM violence, services should be provided using trauma-informed prin-ciples, and be sensitive to the lived experiences of SGM adults in Kenya. Community and policy levels interventions are needed to decrease SGM-based stigma and violence, increase SGM visibility and acceptance, and create safe and affirming venues for mental health care. Political prioritization of SGM mental health is needed for sustainable change. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Although it may seem paradoxical, primary care and mental health professionals develop prejudices and discriminatory attitudes towards people with mental health problems in a very similar way to the rest of the population. The main objective of this project was to design, implement and evaluate two awareness-raising interventions respectively tailored to reduce stigmatising beliefs and attitudes towards persons with a mental health diagnosis among primary care (PC) and mental health (MH) professionals. These interventions were developed by Obertament, the Catalan alliance against stigma and discrimination in mental health. Activists from this organisation with lived experience of mental health diagnosis carried out awareness-raising interventions in PC and MH health centres. The Targeted, Local, Credible, Continuous Contact (TLC3) methodology was adapted to the Catalan healthcare context. The efficacy of these interventions was evaluated using two prospective double-blind cluster-randomised-controlled trials. Stigmatizing beliefs and behaviours were measured with the Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers in PC centres and with the Beliefs and Attitudes towards Mental Health Service users’ rights in MH centres. Reductions in both PC and MH professionals’ stigmatising beliefs and attitudes were found in the 1-month follow-up, although a ‘rebound effect’ at the 3-month follow up was detected. This emphasizes the importance of the continuity of the presence of anti-stigma activities and messages. Attrition rates were high, which can hamper the reliability of the results. Further follow-up studies should enquiry effects of long-term interventions aimed at reducing stigmatising beliefs and attitudes among primary care and mental health professionals using assessment systems that include the measurement of knowledge acquired and actual behavioural change. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Given negative social identity, different perceptions of the structure of an intergroup relation (i.e., stability, legitimacy, permeability) should be related to different identity-management strategies (i.e., social competition, social creativity, or individual mobility) depending on group identification. This is among the basic tenets of social identity theory (SIT). There is surprisingly little empirical support for these postulates in the context of one of the most central group identities: gender. Using a sample of women in leadership positions in Spain (N = 649), we tested relations between structural perceptions and identity-management strategies in a pilot study. Structural equation modeling yielded empirical support regarding social competition, but little for social creativity or individual mobility. Identity-management strategies were related to one organizational outcome (i.e., identification with the organization). The preregistered main study is intended to replicate and extend these findings using a different sample while improving several of the measures used. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Racial attitudes have long been studied for their salience to inter-group relations and the insight they provide into the nature of ethno-racial hierarchies. While research on racial attitudes among Latinos, now the largest minority group in the United States, has grown in recent decades, critical gaps remain. As such, this paper explores Latino immigrants’ attitudes toward Whites, Blacks, and other Latinos across multiple dimensions, including perceived affluence, intelligence, cultural behaviors, and receptivity to contact. We examine cross-group and cross-dimension variation in attitudes in order to evaluate key theories in the literature on racial attitudes, including the effects of socio-demographic factors, social contact, perceived threat, and forms of insecurity. Overall, Latino attitudes do not neatly subscribe to White superiority across dimensions, as they perceive differences in intelligence to be more modest than those in affluence, and rate their own cultural behaviors above those of Whites. Increased contact is associated with more positive views toward Blacks, but more negative views toward Whites and to a lesser extent, other Latinos. Perceived threat results in lower evaluations of all groups, whereas greater insecurity results in negative attitudes toward Whites and Blacks, but appears to push Latinos closer to their own group. Overall, results suggest that among immigrant Latinos, greater integration and social contact reduce White supremacy, rather than simply improving attitudes towards all out-groups, but that the softening of anti-Black prejudice is undermined by perceived vulnerability to crime and anti-immigrant forces. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hmong communities originated in China but today are located across the globe. Salvation, health, and well-being in Hmong tradition are contingent upon pleasing spirits and ancestors. While most diseases are believed to reflect the displeasure of spirits and ancestors, epilepsy is unique in that it portends a heightened capacity for achieving an elevated level of spirituality, which has led it to be deemed honorable by Hmong society members. This stands in stark contrast to some contexts within which epilepsy has been historically understood in the West in which the disease was believed to originate from sin and evil. If and how societal response toward persons with epilepsy (PWE) in Hmong communities differ from that in other Western communities in a way that parallels these differences in beliefs regarding the etiology and significance of the seizures is unknown. Understanding this may have implications that guide efforts in combatting stigma affecting PWE. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article, based on original research from 57 villages in four provinces from North and East India, sheds light on a hitherto unexplored gendered impact of colorism in facilitating noncustomary cross-region marriage migrations in India. Within socioeconomically marginalized groups from India’s development peripheries, the hegemonic construct of fairness as “capital” conjoins with both regressive patriarchal gender norms governing marriage and female sexuality and the monetization of social relations, through dowry, to foreclose local marriage options for darker-hued women. This dispossession of matrimonial choice forces women to “voluntarily” accept marriage proposals from North Indian bachelors, who are themselves faced with a bride shortage in their own regions due to skewed sex ratios. These marriages condemn cross-region brides to new forms of gender subordination and skin-tone discrimination within the intimacy of their marriages, and in everyday relations with conjugal families, kin, and rural communities. Because of colorism, cross-region brides are exposed to caste-discriminatory exclusions and ethnocentric prejudice. Dark-skin shaming is a strategic ideological weapon employed to extract more labor from them. The article extends global scholarly discussion on the role of colorism in articulating new forms of gendered violence in dark-complexioned, poor rural women’s lives. © 2020 by The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the conditions of life of patients with mental and behavioral disorders admitted to a specialized hospital in an inner city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, and their possible relationship with inequities and social exclusion. The information about the conditions of life was gathered through medical records and structured interviews with the patients. The data collected were compared with the recent literature on the subject. We conclude that the conditions of health, life and social vulnerability are associated with changes in family and social relationships, stigma, discrimination and prejudice, and barriers to the exercise of citizenship for these patients. Findings confirm the need for equity in this group's access to the exercise of human rights. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the era of COVID-19, coupled with a community in tune to Black lives, the call to action is now. It is now time to stop, listen, and be intentional in efforts to create sustainable policies and programs that shape the ability to deliver culturally competent care to diverse patients, families, professionals, and communities. Our recommendations for how faculty and academia can decolonize nursing education are delineated in this article. All nursing schools and departments should form a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committee, if they have not already done so. DEI committees can help thread Social Determinants of Health throughout the curriculum, highlight and address microaggressions, and develop formal and informal mentorship programs. As nurses, we must continue the discussion of race with humility but without denial and defensiveness. Subtle racist biases may be unintentionally internalized, and it is our moral and ethical responsibility to recognize these and fight them so that they do not result in prejudicial policy, practice, research, and education. Faculty should celebrate diversity through an exchange of ideas and open communication despite differences in race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, social class, or disability. © 2020

AB  - Various studies have found that reading books about positive interactions between ingroup and outgroup characters, known as media vicarious contact, can reduce prejudice. Focusing on the fantasy saga of The Hunger Games, we examined the effects of negative vicarious contact on collective action across two studies. Specifically, we tested whether reading about fantasy characters living in a postapocalyptic conflictual society with large social disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups leads advantaged group members to display greater willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of the disadvantaged group. Results from Study 1 (correlational survey in the United Kingdom and United States) and Study 2 (experimental intervention in Italy) revealed that reading The Hunger Games is indirectly associated with greater collective action intentions via increased anger toward injustice. In both studies social dominance orientation (SDO) acted as a moderator, but in opposite directions: mediation was significant for low-SDOs in Study 1, and for high-SDOs in Study 2. Results are discussed in relation to the importance of media vicarious contact via book reading for social change, and to the need to identify the contextual conditions allowing to anticipate the specific moderation pattern that is more likely to emerge. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The study aims to identify whether algorithmic decision making leads to unfair (i.e., unequal) treatment of certain protected groups in the recruitment context. Firms increasingly implement algorithmic decision making to save costs and increase efficiency. Moreover, algorithmic decision making is considered to be fairer than human decisions due to social prejudices. Recent publications, however, imply that the fairness of algorithmic decision making is not necessarily given. Therefore, to investigate this further, highly accurate algorithms were used to analyze a pre-existing data set of 10,000 video clips of individuals in self-presentation settings. The analysis shows that the under-representation concerning gender and ethnicity in the training data set leads to an unpredictable overestimation and/or underestimation of the likelihood of inviting representatives of these groups to a job interview. Furthermore, algorithms replicate the existing inequalities in the data set. Firms have to be careful when implementing algorithmic video analysis during recruitment as biases occur if the underlying training data set is unbalanced. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In response to the coronavirus pandemic, several countries have imposed curfews, quarantines, and lockdowns to restrict the spread of the infection among people. India had initiated a nationwide lockdown to combat the pandemic starting from the last week of March until the end of May 2020. But, the lockdown had continued subsequently in several red zones across parts of the country for few months. However, scientists have criticized the government’s abrupt lockdown since it prevented people from preparing for the worst aftermath. Besides, the curfews have blocked millions of impoverished migrant workers from leaving cities to return to their homes in distant rural villages. As a result, the destitute workers have endured enormous hardship and outright discrimination desolately leading to their added physical and mental distress, pain, suffering, and death. Most of the victims of the lockdown have belonged to the economically distressed lower social classes of the Indian caste hierarchy. This article outlines their sufferings triggered by the long drawn-out lockdown episode. © 2020, W. Montague Cobb-NMA Health Institute.

AB  - This research advances a social identity approach to leadership through a meta-analysis examining four novel hypotheses that clarify the nature and impact of leader group prototypicality (the extent to which a leader is perceived to embody shared social identity). A random-effects meta-analysis (k = 128, N = 32,834) reveals a moderate-to-large effect of prototypicality that holds across evaluative and behavioral outcomes. The effect is stronger (a) when prototypicality is conceptualized as the ideal-type rather than the average group member, (b) for stronger prototypes (indexed by group longevity), and (c) for group members in formal rather than nonformal leadership roles. The effect is not contingent on group prototypicality entailing differentiation from other (out)groups. Additionally, results provide meta-analytic evidence of widely examined key factors: follower group identification (which enhances the relationship) and leader group-serving behavior (which attenuates the relationship). Building on these findings, we outline the implications for the next wave of theoretical and empirical work. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Experiences of and concerns about encountering stigma are common among veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One common and serious consequence is self-stigma, which is when an individual comes to believe that common negative stereotypes and assumptions about PTSD are true of oneself. The current study was a pilot randomized trial that evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of the Ending Self-Stigma for PTSD (ESS-P) program, a nine-session group intervention that aims to assist veterans with PTSD learn tools and strategies to address stigma and self-stigma. Veterans (N = 57) with a diagnosis of PTSD who were receiving treatment in U.S. Veterans Health Administration outpatient mental health programs were recruited. Participants were randomized to either ESS-P or minimally enhanced treatment as usual and assessed at baseline and after treatment on clinical symptoms, self-stigma, self-efficacy, recovery, and sense of belonging. Information on mental health treatment utilization for the 3 months before and after group treatment was also collected. Compared to controls, there was a significant decrease in self-stigma, d = −0.77, and symptoms of depression, d = −0.76, along with significant increases in general and social self-efficacy, ds = 0.73 and 0.60, respectively, and psychological experience of belonging, d = 0.46, among ESS-P participants. There were no differences regarding recovery status or changes in treatment utilization. The results of the pilot study suggest that participation in ESS-P may help reduce self-stigma and improve self-efficacy and a sense of belonging in veterans with PTSD. Published 2020.

AB  - In early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the term “infodemic” to describe the velocity at which data can be exchanged among people, in a free virtual space where firms have limited control over the information diffusion. In particular, the diffusion of information on social media has analogies with the transmission (contagion) of social phenomena and infectious diseases. The aim of this research is to model the viral effects of a luxury marketing campaign when adopting negative stereotypes to increase the market share in a growing market. The campaign generated 506,127 likes of celebrity endorsers/influencers and 17,984 comments spread worldwide in a relatively short period, producing a “burst”. Findings revealed the unexpected social burst occurred with negative consumers’ evaluation, which has been amplified becoming dramatically damaging for the brand (brand hate). © 2020

AB  - Social scientists have proposed myriad solutions for mitigating intergroup conflicts. While the literature, such as studies on intergroup contact theory, focuses on intergroup relations, we argue that it is important not to ignore intragroup relations that may benefit or undermine the improvement of intergroup relations at the same time. In this paper, we investigate a typology of eight mechanisms for the behavior of intergroup and intragroup relations. Specifically, we focused on interactions in a triad consisting of an actor paired up with two alters—one ingroup and one outgroup. The triadic network enabled us to theorize and test how intergroup and intragroup relations coevolve. We conducted a vignette experiment to test the intergroup relationship between mainland Chinese and Taiwanese. We found strong evidence for one mechanism for improving intergroup hostility: indirect reciprocity—people rewarded the outgroup for behaving friendly to their ingroup peers. Using agent-based simulation, we predicted that the triadic effect found in the one-shot experiment can continuously improve and stabilize intergroup relations over time. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Understanding the root causes of child mistreatment and abuse should be a key concern of child and adolescent psychiatrists. However, the issue is often framed in such a way that we fail to ask how and why child abuse happens. One framework for the psychosocial motivations behind child abuse is the concept of childism, or prejudice against children. A series such as The Twilight Zone can offer a means of exploring unhealthy adult-child dynamics and applying the concept of childism to better understand them. © 2020 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health

AB  - Adolescence is an important period, marked by significant changes in biological and psychosocial domains. Epilepsy is a chronic neurologic disorder associated with social stigma and prejudice. The etiology of depression in epilepsy appears to be a complex interplay between psychosocial and neurobiologic factors. This period may be too taxing for the adolescent with epilepsy to steer, as epilepsy can affect the development of independence by its social, educational, and mental health effects. The study aimed to compare the burden of depression in adolescents with epilepsy with the general population. One hundred forty-five adolescents with epilepsy and their classmates matched for age and gender were studied over a 9-month period. Zung Self-rating Depression Scale was used to determine the burden of depression in the study population. Among the subjects, 70 (48.3%) had scores in the depressive range to varying degrees compared to 38 (26.2%) controls. The difference in scores was significant (OR=2.628, P <.001). Among the population with positive scores, mild depression category was the commonest for both groups (40% and 22.8%, respectively). There was a statistically significant relationship between gender, seizure type, and depression, whereas there was no significant relationship between age, social class, number of antiepileptic drugs, seizure frequency in the last 12 months, and depression. Adolescents with epilepsy had higher rates of depression than the general population. Hence, there might be need for routine screening of adolescents with epilepsy for early detection and management of depression to improve their overall well-being and quality of life. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - There is a long-standing debate in academic and policymaking circles about the normative merits and economic effects of a universal basic income (UBI). However, existing literature does not sufficiently address the question of which factors are associated with individual support for a UBI. While a large literature in political economy has focused on individual preferences for existing welfare state benefits, it has not analysed the case of a UBI. Using the eighth wave of the European Social Survey (ESS), this article seeks to remedy this gap by analysing individual support for a UBI in 21 European countries. The findings from logistic regression analyses with country fixed effects are partly consistent with the expectations of previous social policy and political economy literatures. Younger, low-income, left-leaning individuals and the unemployed are more likely to support a UBI. Individuals with positive views of benefit recipients and/or high trust in political institutions are also more supportive, while anti-immigration attitudes are associated with lower support. By contrast, the patterns across occupations are mixed and male respondents appear slightly more supportive. Trade union membership is not statistically significant, perhaps because of contradictory effects: unions typically support new welfare state policies but they also have a key role in many existing welfare state schemes and may worry about individuals’ attachment to the labour market. At the cross-national level, support tends to be higher where benefit activation is more pronounced and unemployment benefits less generous. These results suggest one possible reason why countries with high support for a UBI have not introduced it: the mixed support among the left means a pro-UBI coalition has to draw on right-wing voters who may support it only with lower taxes and/or extensive replacement of welfare state benefits, which in turn may further alienate parts of the left. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Objectives: At the end of 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It subsequently spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to investigate the degree of knowledge of young Italians about COVID-19 and their current attitudes toward the SARS-CoV-2 and to determine if there were prejudices emerging toward Chinese. Methods: An online survey was conducted on February 3, 4, 5, 2020, with the collaboration of Italian website Skuola.net. Young people had the opportunity to participate by answering an ad hoc questionnaire created to investigate knowledge and attitudes about the new coronavirus, using a link published on the homepage. Results: A total of 5234 responses were received, of which 3262 were females and 1972 were males. Most of the participants showed generally moderate knowledge about COVID-19. Male students, middle school students, and those who do not attend school, should increase awareness of the disease; less than half of responders say that their attitudes toward the Chinese population has worsened in the last period. Conclusions: Global awareness of this emerging infection should be increased, due to its virulence, the significant risk of mortality, and the ability of the virus to spread very quickly within the community.

AB  - Abstract Objective: We aimed to investigate the relationships between use of media to obtain information on radiation and radiation anxiety among community residents in Fukushima, 5.5 years after the nuclear power plant accident. Methods: A questionnaire survey was administered between August and October 2016 to 2000 randomly sampled residents in Fukushima prefecture. Radiation anxiety toward health and regarding discrimination and prejudice were assessed with 4-and 3-item scales, respectively. Participants nominated their most-used media for acquiring information on radiation by choosing up to 3 sources from 12 information sources listed (eg, local newspaper, TV news, websites, social networking sites [SNS], local government newsletter, word of mouth). We investigated associations of most-used media types and radiation anxiety, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and anxiety regarding radiation's health effects immediately after the accident, using multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: Valid responses were obtained from 790 (39.5%) residents. Acquiring information about radiation by word of mouth was related to higher radiation anxiety toward health. Regarding radiation anxiety concerning discrimination and prejudice, SNS use was related to higher anxiety, whereas acquiring information through Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) TV news was related to lower anxiety. Conclusions: Interpersonal interactions rather than gaining information from media-characterized by unidirectional information exchange-may increase radiation anxiety.

AB  - It has been suggested that physical education (PE) teachers hold strong anti-fat attitudes and that these can have an impact on the health of their students. In this study, we compare the attitudes and stereotypes towards obesity of PE teachers with those of their colleagues who teach mathematics. In addition, we evaluated the association between the teachers’ anti-fat biases and the level of physical activity (PA) of their students. The sample consisted of 81 PE teachers and 75 mathematics teachers. The adolescent sample consisted of 1792 secondary school students. The assessment of attitudes and stereotypes was conducted with the Implicit Association Test and the Anti-Fat Attitudes questionnaire. The PA level of the adolescents was determined by a self-administered instrument. PE and mathematics teachers showed similar biases, except for the automatic obesity–laziness association, which was stronger for PE teachers than for mathematics teachers. These distinctive implicit stereotypes of PE teachers were also significant predictors of the lack of PA in adolescents. We recommend the use of interventions aimed at reducing non-traditional forms of prejudice in teachers. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This article provides an examination of the structure of Islamophobia across cultures. Our novel measure—the Tripartite Islamophobia Scale (TIS)—embeds three theoretically and statistically grounded subcomponents of Islamophobia: anti-Muslim prejudice, anti-Islamic sentiment, and conspiracy beliefs. Across six samples (i.e., India, Poland, Germany, France, and the United States), preregistered analyses corroborated that these three subcomponents are statistically distinct. Measurement invariance analyses indicated full scalar invariance, suggesting that the tripartite understanding of Islamophobia is generalizable across cultural contexts. Furthermore, the subcomponents were partially dissociated in terms of the intergroup emotions they are predicted by as well as the intergroup outcomes they predict (e.g., dehumanization, ethnic persecution). For example, intergroup anger and disgust underpin Islamophobic attitudes, over and above the impact of fear. Finally, our results show that social dominance orientation (SDO) and ingroup identification moderate intergroup emotions and Islamophobia. We address both theoretical implications for the nature of Islamophobia and practical interventions to reduce it. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Researchers have assumed that people judge their own true selves, or their authentic and fundamental nature, to be no better than that of others. This assumption conflicts with self-enhancement perspectives, and with studies on comparative biases in self and social judgment, which assume that people tend to view their characteristics and life prospects more favorably than those of others. The five studies in this article demonstrate that comparative bias operates in self versus other true self comparisons, both with regard to traits (Studies 1–3), and morally relevant behaviors (Studies 4 and 5). Implications for the true and authentic self constructs are discussed. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Empathy for salient outgroups can promote positive intergroup attitudes and prosocial behaviours. Less is known about which factors may promote empathy, particularly among children, in contexts of intergroup conflict. Empathy may depend on underlying cognitions, such as social essentialist beliefs, that is, believing that certain social categories have an underlying essence that causes members to share observable and non-observable properties. This study explored the influence of essentialist beliefs about ethno-religious categories on outgroup-directed empathy, attitudes and prosocial behaviours of children living in Northern Ireland (N = 88; M = 7.09, SD = 1.47 years old). Bootstrapped chain mediation found that lower essentialist beliefs predicted greater outgroup-directed empathy, which was positively related to outgroup attitudes, which in turn, predicted more outgroup prosocial behaviours. The findings highlight the importance of essentialist beliefs as an underlying factor promoting empathy, with links to prosocial behaviours in settings of intergroup conflict. The intervention implications are discussed. © 2020 International Union of Psychological Science

AB  - In this article, I define and measure the new phenomenon of defensive citizenship in Europe. The literature suggests that defensive citizenship engagement is related to attempts by entitled citizens to preserve their threatened interests. It has been on the rise worldwide, especially in Europe. Based on studies and reports on the phenomenon, I argue that defensive citizenship can be assessed among entitled citizens (those born in the country, whose both parents were born in the country) based on mistrust towards political institutions, anti-immigration attitudes and a challenging personal situation. The analysis, based on European Social Survey data, ranks European countries and uncovers concentrations of countries with high levels of defensive citizenship in Eastern Europe. I contend that this phenomenon has significant implications for the democratic functioning of European countries and the stability of the continent. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In this paper, I examine whether agents who commit testimonial injustice are morally responsible for their wrongdoing, given that they are ignorant of their wrongdoing. Fricker (Epistemic injustice: power and the ethics of knowing, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2007) argues that agents whose social setting lacks the concepts or reasons necessary for them to correct for testimonial injustice are excused. I argue that agents whose social settings have these concepts or reasons available are also typically excused, because they lack the capacity to recognise those concepts or reasons. Attempts to trace this lack of capacity back to an earlier culpable wrongdoing will often fail, due to there being no point at which these perpetrators knowingly chose to develop their prejudices. Attempts to ground culpability under some Attributionist accounts of moral responsibility will also fail. This is because perpetrators’ lack of awareness of what they are doing makes it the case that they are not expressing objectionable evaluative judgments in the way required for blameworthiness. Finally, I argue that our temptation to blame agents who commit testimonial injustice is not completely unfounded. Appealing to Watson’s (Philos Top 24(2):227–248, 1996) attributability/accountability distinction allows us to make sense of how some responses to the jurors are appropriate, despite their being excused. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Many individuals who experience psychological, interpersonal, and social distress do not seek help. Deaf and hard of hearing individuals who use American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary language face additional barriers, such as communication inaccessibility, stigma, and prejudice, which can further impede help-seeking. The purpose of this study is to examine help-seeking behaviors and self-efficacy in relation to stressful life events and identity and discrimination factors among a sample of 149 deaf and hard of hearing. Results indicated that there was a low level of help-seeking among the sample despite moderate scores on self-efficacy, high scores on positive identity and discrimination factors, and low scores on adverse life experiences. Self-efficacy scores improved with stronger social networks. The interaction between parents’ communication method and social network mitigated stressful life events scores. Stressful life events and parents’ communication methods were significant predictors of help-seeking behavior. Practitioners can incorporate these findings into their practice assessments and treatment as well as outreach efforts and program implementation. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study expands research on how intergroup contact makes ethnic minority members less prejudiced toward the majority group. Specifically, we propose that perceived group discrimination may serve as an essential boundary condition of the friendship‒prejudice relationship. Accordingly, analyses show that: (a) cross-group friendship predicts less prejudice, (b) perceived group discrimination relates to greater prejudice only among noncontacted ethnic minority members, and (c) greater perceived group discrimination enhances the ability of cross-group friendship to predict reduced prejudice toward majority members. The enhancing effect is inconsistent with previous research. Moreover, we show that perceived personal discrimination does not moderate the friendship‒prejudice relationship. Finally, analyses confirm the unique qualities of cross-group friendship, as perceived group discrimination does not predict greater prejudice when this type of contact is most intense. Analyses are performed on an unusually rich, national probability sample of ethnic minority members fielded in 2017 including 1211 respondents from Denmark. We conclude with discussion of the implications of our findings. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Semiarid regions are often secondary on the national to global (scientific) agenda, especially if abundant vegetation elsewhere draws attention and the local population is considered backwards thinking and poverty-stricken. The Caatinga, our case study, is such a region, home to millions of Brazilians and a vast biodiversity. Unfortunately, a widely uncoordinated land use change and biodiversity decline are happening, while farmers’ livelihoods are at risk. We hypothesize substantial weaknesses in the current governance practices. To explore governance of the less noticed region, we conducted interviews and field visits and complemented the findings with the literature and internet resources. Our multi-method approach combines the social–ecological systems framework with constellation analysis and dynamic modeling. The aim was to understand the current state of governance in the region and identify clues for more sustainable land management. The use and conservation of Caatinga are negotiated at multiple levels, which are only sporadically interlinked. The conversion of forest land into alternative land uses shifts and shares responsibility among different sectors, while cross-sectoral cooperation is rarely observed. The region and its population face massive prejudices. Obstructing attitudes, such as thinking in dichotomies, and paternalistic and opportunistic approaches, are being addressed by some new coalitions taking alternative action. It is unlikely that these isolated initiatives will converge by themselves to a larger transformation toward sustainable resource use. There is a need to bring the dispersed actions in a more focused and coordinated approach, integrating socioeconomic and ecological concerns, values, and partnerships. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This research investigates the effectiveness of messaging strategies to reduce negative tourist stereotyping by residents given the detrimental effects of stereotyping on host–tourist relations. Study 1 examines the effects of two strategies: “prevalence of stereotyping message” (PSM) and “prevalence of counter-stereotyping message” (PCSM), compared to a control group via a between-subjects experimental design. Study 2 investigates whether eliciting a common identity between residents and tourists could further improve these strategies via a 2 (stereotype reduction: PSM vs. PCSM) × 2 (identity: tourists as residents vs. residents as tourists) between-subjects experimental design. Study 3 examines the boundary conditions of these strategies with a group of nonlocal, subgroup residents. The findings show that tourist stereotypes are malleable, and stereotype reduction efforts through communication messages could reduce biases against tourists by residents. This research contributes by connecting concepts on stereotype reduction, social norms, and social identity with tourism stereotype research. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - When asked whether to sacrifice oneself or another person to save others, one might think that people would consider sacrificing themselves rather than someone else as the right and appropriate course of action—thus showing an other-serving bias. So far however, most studies found instances of a self-serving bias—people say they would rather sacrifice others. In three experiments using trolley-like dilemmas, we tested whether an other-serving bias might appear as a function of judgment type. That is, participants were asked to make a prescriptive judgment (whether the described action should or should not be done) or a normative judgment (whether the action is right or wrong). We found that participants exhibited an other-serving bias only when asked whether self- or other-sacrifice is wrong. That is, when the judgment was normative and in a negative frame (in contrast to the positive frame asking whether the sacrifice is right). Otherwise, participants tended to exhibit a self-serving bias; that is, they approved sacrificing others more. The results underscore the importance of question wording and suggest that some effects on moral judgment might depend on the type of judgment. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Native Hawaiian youth in schools frequently navigate assimilationist educational agendas, which inevitably influences their perceptions of self and expressions of mental health. Using an ecological theoretical framework emphasizing contextually based selves, we conducted in-depth interviews with 12 Native Hawaiian high school students about how they navigate experiences with racism and stereotypes, across the school, home, and cultural contexts. Five themes emerged from our grounded theory analysis: (a) cultural pride, (b) positive and negative stereotypes, (c) experiences with racism, (d) self, connection, and land, and (e) cultural generativity. We discuss how the role of ‘aina or land in understanding cultural expressions of self, pride, and the importance of generativity among Native Hawaiian youth. Implications for psychological theory, research, and practice for this group are also addressed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Introduction: Since 2015, increased numbers of refugee families with pre-school-aged children have arrived in Germany. In pre-schools, teachers' professional competence for teaching those children and adapting to their socio-emotional needs has become increasingly important. Previous research linked teachers' stereotypes and cultural beliefs to their self-efficacy and enthusiasm when teaching immigrant children. This study investigated the links between domains of pre-school teachers' professional competence (i.e., negative stereotypes, multicultural beliefs, self-efficacy, and enthusiasm when teaching newly arrived refugee children), and examined whether teachers' professional competence was linked to their perceptions of newly arrived refugee children's behavior problems. Method: In a cross-sectional self-report survey, N = 147 German pre-school teachers reported on their professional competence and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for a selected refugee child from their pre-school group. We used regression modeling to link teachers' negative stereotypes and multicultural beliefs to their self-efficacy and enthusiasm for teaching refugee children. Next, we examined the links between teachers' beliefs, values, and motivational orientations to their ratings on the SDQ subscales. Last, we linked demographic data on teachers and children to teachers' professional competence and SDQ ratings. Results: Teachers with more negative stereotypes toward newly arrived refugee children and less agreement with multicultural beliefs reported lower self-efficacy and enthusiasm for teaching newly arrived refugee children. Teachers with more negative stereotypes perceived more hyperactivity/inattention and total difficulties. Teachers with higher self-efficacy perceived less hyperactivity/inattention, less total difficulties, and more prosocial behavior. Additionally, teachers who had more experience with refugee children reported more negative stereotypes and higher agreement with multicultural beliefs. Teachers having more overall work experience perceived more total difficulties. Boys were perceived to display more externalizing behavior problems, less prosocial behavior, and more total difficulties. Older children were perceived as displaying more prosocial behavior and children from African countries were perceived as displaying more conduct problems. Discussion: Our findings suggest that pre-school teachers' stereotypes and self-efficacy might be related to perception biases concerning newly arrived refugee children's externalizing behavior problems. Implications for the professional development of pre-school teachers and teacher-informant diagnostics of refugee children's socio-emotional needs are discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Chwastek, Leyendecker, Heithausen, Ballero Reque and Busch.

AB  - Introduction: Individuals with disabilities (approximately 20% of the population) experience discrimination and health disparities. Medical school must equip students with expertise to care for patients with disabilities and to identify ableism. Yet, few schools provide curricula that offer a sociopolitical lens for understanding this topic. We developed a disability and ableism curriculum to address this gap. Methods: We developed a mandatory 2-hour session for first-year medical students at University of California San Francisco. Activities included: privilege awareness, student-led discussions, and intervention brainstorming for overcoming health care barriers/biases. The session was evaluated through pre/postsurveys, as well as a follow-up survey 1 year later. Results: In feedback collected during 2018 and 2019, students described the session as meaningful and relevant. Faculty facilitators reported that the session provoked powerful student-centered learning, leadership, and widespread participation. On average the students rated the session 4.6 on a 5-point scale. Pre- and postsession data analysis indicated significant increases in students' self-reported understanding of ableism (p < .001) and confidence in assessing barriers to care for patients with disability (p < .001). One year later, students reported that the session had influenced their conceptualization of providing care to patients with disabilities. Discussion: Through innovative and participatory activities, this small-group session introduced students to important topics such as ableism, the social model of disability, disability history and culture, and health disparities. Our work suggested that creating curricula to equip students with structural frameworks for understanding disability-a topic underrepresented in medical curricula-stimulated student interest and commitment. © 2021 Borowsky et al.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global public health threat over the last few months. Historically, infectious disease outbreaks like the plague, Influenza, cholera, HIV, etc. have generated stigma, prejudice, “othering” and xenophobia, against certain communities. One such prevalent form of xenophobia, is Islamophobia or “fear and discrimination against the Muslims.” Though debated over its various facets and definitions, it is on the rise worldwide. India, being a socio-politically diverse and populous nation, has been facing unique challenges during COVID-19. Considering Hinduism and Islam are the two major religious communities, the subcontinent has witnessed complex dynamics in their relationship throughout history. The pandemic has further instigated Islamophobia, and consequent discrimination, as well as unrest. This can have significant effect of public behavior and health. In the recent past, few legislations in India were interpreted to be Islamophobic and generated nation-wide protest, which provided a fertile backdrop against the discriminative effects of the pandemic. Keeping this in background, this commentary highlights the social contexts of increase in Islamophobia in India during the pandemic, discusses the possible psychological explanations and public health impact, as well as outlines some ways to mitigate it focusing on collectivism. © Copyright © 2021 Ahuja and Banerjee.

AB  - Drawing on the role of teachers for peer ecologies, we investigated whether students favored ethnically homogenous over ethnically diverse relationships, depending on classroom diversity and perceived teacher care. We specifically studied students' intra- and interethnic relationships in classrooms with different ethnic compositions, accounting for homogeneous subgroups forming on the basis of ethnicity and gender diversity (i.e., ethnic-demographic faultlines). Based on multilevel social network analyses of dyadic networks between 1299 early adolescents in 70 German fourth grade classrooms, the results indicated strong ethnic homophily, particularly driven by German students who favored ethnically homogenous dyads over mixed dyads. As anticipated, the results showed that there was more in-group bias if perceived teacher care was low rather than high. Moreover, stronger faultlines were associated with stronger in-group bias; however, this relation was moderated by teacher care: If students perceived high teacher care, they showed a higher preference for mixed-ethnic dyads, even in classrooms with strong faultlines. These findings highlight the central role of teachers as agents of positive diversity management and the need to consider contextual classroom factors other than ethnic diversity when investigating intergroup relations in schools. © Copyright © 2021 Grütter, Meyer, Philipp, Stegmann and van Dick.

AB  - Teachers are caught between the injunction of an inclusive school for all students and the logistic difficulties of such prescriptions. As a consequence, they might be tolerant toward a discriminating peer when they justify the exclusion of students with disability with benevolent arguments. Indeed, people are more likely to accept discriminatory behaviors covered by benevolent justifications rather than by hostile ones. The aim of this experimental study (N = 134) was to test if teachers' willingness to distance themselves from a colleague discriminating against students with disability depends on the justification he/she provided and if attribution to prejudice mediates this relationship. Active teachers read vignettes depicting situations of elementary school student inclusion at school. Through three versions, we manipulated the inclusion of a student with disability by a colleague in his/her classroom (inclusion, exclusion with benevolent justification, or exclusion with hostile justification). Results showed that teachers expressed less backlash and willingness to distance themselves from the colleague when he/she included, rather than excluded, the student and when the reasons for exclusion were benevolent rather than hostile. Finally, attribution to prejudice to the perpetrator mediated the effects of the justification on the distancing measures. These results replicated previous findings regarding the impact of the type of justification on the attribution to prejudice to the case of ableism and show its side effect of willingness to distance from an ingroup perpetrator.

AB  - This work examined whether the endorsement of the culturally idealized form of masculinity-hegemonic masculinity (HM)-accounted for unique variance in men's and women's support for Donald Trump across seven studies (n = 2,007). Consistent with our theoretical backdrop, in the days (Studies 1 and 2) and months (Studies 3 through 6) following the 2016 American presidential election, women's and men's endorsement of HM predicted voting for and evaluations of Trump, over and above political party affiliation, gender, race, and education. These effects held when controlling for respondents' trust in the government, in contrast to a populist explanation of support for Trump. In addition, as conceptualized, HM was associated with less trust in the government (Study 3), more sexism (Study 4), more racism (Study 5), and more xenophobia (Study 6) but continued to predict unique variance in evaluations of Trump when controlling for each of these factors. Whereas HM predicted evaluations of Trump, across studies, social and prejudiced attitudes predicted evaluations of his democratic challengers: Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. We replicate the findings of Studies 1 through 6 using a nationally representative sample of the United States (Study 7) 50 days prior to the 2020 presidential election. The findings highlight the importance of psychological examinations of masculinity as a cultural ideology to understand how men's and women's endorsement of HM legitimizes patriarchal dominance and reinforces gender, race, and class-based hierarchies via candidate support. © This open access article is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives License 4.0 (CC BY-NC-ND).

AB  - Ethnic prejudice can lead to exclusion and hinder social integration. Prejudices are formed throughout socialization, and social norms inform individuals about the acceptability of prejudice against certain outgroups. Adolescence is a crucial period for the development of intergroup attitudes, and young people are especially prone to follow the norms they perceive in their reference groups. At the same time, the effect of perceived norms on prejudice in school classes has been rarely studied. In Hungary, where prejudice against the Roma is widespread and there is no clear social norm proscribing prejudiced manifestations, this topic is especially relevant. In the present paper, based on multi-level analyses of panel data from Hungarian ninth-graders, we find that adolescents adjust their attitudes to those they perceive to be dominant among their classmates and that classmates serve as more important reference groups than teachers do. More contact with Roma is found to be associated with less prejudice against them. Looking at school classes, we find that at the beginning of the school year, many students underestimate the rejection of prejudiced expressions in their classes. By the end of the year, many students are found to adjust their own attitudes to the falsely perceived class norm. Based on our findings, we argue that school classes should be treated as important normative contexts for the socialization of intergroup attitudes and should receive special attention from both scholars and practitioners working in the fields of prejudice research and reduction. Furthermore, we suggest that teachers can most successfully hinder prejudices by working on a common, visible, shared class norm rather than “teaching” students that prejudices are not acceptable. © Copyright © 2021 Váradi, Barna and Németh.

AB  - In higher education, well-designed service learning combines service activities and academic knowledge in reflection, generating essential learning outcomes: academic enhancement, personal growth, and civic engagement. As research on reflection in service learning has shown, the process of reflection deepens through description of service experiences, examination of those experiences and articulation of learning. This article provides a theoretical explanation of deepening the reflection process by incorporating reflection theory and identity theory of college student development, professional development, and general identity development. Expanding the theoretical explanation of the reflective process clarifies the conditions of the deepening student reflection process in service learning in the following ways. First, it focuses on concrete experience then-and-there at that moment rather than abstract impressions by paying attention to personal dissonance in the experience. In addition, it finds discrepancies from differences of views, perspectives, and backgrounds between those of students and others. It connects outward exploration of those differences and inward exploration to construct internal voices toward self-authorship. The deep reflection process requires confronting contradictions through dialogical interplays among the I-positions of their own and others. It bridges discontinuities between past, present, and future selves by expanding the time perspective retrospectively and prospectively, and solving contradictions embedding in their prejudice. Furthermore, it activates plurality in social norms and values. The above conditions should be design principles for deepening critical and dialogical reflection in high-impact service learning. Through deepening reflection in service learning, it can be expected to activate mutuality and support generativity toward solidarity against hostility. © Copyright © 2021 Kawai.

AB  - Eliciting negative stereotypes about ageing commonly results in worse performance on many physical, memory, and cognitive tasks in adults aged over 65. The current studies explored the potential effect of this “stereotype threat” phenomenon on older adults’ emotion recognition, a cognitive ability that has been demonstrated to decline with age. In Study 1, stereotypes about emotion recognition ability across the lifespan were established. In Study 2, these stereotypes were utilised in a stereotype threat manipulation that framed an emotion recognition task as assessing either cognitive ability (stereotypically believed to worsen with age), social ability (believed to be stable across lifespan), or general abilities (control). Participants then completed an emotion recognition task in which they labelled dynamic expressions of negative and positive emotions. Self-reported threat concerns were also measured. Framing an emotion recognition task as assessing cognitive ability significantly heightened older adults’ (but not younger adults’) reports of stereotype threat concerns. Despite this, older adults’ emotion recognition performance was unaffected. Unlike other cognitive abilities, recognising facially expressed emotions may be unaffected by stereotype threat, possibly because emotion recognition is automatic, making it less susceptible to the cognitive load that stereotype threat produces. © Copyright © 2021 Atkinson, Murray and Halberstadt.

AB  - Psychological research and theory focused on distinct racialization and racial identity experiences of Asian Americans are limited. Our article proposes a new measure of ideological values related to Asian American racial identity that draws on Asian Critical Race Theory and Asian Americanist perspectives that emphasize the unique history of oppression, resilience, and resistance among Asians in America. Across three studies with a combined sample of 860 Asian American college students, we created and confirmed the bifactor structure and fit of the 13-item measure of Asian American Racial Identity Ideological Values (AARIIV), with three subscales. Asian American Unity is a cultural response to the discourse on who is included in the category “Asian American” across intersections of social positionalities. Interracial Solidarity is a cultural response to the shared experiences of discrimination and exploitation among all racial minority groups. Transnational Critical Consciousness is a cultural response to Asians in the United States and Asians abroad who share overlapping racialization and discrimination experiences due to white supremacy and imperialism. The three-subscale structure of the AARIIV was supported by a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Evidence of convergent validity was supported as it positively correlated with awareness of racism, critical reflection, critical action, racial centrality, ethnic pride, and ethnic engagement; and negatively correlated with internalization of the model minority myth and colorblind racial attitudes. Evidence of incremental validity was supported as AARIIV predicted colorblind racial attitudes and critical consciousness above and beyond broad-ranging measures of racial identity and ethnic identity. © 2021.

AB  - This study examines the representation of people of color in 10 US general chemistry textbooks published between 2016 and 2020. On average, people of color appear every 320 pages of text, while white figures are observed every 24 pages. The average percentage of people of color in the textbooks (12%) is well below the percentage in the US general population (40%), college population (46%), and science technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce (33%). Of the images that do include people of color, 26% portray explicitly negative stereotypes (e.g., unclean, poor, sick, primitive, unskilled) and only 31% depict STEM activities. Several textbooks in this study were reported in 2007 to contain racial bias, but no evidence of improvement was observed. To understand the persistence of racial bias, biographical information was used to illuminate the values held by the eight scientists that all 10 textbooks have in common. These eight universally prominent scientists include a lifelong supporter and profiteer of slavery, a trustee of the Human Betterment Foundation (an organization promoting mandatory sterilization for "race betterment"), an executive board member of the Swedish Society for Racial Hygiene, an anti-Semitic bigamist, and a modern advocate of eugenics. We posit that general chemistry textbooks reveal two mechanisms by which racial disparity in STEM is preserved and advanced: (1) through the invisibility and negative stereotyping of people of color and (2) via an oblivious idolatry of scientists who have promoted racist ideologies. ©

AB  - Although there are widespread concerns about support for political violence among people affiliated with mainstream political parties, this topic remains largely under-researched. This article examines the relationship between the respondents’ support for political violence and their endorsement of social and political positions that are highly divisive between the left and the right. We collected survey data from a sample of 4,019 respondents from Victoria (Australia). Our analyses distinguished between people affiliated with left-wing parties, right-wing parties, and people with no party affiliation, and found that support for racist and anti-diversity positions is significantly associated with support for political violence across the three groups. Specifically, having negative attitudes to ethnic and religious minorities and having negative attitudes to diversity are significant predictors of support for political violence in the right-wing group. Having negative attitudes to diversity is a predictor of support for political violence in the left-wing group. Having anti-Muslim prejudice is a predictor of support for political violence among people with no party affiliation. Other significant predictors are having anti-democratic views (across the three groups) being male and being young (in the left-wing and right-wing groups) and having experienced discrimination (in the the left-wing group). © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Contemporary writers have taken enormous steps in an effort to re-define and focalize on the prejudiced presentation of the African woman in African literature, with themes that advocate and improve the state of the woman to fully partake in and undeniably, lead socio-political struggles in her society. The study, therefore, aims to explore the Feminist approach to Stylistics as a theoretical framework in addressing the issue of gender inequality by identifying the linguistic features of Free Indirect Discourse in the novel, Children of the Eagle (2002) by Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo. Major findings from the study include; Adimora-Ezeigbo’s use of Free Indirect Discourse is dynamic in her representation of women in the text; education is an important tool for accomplishing the goals of gender equality, advancement and unity. Women must also be encouraged and integrated in the areas of leadership, political activities and electoral process by providing leadership skills through gender-sensitive training. © 2021, Women's Health and Action Research Centre.

AB  - In 1980, Baltimore Voices, a play written from the transcripts of 200 interviews with elderly working-class Baltimore residents taken as part of the Baltimore Neighborhood Heritage Project (BNHP), was seen by thousands of people in Baltimore and on public television. Created by left-leaning oral and public historians, the play was intended to center the voices of white and African American Baltimore residents. However, Baltimore Voices fumbled its opportunity to present a nuanced past to the public through a cascading series of decisions revolving around the ethical question of who had the authority to interpret the oral histories for the stage play and how to frame them for public audiences. Specifically, the play ignored the role of whiteness in shaping Baltimore’s neighborhood history. Instead, the creators saw individual prejudice as the key issue shaping race relations in the city. They forced the stories of Black Baltimore residents into a white ethnic immigrant narrative frame, eliding the privileges that allowed white immigrants to rise in social status and distorting Black history. And they imagined the oral histories and play as modular, with the goal of presenting the history most palatable to the audience. While the theater company practiced sharing authority by giving BNHP narrators multiple opportunities to give feedback during script development, the question remains: when certain community members are more vocal than others, who gets to represent the community? Using extensive archival material, this article discusses Baltimore Voices as a case study of an oral and public history project during a formative moment for both fields. I suggest that progressive oral and public historians at times abdicated their ethical responsibility to frame and contextualize oral history to present complicated histories to the public. Examining whiteness requires this interpretive perspective because the power of whiteness is in its invisibility. © 2021 The Oral History Association.

AB  - Background: There is a scientific prejudice related to the impact of parenting practices on early adolescents’ sexual behavior in Indonesia. The missing aspects of parental get into mischief or risky sexual behavior among youth while sexual education itself is considered taboo in urban areas. This study intended to investigate the correlative pattern between parenting practices toward sexual behavior of early adolescents. Methods: This quantitative, cross-sectional-analytical study enrolled 290 early adolescents aged 10-14 years in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, from May-June 2021. A validated and reliable questionnaire of 30 questions was used to get the Parenting Practice (Permissive, Authoritarian, Democratic) from the adolescent’s perspective. The sexual behavior was collected using 37 questions to categorize the adolescents into Risky, Medium Risk and Non-Risky. The correlative analysis was used to determine the significance (p<0.05), strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Result: It was reported that 184 (63.4%) adolescents had a democratic parenting practice and non-risky sexual behavior. Significant correlation was found (p=<0.001; r=0.978) and strength of correlation (r) was considered strong. A positive correlation was obtained to show that the Democratic Parenting Practice aligns with Non-Risky sexual behavior among early adolescents. Conclusion: Significant findings of this study lead to a general description that democratic parenting practice applied in early adolescents could lead to non-risky sexual behavior. Further study that involves another stage of adolescence (middle adolescence and late adolescence/young adulthood) is required. © 2021, Sanglah General Hospital. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting in memory loss and a severe reduction in the ability to perform activities of daily living. Ethnicity-related genetic factors promoting the development of dementias among African Americans (AA) and increased risk among women for developing AD indicates that AA women with a parental history of AD are at great risk for developing AD. This phase I study assessed the impact of a 12 week, 20-lesson adapted Argentine Tango intervention (n = 24) to a no-contact control group (n = 10) on measures of plasma inflammatory markers, cognition, and motor and psychosocial performance in middle-aged AA woman at increased risk for AD by virtue of parental history. Some woman (n = 16) were also caregivers; thus, the impact of the intervention on caregiving burden was examined in this subset. Preliminary analysis of efficacy was conducted with significance tests on biomarkers and key measures of cognition, including visuospatial and executive function, balance, and strength. After 12 weeks, Tango participants had significantly decreased inflammatory cytokine, including reductions in IL-7 (p = 0.003), IFN-γ (p = 0.011), TNFα (p = 0.011), and MCP-1 (p = 0.042) compared to controls. Large effects were noted for the Tango group on tests of executive functioning (d = 0.89), and inhibition (p = 0.031). Participants in Tango improved in dynamic and static balance (p = 0.018) and functional lower body strength (p = 0.023). Secondary assessment revealed trends favoring the intervention group were noted in spatial cognition and executive function. Moderate effects were noted in caregiving burden measures among the subset of caregivers. These data demonstrate substantial reductions in inflammatory biomarkers along with cognitive and motor improvements through a non-pharmacologic, affordable intervention among a small, well-characterized cohort of AA women with a parental history of AD. © 2021

AB  - This study aimed to identify the structure and socio-cognitive processes of the social representation of autism elaborated by university students. A total of 206 Brazilian university students participated in the study, most of whom were women attending public universities with a mean age of 22 years. The free word association technique was used, analyzed by prototypical analysis in IRAMUTEQ, and open questions were analyzed with thematic-categorical content analysis. The results revealed that the social representation of autism was anchored in mental illness and objectified in the description of Childhood Autism at ICD-10 since the most frequent element of the structure was “child” and the most readily evoked was “illness.” These findings especially suggest that a representation anchored in mental illness implies an attribution of a framework of beliefs and cognitions to autism and autistic people that reflects an atmosphere of many challenges to overcome phenomena such as prejudice and discrimination. © 2021.

AB  - The model minority myth portrays Asian Americans as academically successful and has been criticized for its failure to consider heterogeneity within this population. Utilizing the integrative ecological model of minorities’ development, this review addresses how Asian Americanican children’s and youth’s educational achievement varies according to their family, school, and community contexts. We adapted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist for this review. Based on 48 reviewed articles published between 2005 and June 2020, familial facilitators for academic achievement include supportive and autonomy-granting parenting, high-quality parent–child relationship, appropriate parental expectations and involvement, and social capital. School facilitators are high-quality teaching and teacher–student relationship, and peer support and positive academic orientation. Ethnic-community-based programs and resources promote Asian American children’s and youth’s academic performance. By contrast, Asian American children and youth tend to underachieve in families with hostile parenting, excessive family obligations, and low-socioeconomic status (SES), and in schools with high-rate peer delinquency and racial discrimination or prejudice. Recommendations for promoting Asian American students’ academic well-being are discussed. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - This online experimental study examined the roles of race and student-athlete status in college student perceptions of peers’ academic and intellectual skills and favorability. College student participants (n = 376) were randomly assigned to view a photograph (i.e., Black student-athlete, Black non-student-athlete, White student-athlete, White non-student-athlete) then rated the academic skills, intelligence, and favorability of the respective condition target. Moderation analyses revealed that White student-athletes were appraised as having higher study skills, academic motivation, and problem-solving abilities than White non-student athletes. Moreover, Black student-athletes were rated as less intelligent and less favorable than Black non-student athletes. Results suggest student-athlete status may be an advantage for White studentathletes, but a disadvantage for Black student-athletes in terms of peers’ academic, intelligence, and favorability appraisals relative to same-race, non-athlete peers. Findings imply that Black and White student-athletes likely face different campus experiences, wherein student-athlete status may pose risks of prejudiced peer evaluations and a potentially hostile campus climate for Black students. © 2021 National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education

AB  - The delivery of knowledge about the histories, cultures, and contributions of diverse groups to the students is important for societies and nations. To deliver this knowledge to students, multicultural education has a pivotal role. Particularly, in Muslim populated countries such as Indonesia, the role of multicultural education along with Islamic values has major importance for students. In this way, this study examined the role of content integration, equality pedagogy, empowering culture, prejudice reduction and knowledge construction examined in relation to multicultural equation by considering Islamic perspective. Furthermore, this study examined the role of Islamic values as moderating variable. To examine this relationship, data was collected from the schools in Indonesia. Data collection was made through questionnaire survey in which 5-point Likert scale was used. Data analysis was carried out by using Partial Least Square (PLS). Results of the study shows that; content integration, equality pedagogy, empowering culture, prejudice reduction and knowledge construction play a positive role to enhance multicultural education. Additionally, Islamic values has the ability to promote multicultural education in Indonesia. © 2021 JESTP.

AB  - This essay examines the conversion and assimilation of Shylock's daughter Jessica in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, focusing on her vulnerability in the Christian Venetian society that arises from her race, religion, and gender. Her Christian fiancé Lorenzo and his friends differentiate her from Shylock based on her light skin in order to make her tolerable to Venetians' racial and religious prejudices. As a wealthy heiress, Jessica is a desirable addition to the play's mainstream Christian community struggling with economic instability. Her acceptance by Christians is sealed by Portia's entrusting Lorenzo and Jessica with Belmont's stewardship during her absence. Yet the inevitability of racial mixing, coupled with lingering suspicions about her conversion, casts a shadow of isolation on the newly converted Jessica. Therefore, Jessica's successful assimilation via conversion hinges upon mitigating the Christian anxiety over racial mixing. I examine the strategies that the Christians in the play employ as they seek to alleviate resistance against infusing Jewish blood into the Christian lineage. First, the Venetians in The Merchant of Venice draw from and endorse the Aristotelian medical discourse on the different reproductive roles played by each gender, which minimizes the mother's imprint on the offspring. Second, the text's recurring, peculiar references to blood and wine present Jessica's blood as a pale and thus only a diluting influence. Backed by the Christians' need for her economic contribution, Jessica's “exchange” grants her a more secure position as a Christian convert in Venetian society than she would have as a Jewish woman, yet the ghost of the Inquisition haunts her, as evinced by her closing melancholy. © 2021 ELLAK

AB  - Topics of prejudice, discrimination, and negative attitudes toward outgroups have attracted much attention of social scientists during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the preference for social distancing can originate from the perception of threat. One of the theoretical approaches that offers an explanation for avoidance tendencies is the behavioral immune system theory. As a motivational system that aims to identify and avoid pathogens, the behavioral immune system has been shown to be triggered by various cues of a potential disease threat (e.g., the risk of contracting a virus), which further leads to negative social consequences such as xenophobia, negative attitudes toward various social groups, and distancing tendencies. We present a correlational study (N = 588; Polish sample) that was designed to test mediational models derived from the behavioral immune system theory, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a source of natural disease threat. In serial mediation analyses we show that the perceived threat of COVID-19 translates into greater preferred social distance from foreign individuals, and that this occurs in two ways: 1) via pathogen disgust (but not sexual or moral disgust), and 2) via germ aversion (but not perceived infectability). Both pathogen disgust and germ aversion further predict general feelings toward foreign individuals, which finally determine the preferred social distance from these individuals. The results support the behavioral immune system theory as an important concept for understanding social distancing tendencies. © Authors 2021.

AB  - The increase in the enrollment of immigrant children is posing new challenges for preschool education in Chile. Despite this, few studies have examined the attitudes of educators towards Latin American immigrants as well as other variables that may impact these attitudes. This exploratory research sought to analyze the relationships between out-group threat, cultural self-efficacy and affective prejudice in a sample of 153 students of preschool education. In addition, an attempt was made to determine the extent to which the perceived out-group threat and cultural self-efficacy explain this prejudice. The results show that the perception of out-group threat and cultural self-efficacy explain 34.4% of variability in the participants’ affective prejudice. The relevance of these results for students’ education is discussed. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This paper applies the framework of epistemic injustice to the context of the asylum process, arguing that asylum seekers are typically at risk of this kind of injustice, which consists in their not being considered credible and not being listened to due to prejudices toward their social identity. More specifically, I address hermeneutical injustice in the adjudication of LGBTQ asylum claims, as well as the possibility of developing practices of hermeneutical justice in this context. I start with a general analysis of epistemic injustice in the asylum process, examining the different ways in which stereotypes and prejudices hinder the process (section 1). Next, I focus on hermeneutical injustice in LGBTQ cases (section 2). In section 3, I expand on the possibility of developing hermeneutical justice. Finally, I conclude by hinting at hinge epistemology as a feasible framework for research on hermeneutical injustice and justice, and at broader theoretical themes stimulated by this reflection. © 2021 Edizioni ETS.

AB  - African communities in Australia reflect the rich cultural and religious diversity of the African continent. Despite their persistence and agency, many members from these communities continue to experience a ‘fractured belonging’ due to persistent issues of racism and exclusion; issues that have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Religious community groups and organizations have long played important roles in assisting new migrants with settlement and belonging in Australia, including African migrants. This article presents preliminary findings from an Australian Research Council project on religious diversity and social cohesion, drawing on census data and interviews with African-Australian community and religious leaders in Melbourne and Hobart, from Mauritian, Ghanaian, Ethiopian, Somalian and South Sudanese communities. It explores the roles that religion and spirituality play in both addressing and perpetuating issues of racism, trauma and displacement. It also examines the development of ‘relational belonging’ and diverse, complex and dynamic identities among African migrants in contemporary Australia. It argues the case for retelling the history of African migration to Australia, to subvert the myth of a white Christian nation that excludes non-white Australians. It centres African migrants’ lived experience narratives and theories of belonging developed by African scholars to counter narrow and negative stereotypes perpetuated by political and media discourses. © Equinox Publishing Ltd 2021.

AB  - After recalling the progress made in the diagnosis of the post-truth phenomenon, thanks to recent experimental findings (from cognitive and social psychology) and theoretical work (post-truth versus half-lies and propaganda, degrees in epistemic vice and scale of responsibility), we indicate four other ways to improve our awareness of the scope and mechanisms of post-truth: we introduce some qualifications so as to distinguish between a post-truth world and an Orwellian universe, the negative and positive sides of emotions, an utter contempt for facts, and the sharp dichotomy between facts and values, and between science denialism and blind scientism. Finally, objective truth being taken for granted, we make some suggestions for a “way out”: we should be aware of our cognitive biases and of possible sources of manipulation, cultivate our epistemic virtues, and keep evidence as a prior demand. We should also work in a “scientific spirit,” i.e., refuse any compromise with society, morality, or practice so as to ensure freedom of conscience within an academic and democratic “space of reasons.” But even more urgently, we should avoid some still too frequent misunderstandings about truth itself and about knowledge (which we identify), and remember that post-truth is serious because it is a threat to reality itself: hence we should also take care of our metaphysical prejudices and work to find better ways of ensuring metaphysical knowledge. © De Boeck Supérieur.

AB  - Background. The issue of solitude is fragmentary in gerontological investigations, and is generally interpreted as loneliness: a negative experience of lack of relationships with other people. Ageing people have many variants of loneliness, often connected with their own prejudices or satisfaction with their social contacts. In loneliness, opportunities and rights to the sovereignty of one’s life space can be preserved. Objective. To study loneliness as a fact of life, a multi-dimensional phenomenon, including the feeling of loneliness itself, lack of communication, and ability to be alone. We suppose that senior adults with different levels of psychological well-being are specific in this acceptance of loneliness and ability to find resources in this situation. Design. The participants comprised 129 residents of Kamchatka Region aged 60–82. In the first stage, using C. Ryff ’s “Psychological Well-Being Scale” with midvalues cluster analysis, the respondents were divided into groups with different levels of psychological well-being. In the second stage, the data of the “Differential Questionnaire on Experiencing Loneliness” and “Subjective Perception of One’s Own Life” questionnaire were used for correlation analysis of interrelations between psychological well-being and the “positive loneliness” subscale, revealing the participants’ ability to find resources in loneliness. Results. The research shows that experiencing loneliness in the gerontological cohort is non-homogeneous; it is interconnected with personal attitudes towards positive loneliness, with psychological well-being. It changes the activities of the elderly and the extent of experiencing loneliness. Conclusion. There is cultural mitigation of loneliness in gerontological cohorts and also in their shift from a negative mindset towards an existential one. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2021

AB  - Over the years, media has been invoking 'hegemonic masculinity’ and producing a one-tone representation of men, who are linear, flat, and in line with the traditional definition of manliness. Such unrealistic images of men lead to the reinforcement of prejudice against other genders, which also has damaging repercussions on men. However, there is a noticeable silver lining with the entry of Over the Top (OTT) platforms as they are challenging such representations. These platforms chart out the basic premise of the theory of social construction of reality that helps construct new realities of masculinity, defying 'hegemonic masculinity.' This paper aims to critically examine and evaluate masculinity's representation in various Indian OTT platforms' content and understand how the Indian OTT content is blurring masculinity images instead of what the cultural products are portraying. The paper also intends to analyse the male lead characters and their positioning, which does not compartmentalise men's attributes into the existing patriarchal male image, representing them as real and relatable. This paper substantiates the method of discourse analysis. Three content from Indian OTT platforms are selected with the purposive sampling method - 'Little Things' – Season 1 & 2 on Netflix, 'Made in Heaven' on Amazon Prime Video, and 'Yeh Meri Family' on TVF Play, to analyse along variables formulated to justify the hypothesis – 'Indian content on OTT platforms is blurring the one-tone representation of masculinity'. The paper proposes a revised study of men and masculinity, challenging the patriarchal framework of gender and power for future development in the study. The study posit that OTT platforms have taken a step towards bringing equality among and within genders through their representation to make a difference and build acceptance in society for heterogeneity within masculinity © 2021, Journal of Content, Community and Communication.

AB  - This article draws on the notion of epistemic agency to illustrate how the enactment of shared epistemic agency is enabled or hindered in a mathematics classroom for student teachers. I used data from an ethnographic study that was conducted in a third-year class of mathematics for educators. Data was drawn from verbal interactions that took place between mathematics student teachers, and between student teachers and myself as their lecturer, as they worked on class tasks. A narrative mode of analysing data was employed to synthesise data from critical incidents, while excerpts of these incidents represented data. From this analysis, I argue that, with extended wait time by a facilitator, students’ disposition of epistemic virtues and vices may enable or hinder enactment to epistemic agency, respectively. In article, those vices presented themselves as epistemic stinginess, prejudices against answers by peers and epistemic disclaimer. The epistemic virtues were presented as impartiality and intellectual courage. I further suggest that the recommended wait time of 1–3 during classroom questioning and answering should be extended for classes where epistemic practices are encouraged. © 2022 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).

AB  - The study investigates the satisfaction of religious minorities in Pakistan subject to government policies and attitudes of the Muslim majority. A cross-sectional study design was used to collect data from 120 respondents living in rural areas in Pakistan. Descriptive statistics and the Pearson correlation coefficient were used to measure the relatedness of essential factors of freedom of expression, opportunity in government services, security of unprotected assembly, prejudice in relationship with Muslims and welcomeness in Muslim neighbourhoods. Yeh's Index of Satisfaction was used to measure the satisfaction level of religious minorities with government policies and attitudes of the Muslim majority. The study findings revealed that religious minorities are least satisfied with their citizenship rights in Pakistan, which poses various questions to government policies and legislation. Further, they were also least satisfied with the attitudes of the Muslim majority with whom they must interact in their everyday life. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2022

AB  - In view of certain sociocultural and economic meta-processes, workforce diversity or diversity management become an increasingly important entrepreneurial success factor. Yet, the scholarly examination of diversity in the tourism and hospitality sector is still in its infancy, a fact that applies to qualitative studies in particular. This article addresses the perception of diversity and diversity management within one of the world’s leading aviation corporations, the Lufthansa Group. Following the methodological principles of qualitative social research, this study reports the results of a survey of Lufthansa flight attendants, a stakeholder group that interacts like no other in the area of overlap between the corporation and its customers. Specifically, the survey focuses on Lufthansa’s diversity strategy—based on the principle of “value creation through appreciation” —and how it is perceived by representatives of the cabin crew, in an attempt to identify potential conflicts and prejudices that may arise in the face of employee heterogeneity. © 2021 Cognizant, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: This article investigates female vocational students' strategies for becoming part of a workplace community, what these strategies are and how they are tied to the formation of vocational identities within male-dominated industrial work. Of particular interest is how female students enrolled on Swedish upper secondary industrial programmes experience workplace-based learning at industrial workplaces as part of their vocational education. The theoretical framework derives from Wenger's concept of community of practice, but his theoretical concept does not explicitly include gender dimensions. Therefore, the concept of community of practice is also combined with Paechter's assumption of gender, whereby femininity and masculinity can be considered as different communities of practice. Methods: The article draws on evidence from a Swedish study based on interviews with 20 female students enrolled on the industrial programme at six upper secondary schools. In this vocational programme, there is a distinct gender distribution and only a small minority of the students on the programme are girls. In the analysis, the focus is on the female students' strategies used during workplace-based learning to become part of the work community which consists almost exclusively of male workers. Findings: The female students deliberately negotiated vocational identities as female industrial workers to become accepted in the male-dominated work community. The findings highlight three specific strategies that the female students used: Acting like gender does not matter, acting like boys (not like drama queens), and acting tough and joking around. The female students' strategies were part of - and tied to - a complex vocational identity formation process that featured contradictory requirements. By taking individual responsibility, they identified relevant information for becoming industrial workers and chose to act like boys. The female students saw no problem with being a girl, yet they struggled with implicit, diffuse and hidden gender structures and prejudices in the male-dominated industrial companies. Nevertheless, they strived for what they perceived to be an attractive vocational identity as industrial workers; it was an alternative, atypically feminine way of being that attracted the female students. Conclusions: The study concludes that female students mostly rely on their individual agency when interacting with others in the male-dominated workplace community. A "gendered vocational identity" is formed which shows that the identity formation of female students is a complex double process, in which vocational and gender identities are formed simultaneously and in parallel within the male-dominated workplace. © 2021 European Research Network Vocational Education and Training.

AB  - Ethnicity and racial identity formation are elements of our social world. In recent years, there has been numerous works on ethnicity and race. Both concepts are controversial in different disciplines. The controversies around these concepts have been heated up by scholars who have devoted their time to the discourse of ethnicity and race, and to understand the ascription of both concepts. Ethnicity and race have been causes of conflict, prejudice and discrimination among various ethnic and racial groups around the world. Thus, this paper is an attempt to discuss and critically reflect about race, ethnicity and a post-racial/ethnic future in line with Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze’s idea of the post-racial future. © 2021.

AB  - Background: Homophobia or the reaction against homosexuals could be based on the structural ideology of the society, on its institutions or on power relationships, which can incite contempt, sometimes even to deadly violence, regarding those not complying the national culture reference model. Such behaviors are born from the belief that homosexuality must be fought against and opposed as it threatens social order, and could be increased augmented by the campaigns of politicians spread in the mass media. Methods: The aim of this study is to investigate and compare homophobia in Italy and Spain, two Mediterranean countries related from a cultural and traditional background and for general acceptance of homosexuals, and to verify the role of current national culture on recently rising homophobic attitude. Italian and Spanish subjects were studied by means of self-administered questionnaires consisting of: Modern Homophobia Scale to evaluate homophobic attitudes, Homophobia Scale to evaluate the affective, cognitive and behavioral components towards homosexuality, Stereotype Content Model to identify stereotypes about homosexuality, the scale of 11 Emotions and the subscale of Prejudice Attitude Test assessing the social distance, to assess the prejudicial behavior across the two countries. Results: Results showed that despite homophobia levels are low for both populations, with positive emotion and stereotype, Italians showed a greater social distance and a lower quantity and quality of contacts with homosexuals than Spanish. Comparing for political orientation, ideological right-flaw Italians resulted in significantly higher personal discomfort, aggressiveness and cognitive negativism, and lower quantity of contacts than Spanish. Social distance was higher scored in right-flaw than left-flaw oriented subjects from both Italy and Spain, with Italians scoring higher than Spanish. An alternative interpretation of homophobic attitude in Italy, known for recently rising attempts to homosexuals, was provided in comparison with Spain. Political orientation could provide for the differences observed in social distance in each country, but not between them. Specifically, this study’s results indicate that genderist and homophobic campaigns from the Italian right parties could have transmitted values and attitudes of greater prejudice and rejection towards homosexuals. Conclusions: This research contributes to the objective of raising awareness about the mechanisms underlying the homophobic matrix conveyed from national culture, politics and mass media, and its consequences on psycho-social disease. © 2021. by the Author(s); licensee Mediterranean Journal of Clinical Psychology, Messina, Italy.

AB  - Research on ageism has focused largely on perceptions of and biases targeting older adults, implicitly assuming that age-based stigma increases throughout the life span and that young adults benefit from favorable views relative to their older counterparts. In a series of eight studies (N = 2,323), we provide evidence to the contrary. We theorize that, in sharp contrast with ageism toward older adults, which revolves around fear and discomfort with the target’s later life stage, youngism (i.e., ageism toward young adults) is primarily generationally focused, aiming at contemporaneous generations of young adults rather than young adults in general. Consistent with this theorizing, we find that today’s young adults are ascribed a mixed stereotype content (Study 1a–1c), subject to harsher social judgments than both older age groups (Study 2) and recollections of former generations at the same age (Study 3a and 3b), and victim of discriminatory behaviors (Study 4 and 5). By comprehensively documenting cognitive, emotional, and behavioral evidence of youngism, the present work challenges the idea that ageism only reflects a plight of later-life aging. Instead, we show not only that ageism can target other age groups but also that the nature and content of ageism vary across the life span. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Families in the United States are rapidly changing, and the normative familial model of two married, monogamous, heterosexual parents with children no longer reflects the majority of U.S. families. Nonetheless, state incentive-based policies and discriminatory family laws continue to enforce heteronormative monogamy. Recent changes to the U.S. legal landscape have produced limited formal recognition and protections for same-sex couples and LGBTQ parents, and even these narrow rights are withheld from other diverse familial configurations including families with polyamorous parents. This article uses the concept of sexual citizenship to frame the analysis of U.S. family courts’ normative construction of family, identifying striking parallels between family courts’ historical and contemporary prejudicial treatment of LGBTQ parents and the institution’s similar delegitimization and denigration of polyamorous parents today. This paper reviews polyamorous parents’ efforts towards achieving legal and societal legitimatization, finding significant parallels with legal strategies LGBTQ parents utilized to seek legal recognition and protection prior to federal recognition of same-sex marriage. This paper highlights the inadequacies of such a formal sexual citizenship approach, finding that a limited strategy of accumulating specific sexual rights fails to address non-monogamy’s more radical cultural presence as well as the (non-legal) informal aspects of belonging needed to improve the livability of polyamorous parents’ and their children’s lives. This paper concludes with recommendations for improving the treatment of non-traditional families including LGBTQ, polyamorous, and other blended families, both within and outside the legal institution. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - According to relevant researches, the participation of private enterprises plays a vital role in boosting the efficiency of PPP projects. However, private enterprises, important parties for social capital, only occupy a relatively low share of PPP market in China. Furthermore, there is a large gap between private enterprises and state-owned enterprises. In response to the low participation of private enterprises, existing researches have explored the barriers of private enterprises to participate in PPP projects from macro-environmental factors, project factors, and government factors. As a result, the economic level of the country, profits and risks of projects, prejudices of the government and the natural monopoly of state-owned enterprises can give rise to the decreased participation willingness of private enterprises. However, since these researches mainly conduct questionnaire surveys or apply methods to specific projects for targeted discussions, they are short of constructing theoretical models and empirical researches. In order to figure out the low participation of private enterprises, this paper interprets cooperative willingness of private enterprises. In other words, this paper regards cooperative willingness as the research object, starts from the perspective of private enterprises, explores the influencing factors and influencing paths of private enterprises' participation, theoretically discusses private enterprises' participation behavior and conducts empirical verification. Based on the Social Exchange Theory and Prospect Theory, this research proposes the relational embeddedness affecting the participation of private enterprises from the perspective of informal contracts and implicit incentives. With the construction of a chained mediation model, this paper explores the mechanism of relational embeddedness affecting cooperation willingness, proposes a dual governance path to solve the low cooperative willingness of private enterprises, namely “relational embeddedness-opportunistic behavior of government departments-cooperative willingness of private enterprises” and “ relational embeddedness-cooperation risks-cooperative willingness of private enterprises”. As for questionnaire surveys, this study distributes questionnaires to employees of private enterprises online and offline, collects 306 valid questionnaires and constructs a structural equation model for hypothesis testing. The research results demonstrate that: (1) The relational embeddedness of public sectors and private enterprises will have a positive effect on the cooperative willingness. (2) The perception of opportunism by private enterprises partially plays the mediating role between relational embeddedness and cooperative willingness. (3) The perception of cooperative risks by private enterprises partially plays the mediating role between relational embeddedness and cooperative willingness. (4) The perception of opportunism and cooperative risks by private enterprises has a chained mediating effect between relational embeddedness and cooperative willingness. If private enterprises and public sectors establish a higher level of relational embeddedness, it can lower the perceived opportunism, reduce the perceived cooperative risks and elevate cooperative willingness. By virtue of empirical analysis, this research reveals the multiple acting paths of relational embeddedness on cooperative willingness with the perception of opportunism and cooperative risks as the mediation, replenishes researches on the antecedent variables of cooperative willingness from informal perspective and recessive motivation, enriches the relevant research literature on cooperative willingness, supplies a new perspective and thought for the theoretical study of PPP, and provides theoretical guidance for enhancing the participation of private enterprises. In terms of practical value, this research proposes a method to solve the low cooperative willingness of private enterprises, which is conducive to deeply and clearly recognizing the importance of relational embeddedness, perception of opportunism and cooperation risks by the public sectors in enhancing the cooperative willingness of private enterprises. Firstly, the establishment of an accountability mechanism can constrain government departments' default behavior through information disclosure in the process of PPP projects, thereby effectively reducing the occurrence of opportunistic behavior of the government and eliminating the perception of opportunism by private enterprises. Secondly, the creation of an information sharing platform and the improvement of information disclosure system can hyalinize and normalize PPP market and eliminate the hysteresis quality and asymmetry of information flow between private enterprises and government departments. Lastly, the construction of a PPP credit system and supervisory mechanism can contribute to preferably regulating PPP market, restricting behavior of both parties, lowering the perception of cooperative risks by private enterprises, and promoting the long-term and stable development of PPP projects. © 2021.

AB  - In diverse societies, peaceful intergroup relationships are necessary. Using a minimal groups paradigm, we randomly assigned 188 ethnically diverse U.S. 4 and 5-year-olds to groups with different norms about intergroup relationships. Some were given positive norms (e.g., their ingroup talks, shares, and plays with the outgroup), others were given negative norms (e.g., their ingroup does not talk, share, or play with the outgroup), and others were given no norms. Children then participated in a live and unexpected intergroup interaction. Broadly, the descriptive norms affected children’s interactions with the outgroup member. For example, those given positive norms, compared to no norms, were more likely to communicate, share, and show positive affect with the outgroup member. Implications for intergroup conflict, particularly from a developmental perspective, are discussed. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - A concerning post-secondary education gap exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals in Canada. One program designed to help address this issue, the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP), provides eligible First Nations students with post-secondary education funding. Although such programs are beneficial, it is unclear how much Canadians support public funding of Indigenous education and whether psychological research can help explain why some may endorse or oppose it. Thus, using the PSSSP as an example, we examined five possible psychological predictors of public support: personal prejudice toward Indigenous Peoples, perceived social mobility, meritocratic beliefs, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that all would negatively relate to support for the PSSSP. In a sample of non-Indigenous Canadian adults, we found that only higher personal prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism uniquely explained lower support for the program (or conversely, lower prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political liberalism were related to higher program support). Although correlational, this study provides insight into factors that may influence Canadians’ attitudes toward a program aimed at addressing a consequential societal inequality. We discuss the implications of these findings in regard to support for programs and policies targeted at marginalized groups. © 2021 Canadian Psychological Association

AB  - In 1950, the cultural anthropologist Alfred Métraux, a student of Marcel Mauss, was appointed to head a new Race Bureau at UNESCO in Paris whose mission was to combat racism with the tools of social science. Métraux had worked in the Americas since the 1930s, and his appointment allowed French social scientists to join the global struggle to remove prejudice ‘from the minds of men’. To what extent did French scholars help shape Métraux’s efforts, given that at the time American sociologists and social psychologists dominated the study of race relations? Booklets commissioned by UNESCO and authored by French and American scientists in the early 1950s suggest that linguistic and conceptual barriers made cross-national discussions of race difficult, but not impossible. Thanks in part to Métraux’s campaign, the social scientific study of race relations in post-war France began earlier than is typically remembered. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Psychological essentialism has played an important role in social psychology, informing influential theories of stereotyping and prejudice as well as questions about wrongdoers’ accountability and their ability to change. In the existing literature, essentialism is often tied to beliefs in shared biology—that is, the extent to which members of a social group are seen as having the same underlying biological features. Here we investigate the possibility of “value-based essentialism” in which people think of certain social groups in terms of an underlying essence, but that essence is understood as a value. Study 1 explored beliefs about a wide range of social groups and found that both groups with shared biology (e.g., women) and shared values (e.g., hippies) elicited similar general essentialist beliefs relative to more incidental social categories (e.g., English-speakers). In Studies 2–4, participants who read about a group either as being based in biology or in values reported higher general essentialist beliefs compared with a control condition. Because biological essences about social groups have been connected to a number of downstream consequences, we also investigated two test cases concerning value-based essentialism. In Study 3, beliefs about both shared biology and shared values increased inductive generalizations about the social group relative to control, but in Study 4, only the shared biology condition reduced blame for wrongdoing. Together these findings join with recent work to support a broader theoretical framework of essentialism about social groups that can be arrived at through multiple pathways, including, in the present case, shared values. © 2021.

AB  - The current study examined the developmental trajectory of same-race friendship preference of racially/ ethnically diverse students over the course of middle school. Participants were African American, Asian, Latinx, and White youth recruited at the start of middle school in 6th grade (N = 4,361; Mage = 11.33 years) and followed across the 3 years of middle school. School racial/ethnic diversity and the racial/ethnic representation of students in their academic classes, including honors classes, were examined as predictors of friendship preferences over time. Results from latent growth curve models revealed that same-race friendship preference increased over the course of middle school and was shaped by both the school and classroom racial/ethnic context, above and beyond availability. Greater school racial/ethnic diversity predicted steeper increases in same-race friendship preference over time for all racial/ethnic groups. However, there were interactions involving race/ethnicity when the analyses focused on how students were represented in their academic classes compared with school. African American and Asian youth who were underrepresented in honors classes showed steeper increases in same-race friendship preference over time. Implications for prejudice reduction and creating more inclusive school environments are discussed © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - Emerging methods for studying cultural dynamics allow researchers to investigate cultural change with newfound rigor. One change that has recently attracted the attention of social commentators is “concept creep,” the semantic inflation of harm-related concepts such as trauma, bullying, and prejudice. In theory, concept creep is driven distally by several recent cultural and societal trends, but psychology also plays a proximal role in developing and disseminating expansionary concepts of harm. However, there have been few systematic attempts to document concept creep and none to explore factors that influence it. The present work reviews concept creep from the perspective of cultural dynamics and lays out a conceptual framework for exploring processes implicated in it. Illustrative analyses are presented that apply computational linguistic methods to very large text corpora, including a new corpus of psychology article abstracts. They demonstrate that harm has risen steeply in prominence both in psychology and in the wider culture in recent decades, and that harmrelated concepts have inflated their meanings over this period. The analyses also provide evidence of dynamic relationships between the prominence and semantic breadth of harmrelated concepts, and between psychology and the culture at large. Implications are drawn for theory and research on concept creep. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - To examine whether implicit social cognition is developmentally stable or variable, this study investigated three primary types of implicit social cognition (self-esteem, the gender-science stereotype, and racial attitude) across 2 years in a sample of Chinese adolescents and emerging adults (N = 608; 56% female; 15-to 27-year-olds). Rank-order stability analyses indicated that implicit self-esteem and implicit racial attitude manifested low stability (r =.16,.19, respectively), whereas implicit gender-science stereotype was highly stable (r =.75). Latent change score model analyses showed that: (a) the mean level of implicit self-esteem decreased across the 2 years, whereas the mean levels of implicit gender-science stereotype and implicit racial attitude manifested no changes; (b) individual changes were heterogeneous for all the three types of implicit social cognition (while some of the participants manifested increasing tendencies, 15%–46%, the others exhibited decreasing tendencies); (c) 30% of participants manifested similar changes across the three types of implicit social cognition (either increasing or decreasing over time on all three), while the remaining participants exhibited distinct changes across them. Together, these findings indicate that, developmentally, implicit social cognition is variable but also stable, though the degree of variability and stability vary across individuals and domains © 2021.

AB  - Human societies are not static. Attitudes, norms, institutions, behavior, and cultural products shift over time, sometimes with dizzying speed. However psychological science has either largely ignored cultural change or tacitly treated it as a source of noise. These changes in fact have important implications not only for psychological theory and research, but also policy, public health, and daily life. The present special issue draws together cutting-edge research and theory that addresses what one might think of as “the What,” the “Why,” and the “How” of cultural change. The articles encompass a range of theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches and focus on a diverse set of phenomena and processes ranging from personality to prejudice, to collective memory. Here we provide a brief overview and introduction, laying out our hopes to encourage more psychologists to consider cultural change in their own research and to join us in the emerging field of cultural dynamics. © 2021.

AB  - In this paper I argue that there are possible cases in which the demands of justice and the norms of epistemology cannot be simultaneously satisfied. I will bring out these normative clashes in terms of the now-familiar phenomenon of testimonial injustice (Fricker 2007). While the resulting argument is very much in the spirit of two other sorts of argument that have received sustained attention recently–arguments alleging epistemic partiality in friendship, and arguments that motivate the hypothesis of moral encroachment on the epistemic–I suggest how the argument from epistemic injustice differs from, and is stronger than, both of those arguments. The implications of the present argument are several: we must (i) reconceive the role of identity-prejudice in testimonial injustice, (ii) modify the way we think about how justice and epistemology bear on testimonial transactions, and (iii) understand the mutuality of speech exchanges in ways that do not privilege any particular participant’s epistemic perspective. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recently, interest in the first/last mile has increased with the development of personal mobility vehicles (PMVs), a new eco-friendly and easy-to-use transportation mode. As shared transportation has become more active, existing pedestrians have begun using shared PMVs (e.g., e-scooters and bicycles). The main purpose of this work is to compare and analyze the travel characteristics of each shared-PMV usage group and short-distance travel group, interpret intergroup relations, and calculate the benefits of introducing shared-PMV as an alternative means of short-distance travel. First, the data of shared-PMV usage in Korea were analyzed to understand the characteristics (average number of days of use, average time of use, user growth rate, etc.) of the shared-PMV usage group. Mobile data analysis distinguishes the travel mode and extracts short-range travel groups that fit the scope. The travel modes are distinguished by the variables of mobile data (travel speed, department time, travel distance, travel time, etc.), and the short-distance group consists of short-distance passenger cars and pedestrians (main mode and access mode). This study presents similarities and differences between shared-PMV and short-distance groups via mobile data and evaluates the time, cost, and environmental benefits of introducing shared PMVs as a medium distance. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of meanings produced by the speechess of health managers about the Policy Transfer of Directly Observed Treatment of Tuberculosis. METHOD: Qualitative study developed in 2017 with six managers working in health services located in municipalities in the state of Paraíba. The corpus, constituted by interviews, was analyzed by Discourse Analysis. RESULTS: The speeches expressed aspects favorable to the operationalization of the policy transfer process, such as investing in human, technological, physical and material resources; coordinating management in the organization of the network and raising the awareness of the professionals involved. Barriers were identified, such as the prevalence of cases in the Reference Unit; professional turnover; prejudice and social vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that financial investments, government pacts and commitment of the actors involved in the production of care are necessary to carry out the policy transfer process in the municipalities investigated.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between two forms of religious discrimination (religious prejudice and environmental discrimination) and life satisfaction in a sample of Muslim Americans. Based on the framework of minority stress theory, we hypothesized that higher levels of religious prejudice (distal stressor) and environmental discrimination would significantly relate to higher fear for safety (proximal stressor) and, in turn, would relate to lower life satisfaction. A total of 192 Muslim American participants (Age M = 27.87) completed an online survey about their experiences. Women made up almost 75% of the sample. Findings revealed that higher religious prejudice as well as environmental discrimination were both significantly related to lower life satisfaction and that fear for safety partially mediated both of these relationships. Findings help illustrate that Muslim Americans are impacted by the social-political climate of Islamophobia and can experience religious discrimination in different ways. In addition, women and younger participants expressed higher fear for safety when compared to men and older participants. Professionals who work with individuals from the Muslim community are encouraged to consider the chronic and ongoing impact of stress that Muslim Americans face especially within some Islamophobic environments in the United States. © 2021 Michigan Publishing.

AB  - Race and racial attitudes are central to American politics. To understand these relationships, scholars often use measures developed in earlier social and political contexts. A key issue is thus whether such measures consistently capture the same construct across varied contexts. Changes in the social and political context may result in generational differences in how people interpret certain racial attitude items given different socialization experiences. Such differences make generational comparisons on these items invalid because the items capture different considerations. I build on recent work investigating this possibility and test the racial resentment measure's equivalence between Millennial and older Whites. Despite potential generational differences, I find that the racial resentment measure operates equivalently across generations using two different analytical approaches (retrospective thought-listing and multi-group confirmatory factor analysis). The racial resentment measure offers valid insights into racial attitudes across generational cohorts. I conclude by discussing what this finding implies for emerging work on the manifestations of prejudiced attitudes among Millennial Whites and also suggest potential points of improvement for the measure. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - For decades, Indigenous education in Canada has implemented policies that provide a more culturally relevant curriculum for Indigenous students. It is thought that such a curriculum will improve morale and academic success in Indigenous students. Despite these efforts, a gap still exists between Indigenous students and their counterparts. Little attention has been given to the role that race and racism plays in the lives of Indigenous students. This study examines whether a need exists for race and racism to be addressed in the public school system. Using an Indigenous research methodology, a survey was administered to elicit non-Indigenous attitudes towards the Indigenous peoples of Canada. It was found that in the absence of an antiracist education, non-Indigenous students held negative perceptions of Indigenous peoples, as well as lacked an understanding of racism and its significance. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In social movements, activists may belong to either the disadvantaged or the advantaged group (e.g., Black racial justice activists or White racial justice activists). Across three experimental survey studies, we examined the content of these stereotypes by asking participants to freely generate a list of characteristics to describe each target group—a classic paradigm in stereotype research. Specifically, we examined the stereotypes applied to Black and White activists within racial justice movements (Study 1, n = 154), female and male activists within feminist movements (Study 2, n =134), and LBGT and straight activists within Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender movements (Study 3, n =156). We found that the “activist” category was consistently differentiated into subcategories based on group status: Disadvantaged group activists were stereotyped as strong and aggressive, whereas advantaged group activists were stereotyped as altruistic and superficial. These findings underscore the importance of considering status differences to understand the social perception of activists. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - National mechanisms of migrant integration into the host society and the wider social context in which migration occurs may affect the construction of public attitudes towards migrants regardless of their origin or status. By combining the data of two international studies: the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) and the European Social Survey (ESS), this paper examines national policies regarding migrant integration and the public perception of migrants in the host society in selected European countries. This analysis highlights especially the shifts in public attitudes as possible consequences of the 2015/2016 European “migration crisis”. The data from 27 European countries that participated in the last waves of both MIPEX2020 and ESS2018 were analysed according to the four-dimensional MIPEX categorisation: 1) Comprehensive integration, 2) Equality on paper, 3) Temporary integration, and 4) Immigration without integration (Integration denied). These categories of states’ migration policies were then combined with the public perceptions of immigrants examined by the ESS. Multilevel regression models demonstrated that the respondents from countries with well-developed integration policies express a more positive attitude towards immigrants and acknowledge their contribution to all areas of the host society. A higher proportion of non-EU-27 immigrants in the country correlates with a more negative perception of immigrants’ impact on the host country. Even though the MIPEX score does not reflect clearly the shift in migration policies affected by the European “migration crisis”, it could be considered a stable, though relatively weak predictor of anti-immigrant prejudice. In conclusion, this study’s findings suggest that better-developed policies of political participation and immigrant inclusion foster more positive attitudes towards immigrants. © 2021, Croatian Sociological Association.

AB  - School violence is a global public health epidemic, with students with disabilities at a significantly greater risk than their non-disabled peers. Students with disabilities are more vulnerable to school violence from peers, teachers, and school staff due to stereotypes and prejudice. Teachers are pivotal in preventing violence and intervening, but literature on the role that teachers play in responding to disability-based violence is limited. Guided by the social–ecological framework of bullying, this qualitative study explored educators’ responses to school violence against students with disabilities in Zambia. Data generation included document review, interviews, and focus groups with 33 teachers and 12 parents, and child-friendly methods with 90 students with disabilities. Findings illuminated that students with disabilities are less safe in schools. Teachers are not responding to violence seen or heard about due to stigmatizing beliefs and cultural norms surrounding disability and violence, with students with disabilities blamed for the violence and the response being their burden. Students with disabilities felt protected by special education teachers; however, disability-based stigma did not end with the student. By association, special education teachers were experiencing stigma from other teachers and were discouraged to respond. This stigma undermined the support special education teachers could provide to decrease school violence. Findings provide direction so teachers can respond to school violence in prosocial ways that create an environment where students with disabilities feel safe. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objective: to identify the social representations of transvestite sex professionals regarding quality of life. Material and Method: a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory study, anchored in the Theory of Social Representations, developed with seven professional transvestites of sex. The data production was carried out with semi-structured interviews and later transcribed, validated and analyzed from the Thematic Content Analysis. Results: three categories emerged: 1) Access to health as a principle to quality of life; 2) Support of non-governmental organizations in the visibility and respect to the demands of the trans population and 3) Social ties as a propositional tool in the meaning of quality of life. Final considerations: the representations are located in the need to access health services free of prejudice; in the support of non-governmental organizations in the recognition of their potentialities and singularities, establishing affective bonds of support, loyalty and trust; and in the establishment of social bonds produced with neighbors and friends to face the difficulties experienced daily. © 2021.

AB  - Video games are an increasingly popular form of entertainment. However, despite declining acceptability in many social contexts, prejudiced behavior remains common in online gaming. We explore the possibility that prejudiced behavior is more normative in video games than in the real world by comparing people’s perceptions of the norms across these contexts. In Study 1, we demonstrate that prejudiced behavior is more normative in online video games than in the real world. In Study 2, we show that not all video games are equal—prejudiced behavior is perceived as more common and less offensive in action and role-playing games than puzzle games or face-to-face interactions. This research suggests that norms about prejudiced behavior are different in online gaming than in other contexts; interventions targeted to genres where prejudiced behavior is most frequent and accepted may be effective at shifting social norms and by doing so, reducing prejudiced speech in these contexts © 2021.

AB  - Research on stereotype formation has proposed a variety of reasons for how inaccurate stereotypes arise,focusing largely on accounts of motivation and cognitive efficiency. Here, we instead consider how stereotypesarise from basic processes of approach and avoidance in social learning. Across five studies, weshow that initial negative interactions with some members of a group can cause subsequent avoidanceof the entire group, and that this avoidance perpetuates stereotypes in two ways. First, when informationgain is contingent on approaching the target, avoidance restricts the information available with which toupdate one’s beliefs. Second, computational models that consider the perceiver’s full reinforcement historydemonstrate that avoidance directly reinforces itself, such that initial avoidance of group membersincreases the probability of later acts of avoidance toward that group. Finally, we find initial evidencefor a potential dissociation between behavior and explicit beliefs, with avoidance reinforcing avoidantbehaviors without necessarily affecting self-reported beliefs. Overall, these results suggest that avoidancebehaviors toward members of social groups can perpetuate inaccurate negative beliefs and expectationsabout those groups, such that initial interactions with a group have a compounding effect onoverall impressions © 2021.

AB  - In South Africa the segregation laws of the apartheid years had an impact on contacts and interactions between cultural groups, which led to prejudice, intolerance and painful intercultural experiences. The influence of the past is still evident in present-day South African society, despite greater mobility between different cultural groups. This paper reports on four research studies that investigated how social work and the arts together can explore ways to facilitate contact between diverse groups that will lead to positive experiences. The aim of these studies was to create an opportunity to develop intercultural awareness through joint music-making in an attempt to address prejudice and intolerance. The paper will firstly discuss how a transdisciplinary approach can be utilised. Secondly, the paper posits that making music together is a way to assist diverse groups to explore their own cultural understandings, to ‘hear the voices’ of other cultures, and to move towards greater intercultural awareness that could enhance tolerance in a diverse society. Thirdly, the hermeneutical perspective will be presented as an aspect of the process to support the development of awareness between diverse groups. Concluding recommendations focus on how making music together can become a form of intercultural social work. © 2021 South African College of Music, University of Cape Town.

AB  - Objective: Improving dementia diagnosis rates are a key feature of dementia strategy and policy worldwide. This study aimed to explore the experience of carers of people diagnosed with dementia during or following a hospital admission in order to identify factors that had prevented them from seeking help beforehand. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 informal carers including adults caring for a parent, a friend or a spouse diagnosed with dementia between 2010–2019, following an acute hospital admission for a physical health problem, having not sought help previously. Main Findings: Carers created a ‘bubble of normalisation’ around themselves and the person living with dementia (PLWD) to reject the label of dementia and protect the PLWD from a loss of independence, discrimination and prejudice they felt would be the result of a diagnosis. Carers struggled to talk to the PLWD about dementia reinforcing denial and stigma. Post-diagnosis carers felt unsupported and questioned the value of diagnosis. Principal Conclusions: Stigma related to images of dementia as a disease that takes away independence and identity prevented discussion about dementia between carers and the PLWD. A lack of open discussion about memory concerns between health care professionals and carers also served to delay diagnosis. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The goal of this study was to apply insights from social identity gratifications and ethnic/racial identity development frameworks to better understand how adolescents perceive, select, and avoid media content which has the potential to damage self-and group-concept. We conducted focus groups with 32 Latino adolescents aged 13 to 15. We found mixed evidence that youth prioritized the ethnicity of characters in program selection. Most referenced personality or age as the primary identity-based factors of interest. Although students widely recognized negative stereotypes of Latinos in mainstream English-language media, this did not overwhelmingly dictate media choices, seemingly due to lack of alternative choices. In contrast, Spanish language programming offered a positive alternative to English-language media and may serve identity needs. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Asian Americans have a history of discrimination and othering in the US. In October 2016, journalist Michael Luo put out a call for Asian Americans to tweet racist encounters using the hashtag, #thisis2016. The aim of this study was to examine the encounters shared by Asian Americans. Tweets between October 2016 and December 2017 were obtained via Twitter. The tweets were scoped down to 3,156 tweets to include those that appeared to answer the original call. A phenomenological approach was the overall framework with thematic content analysis applied to analyze the data. Tweets were categorized by type of racist encounter. The racist encounters included: microaggressions, denial of intra-ethnic differences, seen as other, verbal harassment, validation of anti-Asian racism, prejudice, verbal violence/attack, and model minority. Understanding the unique experiences of Asian American individuals, families, and communities helps to target policies, social services, and programming that takes these factors into account. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Throughout much of his writing career, Aldous Huxley contributed to the interdiscursive construction of literature as a utopia, a common ground between scientific and literary discourses. This article explores both the explications and limits of Huxley’s interdiscursive utopia, focusing primarily but not exclusively on his most famous and highly ambiguous novel Brave New World (1932). Read against the background of pertinent criticism and contextualized in 1920s and 1930s debates about the changing prominence of science and the scientist in Britain, Huxley’s enterprise manifests a considerable preserve of social prejudice and hierarchical thinking. This circumstance detracts substantially from the interdiscursivity of his utopia and compromises literature’s claim to a holistic representation of social reality. © 2021, Slovak academy of Sciences, Institute of World literature.

AB  - Modern Hebrew poets and writers describe the biblical figure of the Medium of Endor (I Sam 28: 3-25) as an empathetic woman, warm and compassionate, healing the souls of depressed individuals. This article categorizes the corpus of works that deal with the story of Saul and the Medium of Endor into two primary subjects: debunking the myth of the witch and presenting the world of magic favorably. In the works that belong to the former subject - there is a clear inclination to “purify” the Medium from the negative stereotype associated with her as a “witch.” By re-presenting the Medium various writers object to the negative, sometimes chauvinistic views, that were accepted in western culture regarding the image of the witch as one who seeks to harm human beings and threatens the social order, and who should therefore be persecuted and even put to death. Works from the second category tend to “purify” magic from the negative view that regards it as something “forbidden,” malicious, and dangerous. In these works, magic, mainly used as a therapeutic-psychological technique, aids human beings, and the Medium (ba'alat-ov) of Endor, is described as a contemporary psycho-spiritual therapist. Nowadays, people live in an alienated world and feel the need to turn to the supernatural to find solace for their anxieties. In these works, magic is described favorably, and in some of them it even provides a preferred theological alternative. © 2021 National Association of Professors of Hebrew. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research aims to investigate, in a group of teachers, the link between ethnic prejudice and homophobic attitudes toward issues concerning the use of media tools that support gay and lesbian people. To achieve this purpose, teachers (155 women and 32 males) were given self-report questionnaires: the latent and manifest prejudice scale, and a scale created specifically to assess the various forms of feelings and attitudes toward topics concern lesbian and gay people. The structural equation model suggests how latent prejudice is strictly connected to negative morality and anger toward LG topics, as well as negatively connected to positive attitudes about the exposure of boys and girls to LG topics. The manifest prejudice, however, is negatively connected only to the positive attitudes about the exposure of children to LG topics. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Dissent from white ethnic hostility to blacks, as well as American segregation, was expressed in the pages of left-wing newspapers. Slovak Rovnosť ľudu and Polish Głos Ludowy (“People’s Voice”) demanded “nothing less than full freedom” for blacks, urging readers to embrace anti-lynching campaigns and the FEPC. Anti-integration housing riots were, to Głos Ludowy, manifestations of American fascism. The paper argued anti-black rioters were given “a skull-dugging support from certain sections of the Polish press.” The Communist Slovak paper, Rovnosť ľudu (“People’s Equality”) likewise condemned white mobs attacking black war workers seeking to enter Detroit’s Sojourner Truth Housing Project, and as early as 1937 letter writers to the paper “Condemned Prejudice Against Black Workers.” The same year the paper denounced discriminatory lending practices at the Home Owners Loan Corporation, a prescient exposé of the racially skewed provision of social benefits. After the war both papers declared lynching of black veterans and racial segregation were American-style Hitlerism. Both papers’ commitment to the wartime interracial Popular Front dissented from the more dominant embrace of whiteness. Głos Ludowy long continued its advocacy of racial equality. Extensive coverage was granted to civil-rights campaigns, while every white terrorist attack on activists was unequivocally denounced. The paper called the murder of Florida’s NAACP leader “a shame and blot upon America” that had “the earmarks of genocide.” “A burning concept of equality for the colored races” was articulated. © 2021 Historians of American Communism.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed obesity prejudice levels, attitudes, and perceptions of health care workers toward individuals with obesity and the relationship between health care workers' perceptions of own and society's weight bias, healthy lifestyle preferences, body mass index, and other factors with obesity prejudice levels. METHODS: This cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted with 700 health care workers in Turkey via an online survey addressing characteristics, perceptions, and attitudes toward obesity including an obesity prejudice scale. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. The χ2 test was applied to compare categorical variables. The distribution of the data was evaluated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed data were compared by an independent sample t-test, while the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparing non-normally distributed data. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 40.2±11.3 years and 67.9% were women. Notably, 57.9% worked at tertiary health care centers, 85.9% were physicians, and 64.8% were family physicians; 25% were prejudicial, while 58.1% tended to have prejudice toward individuals with obesity. Obesity prejudice scores were significantly higher among those who were in close contact with and who stated their preference for patients with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the participants tended to have prejudice, and one-fourth were prejudicial toward individuals with obesity. These results highlight the necessity of raising awareness of health care workers to reduce prejudicial attitudes that may negatively impact patients with obesity. Stigmatizing experiences might be detrimental, reducing the quality of life with long-term consequences for emotional and physical health. © 2021 Associacao Medica Brasileira. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the level of ethical sensitivity among Princess Alia University College Students in Jordan and how this is influenced by their educational level and specialization. To achieve the objects of the study, the ethical sensitivity scale questionnaire (ESSQ) was used, as developed by Narvaez (2001). This was used to measure the moral sensitivity of adults and adolescents. It consists of (28) items in seven dimensions, which are the ability to read emotions, to represent the views of others, interest in communication with others, the activation of personal relations, taking into account differences and controlling social prejudice, working to generate interpretations and alternatives, and identifying the consequences of an event and the available options. The sample of the study consisted of (126) randomly selected undergraduate and graduate students. The results of the study showed that the level of ethical sensitivity among Princess Alia University College Students was low, and there were statistically significant differences in the level of ethical sensitivity due to specialization, in favor of humanities students, as well as statistically significant differences in the level of ethical sensitivity due to the educational level, in favor of master’s students. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Asian Online Journal Publishing Group

AB  - Sport and physical activity can play significant role in the lives of persons with disabilities. Participating in sports can improve their health and physical capacities, promote constructive use of their time, as well as provide a better way to integrate and be included in the community. The aim of this qualitative study was to gain insight into perspectives of six coaches regarding their work as para taekwondo trainers. The results present the challenges in the coaches’ work, ways of dealing with difficulties related to para taekwondo training, and positive training outcomes. The challenges faced by coaches indicate acceptance of the abilities of the athletes, ascribed incompetence to athletes with disabilities, lack of trust in the abilities of athletes among people in their social environment, and aggressive behaviour exhibited by persons with intellectual disabilities. Other challenges include limited financial resources, the importance of becoming aware of one’s own prejudice about the capabilities of individuals with disabilities, and building relationships with athletes with disabilities. The coaches deal with difficulties related to para taekwondo training by educating themselves and others, applying an individualised approach to training, cooperating with people from the social environment of athletes with disabilities, and considering the work done with athletes with disabilities as a reward. They recognise positive training outcomes for athletes with disabilities through improvements in bodily functioning, better self-image, and further inclusion in the community. © 2021, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Mining, Geology and Petroleum Engineering.

AB  - Objective: To explore factors associated with social discrimination against users of health services regarding dental aesthetic conditions. Methods: Based on a Brazilian National Survey, multivariate Poisson regressions with robust variance were used to explore the association of outcome discrimination related to different motivations in health services and exposure to sociodemographic and dental variables. Effect modification by complete prosthesis wearing was assessed. Results: Among the 60,200 people interviewed, 11.5% reported being discriminated against in health services. For women, a higher prevalence of discrimination was found among those in the age group of 30-44 years. For both sexes, discrimination was associated with black and brown skin color. Regarding dental characteristics, the higher the tooth loss was, the higher the prevalence of discrimination; however, complete prosthesis wearing presented as a protective factor. Social discrimination was the major motivation for reported discrimination and presented higher prevalence in edentulous individuals who did not wear prosthesis. Conclusion: Dental loss may lead to self-reported discrimination in health care services. The prevalence of discrimination increases when tooth loss increases, and the major reason associated is social discrimination. Copyright © 2021 Bulgarelli, dos Santos, Rech, Baumgarten and Goulart.

AB  - Importance: Stigma, the prejudice and discrimination attached to mental illness, has been persistent, interfering with help-seeking, recovery, treatment resources, workforce development, and societal productivity in individuals with mental illness. However, studies assessing changes in public perceptions of mental illness have been limited. Objective: To evaluate the nature, direction, and magnitude of population-based changes in US mental illness stigma over 22 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data collected from the US National Stigma Studies, face-to-face interviews conducted as 1996, 2006, and 2018 General Social Survey modules of community-dwelling adults, based on nationally representative, multistage sampling techniques. Individuals aged 18 years or older, including Spanish-speaking respondents, living in noninstitutionalized settings were interviewed in 1996 (n = 1438), 2006 (n = 1520), and 2018 (n = 1171). The present study was conducted from July 2019 to January 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Respondents reacted to 1 of 3 vignettes (schizophrenia, depression, alcohol dependence) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria or a control case (daily troubles). Measures included beliefs about underlying causes (attributions), perceptions of likely violence (danger to others), and rejection (desire for social distance). Results: Of the 4129 individuals interviewed in the surveys, 2255 were women (54.6%); mean (SD) age was 44.6 (16.9) years. In the earlier period (1996-2006), respondents endorsing scientific attributions (eg, genetics) for schizophrenia (11.8%), depression (13.0%), and alcohol dependence (10.9%) increased. In the later period (2006-2018), the desire for social distance decreased for depression in work (18.1%), socializing (16.7%), friendship (9.7%), family marriage (14.3%), and group home (10.4%). Inconsistent, sometimes regressive change was observed, particularly regarding dangerousness for schizophrenia (1996-2018: 15.7% increase, P =.001) and bad character for alcohol dependence (1996-2018: 18.2% increase, P =.001). Subgroup differences, defined by race and ethnicity, sex, and educational level, were few and inconsistent. Change appeared to be consistent with age and generational shifts among 2 birth cohorts (1937-1946 and 1987-2000). Conclusions and Relevance: To date, this survey study found the first evidence of significant decreases in public stigma toward depression. The findings of this study suggest that individuals' age was a conservatizing factor whereas being in the pre-World War II or millennial birth cohorts was a progressive factor. However, stagnant stigma levels for other disorders and increasing public perceptions of likely violence among persons with schizophrenia call for rethinking stigma and retooling reduction strategies to increase service use, improve treatment resources, and advance population health.. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

AB  - Scholars in the field of community psychology have called for more research dedicated to examining White privilege as part of a system of White supremacy in the United States. One branch of this work focuses on awareness of White privilege, yet to date, this research has typically investigated awareness of White privilege at individual levels of analysis instead of also focusing on neighborhoods, schools, and other levels of analysis beyond the individual. In this study, we combine survey and U.S. Census data to explore both individual- and community-level predictors of White privilege awareness. With a sample of 1285 White college students, we found that gender, modern racism, social dominance orientation, and subjective socioeconomic status (SES) significantly predicted White privilege awareness. After accounting for these individual-level variables, we found that characteristics of students' hometowns (defined by zip code) predicted White privilege awareness. Specifically, greater income inequality was associated with higher White privilege awareness, while greater White racial homogeneity was marginally associated with lower White privilege awareness. There was a significant interaction between community-level White racial homogeneity and individual-level subjective SES, such that students with high subjective SES and low White racial homogeneity had the highest White privilege awareness. This study highlights the importance of examining different facets of ecological context in relation to White Americans' racial attitudes. © 2021 Society for Community Research and Action

AB  - The paper argues that the different dimensions of collaboration - intercultural, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary - contribute to mutual understanding and empathy. Their intersection fosters self-reflection and reveals shortcomings, blind spots, and prejudices about other cultures, disciplines, and social groups. The course aimed to overcome technology-driven design practices that tend to (re)produce stereotypes or social exclusions - often unconsciously. To make students aware of such problems, we introduced them to Feminist Science and Technology Studies, which show how dimensions such as age, class, and gender affect socio-technological participation. Moreover, we introduced user-centered and participatory design methods (contextual interviews, scenario-based design, design forecasting) that the teams had to adapt to pandemic conditions to conduct participatory research and propose design scenarios. The empirical course evaluation by the students indicates that the pedagogical concept, which we conceptualized as an extended version of a 'Third Space', allowed for intercultural, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary learning experiences and improved collective student and team performance, transcending culturally- and disciplinary-specific situatedness. In our analysis, we reflect on the power of the different forms of collaborations and their contribution to teaching future researchers, designers, and engineers how to engage with another's point of view. We consider this ability a prerequisite for acting responsibly in a globalized digital world. Results from the study are contextualized in current debates on internationalization and digitalization in the educational sciences and translated into recommendations for practitioners. © 2021, University of Wollongong.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of interviews of participants in a political manifestation in Indonesia about the reasons for the rally and the resulting riot. The rally was held in the middle of the Jakarta gubernatorial election, against a non-Muslim incumbent who was accused of having insulted the Quran. We argue that there is a deep relationship between social identities and religion, which has implications for societal togetherness and political freedom. Using a snowball technique, we interviewed 16 Muslims who had participated in this rally. The findings suggest that 1) even though the rally was held in the middle of an election, the demonstrators denied that the rally was politically motivated; 2) Those demonstrators who thought that intruders had infiltrated the rally, maintained that the intruders are to be held responsible for any violence, but not the ‘actual’ participants. 3) Interviewees claimed that their actions were not motivated by anti-Chinese prejudice, although traces of racist thinking can be found in their statements. The findings are discussed before the background of social representations, social identity, theories of collective action, and the black sheep effect. © 2021, PsychOpen. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Anecdotal narratives and recent qualitative research with Black atheists document experiences of racial identity denial from the target’s perspective. However, no research to date has examined whether Black perceivers perceive Black atheists as being weakly identified with their race. Because belief in God is often inextricably linkedwith Black racial identity in the Black community, we hypothesized that Black atheistswould be perceived as less Black than nonatheists. Method: Black/African American adults (n = 343) were randomly assigned to view one of three Black individual’s social networking profiles (i.e., a Christian, an atheist, and religion not explicitly mentioned). After, they reported their perceptions of the targets’ perceived racial identity and trustworthiness. Results: Black participants, regardless of how strongly they identified racially, perceived a Black Atheist as less racially identified than a Black Christian or someone whose religious affiliation was unknown. Additionally, a Black atheist was perceived as less trustworthy than a Black Christian. Conclusions: Black atheists experience general anti-atheist bias (e.g., perceived as untrustworthy), as well as unique antiatheist bias in the form of racial identity denial. These findings extend previous research on identity denial and intragroup dynamics and advance our understanding of the relationship between religious identification and racial identity denial within the Black community. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Prejudices are innate to the human condition and at the base of most conflicts between social groups. Yet, despite much local and global educational effort to promote equality and peace, expressions of hate and violence are omnipresent across the globe. For gaining more understanding about the complex relationship between values and beliefs that influence people’s prejudiced attitudes towards others, this study investigates how Finnish upper-secondary level students (16- to 20-year-olds), on the one hand, affiliate themselves with self-transcendent values, and on the other hand, narrate prejudices towards others. The complementary quantitative (n = 2873) and qualitative (n = 2200) survey responses show that the young people regarded equality and the promotion of peace as the most important values for themselves but, despite this explicit appreciation of these self-transcendent values, they also exhibit several types of prejudice towards others. The findings show that the youth narratives of prejudices are mainly justified with their prior experiences, their imaginaries related to insecurity, disturbances, and conflicts with people who they deem to have lifestyles different from their own. This study expands existing knowledge by suggesting that the main rationales behind young people’s prejudices are not based on traditional social categorisations, or core values, but on differences expressed through individual lifestyles. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article introduces this Themed Issue, Linguistic Diversity as a Challenge to Legal Policy, and reports a small, peer-reviewed study of the integration of research about language issues in legal contexts in Australian legal education. The article explains that interdisciplinary law and linguistics research has emerged to better understand potential inequalities and injustices. This research speaks to concerns shared across many legal systems because both multilingualism and inter-lingual prejudice are common phenomena across nations. The Themed Issue's eleven contributions draw scholarly attention to specific, current problems in legal contexts which relate to language practices and/or policies about language, arranged around the familiar three branches of the state (legislature, executive, judiciary). The Themed Issue is aimed at endowing readers with motivation and basic knowledge to tread new, language-aware routes towards solutions based on collaborative research and policy reform. In regards to integrating such research into legal education, our NSW and ACT study found few course offerings which focus on an intersection of linguistic and legal scholarship. We therefore suggest the development of electives or the inclusion of such material in core subjects (timely given the ‘Priestly 11’ compulsory subjects are under review at the time of writing). © 2021 Griffith University.

AB  - Objective: The stigma and prejudice of the public regarding psychiatric disorders are a long-standing social problem. However, health professionals are more likely to have negative attitudes and label people with mental health conditions. This study aimed to investigate how self-rated familiarity and literacy about schizophrenia are related to social distancing towards schizophrenia patients among health professionals in Taiwan. Method: This study used a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and invited respondents to complete the survey either electronically or in a pencil/paper format. Respondents included health professionals in different disciplines and students under medical placements. The survey instrument consists of three parts: sociodemographic information, the 18-item Social Distance Scale for schizophrenia, and the 19-item Schizophrenia Experience and Knowledge Questionnaires. Data were analyzed using linear regression models to explore sociodemographic factors, self-rated familiarity, and literacy total scores about social distance, attitude, and opinions towards schizophrenia. Result: In total, 420 health professionals completed the questionnaire, of which 24.5% were physicians, 36.0% nurses, 6.7% pharmacists, and 28.6% interns. The majority of respondents (n = 360, 85.7%) had contact experience with schizophrenia patients, and approximately 60% rated their experience as a positive impression. Although 62.9% of respondents had received psychiatric education or training, 86% believed that such education/training was insufficient. Moreover, over half of the respondents did not have confidence in their knowledge of schizophrenia. Older age, being married, and having more working experience were associated with high social distance, a negative attitude, and high prejudice. More familiarity with schizophrenia was associated with low social distance, a positive attitude, and less prejudice. A high literacy score was associated with a positive attitude and less prejudice, but no significant correlation was observed with social distance (β ± SE = −0.26 ± 0.14, p =.057). Among respondents who rated their past contact experiences as negative, neither familiarity nor literacy was associated with social distance. Conclusion: High levels of self-rated familiarity and high literacy about schizophrenia were associated with low social distance, a positive attitude, and less prejudice towards schizophrenia among health professionals. Therefore, sufficient education and training are imperative to increase familiarity and knowledge of schizophrenia. Appropriate education could be implemented from different perspectives, including communication skills, resources of social support, and topics to reduce stigma and prejudice. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - For many Black boys, poor academic performance and high rates of school discipline are often related to biases in how they are perceived and treated at school. These biases oftentimes misalign with how Black boys view themselves and how family members perceive them at home. Few studies examine how different stakeholders’ perceptions of Black boys manifest and shape the middle school experience. The current study employed an embedded case study design, using data from eight semi-structured interviews to explore incongruence among student, teacher, and parent perceptions of two middle school Black boys’ academic and social experiences. Findings showed greater congruence between the boys’ experiences and their parents’ perceptions of them compared to their teachers’ perceptions of them. Of note were teachers’ inaccurate reports of the boys’ career aspirations and academic interests and abilities. Implications of these patterns and their impact on Black boys’ experiences in school are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this article, the ways in which children attribute meanings to the presence of a male teacher in early childhood education is analyzed. The theoretical-methodological framework articulates new childhood and gender studies, serving as a conceptual basis for an ethnographic study carried out in an early childhood school in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Twenty-five children (7 girls and 18 boys), a female teacher and a male teacher participated in the study. It was identified that the relations established by the teachers were based on gender stereotypes. The female teacher often attributed part of her responsibilities to the male teacher, based on representations of hegemonic masculinity, and causing the children to appropriate these meanings. We conclude that it is not enough to insert men into the teaching of children as a way of producing gender equity policy. In order to combat prejudices based on gender differences, everyone involved must recognize themselves as agents of change. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Around the globe, individuals are affected by exclusion, discrimination, and prejudice targeting individuals from racial, ethnic, and immigrant backgrounds as well as crimes based on gender, nationality, and culture (United Nations General Assembly, 2016). Unfortunately, children are often the targeted victims (Costello & Dillard, 2019). What is not widely understood is that the intergroup biases underlying systemic racism start long before adulthood with children displaying notable signs of intergroup bias, sometimes before entering grade school. Intergroup bias refers to the tendency to evaluate members of one’s own group more favorably than someone not identified with one’s group and is typically associated with prejudicial attitudes. Children are both the victims and the perpetrators of bias. In this review, we provide evidence of how biases emerge in childhood, along with an analysis of the significant role of intergroup friendships on enhancing children’s well-being and reducing prejudice in childhood. The review focuses predominantly on the context of race, with the inclusion of several other categories, such as nationality and religion. Fostering positive cross-group friendships in childhood helps to address the negative long-term consequences of racism, discrimination, and prejudice that emerges in childhood and continues through to adulthood. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The present research aimed to identify and discuss the social representations of trans women related to gender identity and transphobia in Brazil and Colombia. In this study participated 43 Trans women, 22 from Brazil, aged between 18 and 55 years (M=29.09, SD=8.53) and 21 from Colombia, aged between 21 and 41 years (M=28.19, SD=7.63). This study adopted a qualitative approach in which semi-structured interviews were used. The data were analyzed by the Iramuteq software, which identified the social representations in classes. The results showed what the participants understood about transphobia and how they regarded their experiences with this gender identity. The participants presented negative social representations, aiming at their personal experiences related to their social context. Themes related to violence, discrimination, prejudice, denial of rights and family support emerged from both the Brazilian and Colombian sample. Implications for Tran´s quality of life are discussed. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid population ageing and international migration are demographic trends which intersect and contribute to far-reaching transformations of local networks and communities. Academic literature has often focused on the impact of migration on receiving communities or narrowly on ‘left behind’ individuals and households. Less consideration has been given to impacts on wider neighbourhood networks and social relationships in sending countries, or the agency of non-migrants in transforming and re-creating networks disrupted by emigration. This article draws on qualitative interviews among a German-speaking minority in Romania which experienced dramatic outmigration to Germany in 1990. The evidence shows that local networks adjusted to outmigration by bringing in new actors previously not involved in support provision; in this case, neighbours belonging to different ethnic groups with whom relations were previously distant. In addition, existing civil society institutions, such as the church, intensified and extended their role to offer practical support and physical care. By examining these transformations through the prism of care in later life, the depth of social transformations ensuant on migration can be brought into sharp relief. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This article aims to investigate about the social stigma and the prejudice of society towards the patients with leprosy, but also to understand how this infectious disease has largely influenced human lifestyle and evolution analyzing the evolution of its treatments from past empirical treatments to actual multidrug therapy (MDT). References on leprosy were extensively searched in literature using PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Springer link and Elsevier’s (EMBASE.com) databases, but also in medical, religious and archaeological books. Leprosy’s spread all around the world following human paths of migration from the African Continent to the Asian one and to Europe, instead its appearance in the New Continent is more recent. Wars, unhygienic conditions, social and health inequality created conditions for its spread since prehistorical times, and exist-ing health disparities contributed to unequal morbidity and mortality, before its gradual decline after the Middle Ages due to the raise of other worse pandemics. Starting from Renaissance, a deeper knowledge on its pathophysiological mechanisms brought an increas-ingly advanced combined surgical and pharmacolog-ical treatment, but still in modern times many efforts have been made to erase its social stigma, changing its name in “Hansen’s disease” included. © 2021, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a survey examining 168 immigrant and non-immigrant youth’s perspectives of intergroup relations, support for immigration, and feelings of belonging in Canada. Using Allport’s (1954) contact theory and the multiculturalism hypothesis (Berry et al., 2021) as a framework, the data is analyzed in the context of relative levels of intergroup contact, friendship, immigration-related knowledgeability, and perceived diversity. This study finds that, overall, the Canadian youth surveyed were more supportive of immigration than older generations and reported high levels of intergroup positivity and frequent intergroup contact. Moreover, intergroup contact and intergroup friendships were positively associated with feelings of belonging, whereas support for immigration was associated with immigration-related knowledgeability and perceptions of diversity. © The Authors.

This study evaluated the prevalence of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide in Brazilian trans people, and it`s relationship with minority stress, passa-bility, social support and trans identity support. 378 people participated through a questionnaire answered online and in the hospital services they attended. Of these, 67.20% had depressive symptoms, 67.72% suicidal ideation and 43.12% attempted suicide. Three Poisson regression analy-zes were performed in two steps, according to the outcomes. In the three outcomes there was a positive association with internalized prejudice and a negative association with social support, which were the only associations in the suicide attempt. Depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were also positively associated with anticipated prejudice and negatively passability and support for trans identity. The vulnerability of transgender people to negative mental health outcomes and the importance of addressing prejudice on an individual and social level, as well as promoting social support and transgender identity support are perceived. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - In the context of the current escalation of anti-gender backlash, this article analyses the instrumental use of gender equality by nationalist forces and unpacks the ways in which the latter dynamic threatens feminist politics and gender justice. I study the intersection of gender and sexuality issues with the co-option of selected aspects of the feminist project by right-wing parties and I reflect on the ways in which femonationalist actors enable and fuel the attacks on women and LGBTQI+ people. In particular, I investigate the instrumental use of gender equality to vilify Black and People of Colour migrants and promote anti-immigration sentiments, with a focus on the framing of gender-based violence in racialised terms. By applying a postcolonial lens, I analyse the redeployment of the gendered colonial narrative in the context of contemporary metropolis focusing on the discourse of the far-right Italian party Fratelli d’Italia. I demonstrate that femonationalist discourses (1) reinforce gendered and racialised power structures, hence patriarchal and heteronormative values; and (2) reshape the understanding of gender equality issues, diluting the meaning of activists’ demands. Unpacking the convergence between femonationalism and anti-gender backlash, the paper provides insights on the complexity of the latter phenomenon and contributes to an understanding of the necessity of challenging the narratives promoted by nationalist discourses to dismantle unequal power relations and all hierarchies of dominations. I conclude by discussing the need for feminists to form intersectional alliances among the oppressed to remain true to their emancipatory and transformative political project and build sustainable, equitable, and inclusive movements. © 2021 Oxfam GB.

AB  - People’s automatic (unintentional, uncontrollable, and efficient) preference between social groups often determines their automatic preference between unknown individual members of these groups, a prominent known the target individuals? Practice might automatize the deliberate judgment of the individuals. Then, if deliberate judgment is nonprejudiced, automatic prejudice might decrease. In 29 studies (total preferences between a famous member of a dominant social group and a famous group on indirect measures of evaluation that were developed to measure automatic preference and on self-report measures. In most studies, we chose pairs based on prior self-reported preference for the member of the stigmatized group. The measures showed discrepancy, indirect measures suggesting an automatic preference for the member of the dominant group. various target individuals, two pairs of social groups (Black/White, young), two indirect measures, and in two countries (Studies 1–23). The indirectly measured prodominant preference was stronger when visual characteristics of the group were present rather than absent (Studies 24 and 25), suggesting a stronger effect of group characteristics on automatic than on deliberate between the individuals. On self-report and indirect measures, the preferences between individuals between their groups (Studies 26 and 27) yet also to individuating information (Studies 28 and 29). Our results suggest that group evaluation plays a central role in the automatic evaluation of familiar (and not only novel) members of stigmatized groups. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Participation in physical activity (PA) come about differently in each individual. Investigating how it occurs in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is seen as an area that does not receive enough attention. In this paper, which was designed to get more information and contribute to the field, the participation of adolescents with ASD in PA was examined in line with the socio-ecological model through the opinions of 17 Turkish parents. Semi-structured interviews well-used to understand the perspective of parents’, and as a main themes constraints and facilitating factors affecting participation of adolescents with ASD in PA were determined. When investigated in terms of intrapersonal factors, which are the first stage of the model, are examined, it is seen that ASD related problems as a constraint and experiences as a facilitator were the foremost themes. Interpersonal constraints were prejudice and family attitude while facilitators were family attitude and attitude of close surroundings. In environmental factors, the main constraints were adapted physical activity (APA) opportunities, while facilitators were neighborhood and facilities. While negative PA approaches of organizations was an institutional constraint, positive PA approach of organizations was a facilitator. In the final stages of the model, in terms of public policy, the constraint was not meeting expectations of current policies and the facilitator was improvements in policies. Consequently, it was understood that adolescents with ASD still participate in PA in some way even though they encounter many constraints when participating in physical activities, the constraints outweigh the facilitating factors. © The British Society of Developmental Disabilities 2021.

AB  - For decades, the achievement gap between low-income Black males and other groups is sufficiently documented and persists. This study calls for a new practical curriculum approach that provides the necessary conditions for how low-income Black males learn, stay engaged, and assist in building the capacity for positive self-efficacy. The significance of this curriculum approach would be improving academic achievement among the group, closing the gap, and facilitate long-term socioeconomic sustainability for the group that is most likely vulnerable to systemic barriers and prejudices. Through a qualitative approach and a historical design, the findings developed a curriculum approach grounded in Social Learning Theory, Human Capital Theory, and Career development Theory. The theoretical framework embodies and incorporates the practical approach found in (Yusuf & Nabeshima, 2012) and (Lee & Fredriksen, 2008) and could improve academic achievement among the group. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Sophisticated algorithms are used daily to search through hundreds of medical journals in order to package updated medical insights into commercial databases. Healthcare practitioners can access these searchable databases—called Point of Care (PoC) tools—as downloadable apps on their smartphones or tablets to comprehensively and efficiently inform patient diagnosis and treatment. Because racist biases are unintentionally incorporated into the search reports that the companies generate and that practitioners regularly access, the aim of this article is to examine how healthcare practitioners’ “pre-existing” racial stereotypes interact with pithy conclusions about race and ethnicity in PoC tools. I use qualitative research methods (content analysis, discourse analysis, open-ended semi-structured interviews, and role play) to frame the analysis within the Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP). This approach facilitates an understanding of how biological racism—the use of scientific evidence to support inherent differences between races—that is embedded in PoC algorithms informs a practitioner’s assessment of a patient, and converges with persistent racial bias in medical training, medical research and healthcare. I contextualize the study with one semi-structured interview with an Editor of a leading PoC tool, MedScope (pseudonomized), and 10 semi-structured interviews with healthcare practitioners in S.E. Ontario, Canada. The article concludes that PoC tools and practitioners’ personal biases contribute to racial prejudices in healthcare provision. This warrants further research on racial bias in medical literature and curriculum design in medical school. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Racism and xenophobia are not just the problems of the adult world; As systems of beliefs, practices, and policies, racism and xenophobia influence children’s perceptions and experiences at early ages. Because families can be significant sources of information regarding race and ethnicity, we focus on the family to understand the broader context of racism and xenophobia in childhood and adolescence. In this paper, we first provide an overview of research conducted among BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) and ethnic/religious minority families that has focused on family ethnic–racial socialization to support children and adolescents’ capabilities for resisting racism and xenophobia. We then review research conducted among white and ethnic/religious majority families that has mainly taken an intergroup relations perspective and has examined associations between parents’ and children’s ethnic–racial attitudes, biases, and prejudice. Finally, we discuss the role of family for racism and xenophobia through the lens of family ethnic–racial socialization and intergroup relations perspectives, highlight areas that are currently understudied, and offer recommendations concerning future research directions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - How youth come to understand their social identities and their relation to others’ identities can have important implications for the future of our society. In this article, we focus on how ethnic-racial identities (ERI) can serve to promote (or hinder) collective well-being. We first describe the nature of change in ethnic-racial identities over the course of childhood and adolescence. We then delineate three pathways by which youths’ ERI can be a mechanism for productive intergroup relations and thereby collective well-being as a: (a) basis for understanding differences and finding commonalities across groups; (b) promotive and protective resource for marginalized youth; and (c) springboard for recognizing and disrupting marginalization. This article concludes with how youths’ ERI can be nurtured into a source of resilience and resistance in the face of racism and xenophobia. Moreover, we urge researchers to consider the role ERI plays in guiding youth to challenge and resist marginalization. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Police integrity is a crucial steppingstone in police administrators’ long-term goals of obtaining legitimacy and yielding citizens’ evaluations of the police as a legitimate institution. This paper investigates the relationship between work-related experiences and police integrity, as well as the degree to which this relationship is mediated by well-known socio-political attitudes such as authoritarianism, ethnic prejudice, and social dominance orientation. Using structural equation modelling of the responses provided by 1,255 members of the Belgium police, the work-related characteristics, socio-political attitudes, and organisational dimensions of police integrity are related to three outcomes of police integrity. Results show that police officers in the field and those who had more frequent contacts with victims and perpetrators of crimes evaluate misconduct to be less serious, are less willing to say that they would report the behaviour, and advocate less severe disciplinary sanctions. Generalised socio-political attitudes related to prejudice mediate work-related experiences and perceptions of peer police integrity and are in turn negatively related to police integrity outcomes. These findings illustrate that police officers do not operate in a social vacuum as these general socio-political attitudes are non-occupation specific. This suggests that police integrity training programmes not only need to target work-related characteristics, such as an open culture to discuss problems, but also need to target general socio-political attitudes to foster police integrity. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although the use of person-centered language has increased in recent years, its usage remains limited within the field of criminal justice, wherein terms such as ex-offender are frequently used to describe formerly incarcerated individuals. Research suggests that person-centered language matters for public opinion, but prior work has not examined the effect of language on support for the social reintegration of returning citizens. The present research experimentally manipulates the effects of the language used to describe individuals released from incarceration and the race of a hypothetical returning citizen on the following outcomes: negative stereotype endorsement, attitudinal social distance, and support for reintegrative initiatives. I find that person-centered language significantly reduces stigmatization of returning citizens, which ultimately increases support for reintegrative services. These findings suggest that humanizing changes to criminal justice discourse may have the capacity to shift public opinion and create a social context more conducive to reintegration after incarceration. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Some individuals may be internationally displaced by climate change. We surveyed two independent samples of New Zealanders to understand attitudes towards climate aid. Participants were relatively less supportive of financial aid policies, though the majority supported climate refugee policy. We assessed whether those ideological barriers commonly used to predict prejudice and policy support related to this acceptance in meaningful ways. Interestingly, we show that approval or rejection of climate refugee policy was largely predicated on views regarding how hierarchically society ought to be ordered. Our research suggests that those opposing climate refugee policy are motivated by anti-egalitarianism and concerns about their own economic welfare to a greater extent than concerns about differences in culture, values, and norms. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Existing research into nativist populist (NP) rhetoric has shown that elite outgroups can be used by politicians to further anti-immigration agendas. The social identity functions of elite outgroups outside of cultivating anti-immigrant prejudice, however, remain poorly understood. In addition, whether populist news media can be considered social identity entrepreneurs in their own right remains an underexplored topic. This study examines the rhetorical use of elite outgroups in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia from a social identity perspective, focusing on political leaders and newspapers op-eds. Our findings demonstrate shared strategies across the countries and source types: (1) NPs depict elites as working through collusion to undermine trust in information production within society and vie for control of the ingroup informational influence; (2) NPs present themselves as nonelite and more ingroup prototypical on dimensions relevant to the elite collusion (being under attack and equally susceptible); (3) NPs contest ingroup norms through constructions of an anti-immigrant consensus which is suppressed by elites. We conclude that social identity researchers should pay more attention to the rhetorical functions of elite outgroups in addition to cultivating anti-immigrant prejudice, and that the media-as-identity-entrepreneur is an important aspect of constructing shared social realities, and mobilizing support, within populism. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - One reason Aristotle is distinguished as a philosopher is that he thought the philosopher investigated the causes of things. This paper raises the question: What are the causes of racial prejudice and racial discrimination. All ethical beings know that racial prejudice and racial discrimination are morally wrong, deplorable and should be completely eradicated. Deanna Jacobsen Koepke refers to Holt’s definitions in distinguishing racism from prejudice: “Racism is defined as hostility toward a group of people based on alleged inferiorities. Racism is a system of power and privilege that is at the foundation of society’s structures rather than prejudice, which is a hostile attitude toward a person based on trait he or she is assumed to have due to group membership.”1 This concept squarely places racism as the culprit to be extinguished. In this article, it is to be argued that to define racism as the target is only to observe the manifest phenomenon. The argument of the article is that racial prejudice and discrimination rest upon four pillars: political, economic, social and cultural. For simplicity of explanation, the social and cultural pillars shall be considered under the category of the political pillar, although the distinction between these pillars shall be noted. This article argues that these four pillars themselves, rest upon a foundation. The foundation is the deep psychological fear of the current, existing dominant economic group that the current existing dominated minority group will eventually usurp the power of the dominant economic group. The manifest form that this type of fear assumes is racial prejudice and discrimination. In its most extreme forms it then manifests as hate speech, hate action, hate brutality and hate murder.2 These manifestations provide the fuel that maintains the power imbalance and provides a camouflage for the four pillars that lie beneath the racist exterior. In this article, the political and economic pillars that underlie color racism will be examined first. The underlying deep psychological foundation shall be treated separately. In the end, the argument of this article is that color racism cannot be fully extinguished until its role as providing a mask for the underlying four pillars that consistently support inequality between different groups or classes are uprooted and the deep psychological fear that underlies them is eliminated.3 The masked function of color racism is its enormous power in perpetuating inequality; hence, the title of this paper, Unmasking Color Racism. © 2021, Polish Academy of Sciences - Institute of Philosophy and Sociology.

AB  - Because youths are particularly vulnerable to social problems, philosophers since Plato to date have continued to show interest in developing, empowering, and protecting the youths. African youths are particularly far more than ordinarily vulnerable to various social problems including racism especially from outside the continent, mainly because of the shortfall in youth development and empowerment strategies in most African countries. Consequently, young people are pulled to countries with resources and infrastructures that provide them with opportunities to enlarge their capabilities and improve their quality of life, where they are also faced with discriminatory, prejudicial, and antagonistic treatments simply because of their skin colour. So, one way to look at racism and reduce its effects is to examine those socio-political as well as economic structures that constitute obstacles to youth development and empowerment, and which push and expose the young in Africa to the ill-treatments emanating from racism. © 2021, Polish Academy of Sciences - Institute of Philosophy and Sociology.

AB  - Ableism is the systematic oppression of and prejudice toward individuals with disabilities due to the idealization of nondisabled bodies and minds. Despite legislation aimed at broadening the rights of individuals with disabilities, ableism persists, including in classrooms of postsecondary institutions and within the field social work. However, changes can be made with adoption of the social model of disability, and in applying Universal Design for Learning (UDL). UDL offers a more holistic framework for curriculum and instruction, benefiting institutions of higher education in the education and retention of individuals with disabilities, and more importantly, individuals with disabilities themselves. This analysis examines UDL as a potential solution for reducing ableism in institutions of higher education and the field of social work. © 2021 Council on Social Work Education.

AB  - Transgressions and injustice are an inevitable part of social life, both in interactions between individuals and between groups. But whereas conflict between individuals typically impacts only few, conflict between groups can be harmful to many – as is illustrated by disputes between nations, political parties, and social groups. For this reason, it is crucial to understand how such transgressions can be restored. In interpersonal contexts, there is considerable evidence that apologies can restore transgressions and enable victims and perpetrators to reconcile. It is unknown, however, to what extent their remedial effectiveness may translate to conflicts between groups. The present research illuminates this question. In an experimental study (N = 272), we compared the effectiveness of apologies for restoring trust after transgressions between individuals or groups. Results revealed that both in interpersonal and intergroup contexts, apologies significantly increased trust. However, their impact was greater in interpersonal interactions (where they fully restored trust to its pre-transgression level) than in intergroup interactions (where they failed to fully restore trust). Furthermore, the effectiveness of apologies was shaped by their emotional content. In disputes between individuals, only apologies with secondary emotions fully restored trust. Conversely, in disputes between groups, neither apologies with primary emotions nor those with secondary emotions fully restored trust. This was explained by greater skepticism of apologies in intergroup contexts, particularly of apologies with secondary emotions. These findings underline that intergroup interactions are more competitive and distrusting than interpersonal interactions, and suggest that more extensive remedies may be required to reduce intergroup tensions. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The underlying dynamics of the various kinds of extremism have, as a common feature, exclusion of the other through hate speech. One of the keys for preventing violent extremism (PVE) is working from the domain of public policy to combat the prejudices and stereotypes that shape discriminatory discourse. This study presents a project of education through literature in the framework of UNESCO’s PVE strategy. This programme is constructed around a specific European case, Ustaša violence, which has allowed identification of three relevant areas when implementing the PVE strategy: historical, literary, and dialogic. With a view to favouring human rights, the aim is to design public policies which, with a social impact in the domain of PVE, will consolidate recognition of the equal dignity of human beings. © 2021.

AB  - Scientific objectivity and reliability are matters of fundamental importance both to science and in the public sphere, where they tend to be regarded with scepticism due to reporting of faulty or biased information, particularly in certain domains. In science studies, these qualities have been questioned in the light of two main characteristics of scientific activity: the inadequacy of data to determine theories, which opens the door to the possible influence of epistemic and value-based assumptions and prejudices, and the social character of scientific work, which may magnify their effect. Science education has a role to play in promoting informed trust in science and in improving science by preparing students to act positively either in the research field as future scientists or in the public domain as informed citizens. In this article, we systematize questions, responses, and arguments relating to the objectivity and trustworthiness of science that have been propounded in the philosophy, history, and sociology of science and which may contribute to an epistemologically sound conception of the subject in science education. We examine the kinds of bias that can affect science, the mechanisms available for dealing with them, and the arguments against treating them as a basis for blanket scepticism. The positions and arguments examined in this analysis generally imply that science is trustworthy and valuable, but confidence in science should be qualified, depending on the circumstances of each research program and the community that produces it, and they suggest means for improving the function and social role of science. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The aim of this research was to analyze, from a gender perspective, the quality of care that a single and gay father offers his son through his experiences, perceptions, and difficulties. One father, single by choice and gay, participated with his one-year-old and nine-month-old son. A semi-structured interview was conducted, and the criteria proposed for the thematic analysis was followed for the interpretation of the data. Results indicate that the participant is immersed in the social model of hegemonic masculinity, as well as benefiting from the privileges that the patriarchy grants to men; however, this model also leads him to live with an unavoidable fear for society's stereotypes and prejudices regarding his type of family. Quality of care is not exclusive to only one gender, since it depends on time, availability, accessibility, patience, and adult's self-awareness, as well as the correct interpretation of child' signals; it is learned from caregiver's experiences and perceptions, so it does not belong exclusively to biological motherhood. © 2021.

AB  - Identification with a superordinate entity, like Europe, reduces prejudice towards immigrants in general, but no research so far investigated if this differs between prejudice towards immigrants from inside and outside Europe. Using online survey data from four European countries, we determined whether national and European identification are (differently) related to attitudes towards immigrants from inside and outside Europe, and to which extent these relations can be explained by differences in refugee threat perceptions. We found that those who strongly identify with Europe hold more favorable views towards both European and non-European immigrants, while the reverse effect is found for strong national identifiers–an effect that can be explained by realistic and symbolic refugee threat perceptions. We did not find evidence for our expectation that the strength of the associations of national identification on attitudes and threat perceptions would depend on the level of European identification of participants. Overall, our findings provide mixed support for the Common In-group Identity Model because European identifiers, although more positive towards immigrants, did not make strong distinctions between European and non-European immigrants. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The concept of the common good represents those resources that are good for an entire group as a whole, or what preserves what the people or inhabitants of the national community have in common. The "good"are those things that benefit the community as a whole; lead to the protection, sustainment, and improvement of the community. Theorists agree that it is the ultimate end of government; the good of all its citizens and void of special interests. Theories of the common good are discussed in this paper with implications regarding the shortcomings of democratic political institutions and structures. The theoretical framework provided by the political thought of W. E. B. Du Bois and Friedrich Nietzsche are used to critically examine the idea of the common good in contemporary democratic societies. Du Bois sought an objective truth that could dispel once and for all the irrational prejudices and ignorances that stood in the way of a just social order for African Americans. Nietzsche's political theory was primarily concerned with disdain for democracy and the need for Aristocratic forms and social ordering. He was skeptical that with the demise of religion, it would be possible to achieve an effective normative consensus in society at large which is needed to legitimize government authority. Both theorists agree that the exceptional and great individuals are few in society and should govern in favor of the masses. Based on their example, this paper argues that both authors are suggesting an Epistocratic form of government where those with political knowledge are privileged. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - Securing long-lasting positive intergroup relations is of high priority in the multi-cultural European Union. Developing and promoting integration within the school context is a matter of interest to both researchers and practitioners. This study investigated the effects of a mastery-oriented motivational climate intervention using the TARGET framework on students’ psychological integration (identification with, and inclusion in physical education [PE] class), in culturally diverse school classes. The intervention was conducted using a quasi-experimental design in 7th to 9th graders over 18 weeks. Two school classes were assigned to an intervention group (n = 38) and three school classes received regular PE instruction. The intervention group was compared with a control group (n = 56). Results indicated a positive effect of the intervention on students’ feelings of inclusion in PE class in the intervention condition compared to the control condition. Mediation analysis revealed that this effect operated through decreased performance climate perceptions. Our findings suggest that such an intervention using the TARGET framework may affect students’ feelings of inclusion within the PE class through differences in performance climate perceptions. Findings highlight the importance of perceived motivational climate in PE for students’ psychological integration in culturally diverse PE settings and suggest the effectiveness of a motivational climate intervention. © 2021 International Society of Sport Psychology.

AB  - As organizations take on grand challenges in gender equality, anti-racism, LGBTQ+ protections and workplace inclusion, many well-intentioned individuals from dominant groups (e.g., cisgender men, Caucasian, heterosexual) are stepping forward as allies toward underrepresented or marginalized group members (e.g., cisgender women, People of Color, LGBTQ+ identified employees). Past research and guidance assume an inevitable need for external motivation, reflected in the ‘business case’ for diversity and in top-down policies to drive equity and inclusion efforts. This qualitative study explored internal motivations in the form of morally motivated virtues of 25 peer-nominated exemplary allies serving in leadership positions. In-depth life/career story interviews were used to identify the virtues that supported their allyship journeys. Findings demonstrated that they tapped into several virtues that served distinct functions in a 4-stage allyship development process: Stage 1—Energizing psychological investment (compassion, fairness); Stage 2—Thinking through allyship-relevant complexities (intellectual humility, perspective-taking, wisdom); Stage 3—Initiating action (prudence, moral courage, honesty); Stage 4—Committing to allyship (perseverance, patience). We call this the ‘EThIC model of virtue-based allyship development.’ This study has implications for theory and research on a virtue-based approach to diversity, equity and inclusion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - We examined the development of children’s positive and negative attitudes toward other-gender peers over 1 year, and explored the longitudinal social consequences of holding positive or negative attitudes on the beholder of these attitudes. Participants were 206 second graders (Mage = 7.18 yrs, SD =.56, 50% girls) and 206 fourth graders (Mage = 9.10 yrs, SD =.66, 44.2% girls) from diverse ethnic racial backgrounds (54.6% White; 17.2% Latinx, 4.4% Black, 5.3% Asian, 2.9% Native American,.7% Pacific Islander, 13.1% other) with average household income ranged from $51,000 to $75,000, and they were assessed in 2 consecutive years. Developmental change was assessed using latent change score analysis, which showed that positive other-gender attitudes increased over time (for boys) whereas negative other-gender attitudes decreased for everyone. Path analyses showed that both positive and negative other-gender attitudes predicted children’s perceptions of stressful other-gender interactions and their inclusion expectancies by other-gender peers longitudinally, controlling for same-gender attitudes. We also examined the extent to which the predicted relation between attitudes and inclusion expectancies was mediated by children’s perceptions of stressful experiences with other-gender peers. We found that the extent of mediation varied by the type of attitudes and by children’s age. Overall, findings contributed to the understanding of the development of children’s other-gender attitudes, and underscored the consequences of these attitudes for the beholder of attitudes. This work also sheds light on the discussion of intervention strategies aimed at improving children’s gender-based intergroup relations. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Based on a field study of Tandawa village located in east Uttar Pradesh, the article examines the pattern of caste cohesion in a rural society and studies how divisions and hierarchy still surface and remain a reality. This ethnographic study shows that though many socio-cultural traditions are practiced in northern India, some are undergoing subtle changes. The younger generation, especially its leaders, the yuva neta, have been taking initiatives over the last two decades to bring about a change in thinking. This study examines these new changes and challenges, and also tries to explore how these yuva neta have taken some initiatives to resolve internal caste-based hierarchical divisions and social contradictions. Using interviews, oral history, narratives and participant observation techniques, an ethnographic account of a small village has been put together. The research article also revisits a few significant studies to understand the debate on the caste system and how deeply it is entrenched in the day-to-day life of rural India. © 2021 Council for Social Development.

AB  - Background: Self-stigma is a dimension of stigma concerning how individuals internalize negative attributes and discriminate against their own selves. Dementia is a stigmatizing condition, and there is a paucity of research exploring the manifestations and implications of self- stigma in people living with dementia in various contexts. Aim: To examine how self-stigma manifests in the experiences of people living with early-stage dementia in Santiago, Chile. Participants: Six men and five women living with early-stage dementia of the Alzheimer’s type, aged between 64 and 82 years old (mean = 70). Methods: One-on-one interviews were conducted, focusing on the experience of people living with early-stage dementia to provide insights on how self-stigma manifests. Interviews were analyzed with a qualitative content analysis approach using Corrigan’s social cognitive model of self-stigma (2016). Results: Self-stigma manifested as devaluation and blame at a cognitive level, and as restriction of participation at a behavioral level. Families and dementia education emerged as contextual elements that influenced the internalization of negative attributes in the participants’ experiences. Conclusions: Consistent with previous qualitative research, we found that self-stigma has negative consequences as it concerns emotions, self-prejudices, and self-discrimination. This study provides distinctive insights on the process of internalization of stigma and the influence of external elements. Self-stigma remains an understudied but important feature of the dementia experience, an understanding of which can lead to developing and testing supportive approaches upon diagnosis to minimize its adverse effects. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper investigates intersecting rights and ways of thinking in faith-based schools. It outlines current legislative attempts to manage anti-discrimination in Australian schools and proposes a dialogic model of reciprocal anti-discrimination for educational leaders and administrators. This paper proposes that reciprocal anti-discrimination will require rigorous clarity in organisational beliefs, values and philosophies of education. Differences of power, prejudice and assumptions are also addressed. The goal of the proposed model is to find a way forward where rights and values intersect while supporting student and staff wellbeing and preserving religious and moral conscience. © 2021 British Association for International and Comparative Education.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore individual and situational predictors of homeless stigmatization. The aim was to test if individual differences in Belief in a Just World (BJW) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) moderate the effect of quantity and quality of contact on stigmatization of the homeless. One hundred and eighty-seven participants completed measures of BJW, SDO, quality, and quantity of contact, as well as a measure of homeless stigmatization. Results showed that BJW and SDO correlated positively with stigmatization, while both quantity and quality of contact were negatively correlated with stigmatization. SDO was found to moderate the relationship between quantity of contact and stigmatization; more contact with the homeless was related to lower stigmatization for participants with low and moderate SDO scores but not those with high SDO. BJW did not moderate the relationship between contact and stigmatization. Implications regarding the interaction between SDO and contact are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The authors developed a Holding Community Program to achieve the following objectives: (a) to increase the perspective-taking capacity of adolescents; (b) to promote interpersonal and intergroup harmony; (c) to empower school students to be more (pro)active in their communities and in public life. Apart from the intervention itself, the study comprised a pre-test and a post-test and involved a total of 240 Hungarian high school students (159 female, 66.3%). The students were aged 14-18 (Mage = 15.33; S Dage = 0.88). They were recruited from four high schools. Control groups (N = 122) were chosen from the same institution and graded as experimental classes (N = 118, 7 classes). Both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention (4-6 months after the intervention) were explored. Quantitative analysis of the data indicated that the two-day intervention program had significantly increased the students' perspective-taking capacity (short-term: F(1, 238) = 6.03, p < 0.05, long-term: n.s.) and efficacy beliefs (short-term: F(1, 238) = 3.83, p = 0.052, long-term: F(1, 238) = 3.38, p < 0.05). After the training, students were more willing to participate in collective actions (short-term: F(1, 238) = 7.32, p < 0.01, long-term: F(1, 238) = 3.83, p < 0.05). These results seem quite promising but the outcome was not significant regarding its effect on prejudice. © 2021 Ural University Press. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - One of the common problems in a society that originates from multiculturalism is the emergence of a dichotomy in the community resulting in differences between ethnic groups. This distinction is often measured by domination, marginalization, majority or minority, and even stereotypes attached to each group or ethnicity. Not infrequently also formed a pattern that labels a local community and migrants. The complexity of inter-ethnic relations in multicultural societies requires controlling models for the relations with conflict potential. Actually, the concept of ethnic identity still leaves debate that is not over, especially among experts in the social sciences. However, at least we need to get an overview of this construct. One of the strongest elements in the cultural structure of a society that can support multicultural relationships that are equilibrium and harmony is kinship because there is a mechanism in maintaining wholeness. This study aims to reveal the meaning of kinship commodification in local ethnic groups in Lampung and reveal the implicit meaning of the commodification of kinship. As a qualitative study, interviews were the main instrument for obtaining a native perspective (the giver and recipient of a title) and observing the custom ritual of awarding the title holistically and supported by several relevant documents. Collected data by rolling out information on some (original) informants to get their perspective on the culture of lifting titles for migrants who used a kinship perspective. This study also used participatory observation to get a complete picture of the commodification of kinship in multicultural relationships. The research location included the Lampung society dominated by Papadun and Saibatin communities. The results showed that the positioning of Lampung ethnicity at the minority level in a multicultural society increased their ability to cultivate a title culture in their community structure as a tool of resistance by adopting kinship. Cultural actions with kinship patterns and symbols make other people like relatives or family. Even the title becomes an instrument of cultural harmony in multicultural relations. The title of Lampung’s local ethnic kinship becomes the identity at stake because the title found a compromise of identity that is always modified. © 2021 Cyprus International University.

AB  - Bullying is characterized by constant violent actions against the same individual. Bullied people suffer physical and psychological damage that directly affect their academic achievement, as well as their relationship with friends, family, and society, resulting in a feeling of social exclusion. Based on the hypothesis that myths and prejudices about giftedness contribute for gifted students to be involved with bullying, we propose an exploratory study of bullying experienced by gifted students in school environments. Interviews were carried out with a non-probabilistic sample composed of ten gifted students of Middle School. Our investigation states that some characteristics of giftedness can help them to deal better with bullying consequences and have an interventionist attitude in a situation of bullying. Moreover, the areas of giftedness can influence how these students use aggression when assuming the role of bullies. At last, it is identified that the myths of giftedness did not lead to their involvement with bullying. © 2021 World Council for Gifted and Talented Children.

AB  - To verify whether a common superordinate identity promotes intergroup social capital, we analyze survey data from three cross-sectional surveys conducted in South Korea one week before, two days after, and six months after the 2018 North Korea–United States summit in Singapore. A comparison of responses from the first and second surveys reveals that the summit positively changed South Korean natives’ altruism toward and trust in North Korean refugees by encouraging a sense of co-ethnicity among the natives. From an additional analysis of data from the third survey, we further find that the positive effects of the summit persisted even after six months. © 2021 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - Universities have embraced a culture of inclusivity and diversity when recruiting students for professional degrees (degree study that is likely to result in accreditation to a profession-specific body). Gender, ethnicity, background and disability should no longer be considered a barrier to the offer to undertake study within a HE institution. Students identified as autistic are part of this group; however, anecdotally, when undertaking work-based learning (WBL), attrition rates are high. This phenomenological study examined the WBL experiences of undergraduate students identified as autistic who have chosen professional degree study. Despite the demonstration of immense personal attributes that any profession would value, this group faces discrimination and stereotyping of their persona. Research was conducted with participants all identified as autistic; drawn from a range of undergraduate professional degrees: policing, teaching, journalism, social work and psychology. A number of themes emerged that offer insight into the barriers for success for these individuals, and the personal cost of being autistic in organisations heavily influenced by a deficit model of disability. Points of interest This work examines the experiences of autistic university students on work-based learning placements as part of a professional degree. This research includes only the voices of autistic individuals, describing their experiences and the challenges they faced, rather than the thoughts and opinions of those who support students. This work offers insight into the prejudice faced by autistic individuals wanting to enter a graduate profession, the challenges they face, the efforts they make to appear ‘normal’ and the constant need to explain themselves in order to ‘fit in’. This research suggests that students with autism can be of great benefit to their chosen profession. Autistic individuals display a strong work ethic, pushing against boundaries and displaying the courage to stand up and make a professional difference to other people’s lives,. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Understanding when children develop a sense of group boundaries has implications for conflict and its resolution. Integrating social identity development theory and the developmental peace-building model, we investigated whether preferences for ethno-religious ingroup symbols mediate the link from child age to outgroup prosocial giving among 5-to 11-year-old children from both majority and minority backgrounds in three settings of protracted intergroup conflict (N = 713, M = 7.97, SD = 1.52, 52.6% female). Participants represented the conflict rival ethno-religious groups in each setting (Northern Ireland [n = 299]: 48.5% Protestant, 51.5% Catholic; Kosovo [n = 220]: 54.1% Albanian, 45.9% Serbian; Republic of North Macedonia [RNM; n = 194]: 45.9% Macedonian, 54.1% Albanian) and were largely from lower to middle-class families; 4% of participants from other ethnic backgrounds were excluded from the current analyses. Multiple-group, bias-corrected bootstrapped mediation found that ingroup symbol preference mediated the link from child age to outgroup prosocial giving; that is, older children expressed higher ingroup symbol preference, which was linked with lower outgroup giving. Across Northern Ireland, Kosovo, and the RNM, there was some significant variation in the strength of specific paths; however, there was a significant indirect effect in all three settings. The findings advance cross-cultural understanding of how age relates to ingroup symbol preferences and outgroup prosocial giving across the elementary school years, with © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - The United Nations Refugee Agency currently has registered approximately 178,990 asylum seekers, and refugees within Malaysia (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Figures at a glance in Malaysia, 2020b). Interestingly, while Malaysia allows for the registration of asylum seekers and refugees, it is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. As a result, refugees in Malaysia are not considered conceptually different from illegal immigrants, and therefore have precarious lifestyles while they await resettlement to a third country. Importantly, refugee children are barred from accessing the local education system in Malaysia, despite documented evidence surrounding the importance of education in the promotion of well-being and successful resettlement in refugee children. These children often end up relying on various volunteer-run schools that have been set up across the country. In order to better understand the barriers and facilitators of refugee education, this study employed the use of semistructured interviews with 10 volunteer teachers who teach Chin refugee children in Malaysia. A qualitative analysis was conducted using a grounded theoretical framework. Five major themes emerged from the analysis of the data: Language, Resources, Cultural Differences, Legal Status, and Experiences of Prejudice. The findings from this study contribute to an important, and growing body of research that aims to understand both the barriers and facilitators of refugee education. It is hoped that these findings provide future educators with confidence and skills in the provision of effective education to their students from refugee backgrounds. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Five experiments investigate the hypothesis that heavier weight individuals are denied mental agency (i.e., higher order cognitive and intentional capacities), but not experience (e.g., emotional and sensory capacities), relative to average weight individuals. Across studies, we find that as targets increase in weight, they are denied mental agency; however, target weight has no reliable influence on ascriptions of experience (Studies 1a–2b). Furthermore, the de-mentalization of heavier weight targets was associated with both disgust and beliefs about targets’ physical agency (Study 3). Finally, de-mentalization affected role assignments. Heavier weight targets were rated as helpful for roles requiring experiential but not mentally agentic faculties (Study 4). Heavier weight targets were also less likely than chance to be categorized into a career when it was described as requiring mental agency (versus experience; Study 5). These findings suggest novel insights into past work on weight stigma, wherein discrimination often occurs in domains requiring mental agency. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Perceptions of social norms can have downstream consequences for attitudes and behaviors, especially when it comes to the acceptance of marginalized groups. While interventions focusing on social norms may boost tolerance, few studies test whether variations in norm communication affect individuals’ perceptions. Thus, in this paper, we test the effectiveness of three communicative aspects—valence framing (Experiments 1–3), point of view (Experiment 1), and group centrism (Experiment 3)—in shifting perceptions of social norms. Specifically, we investigate whether manipulating these aspects affects perceptions of tolerance of lesbian and gay individuals in Slovakia, where LGBTQ+ acceptance is among the lowest in Europe. We found that while positively valenced messages shifted perceptions toward tolerance, manipulating point of view and group-centrism did not. We believe that these findings can inform interventions intended to shift perceptions of social norms in hostile contexts, an important first step in changing prejudiced attitudes and behaviors. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to evaluate the problems encountered in the process of realizing the continuity of preschool and primary school mathematics education and to determine the use of technology in mathematics education in line with the opinions of teachers. The research is a phenomenological study within the scope of qualitative research method. The research was conducted with 40 classroom teachers working in various primary schools in the province of Almaty, Kazakhstan, in the 2020-2021 academic year. The research data were collected with a semi-structured interview form prepared by the researcher and consisting of five open-ended questions, and analyzed with the descriptive method. As a result of the research, students were found to be prejudiced against the course, and the inadequacy of course materials, learning methods and techniques, and course activities were shown as the reasons that negatively affect education. In addition, it has been determined that the rate of teachers to prefer classical methods in education is much higher than new learning methods and techniques and use of technology. © 2021 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

AB  - Young people who are placed in out-of-home care are amongst the most vulnerable in our community. Removed from or rejected by their families, they must learn to live with carers who may be strangers. They may have experienced the trauma of abuse or neglect. Post care, they may experience further social isolation and marginalisation due to limited social capital. These challenges are compounded for queer young people placed in out-of-home care. This study adopted a case study approach to explore the lived experience of two young adults growing up queer in and out of out-of-home care in Australia. Our investigation was framed by two complementary theoretical frameworks. The first, a model of minority stress, is informed by queer perspectives and enabled an exploration into the adverse impact of enduring stigma and prejudice associated with homophobia and transphobia on young people’s capacity to thrive. The model of social capital was then employed to inform an analysis of relationships between queer young people in out-of-home care and trustworthy adults. The findings suggest that queer young people growing up in out-of-home care experience minoritised stress, with lasting negative implications. The presence however, of trustworthy adults who challenge dominant heteronormative assumptions and work to support queer young people can be experienced as stabilising and restorative. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Weight stigma is a negative social process that involves discrimination against overweight and obese people. Gyms are important environments to promote exercise where weight stigma can be a hindrance for obese exercise practitioners. This critical-oriented study provides evidence-based answers to this question: How do obese users experience weight stigma in gyms? Six obese gym users (BMI >30) participated in semi-structured interviews and provided visual data for photo-elicitation. A thematic analysis enabled the grouping of their experiences around weight stigma into three forms of discrimination: 1) direct: negative comments about body weight and body size; 2) indirect: internalization of negative stereotypes on weight, ability or appearance; 3) structural: explicit or symbolic rejection related with weight-centric exercise, equipment and recommendations implicit in marketing and advertising. The results provide evidence and interpretations of different forms of discrimination and inequality that operate in gyms, and how they affect obese users’ experiences. Based on these results, we compile a list of measures to prevent weight stigma and recommendations for exercise professionals to relate with obese users. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - There is limited evidence about the lives of queer Mongolian youth. This is despite mental health problems being a pressing concern among young Mongolians, and international evidence suggesting queer youth may experience more mental health challenges than their non-queer peers. We explored the experiences of queer youth in their immediate environments and navigation of their identities in Mongolian society. In this study, twelve young queer-identifying people aged 18-25 from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia participated in photo-elicitation interviews. Visual research methods allowed participants to generate rich (visual, textual, and oral) data about their lived experiences. We analysed data using a thematic approach and identified three main themes, each with three sub-themes. Participants reported that peer bullying and gendered expectations at school, heteronormativity and gender role expectation in family settings, along with strong stereotypes about queerness in broader society, substantially impacted participants’ mental and physical wellbeing. Mongolian queer youth need strong support from their immediate environments, such as school and family. Stigma and misconception around queerness remain persistent among the public but young people are continuously resisting the prejudice expressed towards them. Understanding these challenges is crucial to increasing inclusivity in policies and programmes to enhance the wellbeing of young queer Mongolians. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - People who have experienced mental health problems often encounter stigmatisation, mainly by professional mental health care providers. Therefore, involvement of experts by experience in courses taught at a higher education institution that provides training for future healthcare professionals aims at destigmatising mental illnesses. Peer trainers have a lived mental health problems experience who take on the role of trainers to present the latest mental health care trends and theories and introduce recovery elements into the educational process. The data on which the article is based were gathered over a period of three years from focus groups involving 2nd year students of the bachelor’s degree programme of ‘Clinical Social Worker’. The results obtained clearly show the destigmatising effect of this type of teaching: what has proven to be crucial in this regard was, on the one hand, the experience of former patients, and on the other hand, a counterweight to the often-one-sided information prevalent in professional literature on mental health available in the Czech Republic. The teaching reinforced the students’ ability to work in a multidisciplinary team together with a peer support worker and also undermined any prejudice they may have had towards people with mental health problems. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Individual and cultural factors play an important role in the emotional-social development. Culture creates differences in individuals’ cognitions, emotions and behaviors about events. One of the differences within culture is ethnic-racial differences. This study was generally aimed that personality traits, intergroup relations, empathy-prosocial behavior-morality and affects are the predictive power to ethnocultural empathy. This article includes four studies. Participants are students the Education Faculty of a university in the Aegean Region. Participans took demograph sheet, HEXACO, narcissistic personality and universality-diversity orientation scales in sudy−1, demongraph sheet, right-wing authoritarianism, discrimination, sensitivity to different cultural groups, social distance and social dominance orientation scales in study 2, demographic sheet, basic empathy, pro-social behavior and morality in study 3 and demographic sheet, trait anger, positive-negative affects towards outgroups and threat perception in study 4. Hierarchic regression analysis reveal that ethnicity and universality-diversity orientation predicts the etnocultural empathy in study1. Immigrant discrimination predicts the ethocultural empathy in study 2. Ethnicity, political tendency, basic empathy and pro- social behavior predicts the ethnocultural empathy in study 3. General threat perceptions towards outgroups predicts the ethnocultural empathy. A result of four studies has showed that the total variance of ethnocultural empathy was explained as.924%. The findings provide support for the best predictive variables of etnocultural empaty was been UDO, low immigrant discrimination, empathy-prosocial behavior, threat perception to out groups and ethnicity-religion-politic variable. According to the results of four studies from the same faculty, these variables explain the majority of the variance related to etnocultural empathy. Ethnocultural empathy may be an important effect in increasing intergroup contact and reducing conflicts and discriminatory attitudes in preservice teachers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article provides an overview of the “behavioural immune system”–a suite of psychological mechanisms that complements immunological defences by motivating pre-emptive behavioural responses to infection threats–and summarises research documenting its implications for social attitudes and social behaviour. This summary focuses on four domains of phenomena: interpersonal interactions, stigma and prejudice, conformity, and political attitudes. Then, drawing on this conceptual and empirical background, the article discusses consequences that disease outbreaks (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may have for individuals’ attitudes and actions, and the further consequences that these attitudes and actions might plausibly have for population-level epidemiological and public health outcomes. © 2021 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between social media use, disease risk perception, social and political trust, and out-group stereotyping and prejudice during a social upheaval. Analyses of primary data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore found that disease risk perception is positively related to stereotyping and prejudice against Chinese immigrants. Individuals who used social media for news were more likely to stereotype and express prejudice. However, those who engaged in frequent heterogenous discussions, and had more extensive social networks, were less likely to stereotype and express prejudice. Higher social and political trust was also associated with lower stereotyping and prejudice. Finally, moderation effects of network characteristics on the relationship between risk perception, social trust, and prejudice were observed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bias and misconceptions surrounding alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and obesity-related liver disease (OLD) may lead to transplant listing inequities. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients, medical students, residents, fellows, and attending physicians for bias and misconceptions regarding liver transplantation (LT) for patients with ALD and OLD. METHODS: Participants took a survey asking them whether patients with ALD who continue/discontinue drinking alcohol or patients with OLD who do/do not commit to a weight loss program deserve equal LT rights. A Likert scale was used for their responses. Participants also estimated 5-year survival and advanced fibrosis recurrence after LT. The primary outcome of the study was bias measured by expected agreement or disagreement to questions using a Likert scale, significant underestimation of a 5-year survival rate after LT, and significant overestimation of 5-year advanced fibrosis recurrence after LT. RESULTS: A total of 381 participants were included in the analysis: 153 residents/fellows, 31 attending physicians, 98 medical students, and 99 patients. A higher percentage from all 4 participating groups either were neutral or disagreed with equal LT rights for patients with ALD who discontinue drinking compared with patients with OLD who commit to weight loss program. The attending physician group was the only group with a majority estimating &gt;60% 5-year survival after LT in patients with ALD and OLD (P &lt; 0.05). All 4 groups had a majority estimate &gt;20% 5-year advanced fibrosis recurrence in patients with ALD and OLD (P &gt; 0.05). DISCUSSION: There seems to be current bias and misconceptions regarding LT for patients with ALD and OLD. © 2021 by The American College of Gastroenterology

AB  - Objectives: Academia is grappling with how to address persistent underrepresentation and reduce inequities. With so many diversity-enhancing initiatives underway, some within the academic community might experience “diversity fatigue,” a construct we use to understand majority groups’ feelings of weariness toward diversity efforts. Method: For our testing purposes, we focused on ethnic and minority underrepresentation, and collected data in four studies from 473 White American students and faculty.Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and latent profile analysis, we develop and confirm the single factor structure of the final 6-item Diversity Fatigue scale. We measured associations with other established measures and examined the strength of the association between diversity fatigue and faculty’s support for a diversity-enhancing intervention. Results: Results demonstrated scale reliability, convergent validity with system-justifying beliefs, and offer suggestive evidence of discriminant validity with inclusion concerns and implicit race-based associations. Although mean levels of diversity fatigue were low overall,diversity fatigue scores were related to concerns about the effort involved with diversity work and were significantly associated with faculty’s motivation to adopt a diversity-enhancing classroom activity.Conclusions: Diversity fatigue in academia is a dampening in people’s response to or enthusiasm for efforts that improve the experience of underrepresented people. This state experience is connected to system-justifying beliefs and is related to concerns about the effort required to do diversity interventions. Understanding and measuring this construct has implications for the psychology of intergroup relations, as well as practical implications for campus communities committed to diversity programs. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Objectives: Research has shown that cultural identity and psychological well-being are associated. We suggest that negative stereotypes challenge the psychological well-being of people with a migrant background. This research focused on the dynamics of adolescents’ ethnic/racial identity (ERI), national identity, stereotype vulnerability, and psychological well-being on the individual level. The study was conducted in Austria over the course of one school year, providing insights on developmental implications of cultural identity for adolescents with a migrant background in Europe. Methods: The sample consisted of 317 (T1) adolescents with a migrant background, recruited at Austrian high schools (age: M = 15.19, SD = 1.11; 233 female; ethnic background: mainly Turkey and Ex-Yugoslavian countries). Longitudinal data from a three-wave study were analyzed by means of a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model. Results: Within-person effects provided a better explanation than the between-person approach. Withinperson processes suggest that higher levels of ERI commitment and higher national identity predict higher levels of psychological well-being at a later time point, whereas higher levels of ERI exploration and higher stereotype vulnerability predict lower levels of psychological well-being. At the between-person level, findings indicate a positive correlation between ERI exploration and stereotype vulnerability. Conclusion: The cultural identity and psychological well-being of adolescents with a migrant background fluctuate over time, influenced by the social context. Stereotype vulnerability contributes to lower levels of psychological well-being among adolescents with a migrant background in Austria. Our findings highlight the necessity to partition the variance of constructs to avoid confounding of between-person and within-person effects. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Objective: To analyze the perception of nurses on the decentralization of care to people living with HIV. Method: Exploratory, descriptive, qualitative study conducted with primary health care nurses based on Imogene King’s Open Systems Theory (personal, interpersonal, and social). The data were obtained through interviews; a sociodemographic/professional questionnaire and a semi-structured script were employed, processed by the IRAMUTEQ software and analyzed through Descending Hierarchical Classification. Results: Study participants amounted to 32 nurses. Five classes emerged from the analysis: “diagnostic revelation process”;“professional training”; “preventive measures”; “barriers and potentials in the process of decentralization”; and “stigma and prejudice”. Conclusion: In the process of reorganization of the healthcare model for people living with HIV in primary health care, an important contribution by nurses in strengthening the local healthcare decentralization was identified. © 2021.

AB  - This article ascribes social-interactional strategies of ethnic Chinese toward the local people in developing mutual social relationship after the conflicts or post-conflicts. The context of multicultural ethnic life had distressed Chinese people to mingle with local people in West Kalimantan causing a wide social gap in the society. This research was conducted through an ethnography methodology to reveal the facts utilizing observation, interview, and documentation to collect the data. There were twelve participants participated as the informants of the research included four Chinese and eight local people. The results of the research revealed that ethnic Chinese had been successful to rebuild and develop the social relationship with the local people through social interaction and engagement. The strategy used was to prioritize human values while interacting, as well as to respect the culture diversity that existed in the community. By implementing the strategy, the social—interactional relationship between Chinese and local people after the conflicts became harmonious. This result could also trigger or lead other multicultural communities to implement similar strategies to fix or rebuild their inter-ethnic relationship. Finally, this article contributes to propose problem solutions to solve social conflicts in multicultural community, and as an effort to prevent the inter-ethnic conflicts. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Despite reductions in traditional racial prejudice among non-Hispanic and non-Latino White Americans, Black Americans regularly experience discrimination. We argue that bias persists because although many White Americans espouse nonracist beliefs, far fewer actively work to combat the societal and institutional discrimination that impedes social change. In the current work, we were interested in identifying and measuring the belief systems associated with White Americans’ active participation in the fight against racial discrimination. In six studies, we developed and validated a measure of antiracism to tap into the belief that White people should proactively fight racial discrimination. Results established the convergent and discriminant validity of the measure and confirmed that antiracism was related to, but distinct from, personal nonracist beliefs. Moreover, higher levels of antiracism were associated with greater perceptions of racial discrimination, collective action intentions, willingness to condemn an officer in a racially motivated shooting, support for diversity tax incentives, and likelihood of signing up to receive information about volunteering for an equal rights organization. Results suggest antiracist beliefs may be the key to understanding White Americans’ active support for social change. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article identifies and presents the main debates and issues that are generating interest in the field of creole studies. It is composed of two main sections. The first one presents the debates currently stimulating creolistics: the nature of pidgins and creoles and the relation between the two, the sociological and typological distinction between pidgins and creoles, the various theories explaining their origin, and their transformation through time. The second part raises issues linked to the social life of these languages, an area of research that, though present since the beginning of creolistics, has remained limited. Using the framework of linguistic ideology, this review surveys the social status of pidgins and creoles, the prejudices that exclude them from being used at schools, and their lack of linguistic legitimacy. It concludes with a discussion of pidgins and creoles on social media. © 2021 Annual Reviews Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article reports the results of a research on how fathers perceive and participate in home births. For that, five men who participated in the home birth of their children underwent a semi-structured interview, whose content was analyzed by means of discourse analysis. The results indicate that, despite the prejudices against home birth faced by these men, they actively participated in childbirth and postpartum. From the male perspective, home birth is an enriching experience that increase men’s participation and widen the exercise of paternity during the whole process. © 2021

AB  - Using interpretative case study methods, the researchers examined the beliefs and practices of 10 preservice social studies teachers with self-described preferences to teach for justice. While all of the participants in this study identified as committed to justice, there was a division between teachers whose beliefs were tolerance-oriented (focused primarily on individual prejudice) and teachers whose beliefs were equity-oriented (focused primarily on systemic oppression). Across the cases, we generally found that the teachers were grouped into three types: teachers not making progress toward critical social studies, teachers implementing critical social studies irregularly, and teachers implementing critical social studies regularly. Teachers who had strong equity-oriented beliefs were more likely to implement critical social studies regularly in their classrooms during student teaching. © 2021

AB  - The study of Latinx children’s race- and ethnicity-related identity, beliefs, and preferences has the potential to contribute to theoretical models and policy recommendations concerning intergroup attitudes and relations. We examined a host of such constructs among Latinx children (N = 61; 72% girls) living in the Southwest US, ranging from 6 to 11 years (M = 8.45, SD = 1.39). With the goal of assessing individual, group, and age-related variation within—and relations across—measures, we assessed racial/ethnic: (a) identity (i.e., self-categorization, centrality), (b) beliefs (stereotypes, perceived parental social distance), and (c) preferences (friendship choices, social distance). Results indicated that children held more positive attitudes toward Latinx and White children than toward Black children. Children who felt more comfortable around Latinx individuals had more Latinx best friends, and those children who felt that race/ethnicity was an important part of their identity were more likely to report having no Black best friends, suggesting that parents and teachers should discuss race/ethnicity in ways that dispel potential anti-Black prejudice and encourage cross-race/ethnicity friendship. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Can targeted messages from political elites impact the relationship between valuing conformity and prejudice? We answer this question in a survey experiment on a national probability sample from the Netherlands by exposing respondents to a favorable vs. unfavorable statement about East European immigrants. We find that individuals attaching relatively high importance to the value of conformity express greater agreement with the statement, independently of its content or partisanship. Further, the positive association between valuing conformity and prejudice is significantly decreased when individuals are presented with a favorable statement about East European immigrants. Thus, valuing conformity is not only associated with higher prejudice but can also reduce prejudice because it makes individuals susceptible to elite normative pressure to respond positively. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The paper analyses the position of women in Yugoslav sport through analysis of archival material and compares it to the position of women in Serbian sport half a century later. The subject and the goal of the paper are exposed in the introductory part of the paper, and the methods used in the paper are exposed in the special part of the paper. The results, discussion and conclusion are the remaining three parts of the paper. Authors conclude that despite the progressive policy conducted first by the post-WW2 Yugoslav government and then by the Serbian government in contemporary Serbia, the position of women in sports has remained essentially the same. Prejudice, misunderstanding and overall gender inequality are typical of both periods. This fact reveals the weaknesses of progressive policies lacking an adequate material basis, since the social conditions of rural areas are the main reasons for such inequality. Furthermore, authors point to the complexity and significance of the phenomenon and prove that the struggle for gender equality in sports is far from over, as the position of women in Yugoslav and Serbian sport has shown only slight improvement since the difficult initial steps. © 2021, Sociological Association of Serbia.

AB  - Controversial issues characterise life in democratic societies and they often arise unexpectedly in the classroom, without being planned for by the teacher. However, controversial issues are rarely addressed beyond a mandatory curriculum and are often avoided. The aim of this exploratory study is to investigate what teachers identify and address as unplanned controversial issues in the classroom and the content of such issues. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 12 teachers from primary, secondary and upper-secondary schools across Europe. Unplanned controversial issues identified fell into three categories (1) mainstream controversy, (2) teacher-initiated controversy and (3) controversial pedagogy. Mainstream controversies follow mainstream definitions of controversial issues. In teacher-initiated controversies, teachers reacted to statements made by students, taking a stand against examples of prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination. Controversial pedagogy refers to instances in which the teachers’ behaviour was deemed controversial by the teachers themselves. The content of the unplanned controversial issues that teachers identified and addressed is multi-faceted and draws upon personal, current, cultural and historical dimensions. The findings suggest that more attention needs to be paid, among other things, to the political dimension of education, teacher vulnerability, and who the person in teaching is. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This study presents an empirical analysis on the attitudes of the co-ethnic hosting populations in Bangladesh toward the 1.1 million Rohingya refugees inside Bangladeshi camps. This paper presents the dynamics of the co-ethnic relations in crisis time, showcasing, in particular, the limits of co-ethnic solidarity within a refugee-host context. An original online survey experiment (N = 451), conducted on urban university students and social media users, reveals the impact of exposure to curated negative framing of the Rohingyas by pro-government media. We found that such negative exposure reduces the probability of believing that Rohingyas integrate effectively into Bangladeshi society by nearly 58% and also reduce support for the Rohingyas’ access to the public services generally available to Bangladeshi citizens (e.g., public schools and hospitals) by 47%. Regression results from another survey (N = 1697) on the hosting population in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh further helps explain that less interaction with the Rohingyas is the channel through which politicizing or othering the Rohingya’s entitlement to public services—as demonstrated by the survey experiment—takes place. The results show that the odds of having the view that the Rohingyas should not be allowed access to public services (e.g., public schools and hospitals) among those who never interact are bigger than among those who interact with the Rohingya. This study reaffirms the immigration literature on the value of interaction and the direct impact of dehumanizing campaigns against refugees, even in the case of co-ethnic hosting populations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The paper aims to investigate whether trust in a host government can mitigate the negative effects caused by the social complexities facing low-status expatriates (LSEs) living in China. It models trust in host government as a mediator in the relationship between expatriates’ perception of status-based prejudice and their work attitudes, it further outlines the role of self-esteem in this relationship. The study seeks to expand knowledge in the domain of expatriate management by explaining the prejudicial behavior of host country towards low-status expatriates. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze responses from LSEs in China. The results provide the evidence that perceived discrimination negatively affects expatriates’ work attitudes and suggest that trust in the host government can mediate such effects. Self-esteem is found to be a significant moderator in the relationship. With this, the study empirically affirms social categorization theory, showing it to be a powerful lens through which LSE adaptability can be the behavior of host nationals towards low-status expatriates and can be further developed with regard to the adaptability of low-status expatriates. © 2021, Centre of Sociological Research.

AB  - There are various theoretical approaches for understanding intergroup biases among children and adolescents. This article focuses on the social identity approach and argues that existing research will benefit by more fully considering the implications of this approach for examining intergroup relations among youngsters. These implications include (a) the importance of self-categorization, (b) the role of self-stereotyping and group identification, (c) the relevance of shared understandings and developing ingroup consensus, and (d) the importance of coordinated action for positive and negative intergroup relations. These implications of the social identity approach suggest several avenues for investigating children’s and adolescents’ intergroup relations that have not been fully appreciated in the existing literature. However, there are also limitations to the social identity approach for the developmental understanding and some of these are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Anecdotal reports suggested an uptick in anti-Asian prejudice corresponding with the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Examining responses from White U.S. citizens (N = 589) during the first months of the pandemic, this study tested: (a) whether actual intensity (official number of cases or deaths reported) or perceived intensity (participants’ estimates of the same) of the COVID-19 outbreak predicted indicators of racial outgroup prejudice, particularly those associated with cross-group interaction, (b) whether outgroup prejudice was oriented toward Asian people specifically, or toward racial outgroups more broadly (e.g., toward both Asian people and Black people), and (c) whether contact with racial outgroups moderated relations between COVID-19 intensity and racial prejudice. Results showed that perceived COVID-19 intensity was associated with prejudice indicators representing the desire for social distance from Asian people, as well as from Black people, yet it was unrelated to reports of negative affect toward either racial outgroup. These patterns support the idea that prejudice during periods of disease outbreak might functionally serve to reduce willingness for interaction with, and likelihood of infection from, racial outgroups. Contact moderated the relation between official reports of COVID-19 intensity and support for anti-China travel policies, such that greater contact with Asian people was associated with less support for exclusionary, anti-China travel policies when actual COVID-19 intensity was high. Overall, these results suggest that intensity of disease threat can exacerbate racial outgroup prejudice and reduce willingness for cross-group interaction, but that intergroup contact may sometimes provide a prejudice-attenuating effect. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Synthetic drug use (SDU) is on the rise in China. Utilizing a grounded three-level social-ecological theoretical model, we aim to better understand how users, medical professionals, and other community gatekeepers perceive the causes and consequences of synthetic drug use in Kunming, China. Past work typically relies on drug users confined to rehabilitation facilities. Utilizing qualitative methods, our work integrates how various community actors perceive problems around synthetic drug use. Thirty face-to-face interviews were conducted in Kunming that were audio-recorded and transcribed. We identify emergent personal, interpersonal and societal level themes shaping SDU which provided our grounded theoretical model. Regardless of their social position, informants identified curiosity, peer networks that facilitated exposure, and the communality of sharing the drug experience as reasons to try synthetic drugs. Drug users reported negative consequences of SDU including the inability to sleep, a fear that others might discover one was using, and the difficulty of quitting. Medical professionals and others in the community were more likely to identify potential harms of SDU. Still, these community members felt synthetic drugs were less problematic than traditional drugs and reported less prejudice and stigma about these new drugs. Overall, medical professionals felt ill-prepared to deal with this new epidemic. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Various economic and social characteristics have been used to explain individual vote choice in the 2016 British EU Referendum. Recently, researchers have considered the role various psychological orientations have played in this vote choice. Here, we are interested in two in particular: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO); constructs that are often used to predict a host of political attitudes and behaviors, particularly those where group identities are a central issue. Those high in RWA prefer group uniformity and are willing to use coercion to enforce this preference. Those high in SDO prefer group-based, hierarchical social and political systems over more egalitarian systems. These orientations are therefore likely to have played a role in people’s vote choice in this referendum. Using data from the 2014–2019 British Election Study internet panel we show that RWA and SDO powerfully influence anti-immigrant attitudes and pro-sovereignty attitudes; attitudes strongly associated with individual vote choice. Our findings suggest that the EU Referendum effectively rallied people’s prejudices against foreign and domestic outsiders to pull the United Kingdom from the European Union. © 2021 Elections, Public Opinion & Parties.

AB  - Off-site manufacturing may play a significant role in improving both process and output productivity in the construction industry and achieving UN Sustainability Development Goals 11 and 13. However, uniform mass production can lead to a monotonous built environment that may be alienating to people. Past examples show that such buildings and neighbourhoods can rapidly become obsolete, which makes them unsustainable. In this study, two online surveys were conducted with over 100 participants focusing on prejudices towards mass manufactured residential buildings and diversity requirements for homes among Hungarian young adults. In contrast to previous studies, respondents evaluated example scenarios with standardised buildings not as observers but by imagining how they would feel or act in situations involving these buildings. The first survey examined the bias of respondents towards mass manufactured buildings with Likert, Thurstone, and semantic differential scales. The second examined how respondents would feel if they visited a home similar to their own by varying visiting frequency and degree of similarity. T-tests showed that prejudices were positive, except concerning mass manufactured buildings’ diversity, and respondents were only negative about having to see identical dwellings to theirs on a regular basis. The results suggest that in Hungary, non-uniform but standardised residential buildings can serve as a suitable tool to provide affordable housing to young adults affected by the housing crisis. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to present a sociocultural analysis of the linguistic experience of South Asian women who immigrate to Taiwan to marry Taiwanese men. In Taiwan, foreign wives and their husbands and children have gradually become a new multicultural, multi-ethnic social group. We argue that because of the power gap between the narrators (who write in Chinese) and the narrative subjects (who are unable to ‘write back' in Chinese), language has powerfully impacted the patterns of prejudice and the construction of subjects’ identities. Marriage immigrants are often subjected to the negative stereotypes created and exaggerated by language standardisation within a dominant ideology. Learning Chinese empowers them to gradually engage in social participation outside of their families in the public space. Written in Chinese, their nonfiction works represent a narrative turn in Taiwan. In this manner, a range of voices are actively resisting discriminatory acts. The foreign wives ask not only for basic rights such as legal residency and work permits but also for the right to enjoy equal and shared cultural interaction in Taiwan. This study shows that language acquisition and writing is an effective means of promoting equal exchange and dialogue between cultures within the broader transformations of globalisation. © Australasian Universities Language and Literature Association 2021.

AB  - People in diverse societies often discuss and debate strategies for achieving egalitarian goals, such as achieving equality in their societies. A tacit assumption in these discussions is that all parties must agree on what equality means in order to pursue and achieve it. In this paper, I use the United States as a context to examine whether that assumption is reasonable, given the effects of macro-level structure and culture on individual psychologies. Specifically, I discuss how patterns of social stratification seep into the mind and affect how different groups of people perceive and make meaning of the world around them, including their understanding of concepts like equality. Further, I discuss what those processes mean for differential motivation to pursue egalitarian goals among sub-groups of people within shared, yet segregated, societies. Finally, I end with some considerations about pathways to achieve equality even when people disagree about what that actually means. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Internal and external motivation to respond without prejudice scale (IEMS) provides a self-report tool sensitive to individual tendencies to control implicit and explicit prejudice without directly inquiring about attitudes toward an outgroup. The current study verified the scale’s psychometric properties and construct validity on a Slovak sample. In line with the predictions, the principal component analysis suggested, and confirmatory factor analysis validated the presence of two uncorrelated factors of internal and external motivation. Additionally, while internal motivation was positively associated with adherence to egalitarianism and negatively with authoritarianism, external motivation did not demonstrate any of these relationships. Furthermore, only external motivation was found to be positively related to expressive self-control that parallels propositions claiming greater self-regulatory demands when egalitarian norms are followed to avoid social disapproval. Finally, both factors were positively correlated with concerns from appearing prejudiced, although internal motivation in a significantly greater degree, reflecting larger dependency on self-oriented concerns. With appropriate values of internal consistency for both factors, the IEMS scale provides a reliable self-report measure that might be used for systematic control of individual differences in the research of social cognition in intergroup context. © 2021 Institute of Experimental Psychology, Centre of Social and Psychological Sciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Using The Players’ Tribune, we interpret how NBA players discuss race within a racialized sporting organisation that is celebrated and marketed as cosmopolitan and a model for social engagement. We find that during the Black Lives Matter movement players draw on and move between varied visions of sport, the NBA, and its relationship to race. Players reject post-racial conceptions of sport and society and highlight the realities of structural racism and interpersonal prejudice within the NBA and society. At the same time, players affirm notions of the NBA as removed from social problems and a leader for positive racial dialogue. These discursive shifts and collisions indicate that while individualistic and less critical conceptions of sport and race persistently circulate, they are also vulnerable to more race-conscious, structural, and critical articulations. Thus, we argue player engagement with sport, race, and politics on platforms like TPT help set the stage for the current wave of anti-racist actions and statements from high-profile athletes across global sport post-2020 and is linked to how the NBA politically orients itself as a racialized professional sports organisation. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In this article, I provide a critical look into the cultural politics of racialised and gendered representations in Africa–China related mediascapes from the perspective of “popular geopolitics.” Geopolitical frameworks have been used in political science and international relations research to analyse Africa–China issues, but have been remarkably overlooked as methodological tools for making sense of the cultural politics of Afro-Chinese racialised politics and narratives, and their implications. To breach this gap, I focus on a number of recent controversial incidents (e.g. an advertisement, a theatrical skit, and debates around social media posts) that weave old and new racist rhetoric/tropes, and gendered stereotypes, into evolving processes of racialisation that inform everyday geopolitical imaginaries of the Africa–China encounter. This is followed by a brief discussion where I use the notion of “multiple triangulations” to trace the routes through which negative stereotypes about blackness could have entered China. By specifically looking at contemporary popular media representations of Africa and blackness, I show how “race,” ethnicity, gender, class and nationalism, problematically underwrite, and are written into a rhetoric that evinces geopolitical asymmetries that characterise crucial areas of Africa–China relations. Throughout the article, I argue that there is an emerging pattern where Chineseness is discursively constructed as a “replacement” for whiteness. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Prior publications on sexuality education experiences have often focused on cisgender students. Few have studied transgender students’ experiences, particularly in East Asia, and none have addressed these issues in the Hong Kong Chinese context, where transgender human rights are a hotly debated issue, and injustice towards trans youth persists. Using the concepts of transprejudice and rights-based sexuality education, this paper identifies the non-inclusive and inclusive sexuality education experiences of Chinese transgender students as reported in data from qualitative interviews with eight trans students aged 16–20 years from secondary schools and a community college. We identified the following themes: 1) Left Out–being omitted and silenced; 2) Terrified and Distressed–being misgendered and misinformed; 3) Outraged–being pathologised and bullied; 4) Empowered: connecting trans-Inclusive and rights-based education; 5) Affirmed and Supported–engaging in trans-inclusive dialogue. The paper argues that rights-based gender diversity content needs to be included in the sexuality education curriculum to reduce transgender students’ feelings of marginalisation. It also speaks to the need for advocacy for non-prejudiced and inclusive sexuality education in Hong Kong. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - It is estimated that only approximately 20 percent of adult European Roma have attained higher than primary education. Scholars have identified different potential causes of the unfavourable school outcomes achieved by Roma students. Cultural differences between the (traditional) way of life in Roma families and the values professed by the mainstream society are often blamed for high dropout rates and the low educational attainment of Roma. Yet there is also a group of researchers who disagree with this, and suggest that it is more to do with economic and other differences. Our empirical study is based on a large representative sample of UNDP/WB/EC Regional Roma Survey conducted in twelve European countries. We show that, on average, Roma respondents (in comparison to non-Roma) express remarkably lower levels of educational aspirations for children. However, these differences diminish considerably when controlling for common individual and household characteristics, and again when including culture proxies. Consequently, our study contributes to questioning one of the negative stereotypes about the distinctiveness of Roma and their culture in relation to education. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic brought along with it concerns about anxiety, racial bias, and pushback against public health recommendations, all of which are intensified by the news and social media. This study investigated the effects of constructive journalism in the context of this crisis, by randomly assigning 492 subjects to view simulated social media news updates with different headlines and images. The results showed positive and constructive headlines led to less anger and anxiety than negative headlines. The sanitization of graphic images decreased anger, anxiety, COVID-19 risk perceptions, and anti-Chinese sentiment—a relationship that was mediated by anger and anxiety. These findings suggest constructive journalism can be useful in times of crisis, and that its visual aspect warrants more scholarly attention. Further, these results shed new light on the effects of news exposure via social media in times of crisis, and how this impact depends on specific attributes of the headlines and images of the content being shared. The findings are discussed in relation to the theory of affective intelligence and recent concerns about how news and social media influence the public in times of crisis. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Because they involve important decisions, should actual trials involve less or more discrimination than trial simulations? Does discrimination occur when defendant and juror both belong to underprivileged groups? In two experiments employing a 2 (decision importance) X 2 (defendant ingroup/outgroup status) design, Black and Hispanic (and some White) college students read a robbery/murder trial transcript. The defendant belonged to participants’ racial/ethnic group or one of the others. Low-decision-importance instructions asked mock-jurors to consider the case carefully. High-decision-importance instructions emphasized the study was a government-sponsored assessment of jurors’ reasoning about a real trial with known guilt/innocence. In Experiment 1 (n = 118), outgroup discrimination–judging outgroup defendants more likely guilty–was evident only under high importance. In Experiment 2 (n = 135), which presented weaker prosecution of the trial and included processing-motivation measures, outgroup discrimination occurred regardless of importance. Black and Hispanic mock-jurors discriminated against defendants of the other group. Greater identity-related processing motivation was reported under high importance. High importance may reduce bias associated with heuristic processing, but promote bias through processing infused with evaluative associations involving social identity and race/ethnicity. The defendant outgroup discrimination regardless of importance suggests prejudice observed in trial simulations may generalize to actual trials. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Bias is an ambiguous term, defined in different ways. In conventional usage, it indicates unwarranted prejudice. However, in health research, the notion that bias is invariably bad is biased. Although research bias is an error that is always harmful, researcher bias is a tendency to think in a particular way that may obscure or illuminate attempts to address research questions. Researcher bias begins with pre-judgements whose continuing evaluation infuses the subjectivity of researchers as persons who are socially situated in health sciences focusing on human subjects. Two sets of conditions can make this bias in health researchers useful. The first is volume control. Researchers can vary the loudness of their own and other voices in different research environments. The second condition is smart working. It balances researcher bias against analytic thinking to work creatively with irregularity and uncertainty. Thus, health researchers need to bring their biases to consciousness. A dialectical approach can then engage the biases as conversational partners to innovate health policy that is informed by principles including transparency, good faith and tolerance. Less critical than whether researchers are biased is whose interests their bias serves given their positionality and role. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Understanding when and why White racial attitudes change is important for understanding their politics. Critically, surveys reveal Whites’ views of Black Americans have been changing recently, an important result given conventional wisdom that these are stable orientations. I test four possible explanations for these shifting views: genuine attitude change, social desirability, partisan expressive responding, and changing racial attitude measure performance. Importantly, these explanations produce observationally equivalent survey toplines. To adjudicate between them, I use the measurement equivalence framework and examine how Whites answer the racial resentment measure. Evidence from multigroup confirmatory factor analysis models supports genuine attitude change. Substantively, this suggests these changes may have important political implications. Methodologically, it suggests partisan expressive responding may have limits, indicates social desirability pressures have not changed how Whites answer at least one racial attitude measure, and offers additional validity evidence for the racial resentment measure. ©2021, Midwest Political Science Association

AB  - Many more autistic women than men do not receive diagnosis in childhood. In addition, they are often socialised from an early age to conceal or ‘camouflage’ their differences in order to fit in. Gendered prejudices often dictate workplace roles which serve to further disadvantage women. Employers are often unaware of how to ensure their workplaces are accommodating for autistic women, and it may seem inconvenient or unnecessary to make adjustments. This article seeks to highlight some issues related to promoting the meaningful recruitment and inclusion of autistic women in the workplace. It draws on qualitative research data to highlight the intersectional dimensions of being an autistic woman at work. The emerging themes are discussed with a view to improving knowledge about how to improve workplace environments and practices thereby support autistic women to succeed. Points of interest Autistic women ‘camouflage’ or ‘mask’ aspects of their autism in order to conceal or compensate for their differences. This may mean they appear to cope and consequently, their needs for support or adjustments at work are overlooked. The research methods use the narratives of autistic women to illuminate the difficulties and advantages of being both autistic and a woman in the workplace. This research suggests that sexist expectations of women to interact as non-autistic person would at work, particularly in relation to emotions, impacts upon their opportunities to progress in their chosen careers. The research discusses barriers and support at work. It contributes to improving awareness of the diverse and complex challenges faced by autistic women. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The current heightened social awareness and anxiety triggered by escalating violence against Black Americans in the United States demands a safe space for reflection, education, and civil discourse within the academic setting. Too often there is an unmet need paired with a collective urgent desire to better understand the chronic existing structural, social, educational, and health inequities affecting disadvantaged populations, particularly Black Americans. In this perspective, the authors provide insight into a shared learning approach that provided a forum to discuss Perspectives Against Racism (PAR). Unlike existing topdown approaches, faculty, trainees, and staff were engaged in leading a series of focused discussions to examine unconscious bias, promote awareness of implicit biases, and reflect on individual and collective roles and responsibilities in working toward becoming antiracist. An existing 1-h graduate elective seminar course was dedicated to creating a space for learning, discussion, and exchange of ideas related to the experience and existence of racism (personal and institutional/systemic). A goal of each session was to go beyond didactics and identify mechanisms to implement change, at the level of the individual, department, and institution. This perspective of the shared experience may provide an adaptable framework that can be implemented in an academic setting at the departmental, center, or institutional level. academia; bias; diversity; educational activities; interdisciplinary placement; prejudice; racial inequality; racism; shared learning; social justice © 2021 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - A recent article published in this journal on confidentiality in the care of HIV/aids patients reports that, in the event of a positive result in the Screening Tests for the virus, the Blood Bank must, in addition to disposing of the blood bag, refer the donor to the reference service. Due to the implicit ethical dilemmas we have experienced, this led us to a detailed review of the respective brazilian legislation and critical analysis of the issue. People with HIV/aids are surrounded by prejudices, discrimination and negative social repercussions, so it is essential that the Blood Bank professional who will communicate this news is fully aware of the issues involving secrecy and confidentiality, and fully trained and capable to proceed adequately. We present and discuss the fundamental points of the current Brazilian legislation the theme and how we must communicate to the donor about the detection of HIV serodiagnosis. © 2021, Conselho Federal de Medicina.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, as a global threat to humanity, is likely to instigate a variety of collective responses in the society. We examined, for the first time, whether the COVID-19 threat perception is related to attitudes towards Syrian refugees in Turkey, theorizing a dual pathway whereby pandemic-induced threat would relate to both pro- and anti-immigrant feelings. Drawing upon integrated threat theory and models of collective-threat regulation, we expected that pandemic threat would lead to more exclusionary outgroup attitudes through increased immigrant threat, whereas we argued that perceived COVID-19 threat would promote inclusionary attitudes through creating a common ingroup in the face of a global threat. Using online search volume data at the province level (Study 1, N = 81) and self-reporting measures at the individual level (Study 2, N = 294), we found that the COVID-19 threat was directly associated with more positive attitudes towards refugees (Study 1 and 2). Study 2 further revealed indirect positive (through a sense of common identity) and negative (through perceptions of immigrant threat) links between COVID-19 threat perception and outgroup attitudes. These results highlight the importance of integrating threat regulation and social identity perspectives when assessing the implications of pathogen-related threats. Copyright: © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Autonomous intelligent agents participate in complex social situations. It is necessary that agents are aware of their society and still understand their context of action and interaction. Such social situation with other agents is influenced by society’s characteristics, including their norms, values, common interests and objectives, members, and social structures. Each complex society is broken down into social groups, each one with an identity. Social identity theory is seen as an analysis of intergroup relations in social categories based on the cognitive definition and the autoconcept of a social group and their belonging. Researchers have been studying this theory in computing, more specifically in multiagent systems. Social exchanges are the object of study in diverse contexts in which social relations are understood as social exchanges. One of the investigated themes is the self-regulation of social exchanges. The game of self-regulation of social exchanges explores its self-regulation but it does not analyse the agents’ identity. Therefore, this research investigates the integration of psychosocial analysis of social identity theory into the social adaptive complex society of the game of self-regulation of social exchanges. The principal result of this work is the GSRSEPSIT, a social simulation model. © Operational Research Society 2021.

AB  - Anti-immigrant hostility continues to rise throughout multicultural societies. Building on segmented assimilation theory, in this manuscript I examine whether anti-immigrant sentiment might decrease school performance of immigrant children using the case of California, the state with the largest population of immigrants in the United States. I find a negative association between an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment at the community level and academic performance of immigrant students. This finding has broad implications for our understanding of immigrant educational experiences. It is also especially relevant at a time when multicultural societies are struggling to incorporate immigrants successfully into their economic, social, and political spheres. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The increasing sectarianization of the international relations of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a defining feature of the region’s contemporary politics. Iran has sought to increase its influence among Shi‘i populations of foreign countries, while Saudi Arabia and other Sunni regimes have moved to curtail it. In heterogeneous and polarized MENA societies, like Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, where the Shi‘a constitute a sizable proportion of the population and compete for political power, it is natural to presume that sectarianization likely increases tension and prejudice against the Shi‘a. Yet, little is known about homogenous MENA societies, where the Shi‘a exist as an infinitesimal, uninfluential minority that does not seek political power. This topic is examined using an original, nationally-representative survey of 2,000 respondents in Morocco. We find that about 59 per cent of individuals express interpersonal prejudice against Moroccan Shi‘a, expressing discomfort at the prospect of having a Shi‘i neighbour. Such prejudice is counter-intuitive, given that Moroccan Shi‘a constitute a miniscule minority–less than.1 per cent of the population. We investigate three hypotheses concerning the sources of anti-Shi‘i prejudice, which locate them in social marginalization, religious beliefs and practices, and views about regional politics. The first two hypotheses are drawn from the existing literature, whereas the third is our unique theoretical contribution. Our results, which find support for the connection between individuals’ views about regional politics and anti-Shi‘i prejudice, advance scholarly understanding of religious diversity in the MENA, showing how international developments can trickle down into interpersonal relations to hinder the acceptance and tolerance of sectarian minorities. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are evidence-based treatments, yet can be controversial among some populations. This study provides a systematic review of prejudice and discrimination toward MOUD, a form of “intervention stigma,” or stigma associated with a particular medical treatment. Methods: A systematic search strategy was used in PsychInfo and PubMed to identify studies published between 1998 and 2018. Studies that empirically examined stigma toward MOUD were included if the manuscript was of moderate or high quality. Studies were analyzed using thematic synthesis. Results: The search yielded 972 studies, of which 28 were included. Most studies utilized qualitative methods to examine intervention stigma toward methadone or buprenorphine, with one including naltrexone. Studies demonstrated that intervention stigma among healthcare providers was influenced by lack of training and abstinent treatment preferences. Providers equated MOUD with illicit substance use and at times refused to care for MOUD patients. Stigma among peer patients seeking treatment was also influenced by abstinent treatment preferences, and among the general public stigma was influenced by lack of MOUD knowledge. Intervention stigma was also driven at the policy level by high regulation of methadone, which fueled diversion and hindered social functioning among patients. Few studies indicated how to reduce intervention stigma toward MOUD. Conclusions: Intervention stigma affects both provision and perceptions of methadone and buprenorphine, decreasing access and utilization of MOUD. Future research should further develop and test MOUD stigma reduction interventions in a variety of social contexts to improve access to care and reduce patient barriers. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Groupwork is a useful classroom tool, but may not fully benefit students who are ostracized by peers due to nonacademic factors, like weight. Here, undergraduate students estimated GPAs of hypothetical student peers who were described as “overweight” or “normal-weight” and judged how much they wanted to work with them. We found small but significant effects: students rated overweight peers as having lower GPAs and reported less desire to work with them relative to normal-weight peers. Instructors should be cognizant that overweight students are believed by their peers to be less desirable class partners and may be excluded from classroom participation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - When people support voter identification (ID) laws, who do they imagine they are keeping in and out of the voting booth? We investigated this question across three studies. First, using a traditional survey approach, we found support for voter ID laws was associated with beliefs that ID requirements reduce illegal voting by both Black and White people to the same degree. Because explicit surveys are vulnerable to social desirability concerns, in the following two studies, we utilized an indirect measure, reverse correlation, to investigate mental images of those who try to vote illegally (Study 2) and mental images of those who should and should not get to vote (Study 3). The findings of these studies suggest that support for voter ID laws is associated with racially biased perceptions of illegal voters and who should get to vote. Critically, these biased perceptions may be underestimated by traditional explicit survey approaches. © The Author(s) 2021.

It is a qualitative study developed from a participatory methodology in Colombia, 2015. The sample consisted of a total of 60 young adults, including 46 teens and managers. The techniques used were a social survey given to 46 adolescents, an unstructured interview to 30, focus groups and resignification workshops. The representations by teenagers and young people about the subject came from female figures, inculcated early, when still in their homes, according to the socio-cultural contexts in which they were inserted. Thus, their beliefs do not favor the development of practices aimed at preventing diseases and teenage pregnancy, in addition to reinforcing stereotyped ideals of masculinity and femininity and prejudices in relation to sex, prioritizing sexist and homophobic notions regarding gender roles. © 2021, UNIV SAOPAULO.

AB  - Researching public opinion in ethnic minority areas of Vietnam in general and ethnic minority area of Northern Vietnam in particular to understand what people are desiring is essential. Ethnic minorities in Northern Vietnam are not only concerned with the urgent issues associated with their daily lives, but also diverse social issues in an age where communication is strongly developing. People always show dynamism and activeness in practices related to public opinion. And remarkably, in this picture, there is no clear slice between modern elements of the globalization context and traditional elements. Views that ethnic minorities are always passive need to be revised. It is necessary to create conditions for people to participate more effectively in the policy making process. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2021

AB  - This study examined bystanders' judgements of bullying and their inclusivity towards refugee victims and ingroup bully peers. Participants included 587 Turkish adolescents (Mage = 13.14, SD = 1.60) who were presented with two stories: intergroup (Syrian refugee victim) and intragroup (Turkish victim) bullying. They indicated acceptability of bullying, retaliation, and how likely they would be to include victims and bullies in different social contexts. Empathy, prejudice, desired social distance, and peer norms towards Syrian refugees were examined as predictors. Adolescents in schools with a higher number of Syrian peers were more likely to expect they would include the Syrian victim than adolescents in schools with a lower number of Syrian peers. Further, adolescents with higher empathy were more likely to include the Syrian victim while adolescents with higher prejudice and desired social distance were less likely to include the Syrian victim. The results highlight the importance of attending to bystanders' future interactions with victims and bullies, as bystanders have the opportunity to challenge injustice by promoting inclusive school climates in diverse societies.

AB  - To date, research on Christians’ attitudes toward Muslims has generally focused on the cognitive components of these attitudes. Based on Eagly and Chaiken’s conceptualization of the ABC Model of Attitudes, this study extended that research by considering multiple evaluative aspects of attitudes. Relevant questionnaires from a larger study of 209 self-identified Christians were used to predict attitudes toward American Muslims. It was hypothesized that adding a behavioral component beyond the cognitive would significantly increase prediction of attitudes toward Muslims in the United States. Drawing on research on related prejudices, it was also predicted that the often-neglected affect of disgust would significantly increase the prediction of attitudes toward Muslims beyond only combining behavioral and cognitive factors. In this study, behavioral factors included engagement with people of different faiths, while cognitive factors included dogmatism and endorsement of Christian nationalism. A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that combining behavioral with cognitive components significantly increased the prediction of American Christians’ attitudes toward American Muslims. Yet, further adding the affective component of physical disgust beyond the cognitive and behavioral components did not significantly increase predictive power. Implications of these findings for the Christian church and American society at large are addressed in the light of the important social implications of understanding attitudes toward Muslims. The need for future research to emphasize the multifaceted nature of anti-Muslim attitudes is also discussed. © Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This longitudinal, quasi-experimental field study investigated affective forecasting as a moderator of positive intergroup contact effects among adolescents. We also examined a novel mediating mechanism that underlies this effect, namely accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for intergroup contact. Three annual waves of survey data were used from 1,169 adolescents (Mage = 13.88 at Wave 1; 50% girls; 66% White British, 44% Asian British) whose schools were merged, in a unique intervention that resulted in one school where ethnic groups were evenly mixed (i.e., balanced school) and two White British majority schools (i.e., majority skewed schools). Results showed that positive intergroup contact and attitudes improved more in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. In all schools, change in adolescents’ positive intergroup contact predicted change in positive intergroup attitudes indirectly via (a) increased accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for contact and (b) reduced intergroup anxiety. Indirect effects via accuracy of perceived contact willingness were stronger for adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts than for other adolescents. These moderated mediation effects were stronger in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. Thus, more balanced ethnic mixing in schools seemed to directly enhance positive intergroup relations and attitudes for all adolescents, but to particularly benefit adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts about positive contact before the school merger © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Many studies have found that males, on average, perform better than females in mathematics, although the size of this gender gap is small and varies considerably across countries. Stereotype threat has been proposed as a principal cause of this gender gap. From this perspective, females’ performance is affected by fear of confirming a negative stereotype about females’ mathematical ability and this stereotype can be activated by an experimental manipulation that reminds females of the stereotype. Yet, evidence of a stereotype threat effect on mathematics performance in childhood and adolescence has been mixed. The present study replicated a highly cited study of stereotype threat among Italian adolescents with a much larger sample of Italian ninth grade (89 male, 75 female, mean age = 14.2) and eleventh grade (84 male, 80 female, mean age = 16.2) public high school students. Performance in tests administered both before and after the experimental manipulations were analyzed with a series of logistic mixed-effects models. Model comparisons confirmed that males performed better than females, but the probability of a stereotype threat effect was infinitesimal. We conclude that Italian adolescent gender differences in mathematics may not be explained by stereotype threat effects © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Our work discusses the effects of Covid-19 on older adults’ health, which is considered the leading risk group in this pandemic. We start with a brief ag(e)ing demographic discussion in Brazil and then address how this period has produced and reinforced discourses that show ag(e)ing stereotypes. These discourses are related to the difficulties in facing the social distancing effects and its possibilities in the context of residential care and in long-term institutions in the state of Bahia, Brazil, where we centralize this discussion. To conclude, we emphasize the urgency of organized and coordinated actions that understand the ag(e) ing process complexity to face both the prejudiced discourses about older adults and the effects of isolation. We also point to the need to recognize and involve ourselves in the other generations of which we are a part, whether in memory or projection. © 2021, UNIV SAOPAULO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the fact that lexicographers have increasingly been taking more care when it comes to defining socially sensitive terms, we argue that ethnicity terms still remain rather poorly defined. In a number of online monolingual dictionaries we surveyed in this study, we find that ethnicity terms are generally simplistically defined, mostly in terms of geography and citizenship, and argue that such definitions are too reductionist and sometimes even erroneous. We also find that some disparaging ethnicity terms are not labelled as such in some of the dictionaries surveyed. We also present a case study from Montenegro, in which a dictionary of the national academy of sciences was immediately revoked over a few ethnicity and ethnicity-related terms, after a violent outcry from two of Montenegro's ethnic minorities, dissatisfied with how their ethnicities were defined and treated in the dictionary. Based on our survey and the earlier findings from the literature, we recommend that international dictionaries follow a standardised model of defining ethnicities, which would additionally refer to an ethnicity's culture and potentially language, and be as inclusive as possible. We also recommend that editors and lexicographers of national dictionaries pay special attention to how they define the ethnic terms relating to the minorities living in their country or region, following a combination of a standardised and a partly customised approach, which would take into account the specific features of the minorities. © 2021 Bureau of the WAT.

AB  - Although classrooms have been described as an important socialization agent for the development of intergroup attitudes, the role of classroom climate has rarely been investigated. This 5-wave study of Swedish adolescents (N = 892, 51.1% girls, nested in 35 classrooms) examined the role of cooperative classroom climate for the development of youth attitudes toward immigrants. The results of multilevel analyses showed that adolescents who perceived classroom climate to be more cooperative had lower levels of anti-immigrant attitudes compared to youth who perceived the classroom climate as less cooperative. Similarly, classrooms with a more cooperative climate were more positive toward immigrants than classrooms with a less cooperative climate. In addition, cooperative classroom climate did not moderate the effects of classroom ethnic diversity on youth attitudes. These findings suggest that cooperative classroom climate reduces the risk of prejudice development. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Discriminatory legislation targeting Latinx immigrants in the United States has shifted how parents communicate with their children about the hostile political climate. One way that Latinx parents talk about and prepare their children to face prejudice is through ethnic-racial socialization, which can promote children's positive development. Few scholars, however, have focused on how Latinx immigrant families with precarious documentation status socialize their children around issues of immigration, documentation status, and the potential for family separation. The current study seeks to broaden our understanding and conceptualization of ethnic-racial socialization practices among Latinx immigrant families living in the United States to include documentation status socialization to better capture the messages parents transmit to their children about the causes and potential impacts of their documentation status. Thirty-nine Latinx immigrant mothers aged 35–53 (M = 41.66), (22 undocumented, 17 documented) were interviewed regarding the ways in which their documentation status informs their ethnic-racial socialization practices. Five subthemes of Documentation Status Socialization were identified among both undocumented and documented parents. Example of subthemes included Limitations and Restrictions of Undocumented Status, and Documentation Privilege, in which parents discussed the limitation of being undocumented as well as the privilege that comes with the legal documentation status with their youth. Our findings yield important implications for practice and research alike. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - For decades, Asian Americans have had to deal with stereotypes, misunderstandings of their status in society, and prejudice and discrimination. Because of their small population in the U.S. and prevailing model minority stereotypes, they have not received the attention or aid necessary for research and policy advocacy to counter the misunderstandings. It is argued that Asian Americans are diverse group on many dimensions but they share experiences involving stereotypes and racism © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Background: PE curricula and pedagogy maintain dominant discourses of whiteness as normalized, lacking in cultural relevancy and disregarding racially minoritized students’ cultural knowledges (Azzarito 2019, “‘Look to the Bottom’: Re-Writing the Body Curriculum Through Storylines.” Sport, Education and Society 24 (6): 638–650; Clark 2020, “Toward a Critical Race Pedagogy of Physical Education.” Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy 25 (4): 439–450; Culp 2020, “Thirdspace Investigations: Geography, Dehumanization, and Seeking Spatial Justice in Kinesiology: National Association for Kinesiology in Higher Education 39th Dudley Allen Sargent Commemorative Lecture 2020.” Quest (grand Rapids, Mich) 72 (2): 153–166; Flintoff and Dowling 2019, “‘I Just Treat Them all the Same, Really’: Teachers, Whiteness and (Anti) Racism in Physical Education.” Sport, Education and Society 24 (2): 121–133). Both pre-service and in-service PE teachers of color often experience marginalization, hypervisiblity, exclusion, racism, and must consistently negotiate an additional emotional ‘load’ when located within white educational spaces (Flintoff 2014, “Tales from the Playing Field: Black and Minority Ethnic Students’ Experiences of Physical Education Teacher Education.” Race, Ethnicity and Education 17 (3): 346–366, 2015, “Playing the ‘Race’ Card? Black and Minority Ethnic Students’ Experiences of Physical Education Teacher Education.” Sport, Education and Society 20: 190–211; Simon and Azzarito 2019a, “‘Singled out Because of Skin Color … ’: Exploring Ethnic Minority Female Teachers’ Embodiment in Physical Education.” Sport, Education and Society 24 (2): 105–120, 2019b, ““Putting Blinders on”: Ethnic Minority Female PE Teachers’ Identity Struggles Negotiating Racialized Discourses.” Journal of Teaching in Physical Education 38 (4): 367–376.). Purpose: This study aimed to understand Black and Latinx pre-service PE teachers’ negotiations of whiteness, and the accompanying emotional ‘load,’ at predominantly white institutions (PWIs). We utilized Critical Race Theory, Critical Whiteness Studies, and emotionality to establish a framework that included interrogating normalized discourses of whiteness through counternarratives (Milner and Howard 2013, “Counter-narrative as Method: Race, Policy and Research for Teacher Education.” Race, Ethnicity and Education 16 (4): 536–561), destabilizing a white/‘other’ dichotomy, and validating emotions connected to racialized identities (Ahmed 2014, Cultural Politics of Emotions. Edinburgh University Press). Method: This qualitative study employed visual narrative methods, extricating, via counternarratives to whiteness (Miller, Liu, and Ball 2020, “Critical Counter-Narrative as Transformative Methodology for Educational Equity.” Review of Research in Education 44 (1): 269–300), the racialized experiential knowledge of 10 Black and Latinx pre-service PE teachers enrolled in predominantly white PE teacher education (PETE) programs. The researchers collected data through interviews, written reflections, and visual texts. Data, including interview transcriptions, participant-generated images, and researcher reflections, were analyzed both inductively and deductively. Results: The results of this study demonstrated how participants first presented emotionally distanced negotiations of overwhelming whiteness in their PETE programs, engaging in a self-preservation response to inherent ‘othering’ and hypervisibility (Evans-Winters and Esposito 2010). With time and developed rapport with the researchers, ‘cracks’ in their positive narratives appeared as more details emerged about the pain caused by consistent experiences of racism in their PWIs. It was clear that participants’ racialization through dominant whiteness presented a multi-layered emotionality that had to be masked in order to be accepted within their white educational communities (Kohli 2018, “Behind School Doors: The Impact of Hostile Racial Climates on Urban Teachers of Color.” Urban Education 53 (3): 307–333). Conclusion: Participants’ emotional responses to racially ‘othered’ hypervisibility provided insights to program attrition by students of color, and how teacher education maintains racialized discourses of whiteness. The results of this research support the idea that PE teacher educators need to demonstrate an outright and long-standing commitment to racial equity and to minoritized students’ emotional well-being before students of color may open up and share what’s ‘really going on,’ thus furthering emotional connections and understandings that can prevent pre-service teacher of color attrition. In the case of the Black and Latinx teachers in this study, the norms of whiteness which underpinned their educational context denied them their humanity regarding their potentially strong emotions towards their experiences of racism, prejudice, discrimination, biases, and stereotypes, placing them as ‘outsiders’ within predominantly white ‘collective bodies’ (their PETE programs and institutions). © 2021 Association for Physical Education.

AB  - Exclusionary attitudes towards outgroups contribute to social and political challenges worldwide. Previous field experiments found that interpersonal conversations employing multiple narrative strategies can durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. We theoretically distinguish between three of these narrative strategies: narratives which promote analogic perspective taking, vicarious perspective-giving, and perspective-getting. Previous research has assigned these strategies together in a compound treatment, leaving open important theoretical and practical questions about each's effectiveness. We present results from three field studies and a survey experiment that individually manipulate their presence. Across the field studies, we find omitting prompts to engage in analogic perspective-taking and vicarious perspective-giving does not diminish effects; conversations employing only perspective-getting narratives durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. Results from within-subject analyses and a survey experiment similarly show that perspective-getting consistently reduces exclusionary attitudes and activates multiple mechanisms. These results refine theoretical understandings of prejudice reduction and support facilitating perspective-getting in conversations intended to reduce exclusionary attitudes. ©2021, Midwest Political Science Association

AB  - The article argues that, although digital and social media provide space and means for children's cosmopolitan citizenship, the tendency to reproduce cultural and ethnic stereotypes and prejudice prevalent in mainstream media can limit their capability and willingness to act and think as such. Drawing upon qualitative participatory research conducted with more than seventy children living in the Czech Republic, the article explores how children's media practice had a tendency to reproduce cultural hegemony. The paper ultimately argues that multicultural education and media education can together support children in reflecting on and challenging cultural hegemony, while at the same time potentially contribute to their transnational participation and cooperation with the use of digital and social media. © 2021.

AB  - Although an increase in the inclusion of women in the global labor market has been reported in recent times, existing literature show that women are still heavily underrepresented in organizational leadership positions. Many studies in this area mainly focused on perceived barriers to women’s ascend to leadership positions, while little attention is paid to insights into the lived experiences of women who have already managed to assume leadership positions. This study was conducted to plug this gap in the literature. We interviewed 10 women corporate organizational leaders in Ghana to share their lived experiences as female leaders within the Ghanaian context. Our findings reveal that women still face several challenges even after breaking the glass ceiling to attain leadership positions in corporate organizations in Ghana. The main challenges were raised around the issue of gender, discrimination, age, their roles as mothers and wives. On the other hand, their positions also came with benefits and opportunities such as improved financial status, a command for respect as well as increasing their social and business networking capacity. More importantly, age although a disadvantage for the young women leaders, it was seen as a resource for older women as it enhances their respect and seen as performance of motherhood roles in this Ghanaian context. The study concludes that although women leaders’ experiences are largely negative, older women leaders seemed to utilize their positions actively and creatively and perform pseudo-motherhood roles which in turn helps them in the performance of their leadership roles. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - To what extent did U.S. natives’ social distance attitudes toward various European ancestry groups affect European immigrants’ residential segregation in the early twentieth century? Surprisingly, this question has not been directly addressed, even though it is well known that, at the time, U.S. natives’ social distance attitudes toward different racial/ethnic groups, documented by Emory Bogardus’s famous 1926 survey, were key features of a boundary separating whites into two divisions: (1) those of Southern, Central, and Eastern European ancestry, and (2) those of Northern and Western European ancestry. The present study finds that variation in natives’ expressed desires for social distance from different European ancestry groups was a decisive factor in European immigrant groups’ residential segregation from the native-born U.S. population, independently of the immigrant groups’ formal schooling and monetary assets. The results bolster claims in the residential segregation literature that majority-group prejudice plays a central role in minority groups’ spatial distance from the majority group, net of any socioeconomic inequalities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This work examines relationships between friendships and implicit preferences across two large samples. There is considerable evidence in the contact literature suggesting that friendships relate to more favorable attitudes toward outgroups, however, most evidence reflects explicit self-report measures. Using samples of 235,543 participants who completed the Disability IAT and 533,220 participants who completed the Sexuality IAT on the Project Implicit website, results indicate that participants reporting either a disabled friend or close acquaintance demonstrated weaker implicit preferences for abled over disabled people. Similarly, those with gay friends demonstrated weaker implicit preference for “straight” over gay. The size of these relationships were considerably smaller than found for explicit evaluations. These effect size estimates should be useful to researchers studying contact-implicit preference relationships as it informs power analyses and sample size planning decisions. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This empirical study examines the impact of epistemic injustice on child soldiers while exploring the potential of the Baraza structure - a local jurisprudence in the Democratic Republic of Congo - to pursue the "the best interests of the child" principle, particularly in the process of holding young soldiers accountable. Epistemic injustice, conceptually developed by Miranda Fricker, consists of "testimonial injustice", when the hearer gives a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word due to prejudice; "hermeneutical injustice", which takes place when a structural breach in collective interpretive imagination resources unfairly disadvantages a person or social group when trying to render intelligible their social experiences; and "distributive epistemic injustice", which happens when "epistemic goods" (education and information) are inequitably distributed. The research outcomes suggest that Baraza jurisprudence has the potential to avert epistemic injustice, and to promote a non-discriminatory treatment of accused former child and adolescent soldiers. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021

AB  - Objectives/Background: Intellectual giftedness is characterized by an intellectual development superior to peers, while emotional and relational developments correspond to the age norms. Few empirical researches have investigated sleep profile of gifted children (GC) and its association with their well-being, all of which used IQ as the sole definition criteria for GC. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between giftedness and sleep on socio-emotional functioning. Participants: The sample consisted of 32 GC (25 boys; mean age = 9.62, SD = 1.81) and 17 typically-developing children (TD: 13 boys; mean age = 10.23 years, SD = 1.95). Giftedness was identified using Renzulli’s three-factor definition of giftedness. Methods: Children’s sleep and socio-emotional functioning were respectively assessed with the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist, both completed by parents. Results: Being in the GC group increased by 4.67 times the risk of having sleep problems and 14.12 times the risk of having maladaptive behaviors. Two-way ANOVA tests showed that sleep problems tended to moderate the relation between giftedness and adjustment difficulties so that the combination of giftedness and sleep problems appeared to be prejudicial to socio-emotional functioning. Conclusion: Giftedness could be a risk factor for sleep disorders as well as adjustment difficulties. The present results support the importance of addressing sleep in the GC assessment to improve their well-being and eventually limit the negative impacts of sleep difficulties on emotional and behavioral functioning. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The literature on what implicit attitudes and biases are and on how they can predict prejudicial behavior towards certain groups has been growing extremely fast in the last decades. Such data assumes that human beings are sensitive to their own and others' group identities. The troublesome feature of these researches is that they show an effect that mostly goes under the radar. The aim of this paper is to look at this data from the perspective of moral philosophy. Thus, on the one hand, I will analyze if and to what extent implicit attitudes have an impact on abilities that are crucial for moral judgment and for moral decision-making - the descriptive goal - and, on the other, I will consider whether this influence should bear any normative significance for moral theory - the normative goal. In order to substantiate these claims, I will provide some conceptual distinctions concerning “empathy” and “trust” (§2). Then, by referring to some experimental data I will put forth the descriptive claim on the influence of implicit attitudes on our empathic and trusting attitudes (§3). Finally, I will discuss the normative relevance of these results, as far as our moral theories are concerned (§4). © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Via colorist and white privilege, colorism and racism mirror one another. Colorism is internalized racism; an oppressive internalization regarding phenotypes and skin tones. Mindfulness and other self-reflective practices have been used to modify manifestations of racism such as prejudiced thoughts and biased behaviors. Mindfulness may also help change expressions of colorism as a derivative of racism. Therefore, the implicit manifestations of colorism were further examined in addition to the viability of mindfulness as an intervention. A review of existing literature was conducted using secondary data collection. Analysis resulted in thematic formulation. The findings suggest increasing awareness and self-determination are salient in mindfulness response to colorist bias and behaviors. Mindfulness alone is symbolic of the past and present legacy that African Americans face with embedded racism and colorism experiences. Social workers will find it optimal to use interventions that aid in transforming colorist bias. Implications for healing others from colorism implicit bias is proposed in social workers’ use of self-reflective practices and the RAIN modality, illustrative of actions to recognize, allow, investigate, and nurture. Continuous education is vital in social work practice; therefore, future research is suggested to build on this review because colorism as a hierarchy affects all of humanity. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper explores what it means to live together in the city through a focus on home and urban public space in East London. It develops a conceptual framework for understanding home as a site of dis/connection–both connected to and disconnected from–the wider estate, street, neighbourhood and city. Drawing on a series of home-city biographies with residents living on different housing estates, we explore what makes a city ‘liveable’ for its diverse residents within and across domestic and public spaces; how home-city dis/connections shape ideas and experiences of living together; and the importance of sensory, material and social contexts of home in shaping residents’ dis/connections with neighbours and the wider neighbourhood. By taking seriously the practices, experiences and imaginings of home as a site of urban dis/connection, we argue that urban scholars can gain a fuller picture of what it means to live together in the city, and understand and challenge inequalities, exclusions and prejudices that shape urban lives. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Outgroup dehumanisation, the denial of full humanity to outgroups relative to ingroups, is pervasive in many contemporary societies. The aim of the present work is to review effective strategies aimed at fostering outgroup humanity attribution. After presenting the main models of humanity attribution, we differentiate two types of strategies. Outgroup-specific strategies are focused on a target outgroup, therefore their effectiveness is more dependent upon the specific intergroup relationship. These include intergroup contact, meta-humanisation, and social categorisation. Outgroup-independent strategies are not inherently linked to a target outgroup, implying that their effectiveness is less dependent on the specific intergroup dynamics under consideration. These involve human-animal similarity and secure relationship attachment. We provide evidence for the effectiveness of these strategies and their underlying processes, showcasing our research programme within the larger literature. In so doing, we take into account the distinction between blatant and subtle dehumanisation, and conclude with suggestions for future research. © 2021 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - Background: Colour-blind attitudes deny racial dynamics and can lead to resistance to transformation because there seems to be no need for it. This study investigated these attitudes amongst students at a university campus engaged with implementing its transformation agenda. Aim: Using a survey, the research determined the prevalence of colour-blind attitudes amongst students and evaluated the social factors that may have contributed to these attitudes. Setting: The research was conducted amongst undergraduates at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, South Africa, in 2017. Methods: A literature review was conducted around the occurrence of colour-blind attitudes amongst students and the associated social factors. Race, gender, racial prejudice, just-world beliefs and social dominance orientation in particular were found to contribute to colour-blind attitudes. A quantitative survey was then conducted amongst a quota sample of 300 students. The data collected on the social factors and colour-blind attitudes were statistically analysed. Results: The students’ colour-blind attitudes were found to be moderate. The social factor of race correlated significantly with colour-blind attitudes, but gender did not. Racial prejudice presented a medium correlation with colour-blind attitudes but just-world beliefs and social dominance orientation only a small correlation. Conclusion: Colour-blind attitudes at the campus were related to race and racial prejudice. This demonstrates the need for students to be offered room to openly discuss and engage with race and issues concerning race. The difference between the findings in this study and extant literature indicates a necessity for further qualitative research to gain a more comprehensive understanding about racial issues amongst students at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus. © 2021.

AB  - Inspired by the well-documented relationship between authoritarianism and prejudices, we tested whether a massive influx of immigrants can constitute social threats - direct (crimes, riots, violence) and normative (different norms, customs, values) - that increase ingroup authoritarian attitudes. Across two experimental studies (n 1=251 and n 2=230), we were able to show that both direct and normative threat to social order, originating from immigrants, lead to an increase in ingroup authoritarianism attitudes (Cohen’s d = 0.45–0.57), but do not impact the right-wing authoritarianism and cultural conservatism. The effect of threat on the rise of authoritarian attitudes was only partially and in a small degree mediated by collective security motivation. Implications for the authoritarianism-prejudices relationship and the functions of authoritarianism are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Anti-black bias is an important focal point in conversations about the sources of racial inequality in schools. Much of the empirical research on this issue has focused on the racial biases of individual teachers, finding that racial inequality in student outcomes is generally worse when teachers have more racial bias. Less is known, however, about how racial inequality in schools relates to anti-black biases that play out at a larger scale within communities. This study begins to fill this gap by examining the relationship between county-level estimates of racial bias and black-white test score gaps in U.S. schools. Data from over 1 million respondents from across the United States who completed an online survey of explicit and implicit racial attitudes were combined with data from the Education Opportunity Project covering over 300 million test scores from U.S. schoolchildren in grades 3 through 8. Results indicated that counties with higher levels of racial bias had larger black-white test score disparities. The magnitude of these associations was on par with other widely accepted predictors of racial test score gaps, including racial gaps in family income and racial gaps in single parenthood. This study also found that the observed relation between collective rates of racial bias and racial test score gaps was largely accounted for when controlling for between-school segregation and racial gaps in discipline, gifted assignment, and special education placement. This pattern is consistent with a theoretical model in which collective rates of racial bias relate to educational opportunity through sorting mechanisms that operate both within and beyond schools. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Using in-depth face-to-face interviews, this study explored 34 homeless shelter workers’ perceptions of homelessness and working with the homeless. We asked the following questions: 1) What were the barriers that homeless shelter residents faced in combating homelessness, from the perspective of the homeless shelter workers? 2) What were the challenges that homeless shelter workers encountered in working with this at-risk population? Our findings shared the realities that the homeless population faced from the lens of shelter workers with different job responsibilities (ranging from customer service workers to case managers, program directors/coordinators, and shelter administrators). Overall, we found that working with the homeless community could present a challenge for shelter workers given the limited availability of funding, discrepancies in agreement of solutions, the lack of qualified helping professionals, the limits of service coordination, preconceived judgment/prejudice from the public, and a series of obstacles that the homeless population faces including barriers to accessing services, employability, personal hardship, and social stigma. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - There are worldwide concerns about the rise of White nationalism and its implications for intergroup relations in multicultural societies. Social media, in particular, has allowed far-right groups to easily share their perspectives with and influence others in support of their ideologies. Yet, few studies have empirically examined what psychological factors are discussed within this content to motivate collective action. A quantitative content analysis of 100 White nationalist videos on YouTube reveals that social outgroups (Muslims, immigrants, feminists) are frequently discussed as threats to Whites’ status. Not only were calls for collective action discussed in at least 12% of videos, themes surrounding White identity and injustice faced by Whites were often underlying these calls, consistent with the theoretical propositions of the Social Identity Model of Collective Action. These results are novel as they identify psychological mechanisms referenced in White nationalist social media that motivate collective actions among White Americans. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this article, I propose a novel theoretical framework for conceptualizing pandemic stigma using the metaphor of ‘mutation’. This metaphor highlights that stigma is not a static or fixed state but is enacted through processes of continuity and change. The following three orienting concepts are identified: (a) lineage (i.e. origin narratives and initial manifestations are created in relation to existing stigmas, stereotypes, and outgroups), (b) variation (i.e. stigma changes over time in response to new content and contexts), and (c) strength (i.e. stigma can be amplified or weakened through counter- or de-stigmatizing forces). I go on to use this metaphor to offer an analysis of the emergence of COVID-19 stigma. The lineage of COVID-19 stigma includes a long history of contagious disease, resonant with fears of contamination and death. Origin narratives have stigmatized Asian/Chinese groups as virus carriers, leading to socio-political manifestations of discrimination. Newer ‘risky’ groups have emerged in relation to old age, race and ethnicity, poverty, and weight, whose designation as ‘vulnerable’ simultaneously identifies them as victims in need of protection but also as a risk to the social body. Counter-stigmatizing trends are also visible. Public disclosure of having COVID-19 by high-status individuals such as the actor Tom Hanks has, in some instances, converted ‘testing positive’ into shared rather than shamed behaviour in the West. As discourses concerning risk, controllability, and blame unfold, so COVID-19 stigma will further mutate. In conclusion, the metaphor of mutation, and its three concepts of lineage, variation, and strength, offers a vocabulary through which to articulate emergent and ongoing stigma processes. Furthermore, the concept of stigma mutation identifies a clear role for social scientists and public health in terms of process engagement; to disrupt stigma, remaking it in less deadly forms or even to prevent its emergence altogether. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We examined the domain-specific views of young and old people held by young (18-30 years, n = 278) and older adults (60-85 years, n = 289) in Germany, the USA, and India. Views about old and young people differed between life domains but were mostly similar across age groups and countries. Older adults in the USA and Germany - but not in India - held slightly less negative views about old people than did young people in some domains, possibly indicating a projection of better-than-expected own aging experiences of older adults into their in-group stereotypes in Western countries. The findings of our study can be explained by socialization processes, supporting mostly a developmental perspective regarding the acquisition and endorsement of age stereotypes. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This article explores the role and impact of Gay Health Action (GHA), a voluntary AIDS organisation that operated in the Republic of Ireland between 1985 and 1989. Drawing on their publications and media engagement, it argues that GHA played a significant role in educating the general public about AIDS, while this group also challenged ideas about sexual health and dispelled negative stereotypes associated with homosexuality. In doing so, the activities of GHA begin to outline the initial public response to HIV/AIDS during the 1980s, while also contributing towards an emergent body of research on the changing nature of Irish society during the late-twentieth century. It suggests ways in which attitudes to the gay community were evolving and highlights the need for further research on AIDS, examinations of which can contribute towards the emergent histories of social change and health policy in this period. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Racism and discrimination in Healthcare must be understood within the perspective of racial discrimination in social institutes. Systemic bias is not the unusual behavior demonstrated by few but is mostly backed by the unconscious discrimination based upon destructive negative stereotypes and institutional guidelines. A novel initiative to make medical staff skillful and induction of providers from the background of disadvantaged backgrounds along with enhanced regulatory monitoring and better data system can effectively address inequalities in the quality of care. Designing and implementation efficient approaches to eradicate the racial discrimination in medical care and health status must be made a national priority. © 2021, Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the relationship between Modern Racism and Ambivalent Sexism using Human Values as a third variable that could explain this relationship, given its predictive power against social phenomena. The sample consisted of 200 participants distributed almost equally regarding gender, including 101 (50.5%) women and 99 (49.5%) men. The mean age of the respondents was 23 years (SD = 5.41). It was observed that Ambivalent Sexism and Modern Racism are positively correlated as they are also related to the Realization, Interactive, and Normative subfunctions of Human Values, partially explaining the relationship between racism and sexism. It was concluded that modern expressions of racism and sexism are interconnected and that normative values, which aim to maintain social stability and tradition, may play an important role in partially explaining this connection. © 2021.

AB  - Background: Adjustment to the onset of disability has complex reverberations relating to both socially engendered disadvantage and the realities of functional limitation. Pre-existing ways of understanding disability can meaningfully shape this experience. Objective: This study aimed to provide an exploratory understanding of the experience of becoming disabled in a low-income, under-served, rural South African community. In particular, it was interested in how people with disabilities constructed their struggle within the conceptual split between disadvantage caused by ‘malfunctioning’ bodies (a ‘medical model’ view) and that caused by social organisation (a ‘social model’ view). Methods: Seven people between the ages of 39 and 47 who had acquired a physical disability within the last 4 years were recruited in a rural area of Limpopo province, South Africa. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted, and the resulting data were thematically analysed. The authors were positioned as both ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ to the participants and sought to use this orientation to best understand and stay faithful to participants’ views while simultaneously applying participant’s experiences to conceptual knowledge in disability studies. Results: Four themes emerged: (1) emotional impact of onset of disability, (2) being introduced to disablist prejudice, (3) being required to take on a ‘disabled’ identity and (4) socio-economic implications of becoming disabled. The findings reflected a complex set of adverse experiences in the lives of the participants, spanning disadvantages based on embodied, cultural, relational and environmental factors, which were superimposed on existing, generalised poverty in their local communities. Participants made sense of their predicament in multiple, evolving ways. Conclusion: This study contributes to the understanding of the complex predicaments, and sense-making, of persons who have acquired a disability in a rural, impoverished Global South environment. © 2021.

AB  - Dr. Margaret-Ann Armour’s career as a research chemist, educator, and advocate spanned more than 40 years. Much of her work took place within a disciplinary culture ignorant of the scholarship supporting organizational change towards inclusive excellence. Her contributions are extensively covered in other articles in this special issue, and her achievements are all the more remarkable given that her colleague, Dr. Gordon Freeman, held gender-biased attitudes that he shared in a peer reviewed article in a national science journal. Three decades later, another Canadian chemist, Dr. Tomáš Hudlický, published a peer reviewed essay in an international chemistry journal that included his views on the negative impacts of diversity initiatives on organic synthesis research. Both articles were retracted, but clearly a faulty and pervasively biased peer review system enabled the distribution of prejudiced opinions that were neither informed by demonstrated expertise, nor supported by data. These two events are reflective of challenges that Dr. Armour faced in her efforts to diversify chemical sciences. We need to build on her critical work to increasing awareness about inclusive excellence in chemistry, as well as educating scientists on what constitutes an informed opinion. Here, we use Freeman and Hudlický incidents as case studies to indicate how pervasive bias can be superficially perceived as scientific scholarship. Furthermore, we use analogies of analytical processes to illustrate how talent gets systemically excluded. Finally, we provide recommendations to chemistry community members for improving outcomes in terms of synthesis of new knowledge, ideas, and solutions, toward leveraging all the available human talent and creating an environment that is both excellent and inclusive. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - Positive distinctiveness threat is central for understanding ingroup bias, but its role in gender differences in the expression of sexual prejudice is not yet satisfactorily elucidated. We analyzed this issue by proposing that sexual prejudice is a defensive reaction to ensure intergroup distinctiveness, so that heterosexual men are more prejudiced against homosexuals than heterosexual women because they strive more for positive distinctiveness. In Study 1 (N = 232), we found that men exhibited more prejudice against gay men than lesbians, while women did not significantly differentiate their prejudice against these target groups. In Study 2, we manipulated the target group of prejudice (gay men vs. lesbians) in a sample of heterosexual men (N = 79) and confirmed that they differentiated more between heterosexual men and gay men than between heterosexual women and lesbians. In Study 3 (N = 177), we manipulated the threat to the distinctiveness between the ingroup (i.e., heterosexual men and heterosexual women) and the outgroup (i.e., gay men and lesbians) and demonstrated that the perceived distinctiveness mediates the relationship between gender and sexual prejudice in men but not in women. Finally, in Study 4 (N = 75), we manipulated the distinctiveness threat for men and women and measured sexual prejudice by using an implicit measure. The results showed more implicit prejudice in men than in women when intergroup distinctiveness was threatened (vs. affirmed). Our results have important implications for understanding sexual prejudice by shedding light on the role played by the distinctiveness threat of gender differences in expressing homophobia. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - This paper deals with the image and perceptions that Turkish migrants from Bulgaria had about the Turks in Turkey, the Turkish state, Bulgarians, and the Bulgarian state both before and after 1989. Perceptions of the Turkish minority among the Bulgarian communist elite are analysed according to published reports and statements made by Bulgarian Communist Party members. The perceptions that Turkish migrants had about Bulgaria and Turkey are the main focus of this study which is based on field research and interviews conducted with Turkish migrants from Bulgaria now living in Turkey. This article shows that these migrants held both positive and negative perceptions of Bulgaria and Turkey, largely depending on the context. The Turkish minority in Bulgaria was regarded as a problem for the Communist government and as an internal enemy to the Bulgarian state. Moreover, the locals in Turkey regarded the Turkish migrants from Bulgaria as “Bulgarian migrants” who possessed a non-Muslim or “liberal” culture. In this way, they experienced exclusionary attitudes from their neighbours both in Bulgaria and in Turkey. The Turks of Bulgaria perceived the Communist regime as oppressive and as a threat to their Turkish identity. Despite their dislike of the regime, prior to the period of forced assimilation that began in 1984, they still possessed a relatively positive perception about the Bulgarian people. Interestingly, while they perceive Turkey as their homeland, they nonetheless held certain prejudices against the local population in Turkey. All of these various interaction helped to strengthen their group identity as migrants from Bulgaria. © 2021, International University Seminar for Balkan Studies and Specialization.

AB  - Literature in policing has mostly overlooked the antecedents of prejudice, especially those who choose a police career. Such a choice is important given the results of prejudice that might cause police misconduct toward regular migrants, irregular migrants, and refugees. This study aims to examine the factors that explain prejudice among police cadets toward other ethnic groups. This study’s data come from a survey of 725 police cadets in three police vocational schools in Turkey. We employed structural equation modeling to examine the antecedents of prejudice toward foreigners within the framework of intergroup threat theory. More specifically, in this study, we included factors such as anomie, authoritarianism, and nationalism and participants’ symbolic and realistic threat perceptions in shaping prejudice toward foreigners. The findings suggest that police cadets’ realistic threat perception was the most salient antecedent of prejudice toward foreigners. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study examines how Otherness is constructed visually in newspaper photographs of the refugee crisis. This visual rhetoric analysis examines the form, content, and function of images and explores the rhetorical strategies deployed in visualizations of the refugee crisis in a mainstream Finnish national newspaper from 2015 to 2016. The data consisted of 1,473 images. The study identified six rhetorical strategies used for dehumanizing refugees: massifying, separating, passivating, demonizing, individualizing, and recontextualizing the Other. The rhetorical strategies in turn constructed four discourses related to refugees, namely those of threat and victimhood aimed at dehumanizing as well as personhood and distance aimed at humanizing the Other. The paper contributes to the current knowledge on dehumanization and humanization of refugees in public discourse by unpacking the subtle visual mechanisms through which these processes occur. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Opposition to immigration has featured prominently in the “cultural backlash” to globalization in Western nations and was a key determinant of Britain’s Brexit referendum. In this article, we draw on theories of intergroup threat to examine the effect of “right-wing authoritarianism” on immigration attitudes in the UK. Previous research suggests that cultural aspects of immigration are especially important in shaping anti-immigrant attitudes. We use an original survey measuring attitudes toward immigration from differing skill levels and national origins. We find that right-wing authoritarianism is a much stronger predictor of immigration attitudes than other attributes. In addition, the effect of right-wing authoritarianism varies by immigrant origin, most strongly predicting opposition toward immigrant groups that may be perceived as culturally distant. We also find evidence that these effects are driven by the “aggression” component of right-wing authoritarianism, a facet of authoritarianism that captures a predisposition toward the enforcement of group norms. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Despite their negative effects on the emotional, physical, and social wellbeing of students, weight stigma and anti-fat attitudes are rarely systematically addressed in schools or within school psychology. Weight-based oppression is regarded differently than other domains of prejudice. Therefore, implicit and explicit bias continue unimpeded, even when practitioners are attentive to other areas of social injustice. Mental health providers serving schools must acknowledge the prevalence of weight stigma and fatphobia to reduce their deleterious and oppressive effects. This conceptual paper outlines the underpinnings of weight stigma, overviews the necessity of addressing it and body image in educational settings, incorporates interdisciplinary perspectives, and proposes a justice-oriented shift in the conceptualization of weight status within school psychological service delivery. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Utilizing exogenous variation in educational attainment induced by compulsory schooling reforms in 15 European countries, this study estimates the causal effect of education on individuals’ attitudes towards sexual minorities with a regression discontinuity design. Using data from the World Values Survey and the European Values Study, this study finds more education reduces individuals’ prejudice against sexual minorities. The findings imply minimum schooling policies can help to build a culture that is more tolerant of sexual minorities, which is beneficial to the minorities’ wellbeing and social cohesion. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Growing polarization in European societies has changed not only political landscapes but also public debates about the past, which has, in turn, had an impact on the way history is taught and talked about in schools. This article explores how these trends are experienced by history educators across Europe and asks which issues history educators perceive to be controversial and sensitive and how they approach the prejudices they frequently encounter when addressing controversial and sensitive issues. Based on focus group discussions with 33 participants from 25 European countries, the article identifies three different forms of prejudice and describes how the focus group participants tried to undermine nationalism, counter xenophobia and fight anti-Semitism. Interpreted from a practice theory perspective, the examples shared by the focus group participants indicate that teaching strategies from the disciplinary approach “toolbox” can help to undermine nationalist stereotypical thinking if they are fine-tuned to the interests and emotions of the learning group and that history teaching routines shaped by the disciplinary approach need to be interrupted on occasion in order to reflect on and deconstruct xenophobic or anti-Semitic prejudice. Overall, the article argues that history teachers need to be aware of the affective dimension of historical learning, including underlying or open prejudices held by students, in order to support the teaching of democratic education goals such as respect and openness to cultural otherness. © 2021 College and University Faculty Assembly of National Council for the Social Studies.

AB  - Introduction: Instruction in implicit bias is becoming prevalent across the spectrum of medical training. Little education exists for preclinical students, and guidance for faculty to facilitate such education is minimal. To address these gaps, we designed and delivered a single session for incoming first-year medical students and developed a facilitator training program. Methods: One faculty member delivered a 1-hour, multimedia, interactive lecture to all first-year medical students. Students subsequently met in small groups with trained facilitators. Activities included reflection, guided debriefing, and strategy identification to become aware of when they might be making an assumption causing them to jump to a conclusion about someone. The program evaluation consisted of aggregated student strategies and facilitator feedback during postsession debriefs, both analyzed through thematic analysis. Results: We delivered instruction to 1,098 students. Student strategies resulted in three themes: (1) humility, (2) reflection, and (3) partnering. The postsession debriefs uncovered opportunities to enhance the session. Lessons learned included presenting material to an entire class at once, allowing students to engage in dynamic discussion in the small groups, eliminating anonymous polling in the small groups, and highlighting management of implicit bias as essential to professional development. Discussion: Our instructional design enabled first-year medical students to identify at least one strategy to use when implicit biases are activated. The large-group session was deliverable by one faculty member, and volunteers successfully facilitated small-group sessions after only one training session, making this model a feasible innovation to reach an entire medical school class at the same time. © 2021 Gonzalez et al.

AB  - The trait justice sensitivity captures individual differences in the tendency to perceive injustice and to negatively respond to these perceptions. The tendency to negatively respond to injustice to one’s disadvantage (victim justice sensitivity) was reliably linked to different measures of antisocial behavior and conservative values. Thus, we assumed that victim justice sensitivity should also be positively related to prejudice and discrimination. In contrast, the tendency to negatively respond to injustice to the disadvantage of others (altruistic justice sensitiv-ity), was reliably linked to prosocial behavior. Hence, we assumed that altruistic justice sensitivity should also show negative relations with prejudice and discrimination. In order to test these assumptions, we surveyed justice sensitivity, prejudices against three different groups, and discrimination experiences among N=343 parti-cipants (M=26.61 years, 79 percent women) in Germany. We found that victim justice sensitivity predicted more self-perpetrated discrimination. Altruistic justice sensitivity predicted less total prejudice and self-perpetrated discrimination and mediated the link between self-experienced discrimination and prejudice/self-perpetrated discrimination unless age, gender, and education were controlled for. Discrimination can promote discrimination. Future research on correlates and potential risk and protective factors of prejudice and discrimination should also consider justice sensitivity as a moral-related trait. © 2021, Universitaet Bielefeld.

AB  - Taking as a context the reality of migration of Latinos to Europe and its repercussions in the educational field, a pedagogical practice carried out in the Master for Teachers in training at the University of Seville, Spain, is described and analyzed. Future teachers of Spanish Language and Literature work on the subject of prejudices toward Latinos through a critical pedagogy whose main materials are literature and the decolonial perspective. To this end, classroom practices are described and analyzed. The pedagogical design is characterized by the following objectives: (1) to recognize and identify our prejudices toward others, (2) to recognize the voice of others in their specificity, and (3) to transcend this specificity and recognize ourselves in the other. In the qualitative analysis of the didactic intervention, the 72 students involved recognize highly positive involvement in the objectives of the activities; moreover, the students’ accounts show the recognition of a colonial hegemonic vision and the revision of prejudices toward the other. This framework takes students further by adopting a relationship of critical engagement with the way they approach Hispanic-American language and literature and its impact on the integration of their potential immigrant students in the classroom. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: To describe the perceptions of homeless people on Avenida Paulista in the city of São Paulo regarding access to health devices in the region. Method: This is a qualitative research conducted with 10 people who were homeless on Avenida Paulista in January 2019. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, and analysis of the findings was made using hermeneutics-dialectics. Two categories of results were created: Health services accessed in the region by homeless people; Barriers to health access faced by homeless people on Avenida Paulista, São Paulo. This study obtained ethical approval. Results: Seeking emergency services occurs as the main gateway for homeless people in the region, and among the barriers faced, prejudice is placed as the main phenomenon. Conclusion: It is necessary to consider the specificities of this population, understand their conceptions of health-disease and their trajectories so that services can be improved and access to health for this vulnerable and growing group can be guaranteed. © 2021.

AB  - Objectives The possibility of foundations opting to apply for a preferential tax regime provided by Law 49/2002, of December 23, depends on whether these entities meet the requirements established in Art. 3 of this law. Among these requirements, the most important one in our opinion is the condition that trustees carry out their roles without remuneration. This paper examines the voluntary nature of the position of trustee and the operational issues that arise from this for the foundation, and reflects on ways of managing this situation. Methodology We refer to the legal requirement of the unpaid nature of the position of trustee both in the substantive and fiscal fields and we venture to suggest the inconsistency of this obligation. We study the varying degrees of rigour which are applied when assessing the unpaid nature of the position of trustee and the other conditions required for the application of the preferential tax regime as well as the consequences of this legislative option, drawing conclusions which may indicate appropriate reforms to this law. Approach The Third Sector, of which foundations form a part, looks to meet the needs of people and of processes worthy of special protection. This is upheld in the words of the Constitutional Court (STC 18/1984, of February 7), which declare that a characteristic of the social and legal state is that general interests are defined through an interaction between the state and social agents, where foundations play a role of crucial importance. In our system, the non remuneration of trustees is absolute. Their remuneration implies the impossibility that the foundation can choose the preferential tax regime established by Law 49/2002. The basis for this requirement stems from purely historical reasons and from the need to prevent trustees receiving indirect financial benefit from their involvement in the foundation. However, the unpaid position of trustee is not part of the so-called “essential content” of the right to create foundations; it is simply a legislative option for the foundation. Results If we compare the required unpaid position of trustee with the rest of the requirements that Law 49/2002 demands for the application of the preferential tax regime we see that its practical translation is quite different. If gratuity is absolute, the remaining requirements of Art. 3 of the LRF-ENL (with the sole exception of the destination of their assets in the event of dissolution) are softened doctrinally, jurisprudentially and legally. Essentially, due to either the forced evolution in jurisprudence (pursuit of the general interest indirectly in Article 3.1), or to the limitations expressly established by the legal text itself (obligatory destination of at least 70% of certain income or revenue of Article 3.2; a limit of 40% to be dedicated to economic activity other than its statutory objective or purpose of article 3.3; impossibility that certain people are main recipients or might benefit from special conditions in the use of their services of Art. 3.4), or due to different doctrinal considerations (retroactive application of the preferential regime to the foundation in formation in the case of Art. 3.7; relative tolerance in the preparation of accounts and preparation of an annual report of numbers 8, 9 and 10 of Article 3); and with the sole exception of the obligatory destination of the patrimony in case of dissolution of Art. 3.6 (really a prolongation of the need to allocate any income and revenue for purposes of general interest), there is no doubt that the requirements demanded for the application of the preferential tax regime operate, in practice, with a lower rigour than that stipulated in Law 49/2002, which, we insist, contrasts significantly with the robustness that the legislation called for when considering the trustee’s position of non remuneration. Implications The unquestionable altruistic convictions of trustees, including the social recognition that comes with their appointment, may be sufficient reward for those who accept the position. However, with this recognition comes responsibility, a solidarity with the rest of the trustees, including even any moral damage that may be caused to the foundation by a trustee, a responsibility that many trustees overlook. Trustees are clearly accountable in the event that the foundation is immersed in a bankruptcy or tax procedure, or fails to meet its duty to ensure compliance with the legal responsibilities of data protection, or criminal compliance, or its obligation to ensure that the foundation is not used for money laundering or to channel funds or resources to persons or entities linked to terrorist groups or organizations. Practical conclusions and original significance The name “Trustee” encompasses two very different realities: on the one hand, purely honorary trustees who, detached from the daily life of the foundation, limit themselves to lending their good name to an altruistic cause with no liability and, on the other hand, the trustees who are involved in the day-to-day management of the foundation. We understand, however, that the trustee we call “honorary” cannot be subjected to a liability regime such as the one that exists, and, yet, with respect to the “manager” trustee, foundations need financial stability, not related to the initial endowment, which requires progressive streamlining of its operating capacities, bringing its responsibility more in line with commercial matters while, at the same time, allowing remuneration for services provided. Recognizing the difficulties of the task, it would seem that the solution must be inspired by STC 18/1984, cited above, according to which “one of the characteristics of the social and legal state is that general interests are defined through interaction between the State and the social agents… that transcends the field of organization, where foundations play a role of crucial importance”. For this, we insist, it is necessary to overcome the wary statist view that currently limits the undertaking of industrial or mercantile activities by foundations. That is, it is necessary to allow without prejudice the execution of economic activities by foundations, establishing the necessary controls and repositioning the trustee in a more appropriate role as a true manager of economic operators in the market. In short, the problem of non remuneration of the trustee must be framed within a global rethinking of the tax regime of non-profit entities and of patronage in light of a constantly changing environment. This rethinking has as a premise the change of attitude of the public authorities who, overcoming their mistrust and paternalism, must establish open collaboration with civil society, especially with foundations that are not, as described by the dictionary mere “fruits of human vanity” but, in the words of Óscar Alzaga “one of the great bridges that must be built to safeguard the abyss between individuals and the State”. With our paper we have tried to broaden the doctrinal debate by providing a redefinition of the figure of trustee on whom, ultimately, rests the future of a foundation. © 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work analyzes the prevalence of words denoting prejudice in 27 million news and opinion articles written between 1970 and 2019 and published in 47 of the most popular news media outlets in the United States. Our results show that the frequency of words that denote specific prejudice types related to ethnicity, gender, sexual, and religious orientation has markedly increased within the 2010–2019 decade across most news media outlets. This phenomenon starts prior to, but appears to accelerate after, 2015. The frequency of prejudice-denoting words in news articles is not synchronous across all outlets, with the yearly prevalence of such words in some influential news media outlets being predictive of those words’ usage frequency in other outlets the following year. Increasing prevalence of prejudice-denoting words in news media discourse is often substantially correlated with U.S. public opinion survey data on growing perceptions of minorities’ mistreatment. Granger tests suggest that the prevalence of prejudice-denoting terms in news outlets might be predictive of shifts in public perceptions of prejudice severity in society for some, but not all, types of prejudice. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this paper we aim to discuss attitudes towards immigrants in a European context and analyse drivers of anti-immigrant attitudes such as the feeling of control, basic human values, political orientation and preferences related to right-wing populism. Based on data from the European Social Survey, we first describe how attitudes of people in Europe changed throughout a period of almost two decades (between 2002 and 2018). We will show that although attitudes are influenced by a number of demographic and subjective features of individuals, on the macro-level they seem to be surprisingly stable, yet hide significant cross-country differences. Then, we zoom in to the three most significant elements influencing attitudes towards immigrants: the feeling of control, basic human values, and political orientation. Applying a multilevel model we test the validity of three theories about factors informing attitudes towards immigrants—competition theory, locus of control, and the role of basic human values—and include time (pre- and post-2015 refugee-crisis periods) into the analysis. In the discussion we link ESS data to recent research on populism in Europe that categorizes populist parties across the continent, and establish that the degree to which anti-migrant feelings are linked to support for political populism varies significantly across European countries. We show that right-wing populist parties gather and feed that part of the population which is very negative towards migrants and migration in general, and this process is also driven by the significance awarded the value of security vis-à-vis humanitarianism. © 2021.

AB  - In this paper, we draw upon the empirical research about the social representations of the Internet in order to propose a theoretically-driven agenda. A systematic review of empirical, peer-reviewed literature was conducted. The corpus of analysis consisted of 12 papers which fell into five themes: (i) the Internet and quality of life; (ii) the Internet as a moving representation; (iii) the Internet and ageing; (iv) the Internet and mobile culture; and (v) the Internet and education. The research about the social representations of the Internet is still limited in number, depth and breadth. Notwithstanding, it conveys important insights about the evolving, symbolically-loaded meanings of the Internet as a prosthesis of knowledge and as a means of communication, with consequences for identity and intergroup relations, contributing to expand the theoretical and empirical debates on the field of digital media. The research agenda for studying the Internet from a social representations’ perspective includes three major theoretical foci: social cognition; social identity and intergroup relations; and social thinking in times of big data. Social representations can provide the field with powerful conceptual tools to learn how people deal with novelty and to navigate through huge quantity of data generated online. In change, digital media can contribute to further social representations theory developments. To learn how communication flows on the Internet and how people make sense of the Internet and Internet-related phenomena (including automatically generated contents, mass and social media accounts) equals to set the clock for the present time schedule. © 2021.

AB  - This study reports the development and validation of a scale to measure xenophobia. The authors were particularly interested in the characterisation of this phenomenon in African nations. Two studies were conducted to explore and confirm the factor structure of the xenophobia scale and ascertain its validity and reliability. In study I, exploratory factor analysis produced a two-factor structure for the xenophobia scale labelled ingroup centredness and ingroup exclusivity. Study II confirmed the two-factor structure that emerged in study I and also established the convergent validity and internal consistency of the scale. Findings in this study suggest xenophobia captures two aspects that border on attitude towards ingroup and attitude towards outgroups. In addition, findings revealed that positive ingroup attitude may not necessarily translate into negative outgroup attitude. © 2021 The Institute of Social and Economic Research.

AB  - This article examines the plight of migrant Muslim garbage pickers during the COVID-19 lockdown in India and their struggles to return home to Assam. Their financial hardships were exacerbated by social, political, and religious prejudices. Belonging to the Bengali-speaking miya community, deemed “Bangladeshi,” government authorities neglected them. The lockdown’s hyped-up anti-Muslim propaganda also reduced them to “corona jihadis.” The author reads their struggles as a case study of the Muslim condition in India and argues for civic engagement for redressing the condition of the marginal and vulnerable. The research was conducted through telephone and Zoom calls and in-person interviews. © 2021, ZRC SAZU, Založba ZRC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Intergroup dialogue (IGD) is a prominent social justice pedagogy that engages diverse groups of students in sustained, facilitated dialogues on social issues. Decades of IGD research have informed the development of the critical-dialogic theoretical framework of intergroup dialogue, which describes how IGD engages students in communicative, cognitive, and affective processes that promote intergroup understanding, intergroup relationships, and intergroup collaboration and action. Scholars have recently highlighted the need to better understand the relationships between students' developmental capacities, their corresponding attitudes and dispositions, and IGD processes and outcomes in order to discern how students at different levels of development respond to and experience IGD. Study Purpose: Grounded in the theory of self-authorship, theories of epistemological development, and corresponding research suggesting that dispositions associated with students' epistemological assumptions of knowledge and knowing can moderate students' engagement and development in matters that are interpersonal and intrapersonal in nature, the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationships between students' openness to multiple perspectives (a disposition associated with epistemological development) and the interpersonal and intrapersonal processes and outcomes associated with IGD. Research Design: In this secondary data analysis of the multi-institutional, longitudinal dataset constructed as part of the multi-university intergroup dialogue research project, structural equation modeling was used to discern how the relationships between IGD's communicative, cognitive, and affective processes and outcomes vary for groups of students with different levels of openness to multiple perspectives. Results: In line with previous research on college student development, the results of this study illuminate a moderating relationship between students' openness to multiple perspectives and the intergroup processes and outcomes associated with IGD. The patterns of moderation observed suggests that IGD's communicative, cognitive, and affective processes and outcomes are most strongly (although not exclusively) associated with matters of pedagogy and cognition for students who are less open, and matters of communication and affect for students who are more open. Conclusions and Recommendations: The results of this study suggest that as IGD facilitators are able to increase their understanding of epistemological development and related dispositions, pass on their understanding to their students via readings and activities, assess their students' epistemological dispositions, and augment their preparation and facilitation accordingly, an IGD group's collective ability to increase intergroup understanding, relationships, collaboration, and action is enhanced. This can be accomplished as what is known about college students' epistemological development and dispositions is more fully integrated into IGD curriculum, facilitation, and facilitator training. © 2021 Teachers College, Columbia University.

AB  - Research on temporary agency work emphasizes that temporary agency workers (TAWs), particularly those in low-skilled jobs associated with precariousness and low social prestige, are likely to be exposed to poor treatment, as well as stigmatization. On the contrary, stigmatization of TAWs in high-skilled jobs has not been treated in much detail in previous studies. Literature provides an incomplete picture of stigmatization within the broader field of temporary employment regarding the focus on low-skilled jobs. Hence, the present qualitative study is based on data from interviews of a heterogeneous sample of TAWs employed in low- and high-skilled jobs in Germany. By using and modifying Boyce and colleagues’ (2007) model of stigmatization, the study shows that stigmatizing treatment towards TAWs occurs across all skill levels, although the intensity and form of those experiences, as well as coping strategies, differ. Thereby, this study contributes to a more differentiated and skill level-specific understanding of how TAWs perceive and cope with stigmatization linked to their employment status. It also provides an important opportunity to advance Boyce and colleagues’ (2007) complex model of TAW stigmatization with empirical underpinnings. © 2021, Lodz University. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the major challenges for modern western societies is the reduction of prejudice in order to achieve a sufficient level of integration of immigrants and especially refugees. The current literature thus presents a multitude of approaches to understand and reduce prejudices. Therefore, the following paper investigates the relationships between ethnic identity, acculturation attitudes, intercultural competence, and prejudice and how contact experiences shape these relationships for students in Germany with and without migration background. The results show that there is a significant relationship between prejudice and the social identity, cultural intelligence, and acculturation strategies. Furthermore, the results indicate that the experienced contact quality and quantity to refugees moderate the effect of acculturation strategies on overt prejudice and xenophobia. However, the relationship between acculturation strategies and covert prejudice is only moderated by contact quantity. Because of the relatively weak manifestations of the dependent variables in the study at hand, alternative instruments should be used for investigation. Based on the obtained results, this paper finally tries to give some guidance for the facilitation of diversity and reduction of prejudice at higher education institutions. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Since 1997, Ecuador has undergone a series of changes to ensure family rights to sexual minorities. However, there is still limited research regarding attitudes toward them. This study focused on the attitudes toward lesbians (L), gay men (G), and their rights. A sample of 318 cisgender Ecuadorians who responded to an online survey was recruited. Analyses indicated that men, heterosexuals, who practice their religion, attend more frequently to religious services, and identify as conservative showed higher levels of prejudice against LG as well as less support toward their rights. Further, participants who did not have LG acquaintances, friends, family members, and those who did not know any LG parented family showed less support toward these populations. Multiple regression analyses indicated that believing that a person’s sexual orientation is learned significantly predicted the attitudes measured in our study. Implications of these findings to help reduce prejudice against LG individuals are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article presents the results of three studies that examine how the perceived opinions of others are related to sexual minorities’ support for social change toward greater equality. Results of two cross-sectional studies (Study 1: N = 1,220; Study 2: N = 904) reveal that perceived intolerance (i.e., perceived intolerant societal norms) is indirectly related to intentions to engage in collective action in both negative and positive ways: the negative effect was mediated by lower perceptions of perceived efficacy; positive effects were mediated by greater anger (about the legal situation and public opinion) and greater perceived need for a movement. Study 3 (N = 408) replicates this conflicting effect with a delayed outcome measure by showing that perceived intolerant norms were indirectly, both negatively and positively, associated with actual collective action engagement. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our expanded social identity model of collective action. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - A field study was conducted with majority and minority group members to test whether the effects of optimal contact conditions and of intergroup contact generalize across situations, and extend to the support of intergroup equality in terms of agreement with social policies benefitting the minority group. Participants were 163 Italian and 129 immigrant workers in three corporate organizations. Results from structural equation modelling analyses revealed that, for the majority group, positive contact stemming from optimal contact conditions was indirectly associated, via reduction in negative stereotypes, with more positive behavior that generalized across situations. For both majority and minority groups, positive contact stemming from optimal contact conditions was associated with less negative stereotypes, and in turn with greater support for social policies favoring the minority. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, also in relation to the significance of the present results for research investigating the relation between intergroup contact and social change. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: The Theory of Mind (ToM) deficit hypothesis is a dominant construct used to explain the social and communication difficulties observed in autistic individuals. This hypothesis was based on an interpretation of autistic individuals’ observable behavior, not based on insider accounts. Insider perspectives still remain mostly absent in research on ToM. We aimed to gain an understanding of the relevance and applicability of ToM by examining writings of autistic bloggers. Methods: As part of a series of studies examining insider autistic perspectives, we used a descriptive qualitative approach and conducted a thematic analysis of content scraped from 40 blogs written by autistic authors. Results: The blogs offered important perspectives on the applicability of ToM to autistic individuals. The primary themes reflected empirical contradictions to ToM, explicit critiques of ToM, and pointed to ToM as a source of harm. Conclusion: The insider perspectives call into question the ways clinicians, researchers, and society use ToM to understand autistic individuals and point to the harmful effects of ToM on autistic lived experience. These findings emphasize the importance of attending to autistic people in building a body of knowledge that better reflects autistic experiences and promotes more effective and ethical clinical practices.Implications for Rehabilitation Our paper indicates the need for a timely and thorough re-evaluation of the ToM deficit hypothesis of autism. Autistic insider perspectives not only empirically demonstrate and explicitly critique the ToM deficit hypothesis, but reveal the hypothesis as harmful to autistic experience by reinforcing negative stereotypes, prompting acts of discrimination, and perpetuating autistic insider’s exclusion from the research concerning them. Given the varied experiences of autistic people and the harmful impacts of the ToM deficit hypothesis, it is safer for clinicians and researchers to presume a presence of ToM and empathy, before they presume a deficit in autistic individuals. Autistic insiders are able, eager, and deserve to be included in the research and practices that concern them. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Previous research into children’s perceptions of science shows that children like science but often hold stereotypical views of scientists and commonly do not see themselves with a career as a scientist.Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine if a carefully designed medium-term, teacher-led STEM intervention, ‘Scientist of the Week’ which showcased a diverse range of working scientists and the skills they need, can lead to a positive change in the perception of scientists among young people.Sample Design and Methods: Using a case-control approach, this research used a tracked sample of 118 young people from aged 7 to 11 in a primary school in the North East of England. Words associated with scientists were collected before and after (directly, one month, one year) the intervention from the tracked sample and analysed to assess changes in stereotypical perceptions and any difference in responses between male and female participants.Results: Before the intervention, young children held many of the common stereotypes associated with scientists. Shortly afterwards, and one year following the intervention, the use of common stereotypes had fallen significantly across all children, with particular improvements in counter-stereotypical word usage for males. It also found that stereotypical images of scientists as highly intelligent were more difficult to counteract and that many of the positive changes in this view seen in the short term (weeks and months) diminished in the long term (one year later).Conclusions: This research has shown that with minimal expense and effort from teachers, negative stereotypes of scientists can be reduced through an intervention that does not require bringing scientists into the classroom. Some of the observed changes persisted in the longer-term, suggesting a lasting alteration in children’s perceptions of scientists following the intervention. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - While we know a lot about the typical type of radical right-wing (RRWP) voter, individual religiosity in explaining support for RRWPs has eluded consistent scholarly attention. The mixed results available from the scarce literature find both positive and negative associations between religiosity and RRWPs vote. The variation in these relationships is puzzling, especially if we consider how RRWPs often present themselves as guardians of native ethnic and religious identity. In this paper we argue that religiosity increases the chance of voting for RRWPs when ethnic relations are a salient issue in the political system. We test our theory using multilevel regression modeling on the European Social Survey, specifically Rounds 7, 8 and 9 and replicate our results based on the European Values Study from 2017. We find that religiosity is a significant predictor of the RRWP vote when there are salient ethnic relations in the political system, proxied by the presence of an ethnic minority party. On the other hand, in countries without minority parties, non-religious individuals are more likely to vote for RRWPs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: The perception of prejudice against, and stigmatization of, sickle cell disease (SCD) leads the patient to perceive a different treatment, due to the disease stigma and may be related to a worse quality of life (QoL). Objectives: Describe and evaluate the perception of the prejudice against the disease and its impact on the quality of life of patients with sickle cell disease. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted between March 2019 and February 2020, with patients diagnosed with SCD. Patients were questioned about the perception of prejudice in any kind of situation, choosing between “Yes” or “No”, not differentiating situations related to prejudice. To assess the QoL and impact of the disease, the volunteers answered a version of the SF-36 questionnaire translated and validated into Brazilian Portuguese. Results: In this study, 113 patients with SCD were followed up, 92% were classified as HbSS and the rest, divided between HbSC and HbS-β-0. Regarding the SF-36, the worst scores were in the summary of the physical components (mean 48.19 ± 21.51) and the physical aspect had the lowest mean (30.75 ±€42.65). When questioned if they had already perceived any kind of prejudice, including the SCD, 32.74% answered “Yes”. For this comparison, there was a significant difference in the summary of the physical and mental components, with worse QoL for those who had already suffered prejudice. Conclusion: Patients diagnosed with SCD who reported perception of prejudice had statistically significant worse QoL, revealing the negative impact, that might lead to sadness and social isolation. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia Celular

AB  - Among social policies in France, those concerning childhood are primarily aimed at populations living in deprived neighbourhoods where immigrant families live side by side with disadvantaged native French single mothers, disabled workers and long-term unemployed families. However, immigrant families are ‘captives’, and they can neither move easily due to lack financial resources nor access private housing markets because some private landlords refuse to accept immigrant tenants. This article is based on in-depth studies using parents’ life-stories, family case histories and semi-structured interviews with professionals carried out in various French cities. It was found that immigrant families, most of whom come from former French colonies (North Africa, Black Africa), have expectations about the French health, social and school systems. The future of their children is at the heart of their migration project. This paper shows how these families report making sacrifices for their children to achieve success in French society, in spite of the risks of living in poverty. But one unexpected risk lies in the prejudices of some professionals against their children. The paper sheds light on how immigrant parenting in France is still shaped by colonialism and class, and how it influences the policy response with various consequences. © 2021 Academy of Social Sciences.

AB  - The study aimed to describe characteristics related to the revolving door phenomenon in a Child and Adolescent Shelter Unit and to analyze the way in which the service manages this phenomenon. A qualitative case study was carried out with the analysis of: semi-structured interviews; participant observation recorded in a field notebook; documents and a focus group. From the analysis, three themes were constructed: Broken bonds: “If the family does not take care of itself, we can’t” (generational issues, family bonds, adherence to treatment); Underfunding: “They work miracles with the resources they have” (state underfunding, prejudice and private investment); Public policies: “This is not my problem” (segmentation of care, lack of community support and information/preparation of the institutions). These points constitute barriers in the treatment of children and adolescents that use drugs and highlight the revolving door phenomenon. © 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - The field of school psychology continues to further embrace a social justice perspective to address systemic racism, privilege, prejudice, and discrimination. To accomplish this mission, school psychologists must ensure that there is a solid literature base that is inclusive and representative of students from minoritized backgrounds. A review of student sociodemographic characteristics was conducted of all articles in four of the primary journals of school psychology from 2010 to 2019 (n = 1,213 articles). Compared to national estimates of school-age sociodemographic distributions, researchers tended to include samples more representative of students identifying as White/Caucasian and underrepresentative of students from low-income backgrounds. Authors rarely included or described participants’ sexual orientations and gender identities beyond the binary (female/male). We provide a discussion and recommendations for improving the inclusivity of students from minoritized backgrounds in future school psychology research. Impact Statement To provide evidence-based school psychological practices to all students, the field’s literature must be representative of the student population. In reviewing the past decade of school psychology research, the literature tends to overrepresent students who are White and come from middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds. There tends to be underrepresentation of sexual minority youth, youth from low SES backgrounds, and children at the elementary grade level.

AB  - With the global #Metoo movement yet to arrive in Nigeria, Jude Dibia’s Unbridled reflects an emblematic moment for the underrepresented to occupy their stories and make their voices heard. The study analyzes patriarchy’s complicated relationship with the Nigerian girl child, significantly reviewing the inherent prejudices in patriarchy’s power hierarchies and how radical narratives explore taboo topics like incest and sexual violence. Contextualizing the concepts of hypersexualization and implicit bias to put in perspective how women, expected to be the gatekeepers of sex, are forced to navigate competing allegiances while remaining submissive and voiceless, the article probes the struggles of sexual victims and how hierarchies in a patriarchal society exacerbate their affliction through a culture of silence. Arguing that Dibia’s Unbridled confronts the narrative of silence in Nigerian fiction, the article explores ways the author empowers gender by challenging social values and traditional gender roles, underscoring gender dynamics and the problematic nature of prevalent bias against the feminine gender in Nigeria. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The ever-increasingly complex economic activities across all industries have rendered teamwork a ubiquitous feature of the modern economy. Selecting the right employees, however, is conceived to be an ever more challenging task in the presence of an increasing number of adult only- children, who are widely perceived to be spoilt, self-centred and thus with weak team spirit. Our experimental study reassesses such negative stereotype by investigating only children’s participation willingness and their commitment to a group effort. Only children are found to contribute as much as their counterparts with siblings to the group effort although with slightly weaker willingness to join. Furthermore, the provision of peer information about relative performance is found to be significantly more effective in incentivizing only children than non-only children on both their willingness to participate in teamwork and their contribution to a group effort. Together, our findings suggest that only children can outperform their counterparts with siblings in teamwork as the uncertainty of team productivity is reduced by the introduction of feedback information. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this paper, we report on our survey research which sought to explore how pansexual and panromantic people experience and understand their identities. Eighty participants, mainly in the U.K., were recruited via social media and internet forums. Thematic analysis resulted in the development of two key themes. In The label depends on the context: It’s like bisexuality, but it isn’t, we report the blurred lines between pansexual and bisexual identities and discuss how, despite often having a preference for pansexual and panromantic, these participants nonetheless engaged in strategic use of both bi and pan terms. In the second theme entitled Educated and enlightened pansexuals we report how participants portrayed pansexual and panromantic identities as requiring an advanced understanding of gender and sexuality. This meant that those who engaged in these terms were represented as educated and enlightened. In the subtheme An internet education: Tumblr-ing into pan identities and communities, we discuss how educational resources and inclusive spaces were largely understood to exist only online. In this research, participants understood pansexual and panromantic identities to be related to, but distinct from, other identities (including bisexuality) and presented their identities as entailing distinctive experiences, including of prejudice and discrimination. We discuss the contribution and implications of our findings. © 2021 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives. Body size attitudes and body image dissatisfaction develop in early childhood. The aim of the study was to examine to which extent parental body size attitudes, internaliza-tion of the gender-appropriate, socially-accept-able beauty standards, and body dissatisfaction shape the attitudes of their children towards overweight peers, and the image that they have of their own body. Sample and settings. The authors interviewed 73 preschool and school children and their parents in mother-daughter and father-son dyads evalu-ating corresponding constructs. Hypotheses. The authors hypothesized that pre-school-age boys and girls would exhibit a positive attitude towards the thin silhouettes and a negative attitude towards overweight ones. Statistical analysis. The chi-square tests of ho-mogeneity were used to verify the percentage, with which characteristics were attributed to the five silhouettes and also to verify the hypothesis regarding children negative stereotypes. The multiple linear regression model that includes maternal attitude towards overweight people, body dissatisfaction, restrictive eating behavior and internalization of the thin body ideal has been used to explore the link between body size attitudes in mothers and daughters. Results. Statistical analysis indicated that children as young as 4 years old hold prejudice against their overweight peers by attributing them a small percent of positive characteristics and a greater percentage of negative characteris-tics. Motherʼs body size attitude and restrictive eating behavior were associated with daughter prejudices. Paternal body size attitudes and body dissatisfaction predicted their sonʼs body size attitudes. Limitations. The procedure used to assess childrenʼs body dissatisfaction and the limited group of participants were the limitations of this study. © 2021, Czech Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Immigration is one of the most contested issues in contemporary political life because of its possible implications for state welfare provisions of receiving countries. There is a fear that rising immigration will erode public support for social policies that benefit immigrants, particularly in contexts of economic crisis. However, some believe that social trust is a determining factor that may mitigate such anti-immigrant attitudes. We test both arguments for the case of Spain through multiple regression analyses of surveys on attitudes towards immigrants, carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) from 2007 to 2017. While the results are consistent with expectations according to group threat theory, we also found that trusting individuals are more likely to support immigrants’ social rights. Moreover, social trust lessens the negative effects of the perception of threat posed by outgroups —perceived economic threat and perceived size of their population— on support for immigrants’ social rights. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Multicultural youth are more likely to experience negative emotions (e.g. depressive symptoms) due to social prejudice and discrimination. Nevertheless, previous studies that analyzed the emotional aspects of multicultural youth mainly compared the characteristics of multicultural youth and those of the other youth or identified individual risk factors using a regression model. This study developed models to predict the depressive disorders of multicultural youth based on the Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST), Classification And Regression Trees (CART), gradient boosting machine (G-B-M), random forest, and deep neural network (deep-NN) using epidemiological data representing multicultural youth and compared the prediction performance (PRED PER) of the developed models. Our study analyzed 19,431 youths (9,835 males and 9,596 females) aged between 19 and 24 years old. We developed models for predicting the self-awareness of health of youths by using QUEST, CART, G-B-M, random forest, and deep-NN and compared the balanced accuracy of them to evaluate their PRED PER. Among 19,431 subjects, 42.9% (5,838 people) experienced a depressive disorder in the past year. The results of our study confirmed that deep-NN had the best PRED PER with a specificity of 0.85, a sensitivity of 0.71, and a balanced accuracy of 0.78. It will be necessary to develop a model with optimal PRED PER by tuning hyperparameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, number of iteration © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The objective of this article is to analyze the impact of stigma and discrimination against the LGBT adolescents’ psychic suffering. Qualita-tive study conducted in a specialized outpatient service of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Secondary Care of the Federal District’s Health Secretariat. Nine adolescents participated. In-depth interviews facilitated data collection, and data were analyzed with Iramuteq software and Bardin’s Content Analysis. Gender identity and sexual orientation intolerance based on heter-onormativity violate human rights and are rele-vant social determinants in health, and overcom-ing the psychological distress problems identified, combined with respect for human rights of the LGBT community, is an essential vector for fac-ing adolescent health inequalities. Discrimination against LGBT adolescents is a social determinant that health services must address since its leads to harmful consequences, such as school dropouts, lack of opportunities, family bond losses, and sui-cidal behavior. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - Immigration may be perceived by members of host countries as a threat, with psychological and material impacts on immigrants' well-being: it may reinforce negative stereotypes, promote discrimination, or even encourage violence. One means of alleviating such prejudice is increased intergroup contact. However, under certain conditions, increased contact can produce harmful outcomes as intergroup contact may provide opportunities for positive and negative relationships between ingroup and outgroup members. Further, relatively little research has examined intergroup contact between native host country members and immigrants in Asian societies, and in particular, in Singapore. To address this gap, the current research examined the effects of separating, clustering, or integrating international students from local ones at two Singaporean universities. We assessed the degree to which different living arrangements impacted local and international students’ intergroup contact, satisfaction with university life, perceptions of conflict, and intergroup attitudes. The findings suggest that those who are interested in improving intergroup relations via influencing the social ecology of majority and minority residents should provide opportunities for integration over separation or enclaves. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - This paper presents an overview of some of the major themes addressed by the Multidisciplinary Course on Human Rights Education coordinated by the authors for the Department of Education, Languages, Interculture, Literature, and Psychology (FORLILPSI) of the University of Florence in collaboration with the Italian Committee for UNICEF. The main thrust of the Course-and therefore of these notes-was and is the valorisation of children’s rights education as a resource for combating the various types of discrimination that underlie processes of exclusion and social marginalization and that increase risks of educational poverty and cultural deprivation. More in detail, we analyze that set of cultural practices, behaviours, and beliefs that generate sexist and racial prejudices and lead to systematic violation of the rights of social groups, which thus suffer processes of inferiorisation. Il contributo che presentiamo sintetizza alcuni dei principali temi chiave proposti durante il Corso Universitario Multidisciplinare di Educazione ai Diritti, coordinato da chi scrive per il Dipartimento Forlilpsi dell’Università di Firenze in collaborazione con il Comitato Italiano per l’Unicef. Il filo conduttore del corso, e dunque delle riflessioni che affidiamo a questo articolo, è costituito dalla valorizzazione dell’educazione ai diritti dell’infanzia come risorsa per contrastare le discriminazioni che stanno alla base dei processi di esclusione, di marginalizzazione sociale e che alimentano il rischio della povertà educativa e della deprivazione culturale. In particolare, il saggio va ad analizzare quel complesso di pratiche culturali, atteggiamenti e credenze che genera pregiudizi sessisti e razzisti e che conduce ad una violazione sistematica dei diritti dei gruppi sociali che subiscono un processo di inferiorizzazione. © 2021, University of Bologna.

AB  - Disability is a complex phenomenon that children often find challenging to fully grasp. Understanding how children perceive disability, however, could have important implications for the social inclusion of students with disabilities. Once we understand how children conceptualize disability, efforts can be made to help students critically analyze misconceptions and stereotypes. Negative stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination toward people with disability can contribute toward ableism in schools. Ableism cannot be addressed with the cognitive dimension alone but developing an accurate understanding of disability seems to be a necessary first step, especially for children. In this study, students in a Grade 4 class in Southwestern Ontario were asked to define the word disability in their own words, draw a character with a disability, and provide a description of their drawing. The majority of drawings were of characters with physical disability and most of the definitions of disability were based upon deficit thinking.Points of interest Children’s understanding of disability in definition and drawings were examined. As part of a larger intervention study, students were asked to define the word disability and draw a character with a disability, as well as provide a description of their drawing. Students’ definitions of disability fell into 5 categories: (1) Disadvantaged, (2) Special, (3) Assistive Devices, (4) Attention and Support, and (5) Types of Disability. Students’ drawings of disability were categorized by the type of disability that was drawn/described. These included: (1) Physical Disabilities, (2) Autism, (3) Sensory Disabilities, and (4) Learning Disabilities. Drawings were mostly of characters with physical disabilities and most definitions focused on the perceived disadvantages of having a disability. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article sheds light on the challenges that Black, Indigenous, and students of color in the U.S. face in dealing with uncertainties and prejudice caused by the worldwide pandemic. It provides recommendations on culturally relevant, responsive, and sustaining teaching strategies based on the cultural competence model (Pedersen, 1994; Sue, 2001; Sue et al., 1992) and curriculum reframing. Teachers of Black, Indigenous, and students of color around the world will find this article particularly useful because there are limited research-based recommendations applicable to schools in the U.S. and around the world. © 2021.

AB  - Victims experience the risk of exclusion due to a number of stereotypical perceptions and prejudices they are exposed to, which is an important factor in violating their rights. Because, when necessary approaches and interventions are not made or wrongly done, secondary victimization can be caused in victims. For this purpose, the PAVS, which measures the level of prejudice, mold-judgment and awareness of victims for professionals working in the field and potentially working, has been developed, its validity and reliability has been tested and applied (n = 270). As a result, two important factors that determine perceptions and awareness of victims are gender and lessons, seminars etc. for victims. attending an event. Women have more positive perceptions and higher awareness than men. Taking lessons for victims or seminars etc. participation increases awareness and students' increased awareness decreases their prejudiced perception. However, while awareness increased, it was observed that there was an increase in stereotypical perceptions. There is only a gender difference in stereotypical perceptions, and men have more stereotypical perceptions than women. Considering the level of awareness, it was found that the awareness levels of women towards victims were higher than men. Some activities for victims should be increased, especially in areas such as educational sciences, social work, psychology, sociology etc. that have the potential to work with victims. © 2021.

AB  - In this article, we analyze the perceptions of young students about Brazil, starting from the dialogue between the historical consciousness and social representations theories. Through the production of written narratives, we aim to identify the worldviews which our participants use to guide themselves over time and to envision their future. Therewith, we intend to value the mental constructions of the subjects in the school context contributing to the strengthening of research in the field of Teaching of History. This study was carried out in a public state school located in the Butanta neighborhood, in the city of Sao Paulo/SP, Brazil, in 2017. It was part of it 127 students, between the ages of 14 and 18, males and females, distributed in five groups of the 1st grade of High School. The data was obtained through a questionnaire and analyzed accordingly with the assumptions of Grounded theory with the help of IRAMUTEQ. This enabled the construction of a dendrogram composed of three classes which implied in the identification of representations about the present time (class 1), articulations with the past (class 2), and projections for the future (class 3). Under the results, we evidenced ideas related to the perception of a country in crisis, with a prejudiced past and with a future, contradictorily, promising. Once worked in class, these ideas can contribute to the formation of the historical consciousness of the students. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Previous studies indicate that perception of peer norms and school norms regarding intergroup contact can significantly influence children and youth attitudes and behaviours towards outgroup members. Additionally, school climate can also play an important role in shaping quality of intergroup relations. The present study examines the role of peer and school norms regarding intergroup contact and school climate in explaining majority and minority pupils’ self-reported prosocial outgroup behaviour in different types of public schools from four different multi-ethnic contexts in Croatia. Pupils (N = 1568; average age M = 15.04) attending ethnic majority, minority and mixed schools participated in this study. Results demonstrate that positive peer and school norms regarding intergroup contact as well as the lower level of ethnicity-based conflicts are associated with more self-reported outgroup prosocial behaviour. Furthermore, findings indicate a moderation effect of group status whereby the effect of quality of relationships and connectedness in school is observed for majority pupils only. The findings also indicate a moderation effect of school type and the stronger effect of peer norms on self-reported outgroup prosocial behaviour of pupils in mixed schools. The results are discussed from the perspective of current literature review and potential educational implications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Atheists are among the most disliked groups in America, which has been explained in a variety of ways, one of which is that atheists are hostile towards religion and that anti-atheist prejudice is therefore reactive. We tested this hypothesis by using the 2018 American General Social Survey by investigating attitudes towards atheists, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, and Muslims. We initially used a general sample of Americans, but then identified and isolated individuals who were atheists, theists, nonreligious atheists, religious theists, and/or theistic Christians. Logically, if atheists were inordinately hostile towards religion, we would expect to see a greater degree of in-group favouritism in the atheist group and a greater degree of out-group dislike. Results indicated several notable findings: 1). Atheists were significantly more disliked than any other religious group. 2). Atheists rated Christians, Buddhists, Jews, and Hindus as favourably as they rated their own atheist in-group, but rated Muslims less positively (although this effect was small). 3). Christian theists showed pronounced ingroup favouritism and a strong dislike towards atheists. No evidence could be found to support the contention that atheists are hostile towards religious groups in general, and towards Christians specifically, although this may have been a Type II error. If atheist groups do dislike religious groups, then this hypothetical dislike would be significantly smaller in magnitude than the dislike directed toward atheists by Christians. © FFC 2021.

AB  - This study investigates a mechanism of mediated intergroup contact effects that occurs through experiencing social presence of a stigmatized outgroup character. Conceiving narrative texts as a context for mediated intergroup contact, we experimentally test (N = 505) the effects of narrative perspective (first vs. third person) and the photograph of the outgroup protagonist (present vs. absent) on perceived social presence of the outgroup character. We further test whether experiencing the outgroup protagonist as socially present affects intergroup outcomes (i.e., perspective-taking, intergroup anxiety, outgroup knowledge, and outgroup attitudes). Findings indicate that first-person narratives are more effective than third-person narratives in inducing social presence of the stigmatized outgroup character; photos, unexpectedly, did not have such an effect. Social presence, in turn, plays a key role in facilitating positive intergroup outcomes from reading online narrative texts. The implications of our findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: In Iran, there is a significant increase in women living with HIV+/AIDS. In a cultural, social, and political context, educational and empowerment needs are still considered a challenging issue among these women. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the experience of living with HIV+/AIDS from the perspective of women in Ahvaz, Iran, focusing on educational needs and empowerment. Methods: The present qualitative study was a descriptive phenomenology conducted in 2020. The research context included all educational, therapeutic, counseling, and support centers, governmental and non-governmental HIV/AIDS associations and institutions located in Ahvaz. The statistical population of the study included all women with HIV and AIDS. The study participants were selected using purposeful and snowball sampling method. Semi-structured open interviews (individual and face-to-face) were selected as the primary and central approach to data collection. Results: The findings showed that the 5 identified themes of understanding the experience of focusing on educational needs and empowerment in women were severe suffering (shock, anger, resentment of the family and friends, and feelings of isolation), disapproval (prejudices, stereotypes, and taboos related to HIV in society, and feeling of lack of social support), insecurity in social and economic life (lack of readiness for cultural and social participation, equality or inequality in empowerment, assessing relationships based on economic criteria, and doubts about improving health), disrespect (disrespect for unique characteristics, and insult and slander), and hardship in protection (continuing to control health status information). Conclusion: It can be concluded that the educational and empowerment needs of patients with AIDS/HIV+ should be taken into consideration. Mobilizing individuals, specialists, and providers of counseling and care services in different sectors to gain a better understanding of the complex nature of the phenomenon of non-compliance with the right to empowerment will be useful. © 2021, Vesnu Publications.

AB  - Social accessibility involves the capacity of a person to be reached by other people, typically through established social networks. Locative media provide new complications to the issue of social accessibility in urban spaces. They do not connect people with their existing social networks, but rather with people – often strangers – immediately around them. Locative media apps provide users with the ability to manage these anonymous connections through filtering functionalities. This filtering out and filtering in functionality has profound implications for the social relations of strangers in urban spaces. At the heart of the matter is the question of who is made visible and who is made invisible. Many studies of locative media use demonstrate troubling directions in the ways in which they are developed and used. Often, locative media apps reinforce and reify existing racisms and other forms of prejudice, and a general tendency to try to simplify or eliminate differences. © 2020, the authors.

AB  - At the intersection of race and gender, Black women can face multifaceted marginalization as members of two marginalized groups. Is such bias against Black women due to individual differences in racism or sexism, or are both implicated? In the present study, non-Black undergraduates at a Canadian university (N = 231) rated stereotype endorsement of Black women (“Mammy,” “Jezebel,” “Sapphire,” “Ratchet”) and their willingness to discriminate against Black women (hiring of, sublet to, voting for). Hostile sexism uniquely predicted stronger stereotype endorsement, whereas modern racism uniquely predicted greater discrimination willingness. Generalized right-wing ideology (tapping the variance shared by right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political conservatism) was not uniquely related to the criteria. Implications in terms of group category suppression or activation, and the designing of interventions, are discussed. © 2021 Canadian Psychological Association

AB  - The strike of public employees is of vital, fundamental, and controversial issues owing to multiple problems it raises in face of political systems. Despite its close relation to an inherent human right, as a manifestation of freedom of expression, it negatively affects the functioning of public facilities regularly and steadily. The stances of jurisprudence and the judiciary, nevertheless, differed on this matter between legitimacy and lack thereof. Accordingly, the current study casts light on the Jordanian legal system in terms of the regulatory legislation constitutional and administrative judiciary towards public employees' strike. Coherently, the study seeks to clarify the contradiction between the stance of the Jordanian constitutional and administrative judiciary on preserving this right and how it is practiced. In this context, the study scrutinizes the constitutionality of the text of Article (68) Of the Jordanian Civil Service System No. (82) of 2013. Moreover, the study views the international conventions ratified by Jordan that features the public employees' strike as a general principle, restricted exceptionally to the necessities of regular functioning of the public facility. Consequently, the study focuses on Jordan's ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights and hence examines whether it affects the legitimacy of the strike or not. The research concluded that Article 68 of the Jordanian Civil Service Law No. 82 of 2013 is unconstitutional. In addition, there is a clear contradiction between the rulings of the Jordanian Constitutional Court and the Supreme Administrative Court pertaining to the preservation of the right for a public employees to strike, since the Jordanian constitution, in accordance with the amendments of 2011, affirms the imperative for preserving the public rights and freedoms of Jordanians and not to prejudice their essence or undermine their fundamentals, consolidating the text of Article (2/128) of the Jordanian Constitution of 1952. © 2021, Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues.

AB  - Through an appraisal of neuroscience viewpoints on nonconscious mind with respect to white racial bias, this article shows how Freud’s philosophical approach to unconscious mentality assists insights into white privilege and complements the model neuro-science provides. The article addresses four areas: Freud’s concept of displaced affect, a link between American white people’s self-reported egalitarianism and suppressed prejudice, how studies linking automatic race bias with the amygdala correlate noncon-scious race-bias with fear response, and how race bias develops from two brain bases involving conscious and nonconscious pro-cesses. This article concludes that white individuals will be better positioned to embrace a principle of social fairness if widespread racism, racial bias and their psychic denial by whites, are made clearer to people. Combining a Freud-informed and experimen-tally empirical approach can help. © 2021 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA.

AB  - From early in development, humans show a strong preference for members of their own groups, even in so-called minimal (i.e., arbitrary and unfamiliar) groups, leading to tremendous negative consequences such as outgroup discrimination and derogation. A better understanding of the underlying processes driving humans’ group mindedness is an important first step toward fighting discrimination and inequality on a bigger level. Based on the assumption that minimal group allocation elicits the anticipation of future within-group cooperation, which in turn elicits ingroup preference, we investigate whether changing participants’ anticipation from within-group cooperation to between-group cooperation reduces their ingroup bias. In the present set of five studies (overall N = 465) we test this claim in two different populations (children and adults), in two different countries (United States and Germany), and in two kinds of groups (minimal and social group based on gender). Results confirm that changing participants’ anticipation of who they will cooperate with from ingroup to outgroup members significantly reduces their ingroup bias in minimal groups, though not for gender, a noncoalitional group. In summary, these experiments provide robust evidence for the hypothesis that children and adults encode minimal group membership as a marker for future collaboration. They show that experimentally manipulating this expectation can eliminate their minimal ingroup bias. This study sheds light on the underlying cognitive processes in intergroup behavior throughout development and opens up new avenues for research on reducing ingroup bias and discrimination. © 2021.

METHODS: qualitative survey, based on the Social Representations Theory, with 24 young people living with HIV, monitored in specialized services in Rio de Janeiro, through semi-structured interviews, and the analysis supported by the software IRAMUTEQ. RESULTS: multidimensionality of the quality of life was observed unfolding the implications of living with HIV/aids concerning the familiar and social support network, time of diagnosis, healthcare services, antiretroviral therapy, and prejudice expressions. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: a conceptual synthesis of quality of life is observed when it is associated with healthy lifestyle habits, interpersonal relationships, and health services and professional practices.

AB  - Regionalism, understood as affective attachment of people to place, is shifting into the focus of social scientific attention. An important aspect of this are the globally observable encounters of growing numbers of immigrants with regional identities. Empirical work concerning the impact of regionalism on anti-immigrant attitudes has been contradictory so far. Results range from a moderate to no influence. The paper, thus, analyses the intricate relationship between hostility towards immigrants and regionalism in detail. Merging country-level data on the extent of regional autonomy in a nation-state with individual and regional data on regionalism enables us to gauge the relevance of regionalism for anti-immigrant attitudes in a comparative perspective. The paper presents a multilevel regression analysis that shows a mitigating relationship of the presence of extensive regional autonomy in a nation-state on anti-immigrant attitudes at the country level. Regionalism, unlike nationalism, does not correlate with anti-immigrant attitudes at the regional or individual level, while nationalism is clearly significant at both levels. These results reflect general global prejudice trends and the call for further work on the effect mechanisms of institutionally granted regional autonomy on openness to immigrants. © 2021 Regional Studies Association.

AB  - In the study reported on here we employed the interpretivist qualitative approach to explore the recruitment and retention of male educators in preschool centres. Purposive sampling was used to select 2 preschool owners, 2 principals, 4 preschool educators and 2 male educators in the Foundation Phase. Data were obtained by in-depth interviewing and were analysed thematically. Results showed no male educators in preschools in the education district where the study was conducted. Misinterpretation of cultural roles, stigma, fear and prejudice, low educator status within the preschool sector and a lack of male recruitment policies were found to be negatively affecting the recruitment of males into the preschool sector. A gender balance that ensures that both female and male educators are recruited within the preschool sector would appear to be congruent with the philosophical underpinnings of the Social Role Theory (SRT). The Departments of Education and Social Development should, therefore, embark on awareness campaigns to educate all stakeholders on the need for a gender balance within the preschool sector. © 2021, South African Journal Of Education.

AB  - This study explored psychological predictors that may impact viewers’ decision to watch television shows on the basis of perceived racial or ethnic representation. 1998 undergraduate students selected from a list of motivations for watching television that included race-specific motivations such as “a character is of my race/ethnicity.” Participants also completed attitudinal measures of colorblind racial ideology, social dominance orientation, ethnic identity, and ethnic stigma consciousness. Analysis revealed that prejudicial beliefs predicted less salience for racial representation when making choices about television watching, while deeper connection to one’s ethnic group predicted greater salience for representation when making these choices. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - For the creation of the play ‘La Torera’, its author, Carmen Elena Jijón, collects fragments of Anita Bermeo’s life to reconstruct the main character of the play. The proposal is articulated, together with the collective imagination, with press articles and multiple creations by artists from the Republic of Ecuador, becoming part of a transmedial biography of ‘La Torera’ that goes beyond the entire work and it circumscribes in an even broader transfictional universe. In this context, the present article manages to demonstrate a parallelism between the figure of ‘La Torera’ with the artist Frida Kahlo, placing both Latin American women in the performance field as pioneers in their different environments. In this way, Anita Bermeo’s legacy as an artist is finally rescued, taking her character beyond the cliche and social prejudices of that time in Quito-Ecuador, which overshadowed her creation.

AB  - Do children suffer from discriminatory structures in society and how can issues of social injustice against children be conceptualised and studied? The conceptual frame of childism is examined through everyday expressions in the aftermath of policies affecting children in Sweden, the UK and Ireland to develop knowledge of age-based and intersectional discrimination against children. While experiences in Sweden seem to indicate that young children rarely suffer severe symptoms from COVID-19, or constitute a driving force in spreading the virus, policy decisions in the UK and Ireland to close down schools have had detrimental effects on children in terms of child hunger and violence against children. Policy decisions that have prioritised adults at the cost of children have unveiled a structural injustice against children, which is mirrored by individual examples of everyday societal prejudice. © Rebecca Adami and Katy Dineen, 2021

AB  - In this article, I question the production of certain cultural and geographic zones under the new emergency protocols mandated through COVID-19 governance, by drawing upon the theoretical model of Foucault’s ‘perfectly governed city’ (1977, p. 198). I argue that in the first few months of 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response, the rapid absorption of state directives into the home (two-person rule) and the body (social distancing) set a precedent for a new standard of state boundary-crossing that should be monitored by cultural studies academics with prejudice. Using Berger and Luckman, I point to the State’s use of habitualisation through repetition that can be used to monitor and control citizenry at a later time but for different purposes. The purpose of this article is to show that these measures represent a condition of potential COVID-style governance, even after the threat to public health has subsided. In particular, its potentiality lies in the effects of disciplining or training the body (particularly through social distancing practices), routinisation and habitualisation, and the normalisation of bodily surveillance in everyday life. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals are at risk for poorer health outcomes in part because of stigma, discrimination, victimization, and resulting trauma and stress. Stigma-related stress can lead to hypervigilance, or a chronic and pervasive state of alertness and readiness to respond to potential threats in the environment. The current study is one of the first to explore LGBTQ-identified individuals’ lived experiences of hypervigilance. In a brief online format, participants (N = 245) completed demographic items and were asked to describe their experiences of hypervigilance and its impact on their lives. Participants reported over 30 negative emotions that accompanied hypervigilance; anxiety, fear, and exhaustion were the most common. Negative emotional reactions occurred in public and private settings and with family, coworkers, strangers, and others perceived to be prejudiced. Participants self-monitored and socially withdrew in efforts to protect themselves from stress and risk of harm. Service providers and researchers should assess hypervigilance in LGBTQ individuals and examine the impact on health and well-being while working to combat stigma and advocate for protective and equitable social policies. Public Significance Statement—Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals described their lived experience of hypervigilance, a chronic and pervasive stress response to direct and indirect experiences of stigma and discrimination.They were hypervigilant for potential harm as they interacted in public and private and when interacting with certain family members, coworkers, community members, and strangers they perceived to be prejudiced against LGBTQ people. Hypervigilance was often accompanied by negative emotions and social avoidance/isolation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - This research aimed to study how social media has changed the culture of communication in Saudi Arabia. The research surveyed 400 Saudis who use social media in order to discover likely relationships between degree of expression, political consciousness, amount of social media use, apparent attitude climate, government censorship and purposes for using social media. A survey questionnaire was used to answer projected hypotheses and research questions, and the data was analyzed using SPSS software. The results found solid connections between different variances, namely the amount of social media practice, degree of expression liberty, and level of political consciousness. Also, a strong and substantial effect was found on the way that people perceive the opinion climate via social media. Furthermore, entertainment was the primary reason why Saudis use social media that prejudiced their expression freedom, political consciousness and perceived opinion climate. The study is applicable to the youth as well as the adult population in Saudi Arabia in relation to opinion and political conscience. Only a few studies have drawn attention to the link between political conscience and use of social media, and this research focuses on the novelty and genuineness of research by using the population from a Kingdom. © 2021 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - Summary: The Gukurahundi genocide in Zimbabwe claimed more than 20 000 lives in the Matebeleland and Midlands provinces of the country at the hands of the state and its militia for political and tribal reasons. This article seeks to demonstrate how language, through hate speech, naming, symbolisation, dehumanisation, and classification, justified and rationalised Gukurahundi. While the linguistic conventions used by state actors before and during Gukurahundi did not cause genocide, it created two social climates, one that legitimised tribal and political hatred, thus eliminating any social sanctions preventing genocide and the other that unmasked the state-sponsored genocide clothed as a necessary military exercise against dissidents. This article employs Allport's (1954) Scale of Prejudice and Stanton's (2016) eight stages of genocide as a tool of making sense of the social processes that create society's progression from prejudice and discrimination to genocide; how through language conventions, the unthinkable becomes acceptable through the erosion of moral, social, religious and rational boundaries. Linguistic conventions show how power is enacted through discourse, how language acts prepare and maintain the way for physical and material acts, and how the same language conventions generate permissions for Gukurahundi, the Rwanda genocide and the Holocaust, amongst others. To demonstrate the permissibility conditions for non-linguistic behaviours like Gukurahundi, this article addresses the metaphor of Gukurahundi, the dehumanisation of the victims, political and religious constructions and the re-construction of the ‘other’. © 2021 JLS/TLW.

AB  - Since rape myths were codified in 1980 (Burt, 1980), scholars have shown that individuals who endorse rape myths perceive victims as less credible and more responsible for rape and perpetrators as less responsible. Studies also show that rape myths hinder successful adjudication of rape cases by influencing juries’ assessments of perpetrator guilt (Dinos et al., 2015). While most of this research focuses on sexual assaults involving adult victims, some scholars have found that victims as young as 12 are blamed for rape. If rape myths influence the perceptions of sex offenses even when victims are children, then defense attorneys in child sexual abuse (CSA) cases may be motivated to highlight rape myth in CSA trials. In the current study, we conducted a content analysis of the cross-examinations of 122 children, aged 6 to 17, alleging CSA to determine if and how defense attorneys question children about rape myths. We looked for questions about force and resistance, motives to lie, victim precipitation, and character issues (e.g., habitual drug use). We found that defense attorneys commonly referenced rape myths in CSA trials. A total of 10% of all defense attorneys’ lines of questioning referenced a rape myth, and attorneys asked 77% of children at least one rape myth line of questioning. Whether or not attorneys asked about different myths and the content of these questions varied by children’s age. Our findings indicate that defense attorneys use rape myths strategically to undermine children’s credibility in CSA trials, but they adapt (adult) rape myths in ways that are plausible in the CSA context. Policies formed to prevent the prejudicial impact of rape myths at sexual assault trials involving adults (e.g., rape shield laws) may not adequately prevent their impact in CSA trials. Prosecutors, therefore, should address rape myths at CSA trials. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - This comparative statistical analysis is of tolerance and how it was perceived and experienced by minorities and majorities in the UK and Germany before and after two defining national events that both focused on immigration and national identity. Based on combined sweeps of the European Social Survey (2012–2018), this study applied logistic regression modelling to determine that during the Brexit vote in 2016 and the German Refugee Crisis in 2015, majorities from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were more likely to be intolerant towards minorities, who were more likely to experience discrimination. Majority intolerance and minority perceptions of discrimination increased after both events among less well-off groups. However, majorities from higher socioeconomic backgrounds were less likely to exhibit intolerance towards minorities before these national events and after. This study offers an original perspective on race and ethnic relations at times of national crises over identity and belonging. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This article is based on scientific evidence from a national survey carried out in Italy in 2017 on a sample of 4011 students. The results of the statistical analysis show that the potential educational role of sports is not an explicit value embedded in its practice. In these terms, today the causal link between sports and education appears to be a stereotype. The study shows that teenagers who play sports outside of school have an increase in their levels of tolerance of bullying and racism. In addition, respondents who play sports have highly stereotyped opinions about gender roles and ethnic diversity. The neutrality of sports practice in Italy, with regard to social inclusion and the dissemination of positive values, has been demonstrated. Although sport can be a useful educational tool to mitigate limits arising from disadvantaged social conditions, a direct relation between sports and education has not been observed. In order to spread positive social values and promote social inclusion through sport, we hypothesise that it is necessary to overcome two limits: the inequality in sports opportunities among students and the weakness of the relation between sports and pedagogy. This article finally proposes a pedagogical approach aimed at sports teaching oriented towards social inclusion. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The vast literature on negative treatment of outgroups and favoritism toward ingroups provides many local insights but is largely fragmented, lacking an overarching framework that might provide a unified overview and guide conceptual integration. As a result, it remains unclear where different local perspectives conflict, how they may reinforce one another, and where they leave gaps in our knowledge of the phenomena. Our aim is to start constructing a framework to help remedy this situation. We first identify a few key ideas for creating a theoretical roadmap for this complex territory, namely the principles of etiological functionalism and the dual inheritance theory of human evolution. We show how a “molecular” approach to emotions fits into this picture, and use it to illuminate emotions that shape intergroup relations. Finally, we weave the pieces together into the beginnings of a systematic taxonomy of the emotions involved in social interactions, both hostile and friendly. While it is but a start, we have developed the argument in a way that illustrates how the foundational principles of our proposed framework can be extended to accommodate further cases. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Beyond education and contact program components, existing research on how to design a successful adolescent stigma reduction intervention has been inconclusive. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based mental health (MH) stigma reduction and health promotion program, Ending the Silence (ETS), developed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). A diverse sample of 206 high school students in New York City participated in the current study. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial design, 14 ninth–12th grade classes (Grade 9–12) were randomly assigned to the ETS program or an active control presentation on careers in psychology. Students completed 4 surveys throughout the study (pre, immediate post-presentation, 4 weeks post, 8 weeks post). Prospective results (over 2 months) and qualitative feedback were analyzed. Prospectively, mixed effects modeling indicated significant effects in favor of the ETS group for reduced negative stereotypes, improved mental health knowledge, and less anticipated risk for disclosing to a counselor. There were also trends in favor of the ETS group for reductions in intended social distancing and negative affect, and improvements in help-seeking intentions. Other predictors of stigma included mental health knowledge, gender, race/ethnicity, prior contact with mental illness, and grade level. Qualitative feedback indicated positive impressions of ETS overall, but suggestions for more interactive activities and discussion. Relatively brief programs such as ETS appear to be a practical vehicle for stigma reduction. Future research is warranted on longer-term programs and adolescent development variables.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented pressure on governments to engage in widespread cash transfers directly to citizens to help mitigate economic losses. Major and near-universal redistribution efforts have been deployed, but there is remarkably little understanding of where the mass public believes financial support is warranted. Using experimental evidence, we evaluate whether considerations related to deservingness, similarity, and prejudicial attitudes structure support for these transfers. A preregistered experiment found broad, generous, and nondiscriminatory support for direct cash transfers related to COVID-19 in Canada. The second study, accepted as a preregistered report, further probes these dynamics by comparing COVID-19-related outlays with nonemergency ones. We find that COVID-19-related spending was more universal as compared to a more generic cash allocation program. Given that the results were driven by the income of hypothetical recipients, we find broad support for disaster relief that is not means-tested or otherwise constrained by pre-disaster income. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Intellectual Disabilities (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with considerable individual variability in type and severity. Due to overt and covert prejudices around ID, however, society tends to generalize this condition. Also, in schools, teachers’ attitudes toward students with IDs often differ from those toward regular students. The purpose of this study is to examine the levels of overt and covert prejudices toward ID of curricular and support teachers and non-teachers, in a sample of Southern Italian citizens, by evaluating age, gender and socioeconomic differences, as well as the associations of prejudice with education about and contact with ID. Six hundred and sixty-four participants (484 F; 38% teachers), 18–70 years old (M = 38.72; SD = 14.79) participated in the study. The Modern and Classical Prejudices Scale was administered in paper and online forms. Sociodemographic measures, as well as measures around ID education and contact with people with ID were collected. The results show that teachers had higher levels of classical prejudices compared to non-teacher participants. Teachers of primary schools showed higher levels of classical and modern prejudices. No gender and socioeconomic status (SES) differences were found in the whole sample. The entry of children with Intellectual Disabilities into primary school can be strongly influenced by teachers’ prejudices. Therefore, the need for teachers’ information and training on Intellectual Disabilities is evident. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In the past few years, Ecuador has experienced legal changes toward the recognition of sexual minority rights. However, lesbian and gay (LG) individuals and couples still face legal obstacles to become parents and social barriers that place their families in disadvantage compared to their heterosexual counterparts. To date, it is not known whether the legal changes reflect society’s move toward a more progressive and accepting climate. This study analyzed the attitudes toward LG parenting in an Ecuadorian online-recruited sample. Three hundred thirty-eight (338) participants answered an online questionnaire about the negative effects and the benefits of having LG parents. The strongest belief among participants was that children of LG parents would be victimized because of their parents’ sexual orientation. Analyses indicated differences in attitudes based on age, sexual orientation, marital status, education level, as well as religiosity. Finally, regression models suggested that beliefs about the origins of sexual orientation and contact with LG people predicted attitude scores. Implications of these findings are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Does social protest following the police killing of unarmed Black civilians have a widespread "opinion-mobilizing"effect against the police? Or, does the racialized nature of these events polarize mass opinion based on standing racial and political orientations? To answer these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - This study analyzed the characteristics of generation Z leading the trend of the fashion industry through the creative activity of Virgil Abloh. A literature review and case study were conducted together with detailing the research methodology. As a result of research, generation Z is conceptualized as a “digital native” who grows in digital technology environment with excellent visual sense. They are “SNS creators” who have influence on Social Networking Services (SNS). They are also characterized as “social activists” who reject social conventions and prejudices. They are a “leading creators” who seek to differentiate with creativity. The characteristics of generation Z in the creative activities of Virgil Abloh have a feature of digital native in that they seek visual originality. In terms of communicating with generation Z through SNS and influencer marketing, it has the characteristics of SNS creators. It expresses social activists in providing consumers with diversity, and social perceptions of differentiation. In terms of providing content that encourages consumers to express their personality, it has a feature of leading creators. It is meaningful in that it contributes to the understanding of the market change and marketing strategy according to the consumer development and the activity of the fashion designer. © 2021.

AB  - Since 2008, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) has annually allocated ten places for students from indigenous communities in its undergraduate courses, as part of its affirmative action policy. The presence of these subjects, historically absent from the university space, represents an enriching moment for both students and the institution itself, but it also brought with it many challenges. The article analyzes the university experiences of some Kaingang students at UFRGS – an ethnic group that represents 85% of indigenous students entering the institution. More specifically, it examines how they followed the content of their undergraduate courses and how they related to non-indigenous colleagues and teachers. The results show the difficulties in the use, reproduction and appropriation of the academic knowledge faced by the indigenous in the task of becoming university students, as well as the type and quality of relationships established with peers and teachers. We conclude that the learning process of the student’s craft is more arduous and slower for indigenous students, considering: the low expectations of entering higher education; the precarious educational background of these subjects; the lack of intercultural dialogue at the university and the prejudiced and discriminatory situations experienced within the UFRGS. © 2021

AB  - Domestic violence (DV) is a widespread social phenomenon, adversely impacting public mental and physical health. The abatement of such issue necessitates a priori social awareness and a posteriori social support. With that in mind, the present study aimed at disclosing dominant discursive constructions of DV among Iranian Instagram users. Driven by Fairclough’s (1992) notion of “moments of crisis,” critical discourse analysis was employed as the theoretical framework to elucidate the results obtained from 1,028 comments on nine DV-related posts. Our primary objective was to uncover Iranian Instagram commentators’ perception of the causes and consequences of DV as well as the perpetrator and victim’s roles through probing into the embedded social values and assumptions underpinning such discursive constructions represented within comments. Meticulous inspection of the data yielded six major themes, namely, (a) blaming the responsible, (b) offering solutions to the victims, (c) portraying the male perpetrators, (d) overgeneralizing the transgression, (e) disregarding men’s rights, and (f) portraying the female perpetrators. The results indicated that female and male commentators held dissimilar perspectives with regard to DV and that though the conceptualizations of DV were not destitute of prejudice, both perpetrators and victims were encouraged to take requisite steps to minimize the adverse impact of DV on their families and relations as well as on social and public health. The discursive themes identified in the current work may serve as the stepping stone toward the mitigation of DV within society. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - This exploratory pilot study examined perspectives of family members of young adults with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder regarding the experiences, and level of support their child or sibling received, throughout their years in general education, into early adulthood, and their perception as to the young person’s overall current quality of life. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four family members (mainly mothers) of autistic young adults and analysed thematically. Family members were selected to capture more accurately the nature and extent of supports in place in the general education system during the autistic person’s childhood years. Where relevant, perceived challenges pertaining to third-level education were identified including social, residential, and academic supports. The lack of support with transitions from secondary to third-level education and into the workplace was highlighted. Barriers to employment included communication and social interaction difficulties alongside perceived employers’ prejudice. The pilot findings highlight the need for support throughout the general education journey and a continuation of accessible support services beyond the age of eighteen for autistic individuals. The study will be extended to gain the perspective from the young person’s point of view of services and supports in tertiary education and/or employment. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Applying the Resource Model of Political Participation, this study extended the emerging research on trainees’ social justice advocacy (SJA) by examining race and gender variables among 281 counselors-in-training. Although no racial and gender differences were found regarding trainees’ SJA, we found significant race and gender differences in trainees’ awareness of modern racism and sexism. Structural Equation Modeling revealed that exposure to racist and sexist events and participation in formal diversity experiences had significant links to SJA. Specifically, exposure to racist events and participation in formal and informal diversity experiences were negatively associated with color-blind racial attitudes. Exposure to sexist events was negatively linked to modern sexist beliefs. Implications for theory, training, and research are addressed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The study should show how familiar German first year university students are with mental health issues and what their attitudes are regarding mental illness. The study sample consisted of 293 first year German university students (20.37 years ± 1.88), most of them women (82.9%). The majority (77.6%) was studying a social type subject. An additive focus group consisted of four experts. The participants of the quantitative part were recruited at prevention workshops that were offered during the induction week at the beginning of the semester at 15 German universities. Experts of the focus group were recruited by telephone call. In addition to quantitative analysis, we realized a focus group with experts of our target group concerns and university system. For statistical analysis, we used statistic software programme "SPSS"24 to conduct t-tests. We used content-analytical evaluation to build a category system. Every fourth participant reported having had a mental health problem. Male participants had a slightly greater desire for social distance (p=0.008; df=288) and slightly stronger stereotypes (p<0.001; df=289). The present study shows that first year university students in Germany have substantial experience with mental health problems. © 2021 Maria Koschig et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - In Spain, housing is one of the main axes of social inequality. Its position within Spain’s economic model and welfare system is key to understanding why its financialization at the beginning of the 21st century had such different consequences among residents as well as territorially. In this context, from 2001 to 2011, Madrid became one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in Europe. This article delves into how both housing and its location organise inequality in different social spheres and reproduce it over time. To this end, the geography of this inequality is analysed in different social residential trajectories, along with how segregation produces its own dynamics of inequality. The analysis is based on census data and applies a combination of factor and cluster analyses. The results reveal important processes of social residential marginalisation articulated by the interaction between high international immigration and the spatial manifestation of the housing bubble. The main socio-spatial result of this process is the disappearance of mixed social spaces in Madrid, previ-ously located in the centre of the city. This dynamic produces opposite territories in terms of advantage and disadvantage in different spheres linked to social inequality such as education, health, leisure, care and even prejudice. In the process, impoverished immigrants disperse towards the neighbourhoods that concentrate the greatest disadvantages in each of these spheres. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - Despite the enormous rise in the transgender media visibility in recent years, the news media in particular still predominantly exemplify powerful elite transgender people or exclusively quote their cisgender counterparts, leaving out the voices and lived experiences of transgender people who do not fall into the high-power categories. Such power exemplification has become part of the journalism practice when reporting issues regarding marginalized social groups. Little quantitative social scientific research has explored how such journalistic practice might have contributed to the acceptance of or the increased hostility and hate crimes against transgender people. Through integrating the theories of exemplification, attribution, and dehumanization, this study experimentally investigates how the power exemplification of members from marginalized social groups like the transgender community (i.e., High-Power vs. Low-Power Transgender Exemplar) in the news narrative interacts with the cisgender heterosexual audience’s sex to redirect people’s intergroup attitudes, responsibility attribution for transgender social issues, dehumanization, and aggression towards transgender people. The findings demonstrated that after exposure to the news content featuring a high-power transgender woman exemplar, cisgender heterosexual women respondents reported significantly higher levels of dehumanization in regard to transgender people’s human nature. After exposure to the news content with power exemplification (vs. the control condition) regardless of the levels of power depicted, male participants were significantly more likely to attribute transgender issues to external factors. These findings reveal 1) the significant psychological and social impacts of the journalism practice of power exemplification when reporting transgender issues, and 2) how heterosexual cisgender men and women audiences respond to power exemplification of transgender people in the news differently. These findings not only provide social scientific evidence to guide practitioners to navigate the intricate practice of exemplifying the power of transgender people in the news but also fill the gap in the lack of quantitative experimental audience research in transgender media studies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study focuses on the reduction of prejudice toward foreign unaccompanied minors (UAMs) by means of audiovisual testimonial messages. Specifically, it analyzes the role of two narrative elements that can influence, in an indirect way, the intention to share the message, the feelings toward UAMs, the intention to approach UAMs, and the intention to collaborate with an NGO that provides support to immigrants. With this goal in mind, an experimental study (N = 500) was conducted using a 2 × 2 factorial design, where the factors analyzed were similarity in terms of social identity (high vs. low) and narrative voice (first-person vs. third-person). No interaction effects of similarity and narrative voice on identification or transportation were observed. However, multiple serial mediation analyses were statistically significant. A significant indirect effect of similarity on dependent variables was observed through perceived similarity (primary me-diator), identification and transportation (secondary mediators), and counterarguing and reactance (tertiary mediators). Similarly, the narrative voice also had a significant indirect effect on the dependent variables that was explained by the increase in identification and transportation, and by the reduction in counterarguing and reactance. This work improves the understanding of the mechanisms that explain the impact of narratives and demonstrates that certain narrative elements can increase the effectiveness of audiovisual testimonial messages designed for the prevention of racism and xenophobia. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

AB  - The present study explores how identifying with the gender and sexual minority (GSM) community can be an important developmental milestone and potential protective factor for GSM individuals. Cross-sectional data were collected from the United States using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to garner a nationally representative sample of individuals (n = 365) between the ages of 18-29 (M = 25.07 years old) who self-identified as a sexual and/or gender minority. Results of a structural equation model indicated that a higher sense of GSM identity salience was associated with greater attribution of their negative experiences to prejudice, which was associated with decreased well-being. Importantly, identifying with the GSM community was a protective factor for this population. Whereas higher attributions of negative experiences to prejudice were directly associated with decreases in well-being, when explained through group identification, the association was positive. This paper extends current research on the GSM community by situating group identification as a process of one’s overall identity development and exploring the protective factors related to this identification. The study highlights the important ways in which connecting with other gender and sexual minority individuals can protect the individuals in this population from the negative outcomes of prejudice. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the self-efficacy perceptions of Social Studies teachers about the basic skills in the 2018 Social Studies curriculum. In Turkey, according to changes made in the Social Studies curriculum in 2018, Social Studies lessons are given to students in the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th grades, and comprise 27 basic skills, This study investigated the self-efficacy perceptions of 143 Social Studies teachers working in Istanbul province. The study found that the majority of teachers felt themselves to be “inefficient” in the following skills: research, perception of change and continuity, critical thinking, entrepreneurship, legal literacy, collaboration, using evidence, perceiving space, political literacy, drawing and interpreting table, graphics and diagrams, innovative thinking, and perceiving time and chronology. Additionally, it was found that the teachers believed that they were at a “good” or “very good” level of efficacy concerning the following skills: environmental literacy,digital literacy, empathy, financial literacy, observation, map literacy, communication, stereotypical judgment and prejudice, decision making, location analysis, media literacy, self-control, problem solving, social participation, and the correct, beautiful, and effective use of Turkish. This indicates that most Social Studies teachers who participated in the study perceived themselves as being at a positive/efficient level in 16 of the 27 skills. Therefore, the efficacies of Social Studies teachers regarding the basic skills of the 2018 Social Studies curriculum could provide opportunities for these individuals to apply effective strategies, methods, and techniques for their students. © 2021

AB  - Being some major problems of our contemporary world, racism and ethnocentrism demand persistent critical scrutiny. One oft-neglected aspect of these problems is how such prejudices are shared and communicated among the members of the dominant group. This study examines Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Sweat (2015), as a dramatic representation of how racism and ethnocentrism are reproduced and communicated as a social cognition. To this aim, the study tries to employ Teun Adrianus Van Dijk's cognitively-based discourse analysis and focus on some micro-level aspects of racism as a social cognition rather as an abstract historical phenomenon. Contextualizing the play within its socio-historical moment, three trends of schematic attitudes and mental models regarding ethnocentrism_ as Van Dijk's theory outlines_ are identified from and studied in the play. The findings demonstrate the socio-cognitive dimension of the discourse of racism, particularly the way it is reproduced and communicated among the dominant in-group members. Moreover, the discussion offers some insight on Lynn Nottage's latest dramatic endeavor in a hard-hitting portrayal of the intersections of race, class, and political economy and in drawing attention to the real meaning of diversity and inclusion in contemporary America. © 2021 American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a source of anxiety globally, and lockdowns have increased anxiety symptoms, contributed to economic stress, and influenced an increase in prejudice, particularly prejudice directed at the elderly and people with disabilities. Terror management theory serves as an explanation for the association between COVID-19 anxiety, ageism, and ableism. Recruiting participants from Amazon MTurk, I assessed anxiety about COVID-19, ageism, and ableism. Hierarchical linear regression analyses demonstrate that COVID-19 anxiety is significantly associated with ageism, and with ableism, as well as age and gender. The results of this study have implications for the effect of COVID-19 anxiety on those who are most vulnerable in the current pandemic, particularly with regards to isolation and social connection; those who are most anxious about the pandemic might spend less time trying to connect with their older friends and relatives, and likewise for the people in their lives who might have a disability. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This paper investigates the prevalence of native-speakerism, as defined by Holliday (2005), in the recruitment practices of three English language schools in Saudi Arabia. Three directors of three different English language schools were interviewed to investigate their perceptions of the ‘native vs. non-native’ dichotomy. Due to the small number of participants, this paper does not intend to draw general conclusions that represent the overall view of all Saudi English language schools’ directors on the topic. Instead, it draws on Malterud et al.’s concept of information power (2016) and argues that a small sample can actually produce more detailed information than a larger one. The findings show that the participants consider anyone who was born in a country such as the USA, the UK, Australia or New Zealand, holds the nationality of that country and speaks a particular variety of English to be a ‘native speaker’. The study concludes that, in the Saudi context, native-speakerism is not racially or ethnically motivated as many studies on native-speakerism have suggested. Rather, the teachers’ nationality, accent and place of birth are the core aspects that define ‘native speaker’ teachers. Therefore, native-speakerism may not only discriminate against ‘non-native speaker’ teachers, but could also create divisions amongst ‘native speakers’ themselves based on their variety of English and place of birth. © 2021, TESOL International Journal.

AB  - The themes of quest for racial identity in Nella Larsen's Quicksand and the protagonist's struggle with dual identity are the most commonly discussed topics in countless critical articles over the past twenty years. However, Larsen's portrayal of Helga Crane's struggle to find an identity as a woman of mixed race serves to demonstrate that her issue is mainly with how society is essentialist. The primary goal of Quicksand is to demonstrate the fluidity of identity. With the challenges that the protagonist faces in the story, Larsen vividly demonstrated that identity is relentlessly changing. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that the reductionist nature of different forms of essentialism causes many people continuous suffering. In other words, Larsen deploys the mulatto figure as a useful critical tool to explore how society is immersed in essentializing categories of race, class, gender and sexuality. © 2021 American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - An influential body of research on American public opinion since the mid-1980s has found economic self-interest to be, at best, inconsistently and weakly related to social and political attitude formation. This article argues that this conclusion is related to a dearth of analysis of the potential effect of economic insecurity on American public opinion. It is argued that respondents’ perceptions of their own economic insecurity capture the extent to which not acting self-interestedly can result in hardship-causing economic loss. Empirically, it is shown—through standard regression techniques and more stringent coarsened exact matching (CEM)—that economic insecurity has a systematic and strong effect on the redistributive, class, and racial attitudes of Americans; an effect that often rivals or supersedes the effect of sociotropic and symbolic attitudes. It is also shown that affective economic insecurity—one’s worry or anxiety regarding the potential of future economic hardship—and cognitive economic insecurity—an individual’s more or less dispassionate estimate of future economic hardship—often have distinct and complementary effects in determining public opinion, even when both measures are included in the same model. The evidence presented here makes it clear that existing measures and conceptualizations of economic self-interest—and the body of empirical work that discounts economic factors in American public opinion—need to be rethought in light of economic insecurity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Social media has a role to play in shaping the dynamic relations between immigrants and citizens. This study examines the effects of threat perceptions, consumptive and expressive use of social media, and political trust on attitudes against immigrants in Singapore. Study 1, based on a survey analysis (N = 310), suggests that symbolic but not realistic threat perception, is positively associated with anti-immigrant attitudes. The consumptive use of social media and political trust is negatively related to anti-immigrant attitudes. Moderation analyses suggest that consumptive social media use has negative consequences for individuals with increased symbolic threat perception and high political trust. But is there a correspondence between consumptive and expressive use of social media in terms of predicting prejudicial attitudes? Study 2 benchmarks the survey findings against participants’ opinion expression via Facebook posts (N = 146,332) discussing immigrants. Automated linguistic analyses reveal that self-reported survey measures correlate with the expressive use of social media for discussing immigrants. Higher anti-immigrant attitudes are associated with higher negative sentiment, anger, and swear words in discussing immigrants. The findings highlight the need to pay attention to the combined influence of social media use and individual political beliefs when analyzing intergroup relations. © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2021.

AB  - This article contributes to the growing literature concerning Disability Hate Studies. The study employs the concept of intersectionality and examines experiences of hate crimes recorded as racist or homophobic but where the victims/survivors also have a disability or mental health condition. The data was derived from 33 case-studies. Although very few hate incidents/crimes were conceptualised as disablist, disability played a significant role in the experiences of victims/survivors. The article proposes that criminal justice agencies should move away from understanding hate crime as a singular interaction to conceptualising the possibility that this can become a harmful hate relationship that progresses overtime. Points of interest The study examines cases of hate incidents/crimes that affect disabled people within the North-East of England. The research suggests that hate incidents/crimes are not always motivated by prejudices towards disability, but are often due to racist or homophobic bigotries. The findings demonstrate that the process of defining a particular type of hate as either racist-, homophobic- or transphobic-motivated crime often masks the fact that many of these victims are also disabled people. The study indicates that hate crimes are often not a one-off event, but can be the accumulation of many hate incidents that result in cumulative negative impacts and can escalate into more severe offences over a prolonged period. The article concludes by suggesting that to develop an effective hate crime intervention, social services and criminal justice agencies must consider the possibility of a power relationship, i.e. a hate relationship, between the perpetrator(s) and the victim(s). © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article analyses how British popular music culture defined and responded to Krautrock, a subgenre of West German underground rock, during the 1970s. It examines and contextualises British and West German interactions in popular music immediately before Krautrock and at the time of its early definition. The article then explores how so-called Krautrock bands related to the British public and press and how they were described and understood in relation to their nationality. The article suggests that stereotypes and prejudices, shaped by the memory of World War 2, remained a significant aspect of British discourse on West Germany into the 1970s. However, interest in Krautrock gave rise to social and cultural interactions that inspired some to challenge and renegotiate ideas of Germany and Germanness. To some, bonds made through music, culture and politics proved more profound than the history of conflict between Britain and Germany. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Education plays an important role in bridging divisions and promoting positive intergroup relations. A number of initiatives aimed at improving relations in conflict-affected societies have been based on the contact hypothesis. However, very little attention has been devoted to the potential of such interventions to reduce social distance between groups. Moreover, the voices of the young people involved in such programmes have rarely been taken into consideration. This paper tries to address these gaps using a qualitative methodology. It presents the views and experiences of post-primary pupils involved in planned educational contact encounters in two countries that have experienced interethnic violence: Northern Ireland and the Republic of North Macedonia. The findings suggest that planned contact can be effective in reducing social distance. However the programmes need to provide opportunities for more frequent meetings, more personalized communication between pupils, and the sensitive exploration of contentious issues to ensure long-lasting changes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Minority stress is a cause of health challenges for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth experiencing homelessness. However, in over-focusing on family rejection, the research on LGBTQ youth homelessness often misses how minority stress itself can shape the youth’s perceived pathways into and experiences of homelessness. A main objective of this study, then, foregrounds minority stress in understanding LGBTQ youth homelessness. To achieve this objective, the author conducted ethnographic fieldwork in central Texas and interviewed 40 LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. The author shows how experiencing intersecting minority stressors, especially within families and youth-serving institutions, is part of the perceived pathways into homelessness. The author also documents how experiencing homelessness in conjunction with experiencing anti-LGBTQ perceived discrimination, violence, and other minority stressors such as racism impact the youth’s mental health challenges while living on the streets. A second objective of this study, then, shows how anti-LGBTQ discrimination intersects with other forms of prejudice and discrimination to shape the youth’s stressors and pathways into and experiences of homelessness. The author concludes that intersecting minority stressors shape perceived pathways into homelessness and compound with the socially stressful experiences of homelessness, but social support, especially LGBTQ-specific support, can help ameliorate these challenges. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Self- compassion means that individual’s trying to understand oneself without prejudice, and being sensitive and kind instead of being judgemental and critical. The aim of this study was to examine the mediating role of self-compassion in the relationship between perceived parental acceptance and psychological resilience in emerging adults. The study also examined whether gender differ in terms of the variables of parental acceptance, self-compassion and psychological resilience. The study group consisted of 545 university students who were studying in a state university and who were reached with stratified sampling method. The Adult Parental Acceptance-Rejection Scale, the Self-Compassion Scale and the Ego-Resilience Scale were used. Correlation analysis, path analysis, Multivariate Hotelling T2 test were applied in the analysis of data. As a result of the study, self-compassion was found to have “full mediating” role in the relationship of perceived maternal acceptance and paternal acceptance with psychological resilience. In addition, perceived parental acceptance and psychological resilience were found to show significant differences in terms of gender. Warmth and acceptance centred parent-child relationship can be considered as a protective factor that can increase the ability to overcome challenging life events by supporting the development of self-compassion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - If extraneous information leads listeners to biased judgements, then their speech perceptions are likely to manifest distortion in that direction. This phenomenon is known as reverse linguistic stereotyping (RLS), which has been confirmed by 25 years of empirical study. Recent research on effects of listener background on ratings of speaker pronunciation and social judgments are likewise consistent with the concept of reverse linguistic stereotyping. In particular, one way of operationalising listener aberration is measuring a function of listener backgrounds and proclivity toward RLS along with a dimension of speaker social attractiveness, superiority, and dynamism. The current study examined to what extent listeners’ background characteristics and RLS propensity factors affect their social judgements of second language (L2) accented speech. The background factors included learners’ accent exposure, study abroad experience, the degree of foreign language study experience, and three RLS dimensions. Results suggest that listeners who hold negatively stereotyped expectations about LX accents tend to find accented speech less superior and less socially attractive. Findings offer implications to language education and various workforce-related communication in global contexts. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: This study sheds light on a hitherto understudied group in family business literature: widows. We explore the roles a widow may take following the unexpected death of her owner-manager spouse when she had no salient role in the business prior to the death. Design/methodology/approach: We used a qualitative approach to research, to study inductively the roles considered and taken by three widows who unexpectedly succeeded as owners of Swedish privately held family firms. We conducted semi-structured interviews with widows and children in top management. Findings: We construct a typology of four main roles a widow can take and analyse the underlying dimensions that they represent. We also analyse to which extent the choice of role widow can be explained by psychological ownership and double-loss theory. The typology can be used as a tool for family business owners and their advisors as the basis of an open and non-prejudiced discussion of the choices available to a widow. Originality/value: We have investigated the factors that influence a widow's decision whether to take over the business or not, as suggested in previous research by, for example, Martinez et al. (2009). We explore the roles a widow can consider and adopt. The study advances our understanding of how businesses can remain as family firms also in the event of the unexpected death of an owner-manager (De Massis et al., 2008). We hereby contribute to the literature on sudden successions and on women in family businesses. © 2021, Hanna Almlöf and Hans Sjögren.

AB  - Professional athletes in the United States have protested racism in various ways for decades. Kneeling during the national anthem became a prominent form of such activism, ever since American football player Colin Kaepernick popularized the practice in 2016. “Anthem protests” gained renewed attention after the police killing of George Floyd and nationwide unrest in the summer of 2020. This article explores whether public approval of those protests was weaker than scholars and journalists suggested, because survey respondents were reluctant to admit that they considered the protesters disrespectful. A list experiment confirms hidden opposition to anthem protests, especially among people of color, who may feel heightened pressure to support racialized protesters. A second experiment reveals that social desirability bias persists even after respondents hear reassurance that nobody will judge their views. These findings indicate that mainstream surveys misrepresent attitudes toward contemporary racial issues, and that anthem protests have yet to gain wide acceptance in the general U.S. population. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This paper illustrates the influence of a new national assignment system (NSAS) on Chilean middle-class advantage. This system was designed to increase educational equity by changing the previous school admission “rules” that were prejudicial against low-income students. We use Bourdieu’s conceptual tools, drawing on concepts of capitals and field, to analyse the influence of the new rules of the game on the value of middle-class capitals. To understand how the new rules shape middle-class families’ advantages, we link qualitative and quantitative analyses that empirically explore how families subjectively interpret the policy change and how objectively it shapes their access to desired schools. The qualitative phase shows that middle-class parents experience the NSAS as a risky new scenario. However, quantitative analysis shows the NSAS is associated with only a modest decrease in middle class-advantages. We illustrate the difficulty of transforming marketized educational systems, where previously privileged families react against equity-driven changes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Constitution protects parents’ rights to make decisions regarding the raising of their children independent of state interference.1 Because this right is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment—which applies to “any person within [a State’s] jurisdiction”2—it shields both citizen and noncitizen parents. Despite this inalienable right, however, the law has overlooked undocumented parents, and as a result, noncitizens are having their children ripped from them—and their parental rights terminated3—at alarming rates.4 And even though there is little information available regarding the frequency of these types of cases, experts “fear that the published instances [of separation] are merely the tip of the iceberg.”5 Although the reasons for the inequitable handling of citizen versus noncitizen parental rights cases are many and varied, this Note argues that two causes prevail over the others. First, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA) throws hurdles in the way of undocumented parents that are nearly impossible to overcome amid detainment and deportation proceedings.6 And second, even if these parents could meet the standards required by ASFA, courts’ flawed application of settled law related to the termination of parental rights (TPR) makes losing custody of their children almost an inevitability for undocumented parents.7 In response, I propose policy and legislative changes at the federal, state, and local levels that will help rectify this blatant flaunting of constitutional doctrine—particularly addressing judicial cultural bias, which contributes heavily to this issue. © 2021, School of Law Publications.

AB  - The issue of otherness in the social construction of ethnicities and rural multiculturalism has long attracted the attention of scholars. By following a postcolonial background, this paper investigates the social construction of Roma as ‘other’ in a multicultural landscape (the Romania-Serbia border) using interviews with participants of different ethnic groups. This paper addresses the following questions: (i) Is the Roma population in this area completely spatially segregated? (ii) How do different kinds of prejudice against Roma operate within this multicultural context? (iii) How does discrimination against the Roma interface with power relations, in particular political power in the area? The findings indicate that, alongside ethno-nationalist racism, Roma face prejudice from apparently more ‘progressive’ groups, who accept multiculturalism, yet blame the Roma for their own disadvantaged social and economic position on the grounds of a failure to integrate that is pictured as ‘backward’. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Despite significant research into the education of autistic children and young people (CYP) and an increased awareness of the employment needs and rights of autistic adults, little attention has been paid to autistic teachers. We discuss findings drawn from an online survey in the UK in which autistic teachers and other autistic education staff (n = 149) describe the lack of understanding, sensory impacts, mental health issues and the complexities associated with revealing an autism diagnosis as a result of their work. These issues can represent significant impediments to either entering or remaining in the school education profession. Positive experiences were also found and, from a social justice perspective, the possibilities of autistic school staff to constitute a role model for autistic CYP and to facilitate their educational inclusion are considered. Future directions in this under-researched area are also discussed.Points of interest There is a lack of research into autistic teachers and other autistic school staff. Autistic school staff experience many difficulties in training, recruitment, job satisfaction and career development. Participants in our survey wrote that they lack support. They also find the physical environment of schools difficult and can experience mental health issues and prejudice. Some participants feared sharing the fact that they were autistic at work, but others had positive experiences of doing so. In the right circumstances, autistic staff in schools can make an important contribution to educational inclusion, particularly of autistic pupils. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Vicariously experiencing sporting events is a worldwide phenomenon, and sports results affect fans’ emotional states. The current studies examined how sports results affect spectators’ political and intergroup attitudes. “Strategic” perspectives on social attitudes suggest that spectators may have higher ingroup preference and less egalitarian attitudes after seeing their team win than after seeing them lose. Two quasi-experimental studies examined people’s attitudes immediately after real sporting events. Study 1 surveyed 589 participants from the United Kingdom immediately following games during the Euro 2016 soccer tournament. Study 2 surveyed 648 fans before and after four college-level American football games in the USA. We found suggestive evidence that vicarious winners perceived their ingroup more favorably and were less financially egalitarian than vicarious losers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: To compare social characteristics, risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted infections among travestis and transsexual women. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out in three cities in Goiás, Central Brazil. Trans women were interviewed on sociodemographic characteristics, discrimination, prejudice, sexual behavior, illicit drugs, and previous testing for HIV and syphilis between April 2018 and August 2019. Results: A total of 166 travestis and 249 transsexual women were investigated. Although sexual, physical, and verbal violence were common to both groups, sexual behavior, use of illicit drugs, prison, and previous positive HIV and syphilis testing were more frequent among travestis than in transsexual women. Conclusion: The present findings confirm that Brazilian travestis are at greater risk for sexually transmitted infections (STI), indicating that health services should take this imbalance into account in terms of health intervention proportions. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Saúde Coletiva.

AB  - Triage for intensive care unit admission is a frequent event and is associated to worse clinical outcomes. The process of triage is variable and may be influenced by biases and prejudices, which could lead to potentially unfair decisions. The Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine (Conselho Federal de Medicina) has recently released a guideline for intensive care unit admission and discharge. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the ethical dilemmas related to the implementation of this guideline, through the accountability for reasonabless approach, known as A4R, as elaborated by Norman Daniels. We conclude that the guideline contemplates A4R conditions, but we observe that there is a need for indication of A4R-concordant criteria to operationalize the guidelines. © 2021 Associacao de Medicina Intensiva Brasileira - AMIB.

AB  - Mental and physical health are strongly linked in a bidirectional relationship. Due to the stigma, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and many other reasons, there exists a large universal treatment gap for people with mental disorders. This could motivate those at-risk individuals to find their way into social networks, asking for information or emotional support. Language could provide a natural eyepiece for the study and detection of such at-risk individuals through their writings on social media platforms. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting at-risk users with clear signs of depression, anorexia, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. We introduce NCNL, a novel deep learning ensemble architecture that makes use of multiple noisy base learners in Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) configuration for text classification. NCNL is designed to be, backbone-independent, and we examine it with modern Transformer-based architectures. We evaluate our models on six different tasks for at-risk user detection and classification. Our models achieve significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art results reported for five out of the six tasks. Extensive experiments show how NCNL improves diversity over the classical conventional ensemble and the effect of using noisy base learners. IEEE

AB  - As COVID-19 is killing untold numbers of older adults around the world, it is important to reflect on the loss of this generation. Approximately eight in 10 deaths were in people aged ≥65 years. This is a devastating loss to our society—losses that will last long after the pandemic has run its course. Lockdowns and visitor restrictions that were meant to protect older adults created an isolation that often led to declining health. Ageist stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination are internalized by older adults as they face being devalued and viewed as a burden. Reflecting on what has been lost with the deaths of so many from this older generation can spur us to think about how society failed to protect them and to find ways to move beyond the stigma attached to being old. We have much to learn from this generation. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, 59(4), 9-12.]. © SLACK INCORPORATED.

AB  - The research presented here examined the relationship between the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social group identity, intergroup contact, and prejudice. Utilizing a common ingroup identity approach, two datasets, which were composed of data from university students collected via online questionnaires before and after the onset of COVID-19, were combined (N = 511). Participants identified as either one of two subordinate student identities: domestic (i.e. U.S. citizen or permanent resident) or international (i.e. non-U.S. citizen or foreign resident), then reported on the strength of their subordinate and superordinate identity (university identity). Participants also reported on their contact experiences with outgroup members, outgroup stereotypes, and completed a novel intergroup bias task. Results indicated that after the onset of the pandemic, participants more strongly identified with the superordinate group, which predicted greater perceived intergroup contact and lower intergroup bias. Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Objectives. Studies carried out so far have shown that negative stereotypes concerning people with gambling disorders and, in particular, the belief that these people bear personal responsibility for their illness, can significantly contribute to the stigmatization of these people. Shame and fear of stigmatization significantly hinder the decision to start treatment. This study investigates the beliefs of respondents about the impact of stigmatization of people with gambling disorders on the social perception of treatment of gambling disorders and the beliefs of respondents about the impact of stigmatization on undertaking treatment or seeking help. Furthermore, the study investigates whether treatment can help reduce stigma and whether professionals, in some way, take this problem into account in their practice. Material and methods. In the first half of 2015, 90 semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with people with gambling disorders, social workers, therapists employed in addiction treatment facilities, general practitioners and psychiatrists. Results. The public reaction to the fact of starting treatment depends on how gambling disorder is perceived: in terms of a medical problem or rather in moral terms. Positive reviews were mainly manifested by significant others who, according to Goffman’s terminology, are ‘wise’. Very often, treatment means having to reveal your problem and face stigmatization. Women in particular are stigmatized because of gambling disorders. This study showed that treatment allows to get rid of guilt by acquiring knowledge on the subject of gambling disorders. Conclusions. Addressing stigma during early stages of treatment may contribute to the continuity of treatment. Professionals should be aware of their prejudices, as their stigmatizing attitudes can influence treatment outcomes. © 2021 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Conducting contemporary art lessons with a traditional art history view and a chronological approach leads to misinterpretations-and even to prejudices-of contemporary art as it is not progressing chronologically, cannot be assessed within specific stylistic forms and defined with strict lines, unlike previous traditional art disciplines. Based upon this problem, in this study, a new course process was planned in which contemporary art pieces are compared to traditional pieces focusing on the five major themes contemporary art differs from traditional art. Within the scope of this research dealing with this process, answers have been sought to the questions how comparative art history education through themes influences the perception of art, professional, personal, social progress of pre-service teachers and what sort of changes this method creates. Methodology: Research findings designed as action research were obtained by reviewing activity forms prepared for the lesson and semi-structured focus group interview. Gathered data were interpreted by the descriptive analysis method. Findings: The findings obtained in this study suggest that this method helps pre-service teachers define art with a broader perspective, better understand and embrace contemporary art, develop awareness about social issues conveyed through contemporary pieces, explore different expression possibilities for art practices and to form new opinions about art education in a professional sense. Implications for Research and Practice: Pre-service teachers expressed positive views for the comparison technique and providing an environment for expressing oneself freely. Within this context, it is suggested to design discussion-based art history lesson plans around specific themes. © 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare social characteristics, risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted infections among travestis and transsexual women. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was carried out in three cities in Goiás, Central Brazil. Trans women were interviewed on sociodemographic characteristics, discrimination, prejudice, sexual behavior, illicit drugs, and previous testing for HIV and syphilis between April 2018 and August 2019. RESULTS: A total of 166 travestis and 249 transsexual women were investigated. Although sexual, physical, and verbal violence were common to both groups, sexual behavior, use of illicit drugs, prison, and previous positive HIV and syphilis testing were more frequent among travestis than in transsexual women. CONCLUSION: The present findings confirm that Brazilian travestis are at greater risk for sexually transmitted infections (STI), indicating that health services should take this imbalance into account in terms of health intervention proportions.

AB  - Age, aging, and age stereotypes are subjects examined by different disciplines, and these phenomena have also been the subject of consumer behavior as they affect attitudes, behavior, and perceptions. Meanwhile, the negative stereotype of aging leads to the denial of aging and changes in the definitions related to age. The denial of aging and the new age types, which are generally defined as younger than the chronological age, are naturally a reflection of the perception that people can “stay young,” and this mood can affect consumption patterns. Although the information that gives rise to these predictions is included in the literature, the concept of staying young has not been examined in detail, and its relation with consumption has not been discussed. The aim of this study is to fill this gap and define the “Staying Young Phenomenon” (SYP) and explain its relationship with consumption through the Consuming to Demonstrate Agelessness (CDA) concept which is also described in this work. For this purpose, two complementary studies were conducted. Using the data obtained from the qualitative research that constituted the first study, quantitative research was conducted and the dimensions of the SYP and CDA were defined. According to these findings, SYP is defined by the “Effort to Look Young,”, “Having Expectations From Life,” “Commitment to Life,” “Avoiding Death,” “Being Positive and Energetic,” and “Glorifying Youth” factors whereas CDA is defined by “Unlimited and Unconscious Spending,” “Personal Development and Personal Care Expenditures,” “Personal Appearance Expenditures,” and “No Regrets Spending” factors. Results of the analysis reveal a significant relationship between SYP and CDA and suggest that the effect of SYP on consumption may be higher than the effects of different age types and social status. The results obtained regarding SYP, CDA, and their relation are discussed in detail in relation to the concepts of age and aging, and suggestions for future studies are presented. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, social dominance orientation (SDO) was examined in relation to ethnocentric bias while ingroup identification and group status were tested as moderator variables. With a survey research design, data were collected via standardised psychological scales from a sample of 1050 participants drawn from majority and minority ethnic groups using a multistage sampling procedure. Findings showed that SDO was a significant positive predictor of ethnocentric bias. In addition, the predictive strength of SDO on ethnocentric bias was stronger for majority ethnic group. Also a preference for social hierarchy was associated with less devotion to one’s ingroup. Results further showed ingroup identification to be a moderator of the relationship between SDO and ethnocentric bias such that it reduces the strength of the relationship between the two variables. Likewise, ingroup identification was directly related to higher pro-ingroup and lower anti-outgroup attitudes. Going by the findings of this study, SDO proves to be a significant variable that consistently influences social/political attitudes. Equally, ingroup identification shows potential as a useful tool in brokering peaceful relations within a multi-ethnic setting in which interacting groups are competitive but interdependent. Findings were discussed within the tenets of extant literature and the social context of the study. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper uses ethnography and interviews with 15 participants who were actively involved in the campaign following the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire to address the question of how campaigners use street mobilization to seek justice in the aftermath of a disaster. Analysis of observations and themes suggests that campaigners used street mobilization to do two things. First, they used it to build solidarity with supporters through accessibility, the use of shared social spaces and collectively showing respect for losses. Second, they used it to protest in a way that challenged negative stereotypes and projected their power to the authorities, who could not ignore such a large and dignified mobilization. Whereas previous social psychology research on disaster communities focuses on the determinants of the immediate responses of people who experienced a disaster, we show the strategic aspects of such disaster communities.

AB  - Featuring an online experiment and content analysis of a research sample of 185 participants with different races/ethnicities, this study investigates how bridging and bonding capital online and offline (a) encourage targets of racial discrimination to seek support, (b) buffer targets’ emotional distress, and (c) facilitate assertive coping behaviors. Hierarchical regressions indicate individuals bridging with a wider range of interpersonal networks offline are more likely to seek support than those with fewer bridging ties. Online bonding helps buffer emotional distress when targets perceive the prejudiced acts encountered as less severe. Maintaining connections with diverse people offline also helps targets cope with racial discrimination assertively when the supportive messages received fail to fully validate their feelings. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - What mitigates prejudice against migrants in situations of uncertainty? Addressing this question, we explored how individuals with greater COVID-19 concern perceive migrants as a greater threat and show prejudice against them, indirectly through the mechanism of need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations. This study was conducted in two European countries: Malta and Italy. Six hundred and seventy-six individuals participated in this quantitative study (Malta: N = 204; Italy N = 472). Results from this study showed that the need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations mediate the relationship between COVID-19 concern and prejudice against migrants in both countries. When testing the three binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity), the authority foundation seems to be the most consistent predictor. The implications of the findings contribute to theories about how situational uncertainty caused by COVID-19, together with the need for epistemic certainty and binding morality, contribute to increased prejudiced attitudes against migrants. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Assimilation and integration processes have been studied widely and for many years, mainly by looking at the attitudes and practices of people with migration background. This article focusses on the mirror group: the people without migration background. Based on a literature review we propose a new model, the Diversity Attitudes and Practices Impact (DAPI) scales, to assess the impact they have on inclusion and exclusion in ethnically diverse contexts. We test the model using new data on Rotterdam, a superdiverse majority minority city with a large share of voters for anti-immigrant parties. Though the attention, both in research and in the public debate, is focussed on the rise of anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe and the United States, the outcomes of our DAPI-scales model demonstrate that, counter to what is expected, the most probable trend in Rotterdam is towards more socio-economic inclusion and more openness to cultural diversity. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore antecedents of empathic responding in the context of anti-discrimination public service announcement (PSA) reception. We sought to qualitatively examine which contextual antecedents are likely to play a role in facilitating the perspective taking and emotion sharing processes. Recruitment through the local university’s mailing list and an online clas-sified advertising service yielded 61 participants: 18 men and 43 women. Semi-structured focus group interviews lasted from 40 minutes to two hours. The recordings were transcribed and analyzed using NVivo. We used a mixed approach to coding and analyzed the interviews using the process of thematic analysis. The analyses revealed that certain facial expressions of emotion, two types of perceived similarity and a focus on common humanity play an important role in triggering empathic responses in this type of context. While it is necessary to promote diversity, these findings indicate that future interventions should focus on emphasizing a common humanity between the groups and that the accentuation of differences should also be accompanied by a focus on simi-larities. The results of the current study can be used to build more appropriate and efficient inter-vention strategies that aim to foster empathy for discriminated and marginalized groups. © 2021, Canadian Ethnic Studies Association.

AB  - Drawing on studies showing that arguments about the nature of intergroup prejudice allow members of privileged groups to ‘perform’ a positive social identity, the present study explores how arguments about the nature of prejudice are produced by targets of prejudice in order to consolidate or challenge their own social identity. We conducted interviews with Bulgarian Roma and, based on a discursive psychology approach, analysed the way participants contested being assigned to a Roma-exclusive identity category, which they treated as produced by prejudiced beliefs of the non-Roma high-status majority population. Positive intergroup contact was used to demonstrate the absence of prejudice and counter Roma identity threat. Auto-stereotyping and disidentification, in turn, revealed how one's own situation is distinguished from the group. We discuss how identity performances founded on prejudice constructions work to maintain or challenge intergroup boundaries. We conclude that studies revealing prejudice constructions of minority groups can explain the sedative effect of positive intergroup contact on ethnic activism and help to reflect on integration strategies that would be compatible with social change in favour of disadvantaged minority groups. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Much research suggests mental health diagnoses elicit stigmatization of individuals. The current study builds upon this literature at the intersection of same- and cross-race perceptions. Black and White participants viewed Black and White targets paired with either a mental health diagnosis (e.g., depression), a physical health diagnosis (e.g., high blood pressure), or no health information (control) while indicating each target’s favorability and how much social distance they would want from them. Overall, people were more stigmatizing toward targets with a mental health diagnosis than a physical health diagnosis or no diagnosis. Black targets with a mental health diagnosis were stigmatized more than White targets with a mental health diagnosis and White participants displayed a greater aversion to Black targets with a mental health diagnosis than did Black participants. Results contribute to the mental health stigma literature and suggest it may be particularly problematic for White perceivers’ attitudes toward Black individuals with mental health diagnoses. Findings may shed light on the racial differences in treatment-seeking amongst Black and White individuals. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have suffered violence and extreme prejudice in every walk of life as a result of the European colonisation of Australia. We acknowledge the ongoing colonial legacy to this suffering and discuss how cultural safety is a solution to overcoming some elements of the disadvantages that still beset Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in terms of accessing health care. Accessible and culturally safe health services are critical in reducing health inequalities for First Nations' people because of the burden of ill-health they experience. 'Cultural safety' in this context refers to approaches that strengthen and respectfully engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures in mainstream services. Alongside holistic Indigenous health and primary prevention approaches, a broad range of medical, socio-cultural and allied health support is needed to alleviate these inequalities. In this article, we describe how the working relationship between Aboriginal Hospital Liaison Officers and Social Workers in public hospitals in Victoria, Australia, contributes to cultural safety, and thereby improves the quality of care and a reduction in discharges against medical advice by Aboriginal patients. We conclude that elements of this model may be applicable to improving care for First Nation peoples in other countries. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The efforts of peace-building and reconciliation between historical enemies are faced with many structural and psychological obstacles. Scholars have identified mechanisms that can induce improvements in psychological aspects of intergroup relations, such as intergroup contact. However, establishing direct contact with everyone is impossible. Therefore, the mass media represents an important source through which groups learn about each other. Numerous studies have shown that stereotypical and often negative portrayals of specific social groups through the media produce or reinforce negative intergroup outcomes. In this research, the authors report results from an experimental study conducted in a post-conflict society of Bosnia and Herzegovina (N = 119). It examined the effects of stereotypical and counter-stereotypical representations of former enemy groups (Bosniaks) through the media on intergroup behavior (reported by Bosnian Serbs). More specifically, in this research the authors explored the effects of representing out-group individuals as immoral (the stereotypical condition) and moral (the counter-stereotypical condition) on specific behavioral tendencies toward the historical enemy group. The results indicate that exposure to primarily moral information about the out-group target facilitated important positive intergroup outcomes. This study extends the literature and research on moral exemplars by demonstrating the effects on relevant intergroup outcomes whilst utilizing current (vs. historical) moral exemplar stories. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The federal elections were held in Brazil in 2018. The ballot resulted in a victory for the far-right candidate, Jair Messias Bolsonaro. The question that arose after the victory of the far-right was: How could this have happened? One of the instruments that undoubtedly contributed to this unexpected victory was a peculiar aspect of his political campaign: memetic communication. Through the use of memes in the social media (above all WhatsApp), Bolsonaro’s project transformed these violent discourses against political opponents, feminism, racialised persons and poverty into a series of discourses legitimised through humour and irony. It was a simplification through the memes affecting the static system of cognitive and metaphorical frameworks. During the pre-election period in 2018, we carried out digital ethnographic research in the WhatsApp groups of supporters of Bolsonaro’s project (“Bolsonarism”). In this period, we collected a sample of 132 memes belonging to WhatsApp groups composed of up to 256 members, who did not know each other and were geographically dispersed. The analysis we carried out demonstrates the trivialisation and legitimisation of violence against political opponents and other social groups. Much of this legitimisation was camouflaged under the mask of supposed humour and irony, which in reality was insulting, prejudicial and dehumanising. © 2021 Communication & Society.

AB  - Can attitudes towards minorities, an important cultural trait, be changed? We show that the presence of African American soldiers in the UK during World War II reduced anti-minority prejudice, a result of the positive interactions which took place between soldiers and the local population. The change has been persistent: in locations in which more African American soldiers were posted there are fewer members of and voters for the UK's leading far-right party, less implicit bias against blacks and fewer individuals professing racial prejudice, all measured around 2010. Our results point towards intergenerational transmission from parents to children as the most likely explanation. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Desecration of national symbols is a recurring societal phenomenon that can lead to highly defensive reactions from some citizens, especially on the part of those expressing a strong attachment to the nation. In this paper, we investigated the effects of blind and constructive patriotism when faced with an ingroup (vs. outgroup) national flag burning on ingroup bias, taking into consideration the mediating role of perceived threat. In two studies (N = 252), the level of blind patriotism predicted stronger ingroup bias—due to more negative evaluation of visible minorities and/or more positive evaluation of the ingroup—when another ingroup member burnt an ingroup (vs. outgroup) flag. This effect was partly mediated by a greater threat to the group’s image perceived by blindly patriotic people when the ingroup (vs. outgroup) flag was burnt (Study 2). Study 2 also highlighted a main effect of the symbol: ingroup bias was stronger when the ingroup (vs. outgroup) flag was burnt. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to the role played by modes of national attachment and the consequences of desecrating symbols. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - While West Indians constituted a much larger immigrant group in the port of Limón, Costa Rica and its environs, Chinese also migrated there during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In hopes of maintaining their culture and in response to the prejudice they faced, both groups formed their own tightknit transnational subcommunities. Nevertheless, they also interacted with each other. These interactions ranged from tension and conflict on the one hand, to routine, peaceful interaction and even collaboration on the other. In particular, class differences and the marginalization these groups experienced combined to produce this complex relationship. Tension and conflict often emerged due to both sides hoping to move up the social ladder and because of the economic power that many Chinese held as shopkeepers and lenders. Nevertheless, as groups experiencing social marginalization and living in proximity to each other, they could develop neutral or positive social and economic relationships. © benjamín n. narváez, 2021

AB  - Background: Diabetes technology use is associated with favorable type 1 diabetes (T1D) outcomes. American youth with public insurance, a proxy for low socioeconomic status, use less diabetes technology than those with private insurance. We aimed to evaluate the role of insurance-mediated provider implicit bias, defined as the systematic discrimination of youth with public insurance, on diabetes technology recommendations for youth with T1D in the United States. Methods: Multi-disciplinary pediatric diabetes providers completed a bias assessment comprised of a clinical vignette and ranking exercises (n = 39). Provider bias was defined as providers: (1) recommending more technology for those on private insurance versus public insurance or (2) ranking insurance in the top 2 of 7 reasons to offer technology. Bias and provider characteristics were analyzed with descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and multivariate logistic regression. Results: The majority of providers [44.1 ± 10.0 years old, 83% female, 79% non-Hispanic white, 49% physician, 12.2 ± 10.0 practice-years] demonstrated bias (n = 33/39, 84.6%). Compared to the group without bias, the group with bias had practiced longer (13.4±10.4 years vs 5.7 ± 3.6 years, P =.003) but otherwise had similar characteristics including age (44.4 ± 10.2 vs 42.6 ± 10.1, p = 0.701). In the logistic regression, practice-years remained significant (OR = 1.47, 95% CI [1.02,2.13]; P =.007) when age, sex, race/ethnicity, provider role, percent public insurance served, and workplace location were included. Conclusions: Provider bias to recommend technology based on insurance was common in our cohort and increased with years in practice. There are likely many reasons for this finding, including healthcare system drivers, yet as gatekeepers to diabetes technology, providers may be contributing to inequities in pediatric T1D in the United States. © 2021 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - This research work draws attention towards heated debate on transfer of gender biased ideology to generations embedding from gendered parenting. Gendered parenting has the potential to be a breeding ground for fueling the belief of gender stereotyping in the minds of their offsprings. This notion of gender stereotyping has created a picture in the heads of the descendants regarding the fixed gender roles which develops gendered socialization in governing the social world from the lens of gender biasness. The objective of the study is to examine empirically the impact of gendered parenting on gendered socialization in their children’s marital life. The study adopts thirty-two-items scale devised by Brogan & Kutner (1976) and eight-items scale under Gender Role Stereotype Scale (2012) by taking into consideration a sample size of eight hundred respondents comprising of highly educated married professionals and their parents. The findings revealed that children have rightly perceived their parent’s act of gender stereotype in their childhood. Consequently, despite being highly educated, the act of gender stereotyping continues in their married life as they burgeoned under the reflection of gendered parenting. Furthermore, it is also interpreted in the analysis that the female respondents are adversely affected by the pervasive bias and prejudices of gender stereotype in professional life in comparison to the male respondents. The study makes efforts to enhance the understanding of the community of parents to limit the transmission of gendered ideology to their next generations, thereby, progressing towards egalitarian society. © AesthetixMS 2021.

AB  - By 2050, 22.1% of the United States population will be 65 years or older, increasing the demand for well-trained, enthusiastic professionals to serve them. At the same time, later life is frequently pathologized, and there continues to be a preference for youth by those who are yet to be old as well as older adults themselves. The growing divide between this expanding cohort and gero-focused professionals is exacerbated by the under-emphasis on gerontology in undergraduate higher education and the substantial shift toward online instruction and larger class sizes in the U.S. In this quasi-experimental study, researchers examined whether a gerontology-focused empathy-building intervention (EBI) in 2 semesters of an online undergraduate course on aging changed students’ attitudes toward older adults, aging anxiety, and interest in gero-focused careers, compared with 2 control semesters taught without the EBI. Statistical results showed that neither the EBI nor course completion without the EBI significantly shifted students’ gero-attitudes and interest, suggesting the necessity of earlier and varied interventions to combat negative stereotypes about aging. Qualitative results provided some indication of the possible impact of the EBI. We describe study design, implementation, challenges, and areas for future intervention and study. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - When pupils learn geography they are extending their world view and reshaping it. This paper analyses representations of Africa and African countries and cultures in Irish primary geography textbooks and assesses to what extent these textbook portrayals facilitate or repress multicultural education, specifically critical multicultural education (CMCE). Here, this paper argues that primary geography can and should play a critical role in challenging societal issues of inequality, racism, prejudice and stereotypes, particularly pertaining to perspectives of the ‘Other’. This paper devises a framework for critical multicultural geography education (CMCGE) and applies this to Irish primary geography textbooks. While some textbooks can demonstrate capacity in fostering multiple perspectives, appreciation for diversity, development of critical thinking and enquiry, and making connections; in the main, textbooks present stereotypical, oversimplified accounts of issues, peoples and places which can result in feelings of superiority amongst dominant groups and more entrenched feelings of ‘Otherness’ amongst minority groups. © 2021 Educational Studies Association of Ireland.

AB  - This study seeks to advance how intergroup dynamics can help us better understand the relations between humans and robots. Intergroup contact theory states that negative feelings toward an outgroup can be reduced through controlled intergroup contact. This study tests this theory by having study participants interact with either a human (member of the ingroup) or large humanoid robot (member of an outgroup) and measuring changes in social distance before and after the interaction. The findings suggest that robotkind is a distinct social group separate from humankind and as predicted by intergroup contact theory, exposure to a specific robot can override held prejudices against robots as a social group. © 2021 Eastern Communication Association.

AB  - This article re-investigates the conventional understanding of the female body and voice in ‘Let’s Play Doctor’, a short story written by the Egyptian Nura Amin in 2005. In traditional representations of women in literary discourses, female bodies have mostly been viewed as complex entities and unsettled fields for scientific practices that enhance and sustain the image of, in particular, male doctors as superior and authoritative. The male monopoly over scientific knowledge produces forms of social regulation within which female bodies are generally represented as passively and morally inferior. In the history of the medical profession, these bodies are registered as having the potential to enact aberrant, erotic, self-indulgence and fantasy, an act which makes them liable to shame and hence constant pathological examination. Amin’s characters, however, offer a potent renunciation of the long established place/image of the female body in medical literary discourses through the irony of a simple children’s game. By creating a community of young female actors who play a traditional game of doctor and patients, these young characters redirect our attention to the hidden power of female knowledge which is suppressed by social medical prejudices carried out on women in a highly gendered Arab society (Egypt). © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - XRchaeology at Miller Grove is a web-based collection of new media components, including digital storytelling, geographic information systems, virtual tours, three-dimensional objects, and web-based virtual reality presentations. XRchaeology contributes to revisions of traditional narratives about free African Americans and the network of escape routes referred to as the Underground Railroad (UGRR). This project focuses attention on potential African American “conductors” in the UGRR and resituates African Americans as the agents of their own freedom. XRchaeology emphasizes that freedom was achieved across a continuum shaped by social, economic, and legal biases and anti-immigration sentiments. The XRchaeology application is designed for both traditional learners and non-specialist members of the public, as the project facilitates self-directed learning and evidence-based inquiry for all interest levels. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - It was in 1835, in the wake of the Nullification Crisis that shook the United States with the threat of civil war over federal law, state’s rights and the Slave Power, that Jerome Holgate, under the pseudonym ‘Oliver Bolokitten’, published his dystopian fiction A Sojourn in the City of Amalgamation. It posited the existence of an African body smell that would make anti-odour machines essential if American societies fell prey to the potential ravages of racial miscegenation. Two decades after Holgate offered his dystopian world-view of smell and race, ‘Cephas Broadluck’, a pseudonym for the American author Allen Gazlay, published Races of Mankind: With Travels in Grubland (1856), an allegorical attack on comparable forms of sensory and sexual ‘amalgamation’, also proposing olfactory detection as a racial protection for the white body politic. The antebellum era dystopias of Holgate and Gazlay combined ideas of truth and race through the sensory experiences of the nose, which had previously been socially conditioned to sense racial Others through a false consciousness about the smell of Africans throughout the Atlantic World. Despite the efforts of academics to deconstruct such absurd beliefs and experiences in the modern world, olfactory racism continues in the languages of both current political leaders and within the bowels of the Internet. Because these prejudicial perceptions continue through what seems for many racists to be biological experiences of truth, scholars must focus much more on analysing embodied perceptions of Othering if academic arguments about the social construction of race are to make any inroads against the return of racist, technologized and fascist modernity in the contemporary West. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Ethnic and land conflicts have recently gained significance in peace and conflict resolution. It is imperative to understand both endogenous and exogenous factors and their relations towards the institutional, democratic, and state-building process to mediate the risks of class and land conflicts. This paper attempts to identify historical relations of land and class structure by analysing Burundi land and class conflict and its significance for peace and stability. We found that the imbalance of land ownership and class structure in a society leads to armed conflicts, leading to an outbreak of other social conflicts, including violence, forced displacement, paralyzed land governance, and power relations changes. Hence, there is a dire need to foster reintegration and reconciliation through balanced multiple diplomacies in Burundi, enhancing state legitimacy towards sustainable land tenure security, improving state capacity, and ensuring justice in the reconciliation process, in association with local and regional powers. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Social media platforms are popular for expressing personal views, emotions and beliefs. Social media platforms are influential for propagating extremist ideologies for group-building, fund-raising, and recruitment. To monitor and control the outreach of extremists on social media, detection of extremism in social media is necessary. The existing extremism detection literature on social media is limited by specific ideology, subjective validation methods, and binary or tertiary classification. A comprehensive and comparative survey of datasets, classification techniques, validation methods with online extremism detection tool is essential. The systematic literature review methodology (PRISMA) was used. Sixty-four studies on extremism research were collected, including 31 from SCOPUS, Web of Science (WoS), ACM, IEEE, and 33 thesis, technical and analytical reports using Snowballing technique. The survey highlights the role of social media in propagating online radicalization and the need for extremism detection on social media platforms. The review concludes lack of publicly available, class-balanced, and unbiased datasets for better detection and classification of social-media extremism. Lack of validation techniques to evaluate correctness and quality of custom data sets without human interventions, was found. The information retrieval unveiled that contemporary research work is prejudiced towards ISIS ideology. We investigated that deep learning based automated extremism detection techniques outperform other techniques. The review opens the research opportunities for developing an online, publicly available automated tool for extremism data collection and detection. The survey results in conceptualization of architecture for construction of multi-ideology extremism text dataset with robust data validation techniques for multiclass classification of extremism text. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Sexual Orientation is an enduring pattern of romantic or sexual attraction, with the attractions broadly incorporated under heterosexuality and non-heterosexuality. Societal and other factors seem to affect individuals’ perception of their self-identified orientation. Thus, this study sets out to document the distribution of sexual orientation, level of self-reported satisfaction, and factors associated with sexual orientation among unmarried university students. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 550 respondents sampled using a multi-stage sampling technique. Data collected via a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed via IBM SPSS version 20.0. Results: Most respondents (93.6%) were heterosexuals, 4.7% bisexuals, 1.3% lesbian women and 0.40% gay men. More heterosexuals (80.4%) were fully satisfied with their self-identified sexual orientation compared to 57.2% of non-heterosexuals. Respondents who had religious upbringing and those whose parents were currently married were less likely to have sexual orientation outside of heterosexuality. Conclusion: The most prevalent sexual orientation was heterosexuality, with more heterosexuals also expressing satisfaction than others. With the level of dissatisfaction expressed by those who are not heterosexuals as well as the factors associated with heterosexuality, it is plausible to conclude that societal values and/or prejudices constitute major factors in individuals self-identifying with some particular sexual orientation and the satisfaction derived therein. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article aims to present concepts and clinical practices recommended to approach people with active sex life. These concepts are an integral part of the recommendations of the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), published by the Ministry of Health of Brazil in 2020. The article proposes a comprehensive approach to sexuality for health promotion. It presents significant aspects of the communication process that must develop, without prejudice and judgment, focusing on sexual and reproductive health. It also highlights relevant points about the exercise of sexuality at specific stages of life, recommending assessment of risks and vulnerabilities and screening for STI and condom use. In this way, it is possible to contribute to exercise their sexuality fully, responsibly, and safely. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is obvious that the textbooks play a key role in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning. The good quality textbooks must meet the criteria or standard as a textbook. This paper aims to describe the accuracy of materials provided in the Bahasa Indonesia textbook for the first grade of Senior High School curriculum of 2013. This study adopted the content analysis method to analyze the data. The findings deriving from this study reveal that the accuracy of learning material provided in Bahasa Indonesia textbook for the first grade of Senior High School (Sekolah Menengah Atas) curriculum of 2013 published by Erlangga has adequately met the standard requirements of Board of National Education Standards (Badan Standar Nasional Pendidikan, BSNP) for the accuracy of learning material of a textbook. However, this study found some weaknesses in the textbook as follows: (1) The textbook has not provided a ‘Competency Map’ containing principles used by students to achieve their learning goals and understand the learning materials provided in each chapter in order that the materials delivered can be well-structured. (2) The examples provided in the textbook are less relevant to the characteristics of diverse backgrounds and social statuses; contain the issues of ethnicity, religion, race, intergroup relations; and do not suit the needs. © 2021.

AB  - This qualitative case study investigates the functions of language use and underlying raciolinguistic ideologies in interactions between Latinx emergent bilinguals who are Spanish native speakers and mainstream students in the fifth-grade English classroom in a public elementary school in the U.S. Midwest. Data included audio and video recorded observations and field notes from students’ interactions in different contexts of the school, as well as students’ work samples and test scores, English curricula, and interviews with the students and their English teacher. Data analysis encompassed open coding followed by focused coding, and this work was informed by critical discourse analysis, resulting in the emergence of themes of two major language functions. These functions were to establish the legitimacy of knowledge source and disqualify a minoritized group. Unbeknownst to their well-meaning English teacher, the students displayed curious forms of social agency. Pervasive and important ideologies underlie language functions and language became the site of symbolic power struggles through students’ hegemonic and counter-hegemonic discourses. This study is significant in the country’s present social and political climate of racial tensions and prejudice against minoritized groups. The study ends with practical and research implications. © 2021 the National Association for Bilingual Education.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People with disabilities are one of the most marginalized groups in society, and having a disability significantly increases the likelihood of unemployment or underemployment. The reluctance to hire individuals with disabilities is significantly influenced by the longstanding, negative stereotypes of people with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: To better understand employers' negative attitudes toward individuals with disabilities, assessment tools must properly capture factors contributing to this stigma. METHODS: The Employers' Stigmatizing Attitudes Toward People with Disabilities Scale (ESATPD) was validated in the current study. RESULTS: Results of the exploratory factor analysis indicate a strong, unidimensional structure of the scale accounting for 47.14% of the total variance with a sample. The single ESATPD factor was labeled employment stigma. In addition, higher levels of employers' stigma were related to negative attitudes toward disability, decreased support of recruitment efforts, as well as decreased intentions of hiring people with disabilities. CONCLUSION: Results support the implementation of tailored interventions directed at specific areas of concern for employers and employees in hiring positions. © 2021 - IOS Press.

AB  - In the upper Midwest, at least until the late 1930s, there was a modest presence of black athletes in American football and track and field in particular, with a smaller number in basketball and other sports. We know a great deal about how the post-war desegregation in professional baseball and football began to slowly change the landscape of elite American sports. But despite this overarching national narrative of small numbers of black athletes in integrated sports in the north and segregated structures in the south, we still know very little about specific contexts, especially at the high school level where the vast majority of organized sporting competition is held in the USA Key questions remain: was there a qualitative difference between the treatment of African-American athletes in different regions of the United States during the first four decades of the twentieth century? Was there a difference in racial attitudes in places where African-Americans were resident in small numbers such as in the towns and medium sized cities of the upper Midwest? Indeed, Iowa was regarded as relatively welcoming of African-American athletes by the 1930s whether that reputation was fully deserved or not. In this article we examine this question from a case study point of view. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Transitions go along with the need to integrate a previous outgroup into the self-concept. This study examines whether this integration follows cognitive consistency principles. In line with recent theorizing, we test whether the perceived compatibility of a previous and a current ingroup determines identification with these groups and intergroup attitudes. We primed employees who were former students (N = 269) to perceive the groups of students and employees as either more compatible or less compatible, and measured the strength of identification and group attitudes with regard to both groups. The findings largely confirmed predictions. Greater compatibility between social groups increased identity integration and reduced intergroup bias. Identity integration mediated the effect of compatibility on intergroup bias. In line with predictions, the voluntariness of group change explained which of the groups people identified more strongly with when groups were perceived low in compatibility. The results of the study provide evidence that integrating identities into the self-concept follows cognitive consistency principles and suggests that emphasizing similarities between previous and current ingroups fosters identity integration and reduces intergroup bias. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article seeks to re-address the problem of Cordelia–not as a vessel of male prejudice, fantasy or repression but as an image of truth and the social life of that truth as it moves across the play world. Focusing on King Lear, I will examine the complex value of silence, not as negation or nothing, but as an ethical value through which the play explores the contested space of the unsayable. Considering Lear’s investment in power, monstrosity and self-knowledge, I investigate the story of Apollo’s crow, Aesop and Ovid, and what happened to the bird who told the truth and became ‘the opposite of white’. Re-imagining the unspeakable, as well as the unknowable, this essay argues that King Lear rehabilitates the power of nothing through a sceptical analysis of the value of acceptance and restraint, unhinged from their stoic or Christian contexts. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Background and Aim: People with severe mental illness (SMI) have a life expectancy of up to twenty years less than the general population and many live with incurable physical health conditions. Yet, they continue to experience barriers when trying to access palliative and end of life care (PEOLC). Little research has been carried out which includes the views and experiences of people with SMI, and this study presents first findings which include people with both SMI and an incurable condition and their carers. It aimed to seek their views, and those of their carers, on their experiences and expectations of accessing PEOLC and to understand how PEOLC for people with SMI could be improved. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 8 participants (5 patient participants and 3 carer participants). Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was undertaken. Findings: Four over-arching themes were developed. (1) Stigma and Prejudice–See Me, Not My Diagnosis (2) Hesitancy and Avoidance–Treading on Eggshells (3) Collaborators in Care–The Ignored Experts and (4) Connections–Leaning in, Not Stepping Back. Significance of Findings: This study presents the first accounts from the UK concerning experiences of PEOLC, barriers to access and how care can be improved, from the perspectives of patients with both a SMI and an incurable physical condition and their carers. The findings illuminate an under-researched area of clinical practice and contribute rich understandings to future service developments and innovations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A growing movement towards inclusive education worldwide means more children with autism are being educated in mainstream classrooms. However, integration does not equate to inclusion, and peer stigmatisation of autism is commonplace. This systematic review explores the merit of school-based peer education interventions targeting the stigmatisation of children with autism spectrum disorders. Relevant records published from 1994 were identified through systematic searches of five electronic databases: EBSCO, Medline, PsychInfo, PsychArticles and ERIC. Thirty-one documents pertaining to 27 studies met the pre-specified eligibility criteria and were included for data-extraction. A narrative synthesis highlighted significant flaws in the available literature, most notably poor methodological quality and a narrow research focus with regards to age, the gender of target child and implementation methods. Nevertheless, this study reports on evidence tentatively supporting the efficacy of ASD de-stigmatisation interventions when targeting ignorance and prejudice. Although no one approach can be determined as most effective, manualised programmes combining different types of information about ASD and delivered using various mediums seem to hold the most promise. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The article explores the linguistic landscape (LL) of Itaewon, a former American military “camp town” in Seoul, by providing a snapshot of its conflicting portrayals. With the LL serving as a critical index of language-, class-, and ethnicity-related social disparities, this study examines, through the notion of “framing” semiotic resources, (1) the state’s and district’s positions towards gentrification and multiculturalism in Itaewon and (2) how the underlying social class and ethnic disparities pertaining to gentrification are reflected. The framing of signs raises, at the macro and latent levels, questions regarding hierarchy among languages, classes and ethnic groups, and the coexistence of a binary internationalized population. It turns one’s attention towards not only what is seen/foreseen but also what is unseen/ignored. The study presents an informed means of revealing contextualized sociolinguistic voices in an area with a complex and unsettled history. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Since the break-up of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Serbia have emerged as nationalist states that serve the political interests of ethnic Croats and Serbs, respectively. Despite these regime shifts, historical communities of Croatian Serbs and Serbian Croats still remain within these states. This paper sheds light on the experiences of these minority groups who embody ideological threats to their regimes’ nationalist goals. I argue that Serbs in Croatia are heavily marginalised by dominant political narratives that have cast them to bear the brunt of the state’s post-war grievances. As a result, they experience institutional discrimination that limits their range of economic and social opportunities. Conversely, Croats in Serbia face less explicit prejudice, though post-war stigmas have pushed many to redefine their ethnic affiliations. Both minority groups are experiencing a steady population decline as the rise in nationalist rhetoric has dissolved their rootedness to these territories. This paper examines a majority-minority dynamic in the context of the literature on modern ‘ethnocratic’ states and presents a case study for how ethnic minorities navigate through social prejudices and find ways to negotiate access to participation in everyday society, given the structural exclusion from institutions they face as communities deemed hostile by their state. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Structured interviews with 227 social workers in Turkey categorized ethical problems in the work place. An inductive content analysis categorized nine themes (dual relationships, threats by clients, worker bias leading to prejudice, child custody issues, fraudulent use of state funds, procedural tensions, coercion by authorities, confidentiality, and taking people into state care) that required problem-solving strategies on the part of the social workers. The results indicated that when confronted with ethical situations the path for deliberation was not always clear, many decisions were made in consultation, whereas others were made independently. Future recommendations include advocating for education and training that utilizes ethical decision-making principles when problem-solving, as well as, stressing the importance of clear guidelines for seeking and utilizing supportive consultation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: This study draws on social stigma and prejudice to examine the perceptions and beliefs of managers and employees regarding visible tattoos and body piercings, as well as the impact they have on potential employment and human resource management in the global South, using Nigeria as the research context. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a qualitative research approach, drawing on data from 43 semi-structured interviews with employees and managers in Nigeria. Findings: Contrary to the popular opinion that tattoos and body piercings are becoming more accepted and mainstream in society, this study finds that some Nigerian employers and employees may stigmatise and discriminate against people with visible tattoos and body piercings. The findings of this study suggest that beliefs about tattoos are predicated on ideologies as well as religious and sociocultural values, which then influence corporate values. Research limitations/implications: The extent to which the findings of this research can be generalised is constrained by the limited sample and scope of the research. Practical implications: Religious and sociocultural preconceptions about people with visible tattoos and body piercings have negative implications for the recruitment and employment of such people and could prevent organisations from hiring and keeping talented employees. This implies that talented employees might experience prejudice at job interviews, preventing them from gaining employment. Furthermore, stigmatising and discriminating against people with visible tattoos and body piercings may lead to the termination of employment of talented employees, which could negatively affect organisational productivity and growth. Originality/value: This study provides an insight into the employment relations regarding tattoos and body piercing in Nigeria. The study highlights the need for mild beliefs and positive perceptions about people with visible tattoos and unconventional body piercings. There should be a general tolerance of the individual preference for body art and physical appearance, and this tolerance should be incorporated in organisational policies, which are enactments of corporate culture. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Attempts were made to explore the value of the multiple social identities approach in reducing the detrimental effects of stereotype threats in the context of spectator sports. A total of 150 females were recruited for a laboratory experiment. The following manipulations were implemented: (a) stereotype threat, (b) threat along with the implicit team identification activation, and (c) control. The results revealed that females in the threat condition showed a reduced level of psychological well-being; paradoxically, negative stereotypes positively influenced their self-esteem. The activation of implicit team identification alleviated the detrimental consequences of threat by inhibiting the spreading activation of harmful stereotypes regarding women in sports. The main theoretical frameworks of this study consisted of the process account of stereotype threat suggested in cognitive psychology. The authors attempted to offer a stronger understanding of the underlying mental processes of stereotype threat on women as well as an effective means to deal with its detrimental consequences. © 2021 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - Gypsy often experience substandard social conditions, poorer health, and discrimination. However, little is known about Gypsies students’ subjective wellbeing. This study aimed to compare Gypsy (n= 42) and non-Gypsy (n= 76) young-students (mean age= 13 years) in terms of composite Subjective Wellbeing (combining indicators of satisfaction with life, positive and negative affect, satisfaction with social support, and quality of life). A series of t-tests indicated that Gypsy and non-Gypsy students did not differ significantly in Subjective Wellbeing. A novelty and strength of the study were that we complemented mean difference tests with procedures for describing group similarities. Understanding similarity is important because it can lead to more accurate and positive perceptions of outgroups, including Gypsies. Across multiple dimensions of Subjective Wellbeing, the similarity between Gypsy and non-Gypsy students was greater than 92%. Although students gypsies experience several cultural specificities, they seem to register levels of composite wellbeing similar to non-gypsy peers. These results are relevant for inclusion practices and policies, as they suggest that research in quality of life is an important means to promote inclusion and equity and to reduce prejudice against ethnic minoritie. © Copyright 2021 IJP&PT & AAC.

AB  - HIV discrimination has served as a barrier to addressing the HIV epidemic and providing effective HIV treatment and care. Measuring HIV discrimi-nation, particularly covert HIV discrimination, has proven to be complex. Adapted from a previous scale, we developed a perpetuated HIV micro-aggressions scale to assess covert forms of discriminatory beliefs among HIV-negative/unknown HIV status individuals. Factor analysis resulted in three subscales, explaining 73.58% of the scale’s variance. The new scale demonstrated both convergent validity (HIV prejudice, HIV stereotypes) and discriminant validity (alcohol use, depressive symptomology). Perpetuated HIV microaggressions were significantly associated with HIV conspiracy beliefs, HIV prejudice, and HIV stereotypes. This new scale can serve as an important tool in evaluating perpetuated HIV microaggressions among HIV-negative individuals. © 2021 The Guilford Press.

AB  - Background Domestic violence is one of the most critical issues worldwide, often reported in newspapers and faced with prejudices and clichés. Violence against women in particular continues to be an obstacle to reaching equality, development, peace and the achievement of respect for women human rights. Primary prevention strategies aim to increase awareness and critical capacity of the phenomenon in the general population. They are therefore not only a clinical challenge, but also a social, cultural and political one. Objective The objective of this literature review is to identify primary prevention programs and interventions related to interpersonal violence Methods A literature search was conducted through major databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO/ PsycLIT, Excerpta Medica/EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), Cochrane Library. National data were collected from, the ISTAT website, the Ministry of Health and the Interior and the Institute of Health. Conclusions The analysis of primary prevention programs highlighted two elements of criticality: Insufficient involvement of the perpetrators of the violent behaviour (men) compared to the involvement of women, and lack of attention to specific risk and protective factors for each level. © 2021 Pacini Editore S.p.A..

AB  - In Singapore, discrimination toward LGBT citizens has been reinforced through a monolithic notion of the traditional Asian family. This ethnography focuses on the lived experiences of 7 ethnic minority Malay Muslim “butch” individuals and their journey to parenthood. Drawing upon frameworks of intersectionality and piety, I explore how butches negotiate and reconcile their queer practices and desires as Muslim daughters around “coming out,” foster children with same-sex partners, being a biological parent and their perceptions of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). Reproductive futures, enacted by Malay Muslim butches, disrupt yet reinforce the durability of “natural” life trajectories scripted through conventions of marriage, family and fatherhood that have, insofar, excluded them. Further, their experiences also offer alternatives to existing literature on same-sex families that tend to render other nonwhite and/or non-Western queer family practices invisible. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that the use of masks is an indispensable protective measure against COVID-19, given the high transmissibility of the new coronavirus through the respiratory system, including by asymptomatic individuals. The use of cloth masks in public places has been established as a protective measure to be adopted alongside social distancing and hand hygiene. This narrative review aims to systematize the scientific evidence that informs the widespread use of cloth masks as a preventive measure against COVID-19 and to describe the evolution of positions contrary to or in favor of its use outside the home, in view of the advance of the new coronavirus pandemic globally. The scientific articles, technical notes, governmental decrees and other documents analyzed indicate that widespread use of masks has the potential to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus. We recommend that the Brazilian government adopt strategies to increase the supply of reusable cloth masks to the public, especially to vulnerable populations and to support studies on the impact of this measure to control the pandemic in the country. Finally, it is imperative to ensure that use of masks does not exacerbate stigmatization of racial groups that already face prejudice. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - This article revolves around a specific materiality: a hole in the fence surrounding Lampedusa’s refugee centre. By allowing migrants to informally leave the violently guarded centre and enter Lampedusa town, the hole connects social worlds that on paper should be separate. For the local population, the hole materialises an absence of state management and ‘clear rules’, but it also facilitates encounters between locals and migrants in the form of economic transactions and acts of helpfulness. This does not mean that anti-immigration sentiments are absent, but they remain generally concealed beneath civil pragmatism—measures of etiquette aimed at peacefully preserving public space. Further, by highlighting everyday ambiguity and pragmatic interests, the article provides a tempering of the ideologically overdetermined vocabularies that dominate much discourse on migration in Europe. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the reactions and feelings of professionals in the frontline of care for inpatients with suspected COVID-19. METHOD: Qualitative approach study with 19 health team professionals from a teaching hospital located in the hinterland of the state of Paraná. Data were collected in March and April 2020. For data analysis, content analysis was used. RESULTS: Of all professionals, 89.5% were female, 57.8% were between 20 and 30 years old. The following emotions and feelings were highlighted by the content analysis: Motivation; willingness to contribute; feelings of fear, anxiety; obligation; preoccupation with death; sadness; discrimination; isolation; prejudice; uncertainty; and doubts about the future. CONCLUSION: The research showed workers' reactions/feelings, which were ambivalent both as a motivating impulse and as self-care, such as in the case of isolation/fear in coping with COVID-19.

AB  - This study (N = 217) explores the potential for virtual reality to decrease social distance toward outgroup members among women. Raising the salience of individuals’ real physical identity through avatar customization and common ingroup identity manipulations was theorized to influence social distance. Participants who customized an avatar to resemble their real selves showed increased social distance. However, avatar customization also increased user identifiability, which was linked to reduced social distance. Priming a common ingroup identity increased identity salience but did not influence social distance. In examining heterogeneous effects by prior levels of issue involvement, participants with high and moderate involvement with immigration showed increased social distance after customizing an avatar to resemble their real selves, thus implying boomerang effects. The study discusses how avatar customization, identifiability, and common ingroup primes in virtual encounters may influence outgroup attitudes and intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article has the objective of defining theoretical and conceptual reflexions about the issue of racism in Brazil. Starting from the work of Latin-American decolonialists, we pinpointed, initially, that the historical matrices of racism in the country are repercussions of the European colonization and of the modern eurocentric thinking. Subsequently, we discussed the history of racism in Brazil, focusing on periods after the slavery abolition marked, specially, by the ideology of whitening, in a first moment, and by the myth of racial democracy, starting from the Vargas Era. In this topic, we brought data about the grave situation of social inequality between black and white people which persists in the country. Therefore, we aimed to attach ourselves to ethical and critical voices that claim that the violence daily faced by the majority of the population is not discredited and naturalized anymore, but explicitly revealed. Only through this, effective measures against structural racism will occur, averting this insidious specter which constantly reoccurs in Brazilian sociabilities. © 2021, Athenea Digital.

AB  - Introduction: The field of disability studies is a contested area of research that has transformed significantly over the past three decades. The move away from the medical model of disability in the early 1980s created opportunities for the voices of people with disabilities to be heard. However, research into the lived experiences of this population has historically relied on proxy accounts and, where first-person accounts have been included, people with disabilities have often been excluded on the basis of cognitive-communicative (dis)ability and language proficiency. This article explores the ways in which space and place influence the lived experience of disability in a rural South African context. Methods: A qualitative approach underpinned by the principles of narrative inquiry was adopted. Thirty participants with a variety of impairments were interviewed over a period of 3 months. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Findings reveal a complex web of physical and socioemotional aspects that influence the spaces and places in which stories are lived and told. Overriding themes include exclusion on the basis of physical mobility; exclusion from healthcare, education and social services; exclusion from the employment sector; exclusion from participation in sociocultural activities; and the creation of ‘safe places’, which provide insight into the physical and psychosocial dimensions of inclusion. Conclusion: A case is made for social activism and for communities to confront the anxieties, silences, prejudices and injustices that exist in policy documents, healthcare consultations and community engagements. © 2021.

AB  - Once ignored by the popular media, sexual and gender minority (SGM) characters have become increasingly visible in recent decades. According to the parasocial contact hypothesis, favorable media portrayals of minority communities can reduce prejudicial attitudes, especially among audience members who have limited real-life relationships with minorities. To explore the boundaries of this hypothesis, we designed an experimental vignette study in which we randomly exposed participants to an unfavorable portrayal of SGM characters, the Bury Your Gays (BYG) trope, which involves SGM characters (typically lesbians and bisexual women) dying in violent ways. Findings indicated that, among the women in the sample, exposure to the trope was associated with more favorable attitudes toward SGM individuals and less sexist attitudes. This effect was especially pronounced among women with SGM friends. We argue that these surprising findings have the potential to broaden the scope of the social contact hypothesis by suggesting a variety of portrayals of minority characters may produce favorable attitudes toward minority groups. Future research should seek to refine the parameters of this hypothesis by exploring effects of a range of portrayals of SGM characters on attitudes among individuals with various types of relationships with SGM individuals. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Using Norwegian survey experiments (N ¼ 1,541), we examined the relationship between Islamist terrorist threats and trust in out-groups, focusing on how this relationship was conditioned by the ''motivation to control prejudice'' (MCP) and emotions of anxiety. After exposure to a news story describing an Islamist threat scenario, the treatment group reported higher levels of trust in out-groups than the control group. High levels of MCP were linked to higher levels of trust; anxiety played an ambiguous role. Although anxiety had a strong negative effect on trust in out-groups, the positive effect of MCP increased with rising anxiety levels, thus making the people who were most scared also more trusting. Activation of social norms may, thus, bolster distrust. © 2020 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined the role parasocial contact with a transgender character on an online TV show (Transparent) may play in reducing prejudice toward transgender people. An experiment was conducted with participants randomly assigned to view either a video depicting a transgender character, or a non-transgender character portrayed by the same actor. Results were consistent with predictions derived from the intergroup contact mediation model for explaining how intergroup contact reduces prejudice toward an outgroup. Critical to reduction of prejudice toward transgender people is the quality of the parasocial interaction with the transgender character. Poor quality of parasocial contact may have unintended negative effects on prejudice toward transgender people based on the data. Limitations and implications of the study for the use of entertainment media to reduce stigma toward transgender people are discussed. © 2021 Central States Communication Association.

AB  - Aims: This study explored occupational therapy students’ implicit (unconscious) ageism. Because of the relationship between impairment and dependence, and ageism and ableism, we also explored if there was a relationship between occupational therapy students’ implicit ageism and their implicit ableism. Methods: We conducted and analyzed implicit age and disability attitude data (i.e., Age Implicit Association Test; Disability Attitude Implicit Association Test) from 54 occupational therapy students. Results: Most occupational therapy students in our study (70%) were ageist, with the majority strongly or moderately preferring younger adults over older adults. Our findings also suggest ableism plays a role in ageism–ableism accounted for almost 30% of variance in occupational therapy students’ ageism in our study. Conclusions: Through attending to functional interdependence and home modifications occupational therapists can support older adults in the natural processes of aging, instead of reinforcing ageism and its influences on intervention and plan of care development. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This inaugural Saudi Arabian-based (SA) study explored how social media images and cartoons can influence the professional identity of pre-service teachers (PSTs) measured by their reflections on self-selected images of teachers and teaching in Saudi media. PSTs (n = 30) were enrolled in a teacher education program in a faculty of education in a public university in the Eastern province of SA (convenience sampling). Findings from thematically analyzing 30 reflective assignments, nine semi-structured interviews, and a focus group (n = 9) revealed four themes: (a) a pervasive negative stereotype; (b) violence associated with male teachers and students; (c) criticism of the education and administrative system; and (d) suggestions of eroding teacher authority. Findings affirm the imperative that teacher education programs intentionally sensitize PSTs to the benefits of critically deconstructing media images. This will help stave off negative connotations of teachers and make teaching become part of future teachers’ professional identities and the SA collective memory. © 2021 Teacher Development.

AB  - The paper attempts to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic is psychically constructed by us. The pandemic is more than just a disease pandemic affecting body and physical health. Its specter is being processed in our unconscious and subconscious registers evoking panic, paranoid suspiciousness, prejudice and exclusion, rage and violence. The paper lays open the intrapsychic processes operating to create three significant mass patterns of reactions and behaviours: fear and anxiety; othering, hatred and stigmatization; and grief and guilt. In addition, it analyzes the psychological impact of the measures undertaken to control the spread and deaths due to COVID-19 such as lockdowns, quarantine, isolation and social distancing, raising the crucial question—Is the cure worse than the disease? The paper also addresses the psychological underpinnings of the human need to envisage a future that awaits us. It responds to the popular question doing the rounds—How will the post-corona world look like? © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

AB  - How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration attitudes, that short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis predicts anti-refugee voting and sentiment. We code exposure to refugees at the settlement level using reports from state media, an independent online news site, and an online social media aggregator. Settlements through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher anti-refugee voting in a national referendum in 2016. The effect decreases sharply with distance. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the far-right opposition gained, while the governing right-wing party lost votes in these settlements in subsequent parliamentary elections. This suggests incumbents are punished by voters skeptical of immigration regardless of their policy position. Survey data supports this finding of a competition among right-wing parties, as individuals in exposed settlements are more fearful of immigrants and support restrictive policies only if they identify as right-wing. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Tattoo represents a phenomenon present since the beginning of human history. Over the years, it took different roles associated with different meanings and utilities, becoming today a form of expression of individuals. Nowadays, tattoos are understood as fashion ornaments, body art, among others, which integrate a social reality. The individuals who are tattooed do not perceive their body as an organic entity, but as an expressive and aesthetic one: they permanently record a story that tells their experiences, feelings and their significant links. Consequently, the tattoo is not a part of the body of the subject, but a synthesis of it. Tattoos are also understood as elements that represent collective identities. In this context, the objective of this study was to discover the perceptions of tattoos as cultural elements. To achieve this, a descriptive research was carried out, with a simple transversal design, through a structured and self-administered online questionnaire. The sample was collected by snowball sampling and consisted of 745 individuals who live, study or work in AMBA (Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires, Argentina) and who are between 18 and 60 years old. As the main results of this research, it is relevant to highlight the existence of strong correlations between the main cultural variables of tattoos (Fashion that will last; Prejudices in the workplace; Cultural expression). Additionally, a multiple linear regression model was formulated to predict the perception that tattoos are a cultural expression through the idea that it represents a fashion that came to stay and the perception that there are prejudices in the work environment regarding the use of tattoos. Finally, there is evidence of significant differences that allow to recognize that younger individuals have a higher level of agreement with the idea that tattoos are a fashion that will last. These results contribute to previous studies on the subject. Tattoos currently represent elements associated with fashion and culture, which can be reflected in the correlations found between cultural variables, reinforcing previous studies, who add to this panorama the idea that Tattoos constitute a social reality. Moreover, the predicted model found allows to assess the existence of a subculture around the use of tattoo as a cultural expression. Additionally, the importance of the Prejudice variable in the work environment as one of the predictors of the Cultural Expression variable can be evidenced in previous studies that confirm the existence of these prejudices. © 2021.

AB  - The study examined the relationships between social anxiety (SA), generalized anxiety (GA), and depression with racial microaggressions and internalized racism (IR) among Black young adults. Given SA's core features, we expected it to have a unique association with IR, and to moderate the connection between racial microaggressions and IR. Participants were 182 Black university students who completed measures of SA, GA, depressive symptoms, racial microaggressions, and IR. Linear regression models indicated that IR was a significant predictor of SA, but not GA or depression. Racial microaggressions were only positively associated with depressive symptoms. SA and racial microaggressions each predicted IR, but no interaction was found. Black young adults with elevated concerns of others' evaluation may be more prone to accepting negative stereotypes about one's racial group. © Copyright 2021 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.

AB  - Background: Snakebite is a neglected public health problem in many countries of the world. Being a tropical country Bangladesh is also facing this problem. In this case series we have tried to focus the illiteracy, prejudice and mismanagement happen in snake bite cases from primary to tertiary level and how effective management can save life of snake bite victim. Case presentation: Among the 29 snake bite cases admitted in a medicine ward of tertiary care hospital four were venomous bites-two male and two female. Our patients came from around Dhaka city. Though victim failed to bring the snake, by studying clinical features and syndromic approaches we suspected Kraits as the culprit in three cases and Cobra in one case. Time period between bite and attend to hospital ranged from 4 hr to 16.30 hours. All victims had inappropriate application of tourniquet to their limbs as a first aid management. Most of them first visit OZHA (traditional healer). Two of them developed respiratory failure. All cases were managed in ICU with polyvalent ASV. One developed anaphylaxis which was managed with adrenaline. All patients recovered completely. Conclusion: Arrival to hospital without delay, facilities for management with trained physicians and proper supply of ASV may reduce death from snake bite and reduce financial burden to the patient. Developing public awareness to remove prejudice about snakes and identifying venomous snake bite is also necessary. © 2021, Bangladesh Society of Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this project was to determine if consumers of Older People’s Mental Health (OPMH) recovering from depression and/or anxiety would benefit, in terms of a reduction in symptomatology and an increase in overall quality of life, from a group program approach. Design/methodology/approach: The Active & Healthy Group Program was developed drawing on evidenced-based psycho-education, psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and research on the effects of diet and activity on well-being. The program consists of six weekly sessions, each consisting of 50 min of psycho-education followed by physical and social activity of similar duration. Pre-and post-testing was undertaken using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Kessler 10 (K10) and European Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life-8 Item Index. In addition, participants completed a qualitative post-group survey focussing on their evaluation of the group, strengths and suggested improvements. The pre- and post-group measures were subjected to statistical analysis. Findings: According to pre- and post-test measures, the majority of group participants showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms and psychological distress (GDS and K10). This aligned with an overall increase in measures of quality of life (WHO QOL 8). Originality/value: This paper contributes to the emerging evidence that older people are often open to education and change, given a friendly non-confrontational environment where evidence is presented that challenges the negative stereotypes so often put forward about old age. Given the nature of the outcomes, Active & Healthy, perhaps, has the potential to impact on service transformation to incorporate group work of this type as a valuable adjunct to core service provision. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Normal baseline investigation results in a patient with common symptoms is often labelled as being due to a functional disorder, with all the pejorative connotations that go along with that term. When given the opportunity to see a patient for a second opinion, it is important to retain an open mind rather than assuming previous assessments are correct. Such an attitude helps with both attaining the definitive diagnosis but is also crucial to helping give hope to the patient. Understanding the patient's concerns about the meaning of their symptoms is critical in finding the balance between advanced investigation to identify a putative cause versus a decision to proceed with symptomatic control. © Royal College of Physicians 2021.

AB  - Effective intervention in social work requires addressing the contextual challenges clients face. For Muslim communities and families in the West, the context is characterized by decades of post 9/11 scrutiny and anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments. Internationally, with terrorist attacks across the globe, and nationally, with a highly-charged political atmosphere, Muslim communities and families in the U.S. find themselves trying to reconcile conflicting influences. While they may seek to establish themselves as positive members of civil society, they are often viewed with suspicion, merely because of their religion, and their children exposed to threats, bullying, and harassment. This manuscript draws from a practitioner-researcher model that applies a developmentally sensitive and contextually grounded perspective to analyzing themes elicited from workshops for parents and guardians in the wake of terrorist attacks. The workshops were designed to provide caregivers with tools to support their children through honest and developmentally sensitive conversations about the sociopolitical climate, including Islamophobia and other systemic issues. The manuscript concludes with suggestions for practitioners and researchers to promote the positive development and integration of Muslim ‘families’ at individual, family, and community levels. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The aftermath of over 50 years of uninterrupted conflict is not only underdevelopment and casualties. It is also the loss of social ties, the mistrust, and the difficulties to build a society where victims live with those who once were their perpetrators. These difficulties are many times linked to strong negative affect, prejudice, and skepticism towards forgiveness and reintegration. This paper uses the 2016-Americas Barometer database to provide empirical evidence of how Colombians’ attitudes towards the FARC-EP shape the probability of believing in forgiveness and supporting the reintegration process. We find that for demobilization to be successful a society needs (i) to reduce the perception of danger when surrounded by former rebels, (ii) to enhance perceptions of friendliness and hard-working on behalf of the ex-combatants, and (iii) to be more educated and allow the victims to speak up. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, its duration, and its intensity are harbingers of demographic change. In the context of social demography, it is crucial to explore the social challenge emerging from the coronavirus disease. The main purpose of this study is (i) to explore the determinants that affected the population in Greece in terms of social isolation during the lockdown period and (ii) to examine possible differences in the assessment of the social isolation factors depending on whether individuals live in urban or rural areas or regions with relative geographical isolation. Field research was conducted with 4216 questionnaires during the first wave of COVID-19 (March to April 2020). Multivariate analysis methods were applied to detect the main factors that impacted the feeling of social isolation, and nonparametric tests were performed to detect possible differences between population groups. Despite the resistance shown to the spread of the disease, the Greek population totally complied with the measures of social distancing and thus was socially and psychologically affected. The results indicate that psychosomatic disorders, employment situations, changes in sleep habits, socialization on the Internet, demographic status, health concerns, and trust in government and the media response determine the Greeks’ social isolation feeling. Pandemic and confinement measures have consequences for individuals and social groups and may prejudice social cohesion at multiple levels. By understanding how the pandemic affected the societies, interventions and public policies may be implemented to ensure both social cohesion and populations’ wellbeing by addressing the social isolation feeling. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - PURPOSE Although we know that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to have mistrust in the health care system, very limited knowledge exists on correlates of such medical mistrust among this population. In this study, we explored correlates of medical mistrust in a representative sample of adults. METHODS We analyzed cross-sectional study data from the Survey of California Adults on Serious Illness and End-of-Life 2019. We ascertained race/ethnicity, health status, perceived discrimination, demographics, socioeconomic factors, and medical mistrust. For data analysis, we used multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS Analyses were based on 704 non-Hispanic Black adults, 711 Hispanic adults, and 913 non-Hispanic White adults. Racial/ethnic background was significantly associated with the level of medical mistrust. Adjusting for all covariates, odds of reporting medical mistrust were 73% higher (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.15-2.61, P <.01) and 49% higher (aOR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.02-2.17, P <.05) for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults when compared with non-Hispanic White adults, respectively. Perceived discrimination was also associated with higher odds of medical mistrust. Indicating perceived discrimination due to income and insurance was associated with 98% higher odds of medical mistrust (aOR = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.71-2.29, P <.001). Similarly, the experience of discrimination due to racial/ethnic background and language was associated with a 25% increase in the odds of medical mistrust (aOR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.43; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS Perceived discrimination is correlated with medical mistrust. If this association is causal, that is, if perceived discrimination causes medical mistrust, then decreasing such discrimination may improve trust in medical clinicians and reduce disparities in health outcomes. Addressing discrimination in health care settings is appropriate for many reasons related to social justice. More longitudinal research is needed to understand how complex societal, economic, psychological, and historical factors contribute to medical mistrust. This type of research may in turn inform the design of multilevel communityand theory-based training models to increase the structural competency of health care clinicians so as to reduce medical mistrust. © 2021, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

AB  - Across a variety of contexts, adults tend to cooperate more with ingroup members than outgroup members. However, humans belong to multiple social groups simultaneously and we know little about how this cross-categorization affects cooperative decision-making. Nationality and gender are two social categories that are ripe for exploration in this regard: They regularly intersect in the real world and we know that each affects cooperation in isolation. Here we explore two hypotheses concerning the effects of cross-categorization on cooperative decision-making. First, the additivity hypothesis (H1), which proposes that the effects of social categories are additive, suggesting that people will be most likely to cooperate with partners who are nationality and gender ingroup members. Second, the category dominance hypothesis (H2), which proposes that one category will outcompete the other in driving decision-making, suggesting that either nationality or gender information will be privileged in cooperative contexts. Secondarily, we test whether identification with—and implicit bias toward—nationality and gender categories predict decision-making. Indian and US Americans (N = 479), made decisions in two cooperative contexts—the Dictator and Prisoner’s Dilemma Games—when paired with partners of all four social categories: Indian women and men, and US American women and men. Nationality exerted a stronger influence than gender: people shared and cooperated more with own-nationality partners and believed that own-nationality partners would be more cooperative. Both identification with—and implicit preferences for—own-nationality, led to more sharing in the Dictator Game. Our findings are most consistent with H2, suggesting that when presented simultaneously, nationality, but not gender, exerts an important influence on cooperative decision-making. Our study highlights the importance of testing cooperation in more realistic intergroup contexts, ones in which multiple social categories are in play. © 2021 Kumar et al.

AB  - In A Free and Responsible Press (1947), the Hutchins Commission—officially, the Commission on Freedom of the Press—sharply criticized journalists and journalism educators. In turn, the journalists and the journalism educators sharply criticized the Commission. This article views the battles in terms of academia. Commission chair Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago believed that a university must work to improve society rather than walling itself off. All but one of the men he successfully recruited for the Commission was a current or former professor. The orientation affected their analysis and their conclusions concerning both the press, which they viewed as a teaching profession, and schools of journalism, which they considered misguided in teaching skills rather than liberal arts. Journalists pushed back against the report as “academic,” which Hutchins called “a red herring.” Journalism professors pushed back against the report as prejudiced and uninformed, which Hutchins denied. Yet despite the attitudes of professors in 1947, the report subsequently rose to canonic status in schools of journalism. The article argues that the report reflects not only concepts about a free and responsible press but also concepts about a free and responsible university. © 2021 History Division of the AEJMC.

AB  - How does immigration influence local redistributive spending? This is a salient question in Europe, where local governments exercise discretion over social policy. Although prevailing accounts predict that anti-immigrant sentiment will fuel cuts in social spending, this perspective overlooks institutional variation in foreign voting rights. Building on the literature on democracy and redistribution, this article argues that an immigration-induced “race to the bottom” in local social expenditure will be conditional on the political status granted to foreign residents. Where foreign residents possess voting rights, incumbents gain incentives to leverage redistributive transfers to mobilize immigrant votes, offsetting downward pressure on social spending. To test the argument, the analysis draws on municipal-level panel data from nine European countries and implements a difference-in-differences design within two recent cases of franchise extension. The results indicate that the extension of local voting rights is sufficient to reverse downward bias in social spending within diversifying localities. © 2021 by the Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - Antisemitism, one of the oldest forms of prejudice and oppression is surging throughout the world. It ranges from verbal abuse to the destruction of property to murder. In the last two years, attacks against Jews in the United States were the overwhelming target of religion-based hate crimes. Stereotypes and myths continue to fuel prejudice and antisemitism in society. Factors such as anti-Israel sentiments, remarks by persons in power, the use of social media, white nationalism, and even the Covid 19 pandemic have contributed to its escalation.As a result of the increasing violence, the U.S. legislature held a hearing on confronting antisemitic terrorism with one outcome being that social workers and community advocates were needed to join law enforcement in the effort to heal and work for justice. Social work with its mandate to promote social justice and human rights and challenge oppression cannot ignore antisemitism and its impact on individuals and societies. However, the subject is basically ignored in the curriculum. This paper offers a brief history of antisemitism and presents guidelines and models for integrating it into social work programs. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Objective: To present the results of a study with a psychosocial approach that aimed to examine the autonomy of people with mental suffering cared for at psychosocial care centres from the perspective of work, based on the perceptions of the users and their families, and using the psychosocial rehabilitation framework and Agnes Heller's theory of everyday life. Methods: Four psychosocial care centres were selected, and 40 people collaborated with the research through semi-structured interviews analysed with the Collective Subject Discourse technique. Results: Although the users wanted to have a job, they showed no initiative, as there are impediments to carrying out work activities due to the side effects of the medication and the obstacles posed by third parties concerned about the loss of social benefits. Prejudice was seen as a mechanism that negatively interferes with social relations and empowerment for autonomy. Expectations of resuming studies and participation in voluntary activities, especially religious ones, were frequent in the users’ discourse. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to expand territorial spaces so that the users of mental health services can be protagonists of their own autonomy and carry out their occupations in the area of productivity with greater ownership. © 2020 Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatría

AB  - Promoting tolerance of diversity in schools is essential for improving students’ mental health outcomes and has an impact on their quality of life. There are sociodemographic and emotional variables (empathy and emotional intelligence) that seem to be related to being more tolerant of personal diversity, whether due to culture, political ideas, social class or physical or psychological conditions. A transversal study was conducted to examine these relationships, using hierarchical regression models (HRM) and qualitative comparative analysis of fuzzy sets (fsQCA) with a convenience sample of 1069 adolescents from six Spanish schools (47.4% were male). The inclusion criteria were studying in the selected compulsory secondary education or high schools. The parents voluntarily signed the informed consent so that the students could participate. The participants completed self-reported questionnaires to evaluate their tolerance to diversity the Diversity Tolerance Scale and the Trait of Meta-Mood Scale 24 were used to measure emotional intelligence, and the Basic Empathy Scale to assess empathy. The results suggest the emotional intelligence variable, specifically emotional repair, is more predictive of tolerance for diversity in adolescents. In the fsQCA model, the interaction of sex, emotional repair and emotional empathy is better predictor for a tolerant attitude. Finally, the development of emotional skills intervention programmes for adolescents will have a direct and positive impact on tolerance of diversity in schools. These findings are important and useful because tolerance of diversity in the classroom seem to have a positive effect on the reduction of prejudice or discrimination, promoting more inclusive environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: The aims of this study are to identify and analyse prevalent gender roles and the persistence of sexist stereotypes among teachers in training in Spain, to determine the reasons for them and suggest solutions for eradicating sexist prejudices. Design/methodology/approach: A gender role questionnaire was administered to 1260 workers from 54 different professions who were enrolled on a postgraduate training course to qualify as secondary education teachers. The instrument contained six variables for both quantitative and qualitative analysis: professional work, family (looking after children), feelings and emotions, household chores, body image and free time. Findings: Household chores, looking after children and gender roles linked to body image were those most indicated by both men and women. It is concluded that men participate little in bringing up children and household chores and that women continue to shoulder the responsibility. Both are concerned about their body image, but women have little self-acceptance of and satisfaction with their bodies and a stronger sense of being judged by how they look. Gender stereotypes persist, despite extensive legislation in Spain since 2004. Research limitations/implications: The study has limitations deriving from its choice of convenience sampling. Although it includes participants from six Spanish autonomous communities, the number from each region is not very high. Nevertheless, the sample is representative of almost all branches of knowledge (54 professions). Another limitation concerns the images used in the research instrument as a data collection strategy insofar, as they could not be obtained from a data bank specific to the research subject but instead had to be found in databases of general images. It can be inferred that a data collection strategy without any danger of bias would be to encourage each participant to design their own images, reflecting their perceptions and auto-perceptions of gender roles and stereotypes. The fact that there were no pre-existing studies using this type of research instrument in education sciences was a handicap for the investigation. Despite these methodological limitations, the results of the study may serve as a basis for implementing specific future actions originating from any area – but especially from the area of education – aimed at teaching people about equal roles in order to eliminate sexist sterotypes. This research was carried out as part of the Proyecto Diseño y Atención a las Oportunidades de Género en la Educación Superior (Project on Design and Gender Equality of Opportunities in Higher Education) funded by the Vicerrectorado de Cooperación al Desarrollo (Office for University Cooperation for Development) at the University of Alicante (Spain). Practical implications: Spanish legislation has not been able to promote significant changes in the performance of traditional gender roles or to eliminate sexist stereotypes that perpetuate imbalances between men and women. The ideal and prevalent model of a Spanish woman is still that of a “self-sacrificing mother”, responsible for the household chores and childcare. She must combine this first job with a second profession, and, in addition, she must have a “desirable physical image”. The study puts forward various possible solutions for reducing and/or eradicating sexist attitudes with the participation of different social agents and in particular through education. The investigation could be of use when carrying out specific cross-sectional interventions on the subject of gender equality with students on postgraduate teacher training courses, for the purposes of encouraging the elimination of stereotypes and strengthening the capacity for critical judgement, positive self-concept and self-esteem. Originality/value: The study may be useful for carrying out specific and transversal university training interventions in postgraduate teacher training on gender equality aimed at promoting the elimination of stereotypes, the strengthening of critical judgement capacity, positive self-concept and self-esteem. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The study deals with linguistic prejudices of citizens of the two main Russian cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg, toward speakers of foreign languages. It aims to reveal possible recent changes in the language ideology dominating Russian society. Monolingual and linguistically normative orientations rooted in the Soviet ideological approach are being challenged nowadays by global processes of migration and cultural diversification, which influence the everyday reality of Russian megalopolises. The research is based on the analysis of two sets of data: (1) meta-discourse on language attitudes derived from interviews with labor migrants and native Russian speakers in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and posts and comments on issues of language, migration, and linguistic landscapes, collected from websites and social media and (2) linguistic landscape data collected in 2016-2019, mainly in St. Petersburg, which reflect recent changes in attitude toward linguistic diversity in public space. These data show, on the one hand, that most city dwellers still relate to monolingual speech norms and try to implement control over public space; on the other hand, that the tolerance toward multilingual communication has been increasing over the years. The study suggests that these "first cracks"in monolinguals facades of Russian cities could eventually lead to the establishing of a less rigid language regime. © 2020 Vlada Baranova and Kapitolina Fedorova, published by De Gruyter 2020.

AB  - Research suggests that exposure to stories about Black adults who are contributing positively to their community can reduce implicit pro-White/anti-Black racial bias in older children (ages 9–12). The aim of the current research was to replicate and extend this finding by investigating whether a different child-friendly manipulation exposing children to positive Black exemplars and negative White exemplars could decrease implicit pro-White/anti-Black racial bias in children aged 5 to 12 years, both immediately following the intervention and 1 hr later. In addition, a second aim of this research was to examine whether child-friendly positive exemplar exposure would similarly reduce adults’ implicit racial bias. In a sample of White and Asian Canadians (N = 478; 182 male, 296 female), recruited from a community science center (children) and a public university in Vancouver (adults), 9- to 12-year-old children's racial bias was reduced up to 1 hr after this new intervention, while the effectiveness of the intervention on 5- to 8-year-old children's bias was less clear. Interestingly, this intervention did not reduce adult levels of bias. The results of a follow-up study (N = 96; 23 male, 72 female, 1 nonbinary) indicate that exposure to child exemplars can reduce bias in adults, but only when additional instructions are provided to internalize the presented association. Thus, the current study provides evidence that depicting counterstereotypical exemplars can reduce implicit racial bias in children for up to 1 hr after exemplar exposure, but there may be important developmental differences in the conditions required to change this bias.

AB  - The increasing number of immigrant students on the Chilean educational system stresses the importance of study teachers’ attitudes to multiculturality in schools settings. Nevertheless, there is a lack of adequate measurement instruments to apply on Chilean population. The aim of this work was to validate the Attitude to Multiculturality at School Scale (León del Barco et al., 2007) on a Chilean sample, composed by N=160 teachers. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the unifactorial model had the best fit to the data. Correlation analysis revealed significant relations between attitude to multiculturality at school, perceived out-group threat and prejudice. Linear regression analysis showed that perceived threat and prejudice explained 42% of the attitude to multiculturality at school variability, supporting criterion validity. © 2021 Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that traces its earliest known cases to the Hubei region of China in late 2019. As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe wreaking unprecedented disruption, increasing levels of xenophobia and racial discrimination have been documented against those of Asian descent. We investigate the historical connections between disease and rise of xenophobia as described in the peer-reviewed literature addressing prior epidemics, such as Ebola and the Hong Kong Flu, in conjunction with concurrent cases of prejudice toward certain groups of people. Attempts to better understand why such attitudes emerge are examined in the context of xenophobic actions during pandemics. Prevailing views suggest that xenophobia ultimately leads to increased stigmatization of those afflicted by disease, which in turn leads to decreased trust in the medical system, resulting in a negative feedback loop. Accurate disseminated information and improved public education on sources and modes of transmission of infectious diseases are essential to check xenophobic tendencies, reduce negative effects and foster greater cooperation. © 2020 Weston Medical Publishing.

AB  - Research has consistently linked social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) to numerous forms of prejudice, but little research has examined how these personality and ideological variables interact in their associations with various attitudinal outcomes. The present study explored the interactions of SDO and RWA in predicting a wide range of social attitudes (i.e., modern racism, modern sexism, traditional gender role beliefs) and feeling thermometers toward racial/ethnic minorities, women, and other socially stigmatized groups in a cross-sectional survey of 1244 U.S. college students (Mage = 21.54; SD = 5.17). Moderation analyses found significant independent associations of SDO, RWA, or both with all attitudinal or ideological outcome variables. We found a hypothesized synergistic interaction of SDO x RWA in predicting attitudes toward women scores, but the results did not support other hypothesized SDO x RWA interactions. Findings provide further support of the Dual Process Model and suggest that SDO and RWA may employ largely independent pathways in predicting attitudes toward marginalized groups. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: Both adoption status and ethnic differences may contribute to stigmatization and microaggressions experienced by adopted individuals and their families. Internationally adopted children have been increasingly recognized to have elevated rates of special needs (SN), especially learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emotional-behavioral problems, and medical-physical issues. However, relatively little is known about the feelings, perceptions, and stigma experienced by families of internationally adopted children with SN. Methods: 461 French parents responded to a questionnaire (308 on-line, 153 paper) regarding their feelings and perceptions after international adoption (feelings of difference, ease of attachment, similarities to and dissimilarities from their child), as well as their views of their child's feelings and experiences (difference, exclusion, and prejudice). Parents were asked if their children were diagnosed by professionals as having special needs, specifically: (1) medical/physical conditions, (2) ADHD, (3) learning disabilities, or (4) emotional-behavioral difficulties. Results were compared for parents of children with or without SN. Results: The children (57%M; 43%F) of the parent respondents were adopted from 47 countries. The children were age (mean ± SD) 3.19 ± 2.59 years old at arrival and 11.33 ± 5.03 years old at the time of the survey. 301 (65%) parents reported that their child had at least one SN: physical-medical SN (13% of children) were reported significantly less often than the other 3 categories (ADHD 39%, learning disabilities 36%, emotional-behavioral problems 40%). Overall, parents reported 652 distinct SN among these 301 children: 102/301 (34%) had a diagnosis in a single category, whereas 199/301 (66%) had diagnoses in at least two categories. SN diagnoses varied by continent of origin: Eastern European children had proportionally more ADHD, learning disabilities, and emotional-behavior problems, as well as more diagnoses per child. Compared with parents of non-SN children, parents of SN children (especially those with learning disabilities or emotional-behavioral problems) significantly more often endorsed feelings of difference, more difficulties attaching to their child, and fewer similarities to and more dissimilarities from their child. The SN parents also more often reported that their child experienced exclusion and/or prejudice. The more SN diagnosed in their children, the more likely their parents’ feelings and perceptions differed from parents of children without SN. These relationships remained significant after controlling for arrival age, current age, gender, and adoption visibility, and after adjusting for exclusion due to adopted status or country of origin. Conclusions: Compared to adoptive parents of children without SN, parents of children with SN report differing patterns of perceptions and feelings. Child SN represent an additional burden for parents of internationally adopted children, and for their children's feelings and experiences (difference, exclusion, and prejudice, as reported by the parents). These perceptions and feelings are present, even when the SN are not physically obvious. SN must be recognized as an increasingly common, complex, and added dimension to the issues of adoptive status and (often) ethnic differences faced by internationally adopted children and their parents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper looks at the representation of inter-national mobility and immigrants in select works from Swedish author Henning Mankell’s Kurt Wallander series. Mankell’s works are set in Sweden, a country where despite exceptionally inclusive foreign policies lies fault lines within its very social exceptionalism. This challenges the complete denouement that is conventionally observed in the genre of detective fiction. Sweden’s geographical proximity with the Baltic countries makes its national boundaries porous, which enables the covert extremist factions to surface and function globally. Illegal human trafficking, followed by the absence of any restriction in compliance with the social welfare state allows one to blend in better, despite the rising anti-immigrant sentiments across the nation in the more recent years. This paper studies the underpinnings of geographical features in the constant run and chase, and how these boundaries are breached by the severity, rigidity, and interdependency of these morally fractured underground networks. Mankell’s Faceless Killers (1991) reveals nascent xenophobia provoked by the neo-Nazi remnants, which is supplemented by local projection of immigrants. These boundaries are further abused in The White Lioness (1993) which has Russian and African fugitives operating deeper networks of extremist groups that manifest an inexistent national security. The paper will reflect on the idea of an immigrant figure as potentially a victim, as a criminal. Finally, an engagement with the physical aspects of the represented urban spaces will facilitate a discussion on the (il)legality of immigration which punctures the welfare state now close to collapse. © AesthetixMS 2020.

AB  - The spiritual dimension of patients has progressively gained more relevance in healthcare in the last decades. However, the term “spiritual” is an open, fluid concept and, for health purposes, no definition of spirituality is universally accepted. Health professionals and researchers have the challenge to cover the entire spectrum of the spiritual level in their practice. This is particularly difficult because most healthcare courses do not prepare their graduates in this field. They also need to face acts of prejudice by their peers or their managers. Here, the authors aim to clarify some common grounds between secular and religious worlds in the realm of spirituality and healthcare. This is a conceptual manuscript based on the available scientific literature and on the authors’ experience. The text explores the secular and religious intersection involving spirituality and healthcare, together with the common ground shared by the two fields, and consequent clinical implications. Summarisations presented here can be a didactic beginning for practitioners or scholars involved in health or behavioural sciences. The authors think this construct can favour accepting the patient’s spiritual dimension importance by healthcare professionals, treatment institutes, and government policies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Increases in cultural and religious diversity have led to calls for toleration of differences, although it is unclear how calling for toleration impacts people’s affective and attitudinal responses. The present research conducted in a small western nation examines if calling for toleration of Muslim minority practices elicits an aggressive backlash against the group amongst those relatively conservative, using relative left frontal EEG activity to examine the motivational processes involved. Non-Muslim participants from New Zealand (N = 172) self-reported their political orientation before being randomly assigned to a toleration or control condition involving writing and reflection tasks about Muslims. Participants then evaluated various groups including Muslims while EEG was recorded. Results revealed that among those relatively conservative, toleration produced higher levels of relative left frontal activity, which in turn led to more negative evaluations of Muslims (relative to control participants). However, for those relatively liberals, toleration had no impact on neuropsychological or attitudinal responses relative to controls. Collectively, these findings suggest that intergroup toleration may backfire amongst those relatively conservative, undermining its intended purpose. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Despite growing recognition among journalists and political pundits, the concept of victimhood has been largely ignored in empirical social science research. In this article, we develop a theory about, and use unique nationally-representative survey data to estimate, two manifestations of victimhood: an egocentric one entailing only perceptions of one’s own victimhood, and one focused on blaming “the system.” We find that these manifestations of victimhood cut across partisan, ideological, and sociodemographic lines, suggesting that feelings of victimhood are confined to neither “actual” victims nor those partisans on the losing side of elections. Moreover, both manifestations of victimhood, while related to candidate support and various racial attitudes, prove to be distinct from related psychological constructs, such as (collective) narcissism, system justification, and relative deprivation. Finally, an experiment based on candidate rhetoric demonstrates that some political messaging can make supporters feel like victims, which has consequences for subsequent attitudes and behavior. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study examined the relations among social dominance orientation (SDO), social contact, and attitudes toward international students. SDO was positively associated with prejudice against international students, perception of threats from international students, and exclusionism. Men had a higher level of SDO than women, but SDO had a greater effect on female exclusionism. The results show that SDO did not directly predict a general attitude toward international students. Prejudice predicted unfavorable attitudes, but threat perception and exclusionism did not, indicating that the mechanism underlying the effect of SDO on attitudes toward international students was through prejudice rather than threat perception and exclusionism. The negative effect of prejudice remained after controlling for the effect of social contact. However, social contact contributed to a favorable attitude toward international students. Both the number of international-student friends and personal relations with them had positive effects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Modern societies and organisations are becoming increasingly diverse, leading many to argue that diversity should be valued because it can benefit teams, organisations and societies more widely. Considerable attention in both organisational and social psychological research has been devoted to so-called pro-diversity beliefs (i.e. the idea that diversity has an instrumental value to groups), and the consequences of these for various outcomes. In this paper, we focus on the role and relevance of PDBs in understanding intergroup relations, and review research on antecedents, consequences, and correlates thereof. We introduce the concept of PDBs more generally before drawing a more directed focus on interethnic relations, thereby contextualising PDBs within theorising on interethnic ideologies and approaches to diversity more generally. Moreover, we delineate potential strategies to facilitate PDBs but also outline boundary conditions, before ending with a discussion of recommendations concerning the practical implications of research on PDBs. © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - This research set out to examine if a critical literacy pedagogy can help student teachers better understand how inequity is reproduced in the field of education. These issues were explored using Bourdieu's (1977) distinctive concepts that frame literacy as an ideological act, an act of misrecognition that results in ‘symbolic violence’. The study took place in a small, specialist teacher education college in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The methodological design was based on action research supported by semi-structured interviews pre- and post- intervention. For the action research, a semester-long, pre-existing undergraduate literacy course was restructured to embed critical literacy. A group of eight self-selecting third year student teachers participated in the research project. Findings reveal that the students held beliefs that tended to conflate poverty with prejudicial stereotyping and attribution of fault to others who are located differently in the social world. Underpinning this was unquestioning acceptance of the education system. Acquiring a sociological, specifically a critical literacy perspective I conclude can help nurture student teachers’ ideas and understanding about teaching for social justice. © 2020

AB  - This paper brings an ethnographic experience to bear on the existing research field of school bullying, rounding out our understanding by focusing on an essential aspect: children’s culture. Based on 14 months of fieldwork and a close analysis of the case of Anat, a 9-year-old victim of bullying, the paper identifies a unique formation of school bullying with no leading bully. Drawing from theoretical approaches which focus on pupils’ everyday life, the paper asserts that bullying without a leading bully is rooted in children’s culture which effectively enforces bullying as a binding norm by constructing its object as disgusting. The paper explores how disgust shapes school bullying into a collective omnipresent rejection. It also discusses intervention programmes and suggests that within such a social position, one practice to consider would be transferring to a new environment where bullied pupils will not be forced to cope with collectively enforced prejudices. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: Perceived discrimination is associated with chronic pain and depression and contributes to racial health disparities. In a cohort of older adult veterans with osteoarthritis (OA), our objective was to examine how membership in multiple socially disadvantaged groups (cumulative disadvantage) was associated with perceived discrimination, pain, and depression. We also tested whether perceived discrimination mediated the association of cumulative disadvantage with depression and pain. Methods: We analyzed baseline data from 270 African American veterans and 247 White veterans enrolled in a randomized controlled trial testing a psychological intervention for chronic pain at 2 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. Participants were age ≥50 years and self-reported symptomatic knee OA. Measures included the Everyday Discrimination Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale, and demographic variables. Cumulative disadvantage was defined as the number of socially disadvantaged groups to which each participant belonged (i.e., self-reported female sex, African American race, annual income of <$20,000, and/or unemployed due to disability). We used linear regression models and Sobel’s test of mediation to examine hypotheses. Results: The mean ± SD number of social disadvantages was 1.3 ± 1.0. Cumulative disadvantage was significantly associated with higher perceived discrimination, pain, and depression (P < 0.001 for all). Perceived discrimination significantly mediated the association between cumulative disadvantage and depression symptoms (Z = 3.75, P < 0.001) as well as pain severity (Z = 2.24, P = 0.025). Conclusion: Perceived discrimination is an important psychosocial stressor that contributes to worsening OA-related mental and physical health outcomes, with greater effects among those from multiple socially disadvantaged groups. © 2020, American College of Rheumatology.

AB  - We review a 40-year corpus of research that we collectively name “Multiple Categorisation Theory” (MCT). From early illustrations using the minimal group paradigm, through a focus on how people cognitively represent social diversity, to recent models of outgroup “re-humanisation”, this work has revealed much about how we think about inclusivity, exclusion, and intergroup differences. We review research that assessed ways to reduce intergroup bias by attenuating the reliance on simple categorisation via “crossed categorisation”. We describe how this research evolved from a focus on intergroup differences to incorporate self-categorisation, through processes of decategorisation and increased social identity complexity. Finally, we consider contemporary models that reveal the generalised benefits of multiple categorisation in promoting outgroup “re-humanisation” through “cognitive liberalisation”. We conclude by highlighting the theoretical and practical implications of this research programme. © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - Objectives: There is important variation in beliefs about immigration within the publics of immigrant-receiving societies but empirical social research has largely overlooked it. The “imagined immigration” concept aims to bring these beliefs back in as an important component of public attitudes toward immigrants. It also offers a new perspective on the political conflict around immigration that persists despite the consensus on desired qualities of potential immigrants among citizens in industrial democracies. Methods: I review the imagined immigration concept and present new empirical evidence in its favor using original survey studies in the United States and Britain. Results: I describe respondents’ beliefs about immigrants, demonstrate their association with partisanship, and confirm that these beliefs are significantly related to perceptions of immigration as harmful—even when controlled for partisanship, ideology, and ethnocentrism. Conclusion: I corroborate the foundations of the imagined immigration concept and discuss its promise and limitations. © 2020 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - As cities and states implement social distancing guidelines to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, one concern is that the social construction of race, and the privileges inherent to those constructions, influence how and when to enforce social distancing. In this theoretical paper, we discuss why Black people may be at a greater risk for police intervention when not abiding by public health guidelines. We also describe the importance of considering how Whiteness, in addition to anti-Blackness, may influence how and when public health guidelines are enforced. Finally, we consider how disparate public health policing related to COVID-19 is situated in a broader historical and global context. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Literature on intergroup contact shows that in the absence of the required structural conditions, contact is not necessarily always a positive experience and that when it is negative, it can lead to heightened conflict and increased prejudice toward outgroups. Therefore, this article examines intergroup contact between Muslims and non-Muslims. Specifically, we examine the experiences of intergroup contact involving young Muslims in Australia and ask how these encounters impact their experiences of discrimination and perceptions of Australian society. We conducted face-to-face, semi-structured interviews to collect rich, qualitative data from young Muslim Australian participants who live in Melbourne, a major cosmopolitan hub, where intergroup contact experiences are likely to be diverse and occur daily. Our findings show that even when met with prejudice and discrimination, young Muslim Australians were able to critically engage with and change the views of non-Muslim Australians through dialogue and creative exchanges about circulating public discourse. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - HIV remains one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity among women of reproductive age; given the risk of vertical transmission to the fetus, timely prevention, monitoring and management are imperative (Melaku et al. [2014]. Causes of death among females-investigating beyond maternal causes: A community-based longitudinal study. BMC Research Notes, 7(1), 629. https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-7-629).

The Daily Star. https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Dec-02/279570-around-3750-hivaidscases-in-lebanon.ashx). We conducted a retrospective review of women who delivered at a tertiary academic hospital in Beirut between January 2016-Decemeber 2017 to assess prenatal HIV screening practices. In total, 1500 charts were randomly selected and reviewed: 137 (9%) women were screened for HIV, 2 (1.5%) tested positive. Odds rations were calculated for screening in relation to religion, parity, previous abortions, and mode of delivery: none were significant. No one was tested for Gonorrhoea and Chlamydia; 1250 (93.8%) were tested for Hepatitis B, 27 (1.9%) for Hepatitis C, 7 (0.5%) for HSV and, 74(5.3%) for Syphilis. Barriers to screening may include: Lack of consensus on mandated screening policy, HIV stigma, physician and patient prejudice and misconception of risk and, financial barriers as health insurance does not cover HIV screening. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Event programmes are typically designed with a target audience in mind, and such design can inherently signal inclusion or exclusion of marginalised segments. This is particularly the case for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) individuals, whose sexual and gender identities position them as an invisible minority on the periphery of society. Given the role of events in building community spirit, it is essential to ensure all members of a community feel able to participate in order to create a sense of belonging, fulfilling Sustainable Development Goals of inclusivity in community. Through the lens of Social Dominance Theory and in pursuit of equality for LGBTIQ+ communities, in-depth interviews were conducted with sexually diverse (queer) participants to explore their perceptions of inclusivity at community events. This study explored how elements of an event could serve to enhance or attenuate prejudice, and therefore influence the inclusion of LGBTIQ+ communities. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Gatekeepers’ tipping-off serves as a crucial first line of defense in safeguarding individuals and society from emerging, severe deviant behaviors. The present research provides a theoretically driven, quantitative approach in examining a gatekeeper’s decision to tip-off a deviant close-other to the authorities. We draw inspiration from motivation science and propose a dual-factor model with desirability and feasibility forming two distinct mediating pathways through which a range of personal and situational factors predict gatekeepers’ reporting intentions. In four studies (N = 1142), we demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the model across diverse deviant behaviors (racial prejudice, addictive gambling and violent extremism) and populations (Asians vs. Americans). We also provide evidence of the theoretical utility of the model in (1) differentiating complex motives underlying gatekeepers’ reporting, (2) arbitrating competing theoretical accounts of reporting and (3) demonstrating a synergistic interaction between desirability and feasibility. The present research underscores the value of applying a motivation science perspective to enhance understanding of gatekeepers’ decision-making process and offers empirically based suggestions for designing relevant crime-reporting interventions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus. However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examined characteristics of cisgender people who use non-traditional sexual orientation labels and investigated minority stress in these groups. Pansexual (n = 160), queer (n = 80), and asexual (n = 98) participants were compared with heterosexual (n = 1,021), bisexual (n = 1,518), and lesbian/gay (n = 2,730) individuals recruited from a cross-sectional survey. Participants were compared on sexual attraction, age, gender and childhood gender nonconformity. Hierarchical regression models with psychological distress as the dependent variable and outness, prejudice events, expectations of rejection, self-stigma, and rumination as independent variables were then tested in pansexual, queer, and asexual individuals. Sexual attraction, age, gender and recalled childhood gender nonconformity were significant predictors of group identity. Pansexual individuals were not significantly distinct from bisexual individuals in sexual attraction. Queer individuals fell between bisexual and lesbian/gay individuals in sexual attraction scores. Prejudice events and rumination were significantly associated with distress in all three non-traditional groups. Rumination scores attenuated the relationship between prejudice events and distress in all groups. These findings help characterize pansexual, asexual and queer individuals and suggest indirect effects of prejudice events on distress via rumination represent a worthy avenue for future minority stress research in these groups. © 2020 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

AB  - This study is part of the QuamMELOT Erasmus+ Project, whose objective is to improve the educational and social inclusion of immigrant minors in general and unaccompanied foreign minors (UFM), through an online course for secondary school teachers with this type of students. This paper aims to analyse the stereotypes and prejudices about immigrant students in secondary education in three European countries: Spain, Greece and Italy. For this purpose, a content analysis of the products generated during the course by teachers has been carried out with a cross-sectional and structured methodology, focused on a descriptive-interpretative analysis according to the qualitative paradigm. The results show an increase in xenophobic statements as perceived by teachers. They believe that this is due to the impact of the global phenomenon of migration on the media, which affects everyday conversations, and a climate of fear exacerbated by populist voices in the political sphere. Moreover, through the analysis of the exercises proposed in the real class through the online course, it is interesting to observe the diversity of the students' reactions to a literary exercise that proposes a controversy about the "colonial difference" that still persists today. There is likewise awareness among teachers of a lack of methodological strategies to break down the prejudices and stereotypes that exist in their classrooms. It also highlights the need to raise awareness in the classroom about this danger, which is at the root of the principles of acceptance and multiculturalism on which Europe is founded. © 2021, Ozgen Korkmaz.

AB  - We studied the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation processes of Syrian refugees in Turkey using semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews among 15 participants. The study explored the themes and issues emerging in the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation processes such as life-satisfaction, contact with the host community and future plans of Syrian adults. Berry's acculturation model (1997) is used to form the theoretical basis of this research. Our findings revealed that psychological and socio-cultural adaptation of Syrian refugees are strongly influenced by economic concerns, pre-migration expectations, religion and perceptions of Turkish natives’ expectations/ attitudes towards Syrians. From the perspective of the informants, economic concerns and uncertainty regarding duration of stay have a negative impact on refugees’ acculturation, leading to delayed psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. Positive perceptions of Turkish natives’ expectations/ attitudes towards Syrians are perceived to increase motivation to seek social support, which promotes well-being and life satisfaction in Turkey. Yet, negative perceptions such as prejudice and discrimination, may pose a risk for psychological health and low socio-cultural adaptation. One major finding of the paper is the two-fold impact of religion on Syrian refugees: Religion can be considered a binding/ equalizing function subsuming refugee and native groups under a superordinate identity. Nonetheless, it also appears to generate social distance when perceived as a threat to the secular national identity. The findings of this research can be used to minimize factors that undermine favorable acculturation outcomes and promote factors that facilitate high levels of psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Negative stereotypes about older adults are increasing and contributing to a shortage of professionals in gerontology. Building on the PEACE model (Positive Education about Aging and Contact Experiences), two experiments used education to address stereotypes associated with older adults. Participants were randomly assigned to read brief articles that: challenged stereotypes about older adults (condition 1), challenged stereotypes about careers working with older adults (condition 2), challenged both stereotypes (condition 3), or described careers in general (control; condition 4). In Study 1, 399 undergraduates in all 3 experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported lower levels of ageism, more positive age perceptions, and more aging knowledge in an immediate and delayed (1–2 weeks) post-test. In Study 2, 446 national community participants (ages 18– 25) in all experimental conditions (vs. control participants) reported greater positive age perceptions, aging knowledge, and interest in psychology and social work careers with older adults in an immediate post-test. These findings highlight the promise of using brief online methods to challenge stereotypes, provide more positive and accurate views of aging and older adults, and increase interest in careers working with older adults. Implications are discussed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We review recent research investigating the effect of shared human values on personal and social outcomes. Using more precise methods than past research, cross-sectional and experimental evidence suggests that well-being and prejudice are predicted by the extent to which people’s values align (or are perceived to align) with those of other people around them. Importantly, this research shows that these effects depend on the type of values being considered and are more nuanced than prior research suggests. For example, well-being is higher among individuals who perceive their fellow citizens to share their values of power and achievement. Prejudice against immigrants is higher among individuals who value conservation more but perceive immigrants to value openness. Moreover, experimentally highlighting actual value similarities rather than mean differences improves attitudes towards outgroups. We discuss how future studies can improve our understanding of value similarity effects and their underlying mechanisms. © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - Research Suggests That Some People, Particularly Those On The Political Right, Tend To Blatantly Dehumanize Low-Status Groups. However, These Findings Have Largely Relied On Self-Report Measures, Which Are Notoriously Subject To Social Desirability Concerns. To Better Understand Just How Widely Blatant Forms Of Intergroup Dehumanization Might Extend, The Present Article Leverages An Unobtrusive, Data-Driven Perceptual Task To Examine How U.S. Respondents Mentally Represent “Americans” Versus “Arabs” (A Low-Status Group In The United States That Is Often Explicitly Targeted With Blatant Dehumanization). Data From 2 Reverse-Correlation Experiments (Original N = 108; Preregistered Replication N = 336) And 7 Rating Studies (N = 2,301) Suggest That U.S. Respondents’ Mental Representations Of Arabs Are Significantly More Dehumanizing Than Their Representations Of Americans. Furthermore, Analyses Indicate That This Phenomenon Is Not Reducible To A General Tendency For Our Sample To Mentally Represent Arabs More Negatively Than Americans. Finally, These Findings Reveal That Blatantly Dehumanizing Representations Of Arabs Can Be Just As Prevalent Among Individuals Exhibiting Low Levels Of Explicit Dehumanization (E.G., Liberals) As Among Individuals Exhibiting High Levels Of Explicit Dehumanization (E.G., Conservatives)—A Phenomenon Into Which Exploratory Analyses Suggest Liberals May Have Only Limited Awareness. Taken Together, These Results Suggest That Blatant Dehumanization May Be More Widespread Than Previously Recognized And That It Can Persist Even In The Minds Of Those Who Explicitly Reject It © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - It has recently been argued that subjective status–the way individuals feel about their worth in society–deserves greater prominence in accounts of political preferences including anti-immigration sentiment and Brexit. In this paper, we give a detailed empirical account of the relationship between Subjective Social Status (SSS) and Brexit-related preferences, using data collected online in the autumn of 2017 (N = 3600). We find limited evidence that ‘objective’ dimensions of status translate into preferences via SSS. Rather, most of the effect of education and social class on political preferences is direct (or via another unmeasured mechanism). We propose that SSS has a role in norm compliance and demonstrate that high SSS among the university-educated and among those with high-status social ties is associated with a higher probability of voting leave in the referendum, as well as higher levels of anti-immigrant sentiment. Thus, we conclude that if SSS has a role in shaping populist preferences, it is more complex than has been assumed. It exerts an effect in the opposite direction to the expected one among the privileged, and does not appear to explain the preferences of the ‘left behind’. © 2020 Academy of Social Sciences.

AB  - During the COVID-19 crisis in March/April of 2020, far-right American political leaders and pundits proffered xenophobic explanations for the pandemic while ignoring that poorer, Black Americans and prison populations were being disproportionately infected. We propose such xenophobic and racist evaluations of COVID-19 drew from and appealed to a pervasive and politically strategic ethnoreligious ideology—white Christian nationalism. Panel data fielded before and during the COVID-19 crisis show that Christian nationalism was invariably the strongest predictor that Americans felt it was not racist to call COVID-19 “the Chinese virus”, blamed minorities for their own disproportionate infection rate, favoured immigration restrictions to solve the pandemic, and minimized or justified the infections of prison inmates. Racial identity also moderated Christian nationalism’s effect such that it was typically a more powerful influence among whites compared to Blacks. Findings affirm that racist and xenophobic views promulgated during the COVID-19 crisis were undergirded by white Christian nationalism. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Implicit intergroup biases are automatically activated prejudices and stereotypes that may influence judgments of others on the basis of group membership. We review evidence on the measurement of implicit intergroup biases, finding: implicit intergroup biases reflect the personal and the cultural, implicit measures vary in reliability and validity, and implicit measures vary greatly in their prediction of explicit and behavioral outcomes due to theoretical and methodological moderators. We then discuss three challenges to the application of implicit intergroup biases to real-world problems: (1) a lack of research on social groups of scientific and public interest, (2) developing implicit measures with diagnostic capabilities, and (3) resolving ongoing ambiguities in the relationship between implicit bias and behavior. Making progress on these issues will clarify the role of implicit intergroup biases in perpetuating inequality. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - To gain insights into social integration of second- and third-generation immigrant youth in Dutch secondary schools, we examined the two sides: immigrant youth's attitudes toward the societal majority and the societal majority youth's attitudes toward immigrants, while taking into account immigrant youth's diverse cultural backgrounds. The sample included Dutch-born Turkish (n = 187), Moroccan (n = 188), and Surinamese (n = 164) adolescents as well as societal majority youth (n = 2,141) across 169 classrooms in 92 Dutch secondary schools. School-based exposure to, and friendships with relevant out-group classmates were examined separately as predictors of out-group attitudes. Also, the mediational function of out-group friendships, i.e., immigrant respectively societal majority, on the association between exposure and attitudes was tested. The results varied between immigrant and societal majority youth, as well as across the cultural groups. Overall, out-group exposure was found to benefit all immigrant adolescents’ attitudes toward the societal majority. For societal majority adolescents, however, the association between exposure, friendships and attitudes differed based on the relevant out-group. This study highlights the nuances between immigrant groups and between immigrant and societal majority groups’ attitudes toward one another. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The ‘competitive threat’ theoretical model leads to the expectation that flows of documented and undocumented immigrants, economic downturns, and spread of conservative-nationalist ideologies would increase opposition to immigration. Recent studies on attitudes toward immigrants in American society do not show any increase in anti-immigrant sentiment. In the present study, we use data from the General Social Surveys (GSS) and American National Election Survey (ANES) to study change in opposition to immigration between 1996 and 2018. The findings obtained from the two data sources are strikingly similar and lead to the following conclusions. First, opposition to immigration had steadily and monotonously declined throughout the period. Second, the decline is evident even after considering variations and changes in the composition of the population, shifts in political ideologies, regional variations and cohort replacement. Third, the trend of decline in opposition to immigration takes a linear form. Fourth, opposition to immigration is stronger among Republicans and Independent voters than among Democrats. Fifth, the overtime decline in opposition to immigration was evident mostly among supporters of the Democratic Party increasing the division along party lines. The findings suggest that immigration is becoming a major political issue that is steadily polarizing American society. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Years of declining support for democracy and the election of leaders with authoritarian characteristics in liberal-democracies continues to trouble scholars. Current narratives may understate the importance of nativist beliefs in these developments by treating this as a byproduct of broader political movements. I contribute to the understanding of nativism’s role in democratic beliefs by arguing for isolating nativism from broader political movements when studying its consequences. Even when controlling for populism, far-right political affiliation, and important national-level variables, anti-immigrant sentiment is significantly associated with increased illiberal-democratic political preferences and decreased evaluations of the importance of living in a democracy. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study aims to understand how student teachers think about poverty in the context of rising rates of child poverty as they begin their initial teacher education (ITE). Globally, increasing numbers of school-age children living in poverty is a pressing concern for teachers. Previous research has suggested that student teachers may hold negative stereotypical attitudes towards children and families living in poverty, which may influence their future professional practice. However, given the importance of ITE as a site for teacher preparation, there is a need for further research into student teachers’ views of poverty in the context of increasing levels of child poverty. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a survey questionnaire comprising closed response and open-ended questions, and analysed using descriptive statistical techniques and thematic analysis, respectively. Our findings suggest that, on entry to their ITE, the student teachers in this study largely held ‘multidimensional’ understandings of poverty. The student teachers also recognise poverty as a real issue affecting children and young people. These findings offer insights for initial teacher preparation in view of the challenges emerging from increased rates of child poverty. © 2020 International Review of Finance Ltd.

AB  - Country-level structural stigma, defined as prejudiced population attitudes and discriminatory legislation and policies, has been suggested to compromise the wellbeing of sexual minority adults. This study explores whether and how structural stigma might be associated with sexual minorities’ school-based and adulthood experiences of victimization and adulthood life satisfaction. Using a sample of 55,263 sexual minority individuals (22% female; 53% 18–29 years old; 85% lesbian/gay, 15% bisexual) living across 28 European countries and a country-level index of structural stigma, results show that sexual minorities, especially men, reported school bullying in both higher- and lower-stigma countries. Higher rates of school bullying were found among sexual minorities living in higher-stigma countries when open about their identity at school. Past exposure to school bullying was associated with lower adulthood life satisfaction, an association partially explained by an increased risk of adulthood victimization. These findings suggest that sexual minorities living in higher-stigma countries might benefit from not being open about their sexual identity at school, despite previously established mental health costs of identity concealment, because of the reduced risk of school bullying and adverse adulthood experiences. These results provide one of the first indications that structural stigma is associated with sexual minority adults’ wellbeing through both contemporaneous and historical experiences of victimization. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Given the aggressive behaviours and negative attitudes associated with hegemonic masculinity, and the fact that men are more likely to commit violent crimes than are women, people might choose to avoid men displaying characteristics consistent with hegemonic masculinity. In a vignette-based study, we assessed whether the gender of a person displaying behaviours and attitudes consistent with hegemonic masculinity influenced people’s desire for social distance. Further, we explored whether the relationship between hegemonic masculinity and social distance was mediated by perceived dangerousness. A fictitious man displaying attitudes and behaviours consistent with hegemonic masculinity was perceived to be more dangerous than a woman displaying the same characteristics, and an increase in perceived dangerousness was associated with a desire for greater social distance. Once this was removed from the direct path, there was no link between the gender of the fictitious individual and social distance, indicating that people do not desire greater social distance from men but from anyone exhibiting ‘toxic’ attitudes and behaviours. The findings have important clinical implications, highlighting the role social connections play in changing prejudiced attitudes and recovery from depression. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although several studies have examined outgroup empathy, the link between trait empathy and outgroup attitudes has been underinvestigated. In the present study this link was investigated among two samples of ethnic Dutch preadolescents (N = 335, Mage  = 10.83 years, SD = 0.94; 53% girls; N = 326; Mage  = 10.53 years, SD = 1.03; 48% girls). It examined children’s parallel empathy in relation to their ethnic attitudes, and the moderating role of perceived peer norms. Results (partly) support the hypotheses that empathy is associated with more outgroup positivity and less ingroup bias (ingroup minus outgroup attitude). The negative link between empathy and outgroup bias was stronger when peers were perceived to be more biased against the outgroup. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This article concerns the relationship between social context, identity and intergroup relations. It reviews early formulations pertaining to contextual influences and proceeds to examine vitality theory, specifically, ethnolinguistic vitality (EV). The ensuing discussion considers objective aspects of EV such as the demographic representation of a group and delineates multiple influences modulating their impact on intergroup relations. Subjective formulations of EV focusing on how it is perceived are then examined in view of their interaction with intergroup issues such as ideologies, the formation of networks and language loss. While acknowledging the wide conceptual girth of EV, a central intergroup issue remains communication. Following through, issues pertaining to language acquisition are therefore scrutinized as they relate to EV, linguistic identification, and motivation. A parallel is drawn with Bourdeusian approaches, which orient the analysis toward the dynamics of power and investment. Specifically, attention is directed to ideological and identity processes underpinning the learner’s involvement in the learning task. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the concept of global English as well as the necessity for a framework of contextual factors reaching beyond intrapsychic constructs. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Studies involving the manipulation of instructions regarding the negative characteristics of a group or comparisons with members of another group (explicit activation of stereotypes) have shown that age, weight, and gender stereotypes can be harmful to motor performance and learning. To date, however, no study has observed whether implicit stereotype threats, such as the sex of the coach or experimenter, can also influence the acquisition of motor skills. In the present study, the individual and combined impact of implicit and explicit influences of gender stereotype on women’s soccer performance and learning was examined. In a 2 × 2 design, 60 women were divided into four groups according to the presence or absence of explicit (ES) and implicit (IS) stereotypes: ES/IS, ES, IS, and control. The groups with implicit activation practiced in the presence of a male experimenter. The groups with explicit activation received instructions activating the gender negative stereotype. The control group practiced without stereotype activations. The results showed that both explicit and implicit activation additively impaired soccer performance and learning, with both main effects being significant for practice and retention. The ES/IS group showed lower scores on the task relative to the other groups, while the ES and IS groups showed worse scores compared with the control group. The findings suggest that stigmatised populations may be forced to cope with more than one social identity threat while learning sport motor skills and indicate the importance of further studies testing strategies to minimise the deleterious effects of negative stereotypes. © 2020 European College of Sport Science.

AB  - This interdisciplinary essay combines science, social sciences, and the humanities to argue in favor of a less rigid understanding of the traditional gender binary of male and female. Relying on recent scientific studies on the sex/gender of the body (internal organs like the brain and chromosomal constitution, for example), this essay mentions results of scientific studies that challenge the binary understanding of gender. These studies point to a much more fluid biological spectrum of the binary male/female—to a trans fluid nature of gender. A less rigid understanding of the nature of gender of all human beings–not just those identified as trans sexual–might help in eradicating prejudices that lead to discrimination and harassment towards the trans community. As the public policy literature reviewed in this article documents, even with laws and policies to protect them from discrimination and harassment, the trans community is still subjected to both. One reason is that laws and policies are still subjected to the interpretation of policy makers and administrators whose decisions, consciously or not, are not immune to biases and prejudices. To further illustrate the scientifically proven trans fluid nature of gender, I will analyze two recent cultural products: One is from Latin America, the Chilean film “Una mujer fatástica,” and the second is an autobiographical essay by a transgender Chicano Professor of Women and Gender Studies—Francisco J. Galarte’s “Transitions: The Dolorous Return of a Chicana/o Transfronterizo.” By analyzing these two cultural products, my aim is to illustrate how these works illustrate gender fluidity in everyday life. © 2020 American Society for Public Administration.

AB  - This study explored Greek early childhood educators’ attitudes towards same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting. It was hypothesized that participants with more negative attitudes towards same-sex parenting will have more negative attitudes towards same-sex marriage as well. The associations between these attitudes and demographic, psychological and personality variables were also examined. Two standardized scales, attitudes towards same-sex marriage scale (ATSSM) and children’s adjustment in same-sex families (SBCASSF) were used to assess the educators’ beliefs. Two hundred (200) early childhood educators participated in the study (M age = 46.78, SD = 8.87). Results indicated that early childhood educators with more negative attitudes towards same-sex marriage were older, more experienced, highly religious, without any contact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+) individuals and had negative attitudes towards same-sex parenting. Multiple regression analysis showed that normative opposition (NO–subscale of SBCASSF) and contact with LGBTQ+ individuals were significant predictors of educators’ attitudes towards same-sex marriage. The results of this study could have an impact on reducing prejudice towards same-sex parented families in the education systems and contribute to their social inclusivity. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Lesbian women and gay men face many barriers to accomplish a parental project, including when seeking to adopt. In Portugal, same-sex couple’s adoption was recently allowed and we sought to understand adoption professionals’ perspectives regarding this issue. We conducted two focus groups with adoption professionals using a semi-structured interview script. We aimed to explore (i) the main challenges for adoption by LGs and same-sex couples; (ii) knowledge, skills, and personal beliefs regarding about these family settings; (iii) the importance of gender (couples, child) in the matching process; and (iv) topics to address in any training for this area. The participants’ discourses oscillated between a certain awareness of the prevailing social prejudice and discrimination toward sexual minorities on one hand and a heteronormative discourse on the other hand. Challenges in working with this population and training necessities were identified. Findings point to the need for guidelines for the home study of LG applicants and cultural competency training to deal with this population in three aspects: knowledge, skills, and awareness of personal attitudes. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article considers the predicament of a low-status Tuareg woman living close by her former master’s family in rural central Niger in 2010; for the family, she maintained the status of taklit (“slave descendant,” feminine singular of iklan), somewhere along the spectrum between paid family servant and domestic slave. Analysis focuses on why she and so many like her have not managed to improve their life chances by moving to town, despite the Nigerien ban on slavery. Relevant factors include her lack of a family support network, the continued impact of prejudice against former slaves, a fear of possibly worsening her economic standing via such a move, and the strong moral compulsion of ordained gender roles in contemporary Sahelian cities. Former mistresses/masters also resisted the departure of women like her from wealthy herding households because of their housework contribution and their crucial role in producing the next generation of workers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The current research investigated support for confronting a sexist comment and how responses in a work or social setting by a target or witness can influence actor perceptions. Across three studies, we demonstrated that although most people supported confrontation by a female target, she was evaluated less positively when confronting than passive, especially in a social versus professional context. In contrast, a male witness was evaluated more positively when confronting than passive, regardless of context. Notably, perceptions of the perpetrator of the comment were only influenced by the target’s response: with less positive evaluations when the target was confronting than passive, especially in the office. These findings contribute to understanding which responses and environments foster confrontation and reduce backlash. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: To investigate factors associated with the stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19 in the United States and factors that can mitigate or prevent stigmatization. Design: A national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Results: Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. Conclusions: Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public. Fostering collective efficacy and media-based contacts with Asian Americans can facilitate these efforts. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Older employees are not only confronted with subtle negative stereotypes about cognitive decline, but they also tend to internalize these negative stereotypes (i.e., they agree with the idea that intellectual performance declines in old age and they feel affected by this decline). Previous research has shown that internalizing negative age stereotypes has detrimental effects on work-related outcomes. Little is known about how internalized negative stereotypes shape older employees' social emotions and social motivation. In the present research, we argue that older adults who internalize negative age stereotypes feel insecure about their belongingness in the workplace and this has negative motivational consequences. Four out of five studies and an aggregate analysis with a total of N = 1,306 older employees (age 50-76 years) supported this hypothesis. Internalized age stereotypes were negatively related to social approach motivation toward coworkers through reduced sense of belonging in the workplace and low positive affect. In addition, internalized age stereotypes were positively related to social avoidance motivation. Investigations of the causality of these relationships revealed mixed results. We discuss these findings from the perspective of socioemotional aging and the need to belong. In sum, the present research adds to knowledge on the role of internalized negative stereotypes for older employees' social lives and, potentially, their success in the work domain. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The effects of virtual cooperative video games have not yet been explored within the setting of hostile intergroup contexts; nor have they been tested among school-aged children. We present results from a longitudinal school-based intervention that enabled virtual contact between Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Israeli children. The program included six virtual and two face-to-face sessions. We find that relative to an intragroup contact control group, children who participated in the intergroup program showed reduced intergroup bias on both cognitive and emotional indicators, including reduced stereotypical views, negative emotions and discriminatory tendencies toward members of the other ethnic group, as well as increased willingness to engage in social contact with outgroup members. These effects were long lasting and preserved six months after termination of the program. The intervention's effectiveness was consistent across measures, gender, and ethnic groups. Thus, the program we developed offers a feasible, relatively cost-effective gaming intervention that can be applied even in areas characterized by severe ethnic tension and hostile conflict. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Discrimination has persisted in our society despite steady improvements in explicit attitudes toward marginalized social groups. The most common explanation for this apparent paradox is that due to implicit biases, most individuals behave in slightly discriminatory ways outside of their own awareness (the dispersed discrimination account). Another explanation holds that a numerical minority of individuals who are moderately or highly biased are responsible for most observed discriminatory behaviors (the concentrated discrimination account). We tested these 2 accounts against each other in a series of studies at a large, public university (total N = 16,600). In 4 large-scale surveys, students from marginalized groups reported that they generally felt welcome and respected on campus (albeit less so than nonmarginalized students) and that a numerical minority of their peers (around 20%) engage in subtle or explicit forms of discrimination. In 5 field experiments with 8 different samples, we manipulated the social group membership of trained confederates and measured the behaviors of naïve bystanders. The results showed that between 5% and 20% of the participants treated the confederates belonging to marginalized groups more negatively than nonmarginalized confederates. Our findings are inconsistent with the dispersed discrimination account but support the concentrated discrimination account. The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Our results suggest that the Pareto principle also applies to discrimination, at least at the large, public university where the studies were conducted. We discuss implications for prodiversity initiatives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - This paper explores the link between memory and history ‘from below’ as well as the (non-) use of histories of past migration in Greece. It analyses how the memory of the 1920s Asia Minor refugees was guarded by Greek state over the course of time. It explores how state agents (historiography, education system, commemorations, etc.) acted as guardians of collective memory ‘from above’, presenting a rosy past that ignored the experiences of these refugees in Greece. It also examines how this process of constructing historical memory ‘from above’ (re)produced national belonging through homogeneity, without taking notice of refugees’ diversities or problems faced during their settlement in the social, cultural or economic space of Greece. The paper adopts a critical approach to the cultural and social spaces in which refugee memory was selectively constructed as the only past that has to be remembered, stored and recalled, and aims to rescue from oblivion memories that were condemned to silence in the contemporary national narrative. These silenced memories could help us to write a history ‘from below’ and find analogies with the experiences of contemporary refugee flows as well as to combat ever-present xenophobia, prejudice and racism in the present society. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As a form of leisure, Pride events offer LGBTQI+ people a chance to gain visibility, advocate for their rights, and construct and express their identity. The benefits such events offer are particularly crucial within rural communities, often perceived to be heteronormative spaces that may exhibit greater levels of prejudice against sexually and gender-diverse individuals. This paper examines the perceived social impacts Pride events can have within a rural community by studying an inaugural Pride event hosted in the Australian township of Wagga Wagga. Informed by an interpretivist approach and using a mix of participant observation and semi-structured interviews, the study found the event had three key outcomes. First, the event challenged assumptions about how acceptance of diverse sexualities and gender identities were in the town. Second, it appeared to help build community acceptance by providing a public space/time for LGBTQI+ individuals to be acknowledged as legitimate citizens. Finally, it contributed to identity construction and created opportunities for connection with other LGBTQI+ residents and the rural community more broadly. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Previous research concerned with British Muslim women has explored a range of important issues. However, what is missing is research exploring the lived everyday social experiences, including the unique nature of identity formation in British Muslims. This qualitative study tried to address this gap. Five female British Muslims were interviewed, and their interviews analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach. Three key themes emerged from the data: Constructing identity, Experiencing prejudice in interactions, and Educating oneself and others. The findings demonstrate the complex nature of being a British Muslim woman, the impact of discrimination from various sources and the gendered nature of these experiences. It also highlights the active nature of identity formation, which occurs within and relates to a particular setting and particular experiences. Implications and future research are discussed. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The results indicate the existence of various forms of microaggressions towards religion teachers at school. First, the article analyses the relation between RE teachers and the management within the school environment–therein parents, other teachers and students–concerning possible cases of discrimination activities, taking into account relevant variables (as professional experience, workplace). Then, it introduces examples of prejudices against this group and the institutional support suggested by the respondents on part of the state and the Church. © 2020 Christian Education.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of moral ingroup versus outgroup behavior on 5- and 6-year-olds’ and 8- and 9-year-olds’ own moral behavior (N = 296). After minimal group assignment, children in Experiment 1 observed adult ingroup or outgroup members engaging in prosocial sharing or antisocial stealing before they themselves had the opportunity to privately donate stickers or take away stickers from others. Older children shared more than younger children, and prosocial models elicited higher sharing. Surprisingly, group membership had no effect. Experiment 2 investigated the same question using peer models. Children in the younger age group were significantly influenced by ingroup behavior, whereas older children were not affected by group membership. Additional measures reveal interesting insights into how moral ingroup and outgroup behavior affects intergroup attitudes, evaluations, and choices. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Both electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed enhanced neural responses to perceived pain in same-race than other-race individuals. However, it remains unclear how neural responses in the sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective subsystems vary dynamically in the first few hundreds of milliseconds to generate racial ingroup favoritism in empathy for pain. We recorded magnetoencephalography signals to pain and neutral expressions of Asian and white faces from Chinese adults during judgments of racial identity of each face. We found that pain compared to neutral expressions of same-race faces induced early increased alpha oscillations in the precuneus/parietal cortices followed by increased alpha-band oscillations in the left anterior insula and temporoparietal junction. Pain compared to neutral expressions of other-race faces, however, induced early suppression of alpha-band oscillations in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices and left insular cortex. Moreover, decreased functional connectivity between the left sensorimotor cortex and left anterior insula predicted reduced subjective feelings of other-race suffering. Our results unraveled distinct patterns of modulations of neural dynamics of sensorimotor, affective, and cognitive components of empathy by interracial relationships between an observer and a target person, which provide possible brain mechanisms for understanding racial ingroup favoritism in social behavior. © 2020

AB  - Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an emerging pandemic with heightened concerns for people with compromised immune systems, including people living with HIV. Purpose In the absence of a vaccine, public health messaging to mitigate risks for COVID-19 primarily focuses on social distancing. Because people living with HIV commonly experience mistreatment associated with HIV, their response to social distancing may be complicated by psychosocial attitudes associated with COVID-19. Methods To evaluate these relationships, we conducted a rapid-response, cross-sectional survey with people living with HIV (N = 149) to assess social distancing practices, COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, COVID-19 xenophobic attitudes, HIV microaggressions, and concern over contracting COVID-19. Data were collected from participants enrolled in a larger ongoing study between March 30, 2020 and April 17, 2020. Results Results indicated that choosing to socially distance to reduce COVID-19 exposure was associated with COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, concerns of contracting COVID-19, and identifying as transgender. Likewise, social distancing imposed by others (e.g., cancelations and restrictions) was associated with concerns of contracting COVID-19. Conclusions Findings demonstrate that social distancing measures are related to concerns of contracting the virus and discriminatory attitudes toward those who are presumed to be living with COVID-19. These potentially negative psychosocial attitudes toward people perceived to have COVID-19 echo the discriminatory actions and attitudes that we continue to observe in HIV social sciences research. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2020.

AB  - Disgust has a social component in which others are perceived as more disgusting than the self. Key characteristics of this social component were examined in six experiments. Experiment 1 established the social disgust Implicit Association Test (SD-IAT) applicability for assessing social disgust. Results revealed a congruency effect, in which participants implicitly associated other-race strangers with disgusting stimuli. Experiment 2 explored whether the SD-IAT effect is the result of familiarity. Unfamiliar in-group and out-group members were presented in the IAT. Results were identical to those of Experiment 1. Experiments 3 (using intergroup stimuli) and 4 (using interpersonal stimuli) investigated whether the SD-IAT congruency effect stems from disgust directed at others or from self-liking. Results showed a larger congruency effect for social disgust than for self-liking. Experiments 5 and 6 investigated whether SD stems from an association between the non-self and either disgust or negative valence. Findings showed a larger SD-IAT congruency effect for disgust. The combined results delineate the core aspects of SD and show that it is a heterogeneous phenomenon, based on relative social categories, in which the non-self is perceived as disgusting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Common factors, such as the working alliance, positive expectations, and psychoeducation have been robustly related to outcome in studies of psychotherapy. As a multicomponent treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD), Mentalizationbased treatment (MBT) includes introductory group-based psychoeducation on core features of personality functioning, BPD, the treatment program and disorder-related personal management. Generally, few studies have investigated patients’ views on how psychoeducation works. This study aimed to explore their experience of the group-based psychoeducation. Twelve patients who had attended the introductory group-based psychoeducation in MBT participated. Qualitative interviews were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. MBT psychoeducation was found helpful in itself and in the further treatment process. Identified experiences related to the group (feeling less ashamed, learning from others, feeling different from others), acquisition of “tools” for better personal management (the psychoeducational content; putting new knowledge into practice), preparation for longer term therapy(therapy became more trustworthy, easier to understand, felt more effective), and demanding aspects (problems with attendance or concentration). This qualitative study is the first to present patients’ own experiences of psychoeducation as part of MBT and suggests that psychoeducation is a powerful and facilitating intervention. Careful patient selection may further optimize its potential. © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - Aim: The diabetes and obesity fields have called for attention to the harmful role of stigma in obesity and diabetes, especially given that little is known about the extent and nature of diabetes stigma facing adults with type 2 diabetes, or the experience of weight stigma in this population. This study addresses this research gap by examining the prevalence and demographic correlates of weight stigma and diabetes stigma in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Adults (N = 1212, Mage = 52) with type 2 diabetes living in the USA were recruited by a healthcare-oriented market research firm, and completed online questionnaires to assess their experiences with weight stigma and diabetes stigma, as well as their internalization of both forms of stigma. Rates of stigma and sociodemographic correlates (years with type 2 diabetes, age, education, income, gender, race and BMI) were examined. Results: More than half of participants reported prior experiences of weight stigma, and 40–60% reported experiencing weight stigma in a healthcare context. Participants reported frequent experiences with diabetes-related stigma including blame and judgement, self-stigma and differential treatment. Women reported more weight stigma than men, and White women appeared particularly at risk for experiencing weight and diabetes related stigma relative to Black women. Conclusions: Individuals with type 2 diabetes reported higher rates of weight stigma than the general population, experienced high rates of diabetes-related stigma, and many internalized these forms of stigma. Increased attention to stigma reduction is essential to ensuring equitable care for individuals with type 2 diabetes. © 2020 Diabetes UK

AB  - Prior research on the effect of religion on prejudicial attitudes against sexual minorities has looked into how religion may influence public attitudes towards homosexual behaviours, gay marriage, and same-sex adoption. However, less is known about how religion may influence employment discrimination against gays in the education industry where prejudice and discrimination against gays frequently occur. Using the 1993–2018 cumulative General Social Survey data merged with county and state-level demographic and religious data of the United States, this study finds that individuals are more likely to favour banning homosexual men from teaching in college when county-level evangelical Protestant homogeneity increases. By contrast, when a county has a higher concentration of Catholics, individuals are less likely to endorse such discriminatory action, regardless of their own individual religious affiliation. This study contributes to a growing trend of research examining religious moral communities beyond its most general form–the overall church membership rates. Instead, as the results suggest, religious moral communities are multi-dimensional and the extent to which a religion dominates a geographic area may have a broad social impact on the whole community. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Perception of mattering may be especially important for those who are more likely to be the object of negative stereotypes, such as members of minority groups. The present study aimed to analyse the relationship between perceived mattering to family and friends, metastereotypes, and well-being among two minority groups: people living with HIV (PLWHA) and people with disabilities (PWDs). Of 100 participants, 39 were living with HIV and 61 were individuals with disabilities. Multiple regression analyses showed that positive (more than negative) metastereotypes could significantly predict perceived mattering and well-being among both groups. Mattering to both family and friends significantly predicted many dimensions of well-being among both PLWHA and PWDs. These findings show that perception of mattering is related to the well-being of minority group members. Interventions aimed at improving the well-being of individuals who belong to minority groups should focus on positive metastereotypes and the perception of being important to significant others, considering both friends and family members. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper explores how immersion and engagement with different cultures in the home environment impacts Korean children’s intercultural learning. More specific attention is given to the experience of nine Korean children whose families have voluntarily served as homestay host families and hosted foreign guests for more than seven years. This qualitative inquiry is drawn from data including participant observations, semi-structured interviews with children and their parents, and the collection of artefacts and documents. Four themes were identified regarding the impact of homestay hosting experiences on the focal children: (1) experiencing intercultural encounters in the home environment; (2) building close, long-lasting intercultural relationships; (3) recognising preconceived prejudices and undoing cultural stereotypes; and (4) challenging a singular and oversimplified representation of cultures. Given the modern, global context in which children engage in frequent contacts with individuals from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, the findings demonstrate the necessity of fostering intercultural learning among school-aged children and suggest homestay programmes are a potential means for developing students’ intercultural learning in a local context. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In evaluative conditioning, a conditional stimulus (CS; e.g. a neutral picture) acquires positive/negative valence if it is paired with a pleasant/unpleasant unconditional stimulus (US; e.g. a positive/negative picture). This valence generalises to other stimuli similar to the CS and to the wider CS category. Being informed that the CS will be paired with the US induces a similar change in valence (instructional learning), but it is not clear whether instructional learning would also generalise. In Experiment 1, participants were informed that one shape would be paired with pleasant and another with unpleasant images. These instructions instilled conditional valence to the CSs which generalised to different shapes from the same category (generalisation stimuli). In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding in an implicit measure using stimuli varying in perceptual features. Participants were informed that three CSs from one category (e.g. vegetables) would be paired with pleasant images and three CSs from a second category (e.g. office supplies) would be paired with unpleasant images. This instruction instilled conditional valence to the CSs which generalised to novel exemplars from the same categories. This suggests that conditional valence instilled via instructions generalises to other stimuli–a finding with implications for prejudice and racism. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Stereotype threat has been shown to have deleterious impacts on the short- and long-term academic performance and psychological well-being of racial and ethnic minority students. Psychological variables related to this identity threat represent significant sources of achievement and attainment gaps relative to nonstereotyped Asian and white students who do not tend to be subject to performance declines related to such threats. In the current study, we investigate long-term effects of a brief self-affirmation intervention implemented at-scale to mitigate stereotype threat for seventh-grade African American and Latino students. Relative to their control-group counterparts, our findings indicate that a self-affirming intervention to buffer racial and ethnic minority students from identity threats reduced the growing achievement gap by 50% per year between seventh and 12th grade (N = 802). As a result, the achievement gap between white/Asian and African American/Latino students decreased by 42% at the end of 12th grade. Finally, the intervention increased on-time graduation rates for treated minority students by 10 percentage points (N = 952). Implications for theory, policy, and future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Educational Impact and Implications Statement: Students of color routinely confront bias and negative stereotypes about their ability to succeed academically in secondary schools. Such “threats in the air” have been shown to cause a variety of negative responses among African American and Latino students, including decreased psychological well-being, anxiety, and decreased working memory, all of which can negatively impact the students’ academic outcomes. In fact, these “threat responses” may account for as much as one third of the achievement gaps separating African American and Latino students from their white counterparts. With a brief, but precisely timed, series of four written exercises, seventh graders were offered the opportunity to reflect on other valued aspects of their personal identities beyond school. These so-called “self-affirmations” can help deflect some of the harm of bias and discrimination and help students of color to perform to their true potentials. Throughout an entire school district, we administered these exercises to seventh-grade students and tracked their academic progress through 12th grade. Our results suggest that the self-affirmations cut the growing achievement gaps in half and increased on-time graduation rates for students of color by 10 percentage points. Our article discusses how and under what circumstances such a brief intervention can have such strong and enduring effects.

AB  - Throughout American history, formal laws and social norms have discouraged interracial romantic relationships. Interracial relationships blur the boundaries between racial groups, challenging the essentialized racial categories that define Whiteness as an exclusive, high status identity. Whites, who are the most resistant to interracial marriage of any racial group, have used their dominant position in American society to enforce norms against interracial relationships. Despite the importance of racial homogamy to White identity and status, we argue that gender roles make violating norms against intimate intergroup contact more costly for women than men, leading to Whites’ greater resistance to interracial relationships involving White women. In a representative American sample using a natural quasi-experiment, as well as 3 follow-up lab experiments, we find that White women face differential social penalties for intimateintergroup contact—being perceived as gender deviant and low status within the group. By contrast, having a racial out-group partner did not influence status perceptions of men or Black women. Status perceptions of both individuals in the couple predicted attitudes toward the couple as a unit, leading to greater prejudice toward interracial relationships involving White women than White men. This research demonstrates the existence of a gendered double standard for intimate intergroup contact among Whites, revealing that gender norms play a critical role in the maintenance of American racial boundaries. © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - In Poland, both, gender hierarchy restricting women’s sexuality and heteronormativity are rooted in traditional “family values” supported by the teachings of the Polish Catholic Church and attached to Polish national identity. Dissenters to traditional norms regulating gender and sexual relations are rejected as a threat to social order and national unity. Latent growth curve modeling performed on data from a 3-wave longitudinal study indicated linear, interrelated increases in authoritarianism; a desire for national cohesion; and rejection of sexual dissenters in the nationally representative sample of Polish participants (N = 889) as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic unfolded in Poland. Data were collected before and during the outbreak of the pandemic allowing us to link the changes in social attitudes to this naturally occurring threat. Cross-lagged panel analysis indicated that authoritarianism predicted desire for national cohesion, which resulted in rejection of dissenters. These results are in line with theoretical models of authoritarianism as a response to threat. They are also in line with findings linking death anxiety and the threat of infectious disease to increases in authoritarianism, traditional worldview defense, in-group cohesion and sexual restrictiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement—This study found that the average level of authoritarianism—a tendency to follow coercive leaders and traditional social norms—increased in response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Poland. This increase was followed by the amplified emphasis on national cohesion and resulted in the rejection of dissenters to traditional sexual norms. This suggests that the rights of sexual minorities and gender equality may be at risk in Poland during the times of increased threat of infectious disease.

AB  - The outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the United States was partly influenced by factors such as social marginalization and anti-immigrant sentiment, both of which have been associated with the global rise in far-right voting (FRV) outcomes. Sociological hypotheses such as group threat and group contact have been suggested as potential contextual factors in the relationship between immigrant share and far-right support; more recently, the halo effect has been used as a spatial mechanism to explore these relationships. Briefly, the halo effect describes increased FRV in ethnically homogeneous areas that are near ethnically diverse areas. This portentous trend has significant international implications, but differences in the spatial distribution and composition of immigrant share and the spatial scale of analysis have produced inconsistent empirical results. This study addressed the spatial distribution of the halo effect in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and used geographically weighted regression to explore spatial nonstationarity in the relationships between socioeconomic factors and Republican (GOP) support. Spatial nonstationarity is observed when a relationship is not globally consistent such as in large or complex areas where local processes might interact with or overwhelm global processes. We found evidence of spatial nonstationarity in the relationships between GOP support and many socioeconomic factors, including the halo effect. In addition to providing a better understanding of the spatial context of electoral dynamics and their interactions at a local scale, these results indicate that spatial nonstationarity in these relationships might be partially responsible for inconsistent results in previous studies. © 2020 by American Association of Geographers.

AB  - This article critically examines the politics of socio-political exclusions, with particular reference to the recurrent surges of herdsmen/farmers’ skirmishes that are currently ravaging many states in Nigeria. Owing to their occupation and prejudiced history, the Fulani herdsmen have not enjoyed full assimilation into mainstream cohesion, and the enactment of laws proscribing ‘open grazing’ by some states, in a bid to protect farmers and farmlands, appears to have further entrenched this supposed exclusion. Consequently, the group, through its Miyetti Allah Cattle Associations, has urged state governments to refrain from enforcing these laws. The implementation of the laws by Benue and Taraba States has caused herdsmen to react angrily by killing hundreds of people in the states. To what extent are these states justified in prohibiting open grazing? Can a group justifiably warn a sovereign, federating, state against implementing a law duly passed by its State Assembly? Using critical analysis, the paper proffers answers to these questions by drawing insights from philosophical arguments of social justice, particularly Nozickian justice as entitlement. Given that what is at stake is the economic livelihoods of both farmers and cattle herders, the paper also provides an objective analysis of the conflict by pointing out the central claims of both parties in the dispute. It concludes that solution to these skirmishes inheres in an approach that emphasizes social justice and inclusion. © 2020 African Studies Association of India, New Delhi.

AB  - Social work educators teach cultural competency and guide students to understand and address racism. Using mixed methods, we explored the influence of a one-semester course on racial attitudes, skills, and knowledge among 10 diverse undergraduate students. The Seeing White podcast delivered content about historic and systemic race-based oppression and discrimination in American society. Students participated in seminars, maintained reflective journals, and wrote a self-analysis paper to integrate learning. Findings indicate increased knowledge and understanding of key concepts and a commitment to respond to institutional racism. Implications for social work education suggest the need for humility and a willingness for educators and institutions to share power.

AB  - Dehumanization and distrust can have devastating consequences for intergroup relations. Until now, few studies have examined the ways in which both (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful discourse are presented in popular media. Recognizing the detrimental effects of terrorism on intergroup attitudes and the power of media in influencing social and political attitudes, the present research examined the frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements in newspaper coverage of the July 7, 2005, London bombings in the aftermath and at the 10-year anniversary of the attack. Drawing from theoretical work on dehumanization, it was expected that (de)humanizing content in media coverage about a stereotyped outgroup would be linked to (dis)trust of that group, and would also be linked to political orientation of the media source. Primary analyses were conducted using an existing manual coding framework for frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements. Results from the coding show that dehumanizing and distrusting discourse was more frequent than humanizing and trusting discourse. Whereas dehumanization was significantly correlated with distrust only in the right-wing source, humanization was significantly correlated with trust only in the left-wing source. The findings advance theoretical understandings of (de)humanization and humanization as they manifest in media discourse following a terrorist event, and how these relate to outgroup (dis)trust. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement: An analysis of UK newspaper coverage of the 7/7 bombings in London revealed a high frequency of dehumanizing discourse about Muslims, particularly in the aftermath (compared to the 10-year anniversary). Further, results varied based on political orientation of the source, such that dehumanization of Muslims was associated with distrust in the right-wing news source, whereas humanization was associated with trust in the left-wing news source.

AB  - This research investigated the effectiveness of a forgiveness education program on reducing anger and ethnic prejudice and improving forgiveness in Iranian adolescents. There were 224 (Persian, Azeri, and Kurdish) male and female students in 8th grade who were selected from 3 provinces: Tehran, Eastern Azerbaijan, and Kurdestan. Schools were randomly assigned to 2 groups of experimental (N = 123) and control (N = 101) students. Measures included the Enright Forgiveness Inventory, Spielberger’s State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Ethnic Prejudice Scale, administered at pretest, posttest, and follow-up. The experimental group had forgiveness education by classroom teachers. The results indicated that the experimental group was higher in forgiveness and lower in ethnic prejudice, state anger, trait anger, and anger expression compared with the control group. This difference was statistically significant in the follow-up phase. It seems that forgiveness education in schools can be an important means of reducing anger and ethnic prejudice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Educational Impact and Implications Statement—Research on forgiveness has shown its effectiveness in reducing resentment and increasing well-being. Forgiveness education in schools, as a new approach for reducing anger and ethnic prejudice, offers a unique opportunity for both psychological health and community peace. This can work in Eastern and Western cultures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - Investigators have proposed a Dual Process Model (DPM) that involves two social-attitudinal variables, social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), which account for prejudicial attitudes. Both RWA and SDO are theoretically and empirically linked to lower empathy and agreeableness (i.e., antagonism). Moreover, psychopathic traits are robustly linked with decreased empathy and elevated antagonism, and thus have at least an indirect theoretical link with prejudice through SDO and RWA. In the current study, two independent samples of Croatian (N = 386) and Greek (N = 378) undergraduates completed SDO, RWA, psychopathy and prejudice assessments. Evidence of strong measurement invariance was found and thus the samples were combined to form a broad European sample. A structural equation model was specified to test whether psychopathic traits (Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle, Antisocial) evidenced direct effects on SDO, RWA, and indirect effects through these constructs on prejudicial attitudes towards minorities and Middle Eastern refugees. As predicted, interpersonal and affective traits evidenced positive direct and indirect effects, respectively, on RWA, SDO and prejudicial attitudes, while impulsive lifestyle traits had negative direct and indirect effects on these constructs. The findings suggest a shared nomological network with respect to psychopathic propensities, SDO, RWA, and prejudicial attitudes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Developmental research has long sought to understand children’s social ideas, and particularly how those ideas influence their judgments and behaviors toward other people. We examine the idea of common humanity, a social idea that has been investigated historically and philosophically, to re-consider what is already known about children’s notions of social equality and difference and to suggest how research in this area might be expanded. We review the social cognition literature to argue that studying the idea of common humanity—which combines abstract notions of universal equality with explicit attention to social group differences—could substantially advance our understanding of children’s social-cognitive frameworks. We then discuss a subset of the literature related to children’s prejudice and describe how the study of common humanity could shed light on the mechanisms behind interventions that successfully reduce prejudice. © 2020 Journal of Moral Education Ltd.

AB  - Within mainstream institutions such as colleges and universities, scientists and social leaders, alike, are faced with persistent and new challenges to forging paths toward inclusion among marginalized group members (e.g., Latino/a/x and African Americans). Integrating theoretical perspectives that conceptualize identity among marginalized groups as tied to culture and strengths with literatures on threat and stigma, we propose a “pride and prejudice” approach to inclusion. We provide support for the efficacy of inclusion as 2 pathways—one route that is associated with recognizing “pride” or the history and culture of marginalized groups and another that is related to reducing “prejudice” or perceived discrimination toward marginalized groups. Specifically, we demonstrate using actual demands for inclusion generated by students attending 80 colleges and universities that a pride and prejudice approach is consistent with collective calls for institutional change voiced by marginalized group members and their allies (Study 1). Then, Study 2, using longitudinal data of Latino/a/x and African American students (N = 1,967) attending 27 colleges and universities we reveal the impact of pride (e.g., taking an ethnic studies course) and prejudice (e.g., perceived discrimination) experiences on sense of belonging, and in turn academic and health outcomes (e.g., graduation rates, depression). We provide evidence for 1 theory-based process whereby individual experiences tied to pride and prejudice can impact belongingness through intragroup and intergroup relations. Theory and policy implications for institutional inclusion efforts including the importance of fostering ties to ingroup and outgoup members are discussed.

AB  - We examined the differences between majority and minority children (i.e., group membership) on racial categorization and perceived cultural distance, among 4- to 6-year-old children, in low diversified schools. We used a spontaneous social categorization task using pictures of children from three different racial groups broadly represented in France (Europeans, Black-, and North-Africans), and an evaluation of the perceived cultural distance between participants' in-group and the racial group represented in the picture, adapted to children and based on three factors (language, eating habits, and music). Results revealed an effect of age on racial categorization: the older the children, the more successful they are in this task. They showed a significant effect of the racial group represented in the photos on perceived cultural distance: members of minority groups (i.e., Black- and North-Africans) were evaluated as more different compared to those of the majority group on each of the factors. Finally, we got an interaction between participants' in-group and the racial group represented in the pictures, for the language factor: members of the majority group perceived as more different photographs representing minorities peers than those representing majority peers, while participants belonging to minority groups perceived no differences between photographs, according to the racial criteria. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: The Norwegian organization Golf as Therapy (GAT) offers golf training sessions for patients in mental health care and/or SUD treatment. Our aim for the article was to explore SUD patients’ experiences of playing golf during their treatment. Method: We conducted semistructured interviews with seven informants, all of whom were SUD patients or former SUD patients of the Tyrili Foundation. Results: A thematic analysis led us to identify three themes. 1) The participants had negative stereotypical perceptions of golf and golf players. When they entered the golf course, these perceptions were largely refuted. 2) The participants enjoyed the versatility that golf demanded but highlighted the social interaction that occurred at the golf course as the most valuable and motivating part of their enjoyment of golf. 3) The participants had positive experiences playing golf that they saw as valuable for developing social networks and for becoming more open-minded about trying new activities. Conclusions: Golf seems to potentially stimulate social participation and to develop relations, and it was perceived as useful for the informants’ situations both during and after treatment. This may strengthening the patients’ social identity and social capital. Therefore, golf as an activity could be benefiting for patients in SUD-treatment. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In times of crisis, people are more prone to endorse conspiracy theories. Conspiracy thinking provides answers about the causes of an event, but it can also have harmful social consequences. Our research tested both the predictor and the consequences of two types of conspiracy beliefs related to the Covid-19 pandemic: (1) general conspiracy beliefs and (2) government-related conspiracy theories. In two studies in Poland (Ntotal = 2726), we found that a perceived lack of individual control predicted both types of conspiracy theories, while a sense of collective control was positively related to general conspiracy beliefs but negatively associated with government-related conspiracy theories. Moreover, general conspiracy theories were related to the acceptance of xenophobic policies and to a less favourable attitude towards outgroups whereas government-related conspiracy theories were not. Additionally, people who believed in conspiratorial governments less frequently indicated that they used prevention methods, such as social distancing and handwashing. Our research demonstrates the importance of considering the content of various conspiracy theories when studying their social effects and potential causes. Knowing which attitudes may be associated with the endorsement of specific conspiracy theories can contribute to counteracting their negative consequences during crises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The argument here places the personal reflections of BAME students and educators at the forefront in this discussion of racial inequity in the British educational system. The contributors are stakeholders who have an investment in schooling, either as student or educator, that cannot be reduced to the four walls of the classroom. It features interviews and personal communications that shed light on what needs to be done to correct disparities in educational outcomes for BAME students. Emphasis is placed on the quality of their contributions and the importance of having a positive black presence in their teaching and learning environments. It features candid reflections on the rights or wrongs of having a Black History Month (BHM) celebration, especially in the wake of the introduction in 2008 of Black History as the ‘Slave Trade’ in the National Curriculum, which many considered, and still believe was ill thought through at the time. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Diversity education occurs in universities and workplaces, but research has progressed in disciplinary silos. Consequently, the field of diversity training has failed to utilize theoretical and practical advances from related fields. Our research addresses these limitations. Integrating educational and social psychology theories, we develop a relational model of training that offers perspective taking as an outcome of diversity training and cross-race friendships as a relational experience that spills over to the training environment. Our first 2 studies, conducted in organizational and academic settings, confirmed the model. Pre- and postcourse assessments revealed that while participants became more aware of the value of perspective taking and their need to improve this skill, only those with close cross-race friends improved their reported perspective taking abilities. Other forms of interracial contact and racial attitudes had no effect. Supporting theoretical predictions, belief in a just world mediated this friendship effect. Given the influence of cross-race friendships, we conclude with a third study that, using an experimental design, examined the effectiveness and underlying processes of a technique that increased participants’ willingness to engage in cross-race friendships and other prosocial diversity and ally behaviors at work (e.g., diversity voice). Our findings illustrate the power of relationships and offer new theoretical directions and practical applications for diversity training and education.

AB  - The health threat posed by the novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic has particular implications for people with disabilities, including vulnerability to exposure and complications, and concerns about the role of ableism in access to treatment and medical rationing decisions. Shortages of necessary medical equipment to treat COVID-19 have prompted triage guidelines outlining the ways in which lifesaving equipment, such as mechanical ventilators and intensive care unit beds, may need to be rationed among affected individuals. In this article, we explore the realities of medical rationing, and various approaches to triage and prioritization. We discuss the psychology of ableism, perceptions about quality of life, social determinants of health, and how attitudes toward disability can affect rationing decisions and access to care. In addition to the grassroots advocacy and activism undertaken by the disability community, psychology is rich in its contributions to the role of attitudes, prejudice, and discriminatory behavior on the social fabric of society. We call on psychologists to advocate for social justice in pandemic preparedness, promote disability justice in health care settings, call for transparency and accountability in rationing approaches, and support policy changes for macro- and microallocation strategies to proactively reduce the need for rationing.

AB  - Extensive studies link anger, fear, and support for populist leaders, but prevailing approaches largely assume an individual model of emotion. In this exploratory short report, we invoke a structurally sensitive social psychological account of the group-based and power-laden dynamics of populist emotion. Analyzing a stratified sample of Philippine respondents, we investigate how anger and fear interact with memberships in low-and high-power classed and regional groups in predicting support for populist President Rodrigo Duterte and various policies of his regime. Lower levels of regional and classed power intensified the association between emotions and populist support. Power-laden complications were also detected on the policy level. We discuss the implications of this work in terms of contextualizing political emotions within local configurations of unequal intergroup relations © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - Research has shown that vicarious contact, that is observing an interaction between ingroup and outgroup members, can improve intergroup relations. Although vicarious contact has been operationalized in different ways, mainly via story reading or video watching, an experimental comparison of these different strategies is still missing. We conducted a school intervention with the aim of comparing the two most used forms of vicarious contact, namely story reading and video watching. Elementary schoolchildren without disabilities (N = 292) were assigned to one of three different conditions: reading a story; watching a video; control. In the two vicarious contact conditions, participants read or watched the story of a child with disability becoming friends with children without disabilities; in the control condition, participants only completed the dependent measures. Results revealed that, in general, both vicarious contact conditions were equally effective in improving outgroup attitudes and behavioural intentions. In addition, they operated with the same strength through the same underlying processes (IOS, ingroup norms). We discuss theoretical and practical implications in the context of vicarious contact as a prejudice-reduction intervention. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Laypersons differentiate between two confrontations styles, varying in communication style, perceived motive, and typical context: call-outs (typically public, non-accommodating language, and self-promoting confronter) and call-ins (typically private, accommodating language, and education-focused confronter). Popular press espouses a general preference for call-ins relative to call-outs, but no empirical work has addressed perceptions of these confrontation styles. To investigate the presumed efficacy of these styles, we modelled communicative differences with Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT), which explores the strategies individuals use to modulate communicative differences with interaction partners. The present studies examined third-party perceptions of confronter motive and likely outcomes between call-in and call-out styles (Study 1) and between typical private and atypical public styles (Study 2) about an anti-Black comment. We examined responses of participants who imagined themselves taking part in public vs. private call-in and call-out confrontations (Study 3). Results showed that these styles are seen as similarly effective in terms of target compliance and internalization, but as operating through different mechanisms. Specifically, call-in styles facilitated positive inferences of motive, which fostered expectations of positive confrontation outcomes. Additionally, the effects of communication style superseded the impact of context. Results have implications for strategies allies can use to facilitate effective, educational confrontations of prejudice. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyse the emergence of the ‘disabled subject’ in contemporary Spain. In order to do this, the study undertakes a qualitative research, based on seventeen in-depth interviews conducted with subjects with an innate or acquired physical impairment, coming from different regions of Spain, and born in the interval between the years 1938 and 1962. These cases will be analysed in the light of three key social institutions: the family, the system of education and the national health system. The study involves, on the other hand, a theoretical framework based mainly on the oeuvre of Foucault, Bourdieu and the Second School of Chicago. The proposed cases will allow us to understand how people with physical impairments faced prejudices, stereotypes and oppressive forms of subjectivity, and how their subjective resistance allowed them to create new spaces of existence.Points of interest People with disabilities endure discriminatory experiences, which can lead to a certain stigmatization and a negative perception of the self. This article delves into life stories of seventeen individuals with physical disabilities in Contemporary Spain. In their passage through a myriad of institutions, people with physical disabilities often developed negative views of themselves, induced by the different agents and institutions around them. This type of research is important, because it allows us to understand, through particular cases, how people with physical impairments went through systematic discrimination, and what resources they could use to fight the prejudices and stereotypes, transforming their own perception and the social image of disability. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - It has been argued that supporting a restrictive view on the inclusion of immigrants finds its origin in a localized feeling of group identity. We test this hypothesis with a household survey in the Belgian city of Ghent (n = 3735). The results show that local and national identities are salient, but also that regional, European, and cosmopolitan identities are supported simultaneously. Especially the regional, Flemish identity is strongly associated with a restrictive, ethnic attitude toward new groups in society. A European identity was not significantly associated with this restrictive attitude. Our conclusion is that not just the geographical scale of group identity is important in explaining anti-immigrant sentiments. The specific historical connotations of every geographical level should be considered. A comparison between generations, i.e. parents and their late adolescent children, suggests that this association between specific group identities and ethnic citizenship norms is equally present among younger cohorts. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article is a snapshot of the current attitudes manifested by the Romanian Orthodox seminarians towards interdenominational networking from the perspectives of individual interests, cultural representation, and institutional structure. Using the interdenominational networking as a social platform, the article considers the tension between rational choice and structuralism, whereby an Orthodox seminarian navigates between individual interests and institutional constrains; while also instrumentalizing cultural representation. For this purpose, a face-to-face survey was administered to 133 Protestant and Orthodox seminarians in Romania enrolled as fulltime students in the pastoral theology programmes at five theological seminaries. The contribution of this research lies in the fact that the data we collected and analysed serves as a social barometer revealing not only the restrained attitudes of the Romanian Orthodox seminarians towards interdenominational networking, but also their inability to bypass the deep-seated religious prejudice due to indoctrination and competition for credibility. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Those from low socioeconomic status (SES) often lack access to public space and, when they have access, they are often discouraged from using public space. Scholars from human geography and related fields have argued that this limits engagement in civic life and undermines sense of belonging in one's community. In the present work, we consider whether lower-SES students face this predicament in higher education, particularly at elite public institutions. Across four studies, we find that, compared with higher-SES students, lower-SES students use public space on campus less—iconic public space in particular—and this can mediate the relationship between SES and sense of belonging at the University. We also find that experimentally increasing students’ use of public space can reduce and even close SES gaps in felt belonging. Taken together, the present studies suggest that use of public space matters for belonging and for understanding gaps in belonging. This work contributes to our understanding of SES disparities in higher education. More generally, it illustrates the importance of public space.

AB  - Although social work students in Taiwan generally tend to have positive attitudes towards the Taiwanese Indigenous peoples, a considerable proportion of these students have undecided or unfavourable attitudes. A total of 1,919 first- to fourth-year social work students from 24 social work-related departments across Taiwan completed a purpose-designed questionnaire incorporating Indigenous-related education, contact, consciousness, and demographic items. A regression analysis of the survey results reveals robust evidence that ethnic identity, having Indigenous friends, empathy towards Indigenous people and one’s position on the political spectrum affect attitudes. However, multicultural education, including Indigenous-related courses and ethnicity-related courses in college, and collective guilt are not significant factors influencing the attitudes of social work students in Taiwan. These findings have implications for social work educators in countries that provide social work services to Indigenous people. IMPLICATIONS Teaching activities should be designed to increase social work students’ opportunities to make friends with Indigenous people, emphasise core social work tenets in the classroom and develop students’ empathy towards Indigenous people. Conducting future research to investigate the factors that influence social work students’ attitudes towards Indigenous people in other countries may be fruitful given the unique interaction histories between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. © 2020 Australian Association of Social Workers.

AB  - Sexual minority people face greater risk for compromised sexual health than their heterosexual peers, yet school-based sexuality education often excludes them. Little is known about whether or how sexual minority people’s sexuality education experiences have varied across sociohistorical contexts of rapid social change in both sexuality education and sexual minority visibility. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among 191 sexual minority people from three distinct sociohistorical generations (ages 18–25, 34–41, and 52–59, respectively) and four geographic regions of the United States. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis following a consensual qualitative protocol. Fifty-one participants (i.e., 27%) discussed school-based sexuality education experiences despite the lack of an explicit question in the interview protocol prompting them to do so. Four distinct yet overlapping themes emerged in participants’ experiences of sexuality education: 1) Silence; 2) The profound influence of HIV/AIDS; 3) Stigma manifest through fear, shame, and prejudice; and, 4) Comparing school-based experiences to sexuality education outside of school. The presence of themes varied across groups defined by sociohistorical generation. The implications of sexuality education experiences for the wellbeing of sexual minority people are discussed. © 2020 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

AB  - Research on Asian American educational attainment suggests that a combination of immigrant hyper-selectivity and ethnic capital enables second-generation Asian Americans to succeed according to a narrowly-defined success frame. However, recent quantitative work suggests that ethnoracialized advantages within the educational system do not translate into advantages in the workplace. This study therefore examines second-generation Asian Americans’ experiences as they seek work in the labour market. I draw from 30 semi-structured qualitative interviews with 1.5- and second-generation Asian Americans in the New York City area, all of whom had entered the full-time workforce within the previous ten years. I find that these recent labour market entrants faced three major constraints and enacted several strategies in response. Family and community networks no longer provided the same ethnoracialized resources and network ties that might enable educational success; in response, workers mobilised institutional resources and peer networks. Once in the workplace, respondents experienced racialized microaggressions; in response, they minimised the role of race. Finally, they encountered negative stereotyping; in response, they worked to distance themselves from such stereotypes. Overall, these findings shed light on how ethnoracialized processes impact the presumed link between educational and occupational success. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Stigmatization by health care professionals leads to decreased help-seeking behaviors in those being stigmatized. Prejudicial attitudes are especially pronounced concerning sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which is crucial in light of rising prevalence rates of STIs in recent years. We aimed to examine stigmatization against patients with sexually versus non-sexually transmitted infections among medical students in Germany. We also assessed how a person’s sexual orientation or gender might contribute to stigma. Medical students (N = 332) read about a fictious patient with symptoms of pharyngitis after having had a casual sex encounter. Gender (female/male) and sexual orientation (hetero-/bi-/homosexual) of the patient as well as the pathogen causing the infection (gonococcus/H1N1-virus) were randomly varied. Afterwards, stigma against the patient was assessed. Patients with a gonococcal pharyngitis were perceived as more prone to engage in risky behavior, dumber, and less responsible than patients with a H1N1-virus pharyngitis. Bisexual patients were perceived as more prone to engage in risky behavior than hetero- and homosexual individuals. The predictability of the consequences of the patient’s actions was rated higher in bisexual patients. Stigmatizing attitudes toward patients with a STI were frequent, especially against bisexual patients. More education should be dedicated to sexual/LGB health during medical school to reduce existing stigma. © 2020 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

AB  - Background: Stuttering is associated with negative stereotypes and attitudes. Teachers play a pivotal role in children’s lives but need to be well educated about stuttering in order to support children in the classroom. This study (i) explored New Zealand teachers’ attitudes and knowledge and (ii) piloted an online education package for teachers. Method: In phase one, 59 teachers (35 primary and 24 secondary) completed an online survey examining their attitudes and knowledge of stuttering and strategies for classroom management. In phase two, 27 primary school teachers completed a short online education package including a fact sheet and educational video ‘Wait wait … I’m not finished yet’ (Michael Palin Centre, 2018). Teachers completed the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes-Stuttering POSHA-S [Abdalla, F. A., & Louis, K. O. S. (2012). Arab school teachers’ knowledge, beliefs and reactions regarding stuttering. Journal of Fluency Disorders, 37(1), 54–69 ] before and after the education package. Results: The teachers surveyed had a wide range of teaching experience (1—46 years) and displayed positive attitudes to stuttering. They had gaps in their knowledge about the cause of stuttering. Teachers frequently rated ‘unsure’ to statements relating to the use of classroom strategies. The online education package was well received and considered valuable in understanding stuttering. Attitudes and knowledge shifted in accuracy and certainty. Conclusion: The New Zealand teachers in this study had positive attitudes but knowledge gaps. Their toolbox of appropriate classroom strategies was limited. A short online education package can enable teachers to make a positive shift in attitudes and knowledge and reflect on new strategies to use in their current classrooms. Stuttering resources should be available to all teachers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In India, the “feminization of aging” is one of the areas in which prejudice most frequently occurs. Noticeably, poverty, isolation, changes in residential care, and weak institutional support push women into several vulnerabilities. This study demonstrates that elderly women are often denied basic rights and are compelled to reside in old-age homes; the situation is worse for elderly widowed women. We examine the claims that the lives of elderly women are more precarious due to their lower literacy, limited social exposure, and monetary dependence. Being women, old, and widowed, they are affected by triple vulnerabilities that require concrete policy implications. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article focuses on the prevalence of anti-immigration attitudes among the far-right electorate. Drawing on the distinction between the predictive power of immigration concerns, and the question of how widespread these concerns are among the far-right voter pool, we proceed in two steps. First, we assess the extent to which anti-immigration attitudes are a necessary condition for voting far-right; and second, we examine whether far-right voters with different levels of anti-immigration attitudes exhibit similar individual and attitudinal characteristics. Using data from the 8th wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) we find that, surprisingly, anti-immigration attitudes are not a necessary condition for voting for the far-right as approximately one third of far-right voters have no concerns over immigration. We further show that far-right voters with different levels of immigration concerns have different profiles when it comes to other predictors of the far right-vote including ideological affinity, attachment to the EU and government satisfaction. Our contribution is significant as we suggest that there are different routes to voting for the far right by groups with different grievances, including non- immigration related. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Political campaign slogans, such as ‘Take back control of our country’ (United Kingdom Independence Party) and ‘The Netherlands ours again’ (Dutch Party for Freedom), indicate that right-wing populism appeals to the belief that the country is ‘ours’, and therefore, ‘we’ have the exclusive right to determine what happens. We examined this sense of ownership of the country (i.e. collective psychological ownership [CPO]) with the related determination right in relation to exclusionary attitudes and voting behaviour. Among Dutch (Study 1, N = 572) and British (Study 2, N = 495) participants, we found that CPO explained anti-immigrant and anti-EU attitudes, and these attitudes in turn accounted for voting ‘leave’ in the 2016 Brexit referendum in the British sample (Study 2). Additionally, CPO was more strongly related to negative immigrant attitudes among right-wing Dutch participants, whereas it was more strongly related to negative EU attitudes and voting ‘leave’ among left-wing British participants. CPO contributes to the understanding of critical contemporary social attitudes and political behaviour. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Increased awareness of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has come with an increase in books that depict individuals with ASD. However, media representation of disabilities could be misguided. To integrate literature in the classroom that helps students better understand the population of ASD, carefully choosing quality books (e.g., narrative fiction) with authentic depictions that do not perpetuate negative stereotypes is essential. The tools and criteria presented for educators help them evaluate and select books for their classrooms or as recommendations to others. The article includes a set of guidelines that help educators facilitate proper consideration for representations of characters with ASD, including the essential and more profound components of their strengths with a positive view of diversity in mind. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2020.

AB  - A number of psychological theories suggest that increased economic inequality may lead to greater social class stereotyping. However, all existing evidence for this claim is correlational. Across three experiments (one exploratory and two confirmatory, N = 2,286), we observed that exposure to socially signaled inequality—operationalized in terms of variation in perceived incomes among groups of target individuals—amplified the endorsement of one key social class stereotype: the perception that higher income individuals are more competent. When judged amid greater inequality, the same high-income targets were perceived as more competent and the same low-income targets were perceived as less competent, compared with when judged amid greater equality. By contrast, we found no consistent effect of exposure to inequality on stereotypes regarding warmth and relatively weak class-based stereotyping on the warmth dimension in general. We discuss implications of these findings for theories regarding the effects of economic inequality. © 2020 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Are implicit and explicit biases related to ASD identification and/or stigma? College students (N = 493) completed two IATs assessing implicit stigma and racial biases. They evaluated vignettes depicting a child with ASD or conduct disorder (CD) paired with a photo of a Black or White child. CD was more implicitly and explicitly stigmatized than ASD. Accurately identifying ASD was associated with reduced explicit stigma; identifying CD led to more stigma. Participants who identified as White implicitly associated the White child with ASD and the Black child with CD. A trend in the reverse direction was observed among Black participants. Implicit and explicit biases were unrelated. Findings highlight a need for trainings to ameliorate biases favoring one’s in-group. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: Interactions between members of different racial and ethnic groups are often stressful. These interactions are stressful, in part, because they contribute to social identity threat—the fear of being judged or treated negatively based on one’s social group membership. Previous work separately suggests that the diversity of an interaction partner’s friendship network and the goals that people set for themselves influence social identity threat. Bringing these two bodies of work together, the present research examines whether adopting a learning (vs. performance) goal mitigates identity threat for Black people anticipating an interaction with a White partner who had a racially homogenous (vs. diverse) friendship network (a context previously shown to arouse identity threat). Method: Two experimental studies (N = 310) were conducted. Black adults (Mage = 29.66, 64% women) primed with either a performance or learning goal anticipated an interaction with a White partner who had either a racially diverse (Study 1) or racially homogenous (Studies 1 and 2) friendship network. After, we assessed participants’ social identity threat and anticipated interaction experiences. Results: Black adults primed with learning (vs. performance) goals expected to be perceived more positively by their interaction partner and expected to have more positive interaction experiences when they anticipated an interaction with a White partner who had a racially homogenous network of friends. Conclusions: These findings suggest that learning goals can mitigate threat among Black individuals within an otherwise identity-threatening interaction context, thus opening the door for positive interracial contact in the future even in the context of challenging interracial interactions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement—One of the challenges of a diverse society is that interracial interactions can be difficult and uncomfortable; thus, many people avoid them. Yet, research documents many benefits to a truly integrated society. It is therefore important to investigate strategies that foster more comfortable interactions—even in the context of the most challenging interracial situations. Results from our research suggest that adopting learning (vs. performance) goals may be effective in reducing threat and promoting positive interactions for Black individuals.

AB  - Objectives: Exposure to racism experienced by caregivers poses a threat to child developmental outcomes. The current study examines the effects of caregiver-experienced racism on the development of internalizing behaviors for African American children during a sensitive period in their development of racial awareness. Two aspects of caregiver-provided ethnic racial socialization (ERS), cultural socialization and preparation for bias, were assessed as moderators. Supported by prior research, cultural socialization was hypothesized to be protective. Given that research on preparation for bias in early childhood is sparse or inconclusive, no directional hypothesis was formulated for the moderation effect of preparation for bias. Method: A community-recruited, low-income sample of 130 African American caregivers and their children (T3 Mage = 6.20, T4 Mage = 7.17) reported on past-year experiences with racism, ERS practices, and child internalizing behaviors. Path analyses were utilized to assess the influence of caregivers’ racist experiences and ERS practices on children’s first grade internalizing behaviors after controlling for kindergarten levels. Results: Cultural socialization was not a significant protective factor as hypothesized. However, caregivers’ past-year experiences with racism predicted more anxious and sad behaviors in children when caregivers reported using more preparation for bias. Conclusions: The effects of caregivers’ racism experiences on their 6-year-old children’s internalizing behaviors were contingent on their use of preparation for bias socialization. This study adds to the literature on racism and further elucidates the role preparation for discrimination plays in developmental outcomes for young African American children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement—Research indicates that preparing African American children for future experiences of bias and prejudice can protect them against the negative effects of racism later in life. However, the appropriate ages and circumstances within which to engage in this type of socialization are unclear. Results of this study indicate that when African American caregivers have experienced higher levels of racism, their messages of how to deal with discrimination are associated with higher levels of anxiety and sadness among their 6-year-old children.

AB  - We examined whether zero-sum thinking explains White Australian-born people’s majority-culture perceptions of discrimination towards their ingroup and an outgroup (immigrants), and the relationships among perceived discrimination and support for multiculturalism and immigration. Two correlational cross-sectional studies were conducted among self-identified White Australians (Study 1, N = 517), and White Americans (Study 2, N = 273), as well as an experiment among White Australians (Study 3, N = 121) in which we manipulated discrimination towards immigrants over time. Our findings did not support a zero-sum account but revealed that perceptions of group discrimination were positively correlated: a case of ‘they’re discriminated against, but so are we’ rather than ‘if they gain, we lose’. Moreover, concerns about future discrimination of the ingroup were most predictive of opposition to multicultural policy and immigration. We argue our findings are more consistent with a competitive victimhood account of intergroup relations than a zero-sum thinking account. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Objectives: (a) To assess and compare the changes in five facial signs with age between genders of Caucasian subjects and (b) to evaluate their links with perceived ages and tiredness. Material and Methods: Once zoomed from standardized digital photographs, five facial signs of 518 Caucasian French subjects of both genders and different ages (18-69 years) were graded by 15 experts, using a referential Skin Aging Atlas. A large naïve panel of 1000 French subjects (500 men and 500 women) was asked to attribute a perceived age and a degree of tiredness to 200 subjects (among the 518). Results: The severity of the facial signs increases with time at a linear-like rate. The changes in marionette lines significantly differ between genders, much more pronounced in women, and nasolabial fold was found more pronounced in men at older ages (>50 years). Before 50's, Forehead wrinkles present a slightly higher severity in men whereas at 50's women present more severe ptosis. Crow's feet wrinkles did not show significant changes. Perceived ages were found significantly correlated with the severities of the facial signs and the perception of tiredness was associated with perceived ages in men, but not in women older than 40 years. The gender-related perceptions from the naïve panel in both perceived ages and tiredness showed a low discrepancy. Interestingly, as for changes in facial signs, the upper-half face seems more affected for men and lower-half face for women; after 40 years, the naïve panel seems more focusing on the same areas to predict a perceived age. Conclusion: As compared to the previous Chinese study, the present work reveals some slight ethnical-related differences, indicating that the facial signs of the lower face play a major role in the assessment of perceived age of both genders from different ethnicity. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - There is considerable evidence to suggest that individuals with mental illness as well as their carers and families are discriminated against across a number of domains. It is also well recognized that people with mental illness are likely to die younger than their counterparts who do not have mental illness. We propose that a Magna Carta is urgently needed to protect the rights of people with mental illness and help reduce discrimination. In this paper a background and rationale for this is offered alongside suggestions for reducing discrimination. The simple message is this; progress in health, economic, environmental and global development will not be made without improvements in mental health. The reasons are equally straightforward as mental illnesses cause more disability than any other health condition and bring enormous pain and suffering to individuals, their families and communities. These impacts lead to early death, damage to the economy and restrain individual progress. Every country needs to take urgent responsibility for defending the rights of individuals with mental illness. © 2020 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.

AB  - As Spanish heritage courses multiply all over the United States, the need to reexamine the curriculum and pedagogical approaches that are most appropriate to meet instructional goals is becoming increasingly pressing. Although several researchers have called for developing students’ critical language awareness (CLA) in the Spanish heritage classroom, this model has yet to make its way fully into the curriculum. A CLA approach is essential to help students become aware of issues of language and power and the privileging of certain dialects over others. Spanish language maintenance in the United States cannot be achieved unless learners develop this awareness in order to challenge dominant language ideologies that have been reproduced through education. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a four-module curriculum designed to develop Spanish heritage learners’ CLA. The modules address (1) language variation and diversity; (2) language ideologies and linguistic prejudice; (3) Spanish in the United States and bilingualism; and (4) language maintenance. Pretest and posttest results show the curriculum effectively improved students’ level of CLA. Pedagogical implications and recommendations are discussed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - According to ambivalent sexism theory, prejudice toward women has two forms: hostile (i.e., antipathy toward women) and benevolent (i.e., patronizing and paternalistic attitudes toward women). We investigated whether 5- to 11-year-old children’s gender attitudes exhibit this bipartite, ambivalent structure. Consistent with this possibility, latent variable modeling on a new developmentally appropriate instrument revealed that children’s (n = 237) hostile and benevolent attitudes were two distinct but positively associated factors. Using this instrument, we then explored age and U.S. regional differences in ambivalent gender attitudes, as well as whether these attitudes predicted self-evaluations and preferences associated with traditional gender roles. Stronger agreement with hostile and benevolent gender attitudes was found among younger children, except for boys’ benevolent attitudes, which did not vary with age. Children also reported lower agreement with benevolent gender attitudes in a more gender-egalitarian region of the United States (New York vs. Illinois). Finally, children’s benevolent and hostile attitudes differentially predicted their self-evaluations (e.g., boys’ benevolent vs. hostile attitudes predicted higher vs. lower self-evaluations of warmth, respectively). No evidence emerged for links between gender attitudes and traditional career or relationship expectations. These findings provide the first known evidence that children’s gender attitudes are ambivalent—comprising distinct, but positively related, dimensions of subjective positivity and negativity. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - While extended intergroup contact has been commonly studied in the context of prejudice reduction, less is known about its implications for processes related to the ingroup. Through three correlational and one experimental studies (total N = 897) conducted in two different intergroup contexts (Turkey and United Kingdom), we investigated whether extended intergroup contact relates to social distance and attitudes towards ingroup members as a function of outgroup attitudes. We also investigated ingroup identification and perceived ingroup morality as potential mediators in these associations. Correlational studies demonstrated that especially when outgroup attitudes were more negative, participants’ positive (but not negative) extended contact was related to a more negative evaluation of the ingroup; whereas when outgroup attitudes were more positive, extended contact was associated with positive attitudes towards the ingroup. We found experimental evidence for the suggested relationships in relation to ingroup social distance. Findings are discussed in the light of vicarious dissonance theory and deprovincialization hypothesis. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Britain’s unexpected vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) in June 2016 has proved divisive and damaging both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Across two correlational studies, the current research proposed a model to explain the Brexit vote, with attitudes to immigration and willingness to disagree (WD) as direct predictors of the referendum result, and internal (IMS) and external (EMS) motivation to respond without prejudice as indirect predictors. Study 1 (N = 353) and Study 2 (N = 363) both showed good fit with the model and, respectively, explained 48% and 46% of the referendum result. More positive attitudes to immigration predicted a vote to remain. Higher IMS and lower EMS predicted a vote to remain, fully mediated by attitudes to immigration. In Study 1, lower WD also predicted a vote to remain, both directly and indirectly via attitudes to immigration, although this was not replicated in Study 2. These results are discussed both in relation to the Brexit result, and the implications for motivation to respond without prejudice, WD, and political correctness more generally. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Expressions of hostility in immigrants’ surrounding environment have been shown to negatively influence their relation to the political society. The impact of such contextual hostility on immigrant youths and political community support however remains unexplored. Filling these gaps, I test the hypothesis that contextual hostility decreases immigrant youths’ political community support, captured with a sense of national pride. In addition, I test two rivalling hypotheses regarding the influence of contextual hostility on the so-called second generation of immigrants, expecting the impact to be either weaker or stronger among the second generation of immigrants in comparison to the first generation. Analysing survey data on the political beliefs of youths in secondary school classes in Sweden, my main finding is that immigrant youths in school classes with high levels of anti-immigrant attitudes are less supportive of the political community, entailing a potential legitimacy problem for the democratic system. The impact of anti-immigrant attitudes among the second generation of immigrants is in turn weak or non-existing. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Being labeled as terrorists has been one of the primary negative stereotypes used against Muslims in the USA. Muslim Americans are very diverse coming from different ethnic, historical, and cultural backgrounds. They belong to various religious schools of thought and practice, as well as branches of Islam. Differences among this diverse group stipulate different perceptions of being stereotyped as terrorists, which was at large ignored by previous research. I use data from the 2011 Pew Religion and Public Life Survey (N = 806), to analyze differences among various Muslim American racial/ethnic groups in perceptions of being stereotyped as terrorists. Black, Asian, and Hispanic Muslims report a few times lower odds of being viewed as terrorists than white Muslims (respondents having origins primarily in the Middle East or North Africa). Compared to conservatives, moderates and liberal Muslims are more likely to name ‘viewed as terrorists’ among the most important problem facing Muslims living in the USA today. Among acculturation and socio-demographic correlates, nativity was associated with being viewed as terrorists. Using the Muslim case, the study identifies different positions in perceptions of stereotypes and challenges the stereotypical approach of constructing a population identity as homogeneous. © 2020 Society for Terrorism Research.

AB  - Within a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, heteronormative ideology serves as a social force that maintains dominant group members’ status (e.g., heterosexual men). Disgust may be an emotional reaction to gay men’s violation of heteronormativity (i.e., same-sex sexual behavior) and motivate hostile attitudes toward gay men to promote interpersonal and intergroup boundaries. Based on this theoretical framework, we hypothesized that sexual disgust—compared to pathogen or moral disgust—would be most strongly associated with antigay hostility and would statistically mediate its relationship with heteronormativity. Heterosexual men in the United States (n = 409) completed an online questionnaire assessing heteronormative ideology, disgust sensitivity, and hostile attitudes toward gay men. Results support the hypotheses and suggest that gay men’s sexual behavior is the most likely elicitor of disgust and antigay hostility, as opposed to a perceived pathogen threat or moral transgression. The findings indicate that heteronormative attitudes and sexual disgust are likely contributors to antigay hostility. Thus, intervention efforts should seek to improve tolerance of same-sex sexual behavior among heterosexual men, which may mitigate emotional reactions and hostile attitudes toward gay men. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Public Significance Statement—The present study encourages researchers to think about social identities more critically in order to better understand the associations between identity-based indignities and well-being. Thus, we demonstrate how to capture the unique experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people of color who face prejudice unlike racism or heterosexism alone.

Objectives: Discrimination, once unmistakable, has taken on subtler forms as exemplified by microaggressions—daily, seemingly harmless indignities that send negative messages to minority group members (Sue, Capodilupo, et al., 2007). Furthermore, unique microaggressions exist for individuals who possess more than one stigmatized identity. For example, racial/ethnic minorities who are also lesbian, gay, or bisexual face discrimination that is unlike racism or heterosexism alone or in combination. Thus, to meaningfully investigate how dually marginalized individuals experience various forms of contemporary, covert discrimination, scholars need access to paradigms that better capture their existential realities. Specifically, greater attention must be paid to how interlocking social categories shape experiences of subtle discrimination. To this end, we demonstrate how to conceptualize quantitative research that is mindful of intersectionality—or the interconnection of social identities in creating overlapping and interdependent systems of oppression. Method: We conducted a 2-phase study to examine whether an intersectional methodology better predicted adverse health outcomes for 801 lesbian, gay, and bisexual people of color as compared to an additive/multiplicative approach (i.e., combining scores from two different measures of experiences with racism and heterosexism). Results: Results indicated that intersectionality (vs. additive/multiplicative approach) better measured symptomology for racially diverse sexual minority group members who experienced microaggressions. Conclusions: These findings provide quantitative evidence in support of intersectionality, an achievable methodological approach that captures subtle encounters with discrimination for individuals with interlocking marginalized identities—encounters that would otherwise remain on the fringe of research.

AB  - Freedom of speech for all citizens is often considered as a cornerstone of democratic societies. In three studies, we examined the relationship between cognitive ability and support for freedom of speech for a variety of social groups across the ideological spectrum (N1 varies between 1,373 and 18,719, N2 = 298, N3 = 395). Corroborating our theoretical expectations, although cognitive ability was related to more affective prejudice toward relatively conservative groups and less affective prejudice toward relatively liberal groups (Study 2), people with higher levels of cognitive ability were more in favor of freedom of speech for all target groups (Studies 1–3). The relationship between cognitive ability and freedom of speech support was mediated by intellectual humility (preregistered Study 3). These results indicate that cognitive ability contributes to support for the democratic right of freedom of speech for all social–ideological groups. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Suspension is defined as a temporary removal from the educational setting where a child is able to return after a determined period of time, while expulsion is the complete and permanent removal of a child from an entire educational system (Gilliam and Shahar 2006). Preschool children have been found to be both suspended and expelled at higher rates than school-aged children (Cutler and Gilkerson 2002; Gilliam 2005; Gilliam and Shahar 2006). It has been reported that 50,000 preschoolers were suspended at least once; another 17,000 were estimated to have been expelled (Malik 2017). However, much of this information had been collected from public preschool programs. Although many factors contribute to the high suspension and expulsion rates of young children, race has risen to the forefront as a possible contributing correlate to disproportionality (Kunesh and Noltemeyer 2019; U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights 2016a, b). More specifically, children of color have been found to be at increased risk for being suspended and expelled (U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights 2016a, b). In addition to addressing the gap in research by reporting suspension and expulsion data from one state’s community childcare centers, this paper also examines the disproportionality of suspensions and expulsions in these programs. The impact of director race on early childhood suspension and expulsion is also considered as a contributing factor. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - A number of homeland security measures have been implemented or proposed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. While public opinion polls suggest that some of these measures (e.g., universal security checks) have received widespread support, security policies advanced by President Donald Trump that target Muslims and other immigrant groups are more controversial. These polices have conflated immigration with terrorism and have generated anti–immigrant sentiment in some segments of the American public. In this paper, we utilize national survey data to examine the social sources of public support for national security measures, with a focus on policies that emphasize border control, universal security, reduced civil liberties, discriminatory surveillance, and exclusion. We also determine the extent to which support for policies specific to the Trump administration is driven by Trump’s voter base–White, male, older, southern, Christian, and conservative and assess the influence of anti–immigrant attitudes. Our analyses reveal that the American public favors security measures that are applied universally, and characteristics of Trump’s voter base further predict policy support. Our findings also suggest that support of discriminatory security policies is largely explained by the perception that immigrants are dangerous. We discuss the implications of the anti–immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that has stemmed from Trump’s presidential campaign and subsequent administration for national security policies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article explores the political relevance of popular artistic productions by immigrants and the links between art and identity politics in the context of Israel. I propose the term ethnic provocation as an analytical tool for understanding the role of immigrant artists’ critical stance in their new society, and the anti-hegemonic spirit they advance. I examine the work of immigrant artists, members of the Russian-Israeli Generation 1.5, who came to Israel as children. The provocative art created by these immigrants tackles four different aspects of their ethnic identity: the stereotype of Russian speaking women as “sluts”, the religious-nationalist view of ex-Soviet Jews as gentiles, presentation of them as foreigners who do not belong in the Jewish state and their ambiguous location on the Israeli ethnic map. The article argues that ethnic provocation aims at resisting the negative stereotypes and exclusion of immigrants, and at challenging the ethnic hegemony in the host society. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There are increased efforts to improve patient–provider relations and engagement within North American mental health systems. However, it is unclear how these innovations impact care for ethnic minorities, a group that continues to face social and health disparities. This study examined one such engagement innovation—person-centered care planning—to gain a better understanding of this overall process. We specifically explored how mental health providers trained in person-centered care planning work with their patients of Latinx and Asian backgrounds. In-depth interviews were conducted with mental health providers in community clinics, and narratives were analyzed via phenomenological methods. Findings revealed that regardless of specific practice innovations, it was providers’ own embeddedness in their mental health organizational culture that became conspicuous as a determinant of care. This culture contained implicit preferences for clients considered to be ideal (e.g., are verbal, admit a problem or illness, accept services, and are individually oriented). These clients were experienced as ideal largely because they helped the system operate efficiently. Findings suggest that these organizational norms, preferences, and expectations—and bureaucratic demands for efficiency—may engender an implicit organizational bias that creates barriers for culturally different groups. These biases may also hinder practice innovations, whether patient-centered, disparities-focused, or otherwise. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement—Mental health organizations hold norms and expectations regarding what an ideal client should act like and typically prefer clients who help them operate efficiently. This presents serious barriers for cultural minority clients, whose own norms and preferences often conflict with the preferential biases of mental health treatment culture.

AB  - This corpus-assisted critical discourse study examines news reports published by China’s official English-language media from 2000 to 2018, with the goal of understanding how they represent LGBTQ+ issues within the China’s socio-political context. Analysis reveals that the discussion of LGBTQ+-related topics has been consistently discouraged in China’s official English-language media, and the few news reports which have appeared in these media sources have focused on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS through homosexual behaviors, on promoting LGBTQ+ rights, and on advocating for the liberalization of sex education in China. The range of these focuses indicates that, despite widely-held negative stereotypes regarding homosexual behaviors and their relation to the spread of HIV/AIDS, the official English-language media of China have endeavored to project a positive image of the Chinese central government’s efforts to construct a society that is open, inclusive, and tolerant of LGBTQ+ individuals. This study also discusses positive changes in the social well-being of LGBTQ+ persons in China as evidenced first by the more liberal attitudes that gradually have resulted from the efforts of Chinese netizens to influence LGBTQ+-related governmental policies and second, by the more positive representations of LGBTQ+ issues being communicated to global audiences through the China’s official English-language media. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - People living with HIV (PLWH) would decide whether to disclose their HIV serostatus to others based on the weight of perceived benefits and costs for the disclosure. Using cross-sectional data from 1254 PLWH in Guangxi, China, the study aimed to examine a framework of disclosure decision-making in the context of disclosure to family members (parents and siblings) through exploring the associations between disclosure and perceived benefits and costs of disclosure at individual and interpersonal levels. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that HIV disclosure was associated with perceived benefits at both individual level (stress relief and social support) and interpersonal level (educating others and promoting family stability), but was not associated with perceived costs at either individual level (stigma and confidentiality breaching) or interpersonal level (family conflicts and concerns). Our findings suggest that perceived benefits rather than costs are associated with disclosure to family and play an important role in disclosure decision-making. These results may refine and expand the existing framework on decision-making of HIV disclosure focusing on PLWH’s weight of individual benefits and costs. Future interventions highlighting the benefits for their family and other members of their social network may be an effective strategy to promote HIV disclosure to family members. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: Public attitudes towards stuttering have been shown to reflect negative stereotypes and stigma around the world, and especially so in several Middle Eastern studies. Nevertheless, attitudes of nonstuttering individuals who are close friends with–or related to–a person who stutters have been shown to be more positive than the public without such experience with stuttering. Purpose: To measure attitudes towards stuttering of parents and other family members of individuals who stutter in Egypt. Method: A sample of 100 Egyptian family members of children who stutter, 80% of whom were the children's parents, rated their attitudes towards stuttering on an Arabic version of the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes–Stuttering (POSHA–S) (St. Louis, 2011). Results: Egyptian parents displayed attitudes towards stuttering and people who stutter that were less positive than other samples around the world from the POSHA–S database. Conclusion: Cultural differences between Egypt and Western countries were interpreted to explain less positive attitudes overall. Also, being a parent or close relative of a stuttering child failed to foster more positive attitudes towards stuttering than comparison Middle East samples. Public awareness campaigns directed at promoting accurate information about stuttering among Egyptian parents should be undertaken to mitigate their negative attitudes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article focuses on Africa-origin male marriage migrants who settle in Australia through their inter-ethnic relationships with Australian women. Male marriage migrants, many of whom are from lower socio-economic backgrounds, expected to find happiness in their intimate intercultural relationships, and in their new and promising geographical and social contexts. This article is based on extensive interview data with these male marriage migrants and demonstrates that while men imagined that their lives in Australia with their intimate partners would be good, their everyday lived experiences turned out differently. For many of these men, marriage migration undermined their sense of self and understanding of what it means to be a man and a husband. Through the journey of marriage migration, their Australian spouses were bestowed with unforeseen power over them, challenging expected gender roles and resulting in a myriad of dependencies and ultimately unhappiness amongst the men. These findings are significant because male marriage migrants often are assumed to only be marrying for visa purposes instead of romantic reasons. This article investigates the often overlooked experiences of men from African countries who are pursuing Ahmed’s [(2010). The promise of happiness. Durham: Duke University Press.] ‘happiness project’ through marriage migration to Australia, experiences that are a factor in explaining relationship breakdowns. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article investigates the perceptions of mainstream Turks in Turkey towards Turkish (re)migrants from West European countries. It seeks to gain insight into themes and issues emerging in the cultural contact of (re)migrants with Turks back in Turkey and to elucidate the dimensions of the perceived stigmatization of Turkish (re)migrants. By using an original survey instrument, the items of which were generated based on the semi-structured interviews with 53 informants, data were collected from 606 Turkish informants. Based on the survey results, a model was developed and validated. The results of the study are discussed within the frameworks of intergroup relations and social categorization of the social identity approach. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the context of ongoing debate about the positive and negative consequences of ethnic diversity for intergroup relations, we study inter-ethnic relations among adolescents in England’s schools. In the first national study of schools throughout England to relate inter-ethnic attitudes to both school and area ethnic composition, we combine survey data collected from 14-year-olds in nearly 100 schools with administrative data. We focus on relations between three ethno-racial categories: White-British, Asian-British and Black-British, for three conceptually distinct indicators of inter-ethnic orientations: warmth, friends, and attitudes. We posit that ‘contact’, proxied by school outgroup composition, should lead to more positive intergroup orientations, while ‘exposure’, proxied by neighbourhood outgroup composition, should lead to more negative intergroup relations. We show that higher school outgroup shares are associated with more positive orientations towards that group for almost all relationships and measures. We further show that for the two instances where higher school outgroup shares do not enhance positive intergroup orientations, they nevertheless moderate negative effects of neighbourhood composition. We conclude that schools offer the opportunity to enhance intergroup relations and to mitigate the threats associated with increased neighbourhood diversity with potentially enduring consequences. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Prejudice and discrimination in everyday life are persistent problems for most societies but difficult to uncover and explain by empirical social research. Complementing existing approaches to study discrimination, we demonstrate the usefulness of survey-based stated choice experiments to explore everyday discrimination and its heterogeneity within a multifactorial framework. In our study German respondents (n = 766) were asked to choose between various carpooling offers varying not only in regard to price, car type, and rating but also to the perceived ethnic background of the driver. Random parameter logit models show preference heterogeneity in the sample and that differences in choice behaviour related to perceived ethnic background of the driver can be explained by xenophobic attitudes and lack of regular contact with perceived ‘foreigners’. We find no indication that familiarity with the situation reduces discriminatory preferences. Our survey-based approach adds to existing research by experimentally singling out main and interactions effects of discriminatory attributes and by being able to determine the correlation between personal characteristics of the decision makers and their discriminatory preferences. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Since the late 1990s, populist discourse based on anti-immigration sentiments has been on the rise in Britain. This phenomenon reached a peak during the EU Referendum (ER) campaign and shortly thereafter. The ER has been linked to the upsurge in racially and religiously aggravated offences recorded post-July 2016. Polish nationals, who constitute the largest group of EU nationals in the UK, were targeted by many of these incidents. It could therefore be argued that, in the last years, and particularly, since the ER, EU nationals living in the UK have become more ‘vulnerable’. To test this hypothesis, this contribution is based on an interdisciplinary project that collected socio-legal evidence to compare the vulnerability of the Polish community in Southampton before and after the ER. The paper draws on vulnerability and psychology literature to differentiate between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ vulnerability. Our study deploys mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) to test changes in objective and subjective vulnerability among Southampton-based Poles before and after the ER. Our findings suggest that, following the ER, Poles felt significantly more vulnerable, especially in terms of subjective vulnerability, even if they had never experienced overt hate incidents or discrimination (objective vulnerability) before. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper departs from an ethnography of Somali parents in Oslo, Norway, which examined perceptions of the Child Welfare Services (CWS). We explore how young second-generation parents portray middle class identities when they interact with school and kindergarten personnel. These are institutions under legal obligation to report to the CWS if they suspect neglect of children. Drawing on Goffman, we analyse how parents conduct and meticulously prepare for encounters with school and kindergarten personnel. These preparations pertain to countering ethnic stigma and avoiding racial scrutiny, in large part to avoid referrals to the CWS. Our paper makes the following contributions. In the study of child welfare and ethnicity, we stress the importance of visible ethnicity–or ‘race’–and show how scepticism of CWS derives from suspicions of racial prejudice; strained relations between migrants and the CWS extend far beyond interactions between caseworkers and clients as they also stem from interactions with adjacent institutions. Regarding the study of ethnic relations, we argue that understanding performance of ethnicity requires inclusion of institutional contexts, such as the schools, kindergartens and the CWS. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Limited research on access and utilization of sexual health services by sexual minorities has disadvantaged improvements of health systems in terms of providing appropriate treatment and care. Studies demonstrate that LGBTQ persons are more likely to experience health inequities, and are seldom recognized in health research and interventions. Using qualitative methods, this study aimed to shed insights into the utilization of health care services among university LGBT students. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 LGBT university students aged 18–24 years in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The interviews reveal that LGBT youth are victims of stigmatization, prejudice, and marginalization within the health system. Health providers have limited training in addressing the concerns of the LGBT community. The Internet is an important source of health information for LGBT youth. Students preferred private health services, because they felt health providers are more informed about their health needs and concerns. The findings suggest the importance of incorporating the needs of LGBT youth within youth-friendly initiatives. Future research should investigate the incidence and prevalence of diseases among LGBTQ persons, and take into account the perceptions and attitudes of health providers to understand their views on the provision of sexual health care for LGBTQ youth. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Humans generally fear those different to them (i.e., an out-group) in the same way they fear natural predators. But fear pushes us to derogate others, whether they constitute a threat or not. Research has examined how fear associated with specific intergroup relations interferes with how individuals relate to in-group and out-group members. However, we know relatively little about how intergroup relations might be affected by incidental emotions. We tested how incidental fear affects empathy toward in-group and out-group members. We found that exposing participants to fearful imagery was sufficient to reduce empathy, but only in response to out-group suffering. We discuss how these findings provide insight into how fear is often leveraged to encourage social tribalism.

AB  - To gain insights into whether schools striving to improve intergroup dynamics should curb disliking or facilitate liking across students of different ethnic groups, the current study examines the associations between interpersonal affect and intergroup relations in multiethnic schools. Given (i.e., outgoing) peer nominations of liked and disliked grade-mates were coded by ethnicity in 26 public middle schools, including all Asian, Black, Latinx, and White students (N = 4,350). Controlling for earlier intergroup attitudes and the availability of ethnic ingroup and relevant outgroup grade-mates, multilevel analyses show that liking (but not disliking) of cross-ethnic grade-mates was associated with more positive attitudes toward that particular ethnic group. Implications of these findings for intergroup relations among adolescents in multiethnic schools are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The term homophobia is widely used to describe negative attitudes toward homosexuality. As with some concepts in the social sciences, different researchers apply the term to widely different forms of discrimination against gay men and lesbians. Existing research provides some general classifications of different spheres in which homophobia operate, but these typologies are too broad to serve as frameworks for in-depth analyses of discourses and manifestations of homophobia. This article reviews different conceptualizations associated with the term homophobia in academic literature and synthesizes these diverse positions into a comprehensive framework—a taxonomy of homophobia—that can facilitate analysis of homophobia in a given context and enhance comparisons between contexts. The proposed homophobia framework postulates that negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians can manifest in seven distinct, yet interrelated shades, namely radical, prohibitionist, denialist, avoidance, morbidity, tepid, and veiled. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present study examined the role of parents’ prejudices and their children’s own religious orientation in the formation of children’s prejudices against the opposite gender and sect. A total of 280 children including 104 (36%) girls were recruited from various schools. Children age range from 12 to 18 years with mean ± SD = 14.60 (1.42) years. Parents of the children (including 175 fathers and 113 mothers) were approached at their homes. Based on the conceptualisation of the study, parallel models addressing gender and sectarian ingroup-outgroup classification were developed and estimated. The study tested, confirmed, and validated the cognitive-developmental model addressing the underlying mechanism for shaping the religious orientation of children as a consequence of parents’ prejudices and its role in the mental health of children. The results supported the conceptual model of the study elaborating on the underlying mechanism of the relationship among parents’ and children’s prejudices, and children’s religious orientation in the development of depression and anxiety in children.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore the educational experiences of women with disabilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This study analysed interviews from women with disabilities who have successfully negotiated the educational system in the KSA and highlights the participants’ skills/abilities and connections while at the same time sheds light on systemic barriers they faced. Using an expanded notion of cultural capital, participants confirmed the relevance of all the categories of cultural capital (except the linguistic one), although some revisions to the model are discussed to better match the experience of the participants. All the women in this study had educational aspirations, resisted negative stereotyping, navigated a complex set of barriers to achieve educational success, and had strong familial support and emotional support from their social networks. Although there is a legislative/policy foundation for educational services for women and people with disabilities, the study identifies some systemic barriers to education equality. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Stigma represents an important social issue, one rooted in communication. The present study used a quantitative content analysis to examine the representation of the term stigma in one national and six regional news publications in the United States between 2000 and 2018. In the 1,524 stories examined, journalists explicitly defined stigma once. Stigma was discussed in relation to serious, often dehumanized conditions such as schizophrenia, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS. However, journalists and news sources frequently trivialized stigma by referencing it in relation to bad football teams, food, motor vehicles, and other objects that do not experience the full impact of stigma: stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The knowledge about substance use and treatment among migrants and ethnic minorities is scarce in the European Union. In light of recommendations to optimize data gathering and processing, the aim of this paper is to identify which migration and ethnicity related indicators are used in the EU-28 treatment demand indicator (TDI) registries. We present results of a systematic TDI report analysis and an online survey. Because of the importance of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in the European Union, we base the discussion of the results on survey responses of experts in the member states. We subsequently discuss considerations related to 1) optimizing migration and ethnicity related indicators in TDI and other drug related indicator protocols, 2) using unique identifiers, and 3) enhancing purpose specification and informed consent. These suggestions are formulated against the backdrop of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as the growing need to ground comprehensive drug treatment policies in tiered modelling and multi-indicator analysis. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - LGBTQ + young people of color manage societal marginalization related to their LGBTQ + and racial/ethnic identities, which can shape health challenges. Despite their elevated need for responsive health services, cultural competence among service providers has largely focused on race/ethnicity, rather than LGBTQ + status, resulting in a lack of inclusive care. To understand how to better serve marginalized young adults through elevating their diverse voices, we employ an intersectional lens of emerging adulthood to qualitatively explore the health service experience narratives of 41 LGBTQ + Latino/a emerging adults between 18 and 25. First, most participants stressed that being perceived as young constrained their patient-provider interactions and limited their health care autonomy. Secondly, participants encountered a continuum of service providers that ranged across prejudice, ignorance, and acceptance tied to the young person’s LGBTQ + and intersecting identities. Finally, participants outlined what they preferred when it came to health care services. This study has important implications for how health service providers may establish inclusive health care that promotes marginalized emerging adults’ autonomy and wellbeing. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Literature concerned with attitudes toward transgender (TG) individuals has been found to be lacking. Predominant research is quantitative and the few qualitative studies either investigated TG experience or attitudes of those with personal experience of TG people. This study investigated this topic using a qualitative approach employing semi-structured interviews exploring beliefs, understanding, and experience of TG people. Foucauldian Discourse Analysis was used to analyze the language used to construct a “transgender” discourse. Participants were cisgender, heterosexual, female participants from Black and ethnic minority backgrounds (n = 6). Prevalent discourses were; “Heteronormativity as a Benchmark,” “The Ease of Disclosure’“ and “Actualising the Other.” Participants consistently drew on discourse that constructed TG as “other.” Findings indicate a need to attend to context, as well as content, when exploring attitudes and that covert forms of prejudice need to be addressed and could inform anti-prejudice interventions and the creation of future transphobia measurements. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Direct experience of social difference is crucial if lower levels of prejudice and greater social cohesion are to be achieved in our cities. Despite their key role of connecting places and people, transport infrastructures have scarcely been assessed as facilitators of encounters with social difference. Furthermore, urban contexts are progressively more complex due to the increasing relevance of transport multimodality along with the unequal degree of access to different transport modes. Building upon network analysis and consolidated accessibility measures, this study presents multi-accessibility as a concept and quantitative instrument to evaluate the potential encounter of difference in city spaces opened up by multimodal transport infrastructures. Multi-accessibility is also presented as a relevant and complementary policy avenue to enhancing social cohesion through transport planning and land use policies in the future. Two planning scenarios for the case of the Madrid metropolitan area illustrate the application, utility and interpretability of the instrument. © 2019 Urban Affairs Association.

AB  - The research presented here constitutes the first investigation of the standard language ideology (SLI) in Great Britain that takes account of a multiethnolect–namely Multicultural London English (MLE). A corpus-informed discourse study was conducted to explore representations of MLE and its speakers in two corpora: one containing data from non-MLE-speaking Londoners and one consisting of data from MLE speakers themselves. The data included in these corpora had been collected by means of an online questionnaire. The discourses in both corpora clearly reflected the SLI that prevails in the British context–but much stronger evidence of this was found in the non-MLE speakers’ discourses. The non-MLE speakers were also found to hold much stronger, and very negative, social stereotypes of multiethnolect speakers. There was evidence of their use of iconisation and erasure in order to create linguistic (and social) differences between themselves and MLE speakers. Given the current political climate in Great Britain, it is hypothesised that the non-MLE speakers’ negative views of the multiethnolect and its speakers helped them reaffirm their own prestige, which they perceived to be threatened. Notably, the MLE speakers themselves were not complicit in the negative stereotypisation of their own group. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In July 2018, the UK’s Intelligence & Security Committee issued a report into diversity and inclusion across the intelligence and security community. The picture the report painted was far from satisfactory; in short, Britain’s intelligence agencies did not ‘fully reflect the ethnic make-up of modern Britain’. The report argued that Britain’s spy agencies–MI5, SIS (or MI6) and GCHQ–should improve black, Asian and ethnic minority recruitment, highlighting areas for improvement, especially around the vetting of recruits. This problem stems from the post-war Cold War ‘security state’ and the development of security-vetting programmes from the 1940s, aiming to protect Whitehall from Soviet spies and ‘fellow travellers’ to those with so-called ‘character defects’– drink, drugs and homosexuality. But this ‘security state’ also saw the newly emerging multicultural Britain as a major threat. The so-called ‘Windrush Generation’ of migrants from the Caribbean, and migration from the Indian subcontinent and Africa, forever changed the social complexion of Britain, but posed significant questions for security officials. What was Britishness? With first or second generation migrants entering the civil service, who was a ‘UK eye’ and what access to secret information should they have? To what extent was discrimination justifiable to protect state secrets, and how should officials respond to new legislation such as the Race Discrimination Act? As this article shows, new entrants to the civil service faced deeply engrained prejudices, and questions over their loyalty to Britain. As late as the 1960s (and beyond), ‘coloured’ members of the civil service were rejected from secret posts across government, including the Ministry of Defence and intelligence and security services, especially MI5 and GCHQ, with discrimination on ‘security’ grounds justified by the landmark 1968 Race Relations Act, which barred race discrimination for housing and employment elsewhere. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - According to the precarious manhood perspective, masculinity threat triggers various compensatory mechanisms and heightens motivation to restore and reaffirm masculinity via typically masculine attitudes and behaviors. Four experiments aiming to examine the effect of masculinity threat on prejudices toward sexual and gender minorities were undertaken, controlling for adherence to sex role stereotypes. Our studies showed that Polish men representing university and high school students exposed to gender threat experienced increased negative affect (Experiment 1) and expressed higher prejudices toward gay people (Experiment 2) and transgender individuals (Experiments 3a and 3b). Furthermore, Experiment 2 revealed an effect of masculinity threat on modern prejudices predominantly toward gay people but not old-fashioned homonegativity. The results are discussed in terms of the role of masculinity threat as the mechanism responsible for gender differences in the attitudes toward sexual and gender minorities. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study used data from the 2015 US Transgender Survey, which gathered information from the largest sample of trans individuals to date. High labor force participation rates and high unemployment rates were found for both trans men and women. However, women were more likely to be out of the labor force and less likely to be employed than men. The unemployment rate of trans women was greater than that of trans men with otherwise similar characteristics; these results are consistent with the existence of an additional labor market penalty for being female on top of a penalty for being transgender. While perceived gender incongruence (the ability of other people to identify transgender individuals as such) was more common among women, the relation of that variable with labor force status was stronger for men. There was no evidence that state-level employment non-discrimination laws were associated with improved labor force outcomes. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In Turkey, discrimination against women has cultural, sociological, and legal causes. Education, health, employment, and social life carry traces of gender discrimination. Gender inequality also occurs in the legal field. Especially in the criminal justice system, women experience disadvantages compared to men. Despite the gender-neutral laws, discrimination is widespread and affects law enforcement, which is dominated by patriarchal social codes and prejudices. This study aims to focus on women as victims and offenders in the Turkish criminal justice system, with examples and assessments from investigation of the corrections system. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Community perceptions of schizophrenia potentially influence the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals with the disorder. There is some evidence of improved community knowledge of schizophrenia in recent years; however, misconceptions still remain. Aims: The aims were to investigate community perceptions of schizophrenia at two points in time. Method: Two cross-sectional surveys were used to assess perceptions of schizophrenia. Using personal contacts and a snowball approach, members of the Australian community were recruited in 2005 (n = 1214) and in 2017 (n = 985). Participants were asked “What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think about schizophrenia?” Results: Analyses revealed that community knowledge of schizophrenia was more accurate at the second time point and prosocial tendencies were more evident. Perceptions of dangerousness, aggressiveness and unpredictability did not differ at the two time points. Despite there being fewer responses that confused schizophrenia with dissociative identity disorder, this misconception was still evident. Conclusions: Although community knowledge about schizophrenia appears to have become more accurate and empathic, the endurance of negative stereotypes and misunderstandings highlights the need for community education programmes to combat stigma and discrimination. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The current study integrated prior research demonstrating 1) a mediational process by which the Five-Factor Model personality factor Openness to Experience, transmitted through right-wing authoritarian ideology, predicts sexual prejudice and 2) that the Five-Factor Model personality facet Openness to Values may be the more precise personality root of this process. Participants were 79 college students who completed a comprehensive measure of Five-Factor Model personality factors and facets and other relevant measures. Results supported hypotheses. In particular, facet-level Openness to Values accounted for comparable unique variance in sexual prejudice as factor-level Openness, and analyses of direct and indirect effects and overall model fit supported Openness to Values as the precise source predictor of the mediational pathway. Discussion focuses on preliminary evidence that Openness (and perhaps its facets) may be cultivated, and sexual prejudice reduced, by contact interventions. I emphasize in particular the promise of contact interventions that avoid frustration of the dogmatic personality by enhancing the experiential processing mode, including encouraging mental simulation of alternate social values. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Many U.S. cities pursue a “human relations” strategy in response to racial and ethnic group conflict. Reflective of Common Ingroup Identity theory, human relations practitioners emphasize a superordinate community identity among residents from different groups for the purpose of “bringing people together” in an effort to improve intergroup relations. Practitioners also encourage intergroup contact to promote positive change in attitudes. Herein, we test the influence of group identity cues and intergroup contact as predictors of perceived intergroup commonality. The findings suggest emphasizing a superordinate community identity increases feelings of commonality in the attitudes of Anglos and Latinos toward one another and toward African-Americans and Asians, while intergroup contact has no significant influence on intergroup attitudes. These findings contribute to the extant literature by simultaneously testing the relative effect of salient group identities on intergroup attitudes and expanding the focus beyond the binary comparison found in most studies of racial–ethnic relations. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Bisexual individuals suffer poorer well-being than their gay and lesbian peers. The current work highlights the identity denial experiences of people who identify as gay, lesbian, and bisexual through self-reports and quantitative measures. Study 1 (N = 130) asked participants about unsupportive experiences during sexual identity disclosure and found that experiences of identity denial were more frequently reported by bisexual individuals compared to gay and lesbian peers. Study 2 (N = 202) examined the distinct relationship of identity denial experiences, above and beyond other prejudiced responses and discrimination, with well-being and self-concept outcomes. Results suggest identity denial is a frequent experience for bisexual individuals and is uniquely associated with lower psychological well-being and a less clear self-concept. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Many LGBT people with a Christian upbringing experience conflict between their religious and sexual identities. Many resolve this conflict by leaving Christianity, others by moving to affirming churches. Some research has examined the experiences of LGBT people who choose to attend conservative churches; however, there has been very little research on the experiences of non-heterosexual women in the Catholic Church. Narrative and thematic analyses of data collected through qualitative interviews with six non-heterosexual Catholic women revealed several ways participants had integrated their faith and sexuality: acceptance from other Catholics, distinguishing between the Church and God, meeting other LGBT Christians, and developing a personal relationship with God. These reflect strategies adopted by gay Catholic men and LGBT Christians attending Protestant churches. Nonetheless, participants reported that their experiences varied from those of gay Catholic men due to gay men being more visible and more subject to prejudice within the Church. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study investigates how personality relates to citizens’ willingness to extend political, social, and cultural rights for minorities, including voting rights for immigrants, religious rights for Muslims, and affirmative action measures. Moving beyond explanations centred on intergroup relations, we argue that political efficacy (i.e. beliefs about personal political competences and the responsiveness of political elites) operates as a mechanism linking personality and policy preferences on minority rights. We test these arguments using mediation models on data from a large-N survey conducted in Germany in 2016. Results show that high openness, high agreeableness, and low conscientiousness predict permissive views on minority rights. In addition to indirect effects via group-specific attitudes, we find empirical support for substantial links via political efficacy. In particular, people high in conscientiousness or high in neuroticism have lower faith in government responsiveness, which in turn is related to less willingness to approve minority rights. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In recent years, strong public opposition to amnesty has prevented the passage of any new immigration laws that include a “pathway to citizenship” for the millions of undocumented immigrants who reside in the United States. Much scholarship on the origins of white opposition to immigration has focused on ethnocentrism. However, it has also tended to conflate racial prejudice with potentially non-racial social concerns–even though the latter could, in theory, be ameliorated through policy design in ways that racism could not. Using experiments embedded within a large national survey, we disentangle the effects of both ethnic prejudice and social concerns on public opinion. Our results indicate that significant social concerns exist independent of racial considerations, and attitudes are quite responsive to policy designed to alleviate them. Further, the extent of this responsiveness depends on partisanship. Once these considerations are addressed through policy design, we find measurably wider support for a pathway to citizenship than would be predicted were racial prejudice the underlying motivator of these social concerns. © 2020 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - The desa wisata terpadu policy was created in 1992 by the Indonesian government. Translated as integrated touristic villages, this model promotes an archetype of sustainable development adapted according to the characteristics of the local villages. Twenty-five years after the creation of this policy, it becomes relevant to examine its capacity to do so, by meeting the expectations of sustainable tourism, understood as a motor of global development and territorial integration. Because Bali remains the most important touristic destination in Indonesia, this study focus on this special case, and more especially on three villages considered as model examples: Penglipuran, Tenganan and Jatiluwih. For each, have been studying its economic sustainability, analyzing whether tourism brings local economic development; its social sustainability, evaluating the capacity of tourism to foster cohesion among the inhabitants by maintaining the traditional local organization; and its cultural sustainability, examining the complex effects of tourism on the preservation of local heritage. The methodology is based on a multi-case study, through a qualitative approach composed of 12 interviews with actors and inhabitants among the local population involved in tourism. Our results show that the three villages are successfully meeting the expectations of sustainable tourism by favoring economic growth that enables the local population to keep their community alive through community-based management that globally respects the traditional organization. However, their sustainability remains fragile and needs to be improved through an increasingly efficient socio-economic model. It includes more flexibility to involve young qualified inhabitants, without gender prejudice, in order to avoid the ‘vicious circle’ of a lack of qualified human resources limiting their capacity for economic growth. Those results may be of interest to researchers who are involved with tourism and sustainability issues, but also to institutions and professionals working on the establishment of sustainable models of tourism in Bali or elsewhere. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - ‘Hate stereotyping’ occurs when researchers foreground negative emotions, especially hate, as motivating right-wing social movements, epitomized by labels like ‘hate group’. This convention contradicts empirical evidence showing that hateful feelings and ideological prejudices are mostly insignificant for attracting and retaining members in such movements. Using contemporary theories of hate, this article demonstrates the concept’s limits and misuse in studying and theorizing the political Right. For instance, hate’s theoretical and methodological ambiguity sometimes leads scholars to confuse hatred with right-wing ideology and prejudice, which can obfuscate findings and spur dubious generalizations across political groups. Moreover, some researchers accept post-structuralist theories of hate as a substitute for vital data on emotions, motivations and meaning-making among right-wing actors. Hate explanations persist because they appeal to ‘common sense’ about intolerance, not because of their methodological integrity for studying right-wing movements. By foregrounding intolerance, hate stereotyping risks sustaining the dominant narrative that prejudices such as racism are deviant, and that racism is a problem of bad attitudes and fringe ideologies, rather than larger issues of systemic and structural inequality. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Adolescents and young adults are the main perpetrators and victims of violence in almost all parts of the world. Theories of human behavior predict that the intention to behave violently is formed in part by the individual’s attitude toward violent behavior. The purpose of this study was thus to investigate factors which both promote and protect against violent youth attitudes in Toronto, Canada’s largest urban center. Multinomial logit models were fit separately for males and females in Grades 7 to 9 using cross-sectional data from the 2006 International Youth Survey. Odds ratios were estimated for the associations between levels of attitude toward violence and select factors in each of the biological, familial, peer-related, school and community domains. A graded effect of school attachment on violent attitude was observed for both sexes; male and female students who do not like school at all are 9.89 (3.15-31.0) and 6.49 (2.19-19.2) times as likely as those who like school a lot to have the “most” versus “least” violent attitude, respectively. For every one-unit increase in (negative) perception of neighborhood score, male and female students are 1.15 (1.07-1.23) and 1.20 (1.12-1.28) times as likely to have the “most” versus “least” violent attitude. The number of victimization events was associated with attitude toward violence in males but not females, while the reverse was true for academic performance and exposure to prejudice. Our findings highlight the important relationships between connections to social environments and youth attitudes toward violence, and identify modifiable factors which may be amenable to intervention. Sex-specific differences in the predictors of violent youth attitudes warrant additional investigation and have implications for policy design. © 2021 SAGE Publications.
