T1  - Experiences and effects of HIV-related stigma among youth living with HIV/AIDS in Western Uganda: A photovoice study
AN  - 2394533713
AB  - HIV-related stigma has been identified as a significant stressor affecting Quality of Life of Youth Living With HIV/AIDS (YLWHA). Gaining a contextualized understanding of how this stigma is experienced by YLWHA in Western Uganda is crucial in addressing it in this group and setting. In this study, we explored the lived experiences of YLWHA with HIV-related stigma. Photovoice was used to gain insight into the lived experiences of HIV-related stigma in 11 YLWHA (15–19 years), purposively selected from a hospital-based peer support group. Group interview transcripts, notes and photographs were subjected to phenomenological hermeneutic analysis. Encounters with enacted, anticipated and internalized stigmas and their myriad sequels were prevalent in the photos and narratives of participants. Our findings were categorized and presented in 5 main themes that were identified through the analysis: being devalued, experiencing fear, experiencing injustices, feeling lonely, and lacking future perspectives. HIV-related stigmas were experienced in various socio-ecological domains but predominantly in homes and schools that ought to be supportive surroundings for youths. A multilevel approach, targeting the entire society where the root causes of stigma can be found and specific contexts like schools and homes where youth are confronted with stigma on a daily basis is proposed for a wholistic intervention.

T1  - Want to Improve Math Scores? An Empirical Assessment of Recent Policy Interventions in Canada
AN  - 2388009411
AB  - The Canadian provinces have implemented various strategies aimed at improving kindergarten through 12th-grade mathematics performance. There is no clear evidence which, if any, of these strategies improve achievement scores. We apply hierarchical linear modelling to the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment data to isolate the effects of policy interventions. We find that efforts to improve learning conditions can be worthwhile, but their effects are not as substantial as a school's socio-economic status composition, which elevates or depresses the academic achievements of all students. As barriers to school choice come down, ambitious parents will resort to active school choice, a strategy that may reduce social equity.Alternate abstract:Les provinces canadiennes ont instauré diverses stratégies visant à améliorer la performance en mathématiques des élèves de la maternelle à la 12e année. Rien ne démontre toutefois clairement lesquelles de ces stratégies, le cas échéant, augmentent bel et bien les taux de succès. Les auteurs appliquent la modélisation linéaire hiérarchique aux données de 2012 du Programme international pour le suivi des acquis des élèves, afin d'isoler l'incidence des interventions politiques. Ils constatent que les efforts visant l'amélioration des conditions d'apprentissage peuvent être utiles mais que leurs retombées ne sont pas aussi importantes que celles de la composition socio-économique de la clientèle scolaire, qui augmente ou diminue les résultats scolaires de tous les élèves. Avec la levée des obstacles au choix d'école, les parents ambitieux se prévaudront de ce choix, une stratégie qui pourrait être préjudiciable à l'équité sociale.

T1  - African Immigrant Students and Postsecondary Education in Canada: High School Teachers and School Career Counsellors as Gatekeepers
AN  - 2480380348
AB  - L'école et l'éducation en général sont perçues comme des moyens pour intégrer les enfants des nouveaux immigrants dans la société Canadienne, mais aussi pour préparer les jeunes immigrants â poursuivre leurs carrieres. L'école secondaire, â travers les sujets enseignés, prépare ces jeunes immigrants â l'éducation post-secondaire et â leur entrée dans le marché du travail. Cependant, ces nouveaux étudiants, particulierement ceux/celles d'origine africaine, sont découragés par la structure du systeme, et ceci les empeche de poursuivre un curriculum qui peut les conduire au choix de carriere dont ils aspirent. Cela est en grande partie le résultat du röle joué par les enseignants et les conseillers scolaires en carriere. Les recherches démontrent que les enseignants/es et les conseillers en carriere ont une préconception négative raciste, et des stéréotypes préjudiciables sur les étudiants africains quant â leurs habiletés de performance éducationnel et de succes. En plus, les écoles canadiennes promeuvent une structure linguistique, des rapports d'autorité, ainsi qu'un curriculum qui alienent les étudiants immigrants africains. Nous estimons que les écoles doivent mettre en place un systeme de guide en carriere culturellement approprié, conduit par des professionnels formés â la sensitivité culturelle. Nous estimons dans cet article le besoin d'inclure des enseignants/es et des conseillers qui apprécient la culture and le style d'apprentissage de ces étudiants, et capable de servir de modele identitaire pour ces étudiants. En plus, nous affirmons le besoin pour des programmes de mentorat entre écoles et communautés qui facilitent l'aspiration des étudiants issues des minorités dans les carrieres de leur choix.Alternate abstract:Schooling and education, in general, are perceived as a means of integrating children of new immigrants into Canadian society and preparing young immigrants for their future careers. High school education and the subjects taken prepare these young immigrants for postsecondary education and entry into the labour market. However, these newcomer students, particularly those of African origin, are discouraged by systemic structures from pursuing school curricula that may lead them to their aspired careers. This is, for a major part, the result of the role played by teachers and school career counsellors as gatekeepers. Research shows that teachers and career counsellors have preconceived negative, racist and prejudicial stereotypes about African students and their abilities for educational performance and success. Further, Canadian schools promote linguistic structures, authority patterns, and types of curricula that alienate African immigrant students. We contend that schools need to implement culturally appropriate career guidance programs that are conducted by professionals trained in cultural sensitivities. As such, this paper argues for the inclusion of teachers and counsellors who appreciate the culture and learning styles of these students, and who can serve as identity models for the students. In addition, we advance the need for inter-school-community mentorship programs that facilitate minority students' aspirations into the careers of their choice.

TT  - La eficacia de una intervención con aplicación móvil sobre actitudes asociadas a la violencia de pareja en los adolescentes de centros de acogida
AN  - 2478114838
AB  - This study focuses on the effectiveness of an app-based, monitored intervention using the Liad@s app in a residential youth-care setting. The aim of this intervention is to reduce maladaptive beliefs and attitudes linked to dating violence: distortions or myths about romantic love and hostile and benevolent dimensions of sexism. A quasi-experimental pre-post study with a control group was carried out. Participants were 71 adolescents from 9 group homes in Valencia (Spain). The outcomes measures were hostile and benevolent sexism (Ambivalent Sexism Inventory - ASI), ambivalence and prejudice towards men (Ambivalence toward Men Inventory - AMI), and myths about romantic love. The results of the intervention were assessed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). A post-intervention, statistically significant reduction with a medium-large effect size was observed in all dimensions for the treatment group, with eta-square of .25 for the sexism dimensions, .38 for myths, and .21 for ambivalence and prejudices. The experimental group demonstrated significantly more change than the control group on all measures. The benefits of the intervention did not vary by participants’ sex. These results may be helpful to professionals involved in child and youth care, who can profit from adolescents’ proclivity toward online communication.Alternate abstract:

Se realizó un estudio pre-post cuasi experimental con grupo control. Participaron 71 adolescentes de 9 centros de acogida de Valencia (España). Se tomaron medidas del cambio en sexismo hostil y benévolo (Inventario de Sexismo Ambivalente - ASI), de ambivalencia y prejuicio hacia los hombres (Inventario Ambivalencia hacia Hombres - AMI) y medida de mitos del amor romántico. Los resultados de la intervención fueron evaluados usando MANOVA (análisis multivariado de varianza). Se obtuvo una reducción significativa con tamaño del efecto entre medio y grande en todas las dimensiones esperadas en el grupo que usó la app. Las etas cuadrado fueron de .25 para las dimensiones de sexismo, .38 para mitos y .21 para ambivalencia y prejuicios. El grupo experimental mostró significativamente más cambio que el control en todas las medidas. Las ventajas de la intervención no varían en función del sexo de los participantes. Estos resultados pueden ser útiles para profesionales implicados en atención y cuidado a jóvenes, quienes pueden beneficiarse a su vez de su facilidad para comunicarse online.

T1  - Minority Stress, Parenting Styles, and Mental Health in Brazilian Homosexual Men
AN  - 2364109810
AB  - Homosexual men are constantly exposed to prejudice and violence in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between minority stress, parenting styles, and indicators of mental health problems in a sample of homosexual men. Method: quantitative, cross-sectional, correlational, and retrospective design. Participants were 101 Brazilian men who selfidentified as homosexuals, aged between 18 and 55 years. Results: concealing sexual identity was a predictor of depression and stress. Parental responsiveness was associated with a lower incidence of enacted stigma and depression. Conclusions: the mental health of homosexual men can be negatively affected by the need to conceal their sexual orientation. Parental responsiveness is a protective factor in terms of experiencing enacted stigma and depression. The results found in the study may be useful for counselors and social workers who are working with LGBT people and their families.

T1  - Straight, LGB, Married, Living in Sin, Children Out of Wedlock: A Comparison of Attitudes Towards ‘Different’ Family Structures
AN  - 2362743078
AB  - Australia is one of the last Western countries to legalize marriage between same-sex couples. Research suggests that the delay in marriage equality may be a consequence of societies’ conceptual connection between marriage and family being an ultimately heterosexual experience. The aim of this study was to investigate attitudes toward same-sex parenting within the marriage equality debate. Members of an Australian sample (n = 436) were randomly allocated to 1 of 9 conditions, where they received a vignette of either a heterosexual couple, a male same-sex couple, or female same-sex couple in 1 of 3 family structures (marriage/no children; marriage/children; no marriage/children). Participants rated their level of acceptance toward their allocated vignette, deciding whether the couple deserved the same rights as anyone else. Results demonstrated a significant division between acceptance of same-sex couples and heterosexual couples getting married and having children, with more negative attitudes toward same-sex couples present. Findings also highlighted a prejudice toward couples having children out of wedlock, regardless of sexual orientation of the couple. The implication for marriage equality advocates is challenging society attitudes toward marriage and family, by educating the community about same-sex parenting as well as parenting beyond marriage.

T1  - The Social Image of Families of Children and Youth in Residential Care: A Characterization and Comparison With Mainstream Families With Different Socioeconomic Status
AN  - 2283929107
AB  - The literature suggests that families of children and youths in residential care are often associated with negative social images. These images may shape prejudiced attitudes and behavior toward them and, when shared by care professionals, compromise the effectiveness of family intervention and reintegration. This study explored these social images in a sample of 176 participants with and without professional contact with this population. Participants were asked to indicate five attributes describing families of children or youths living in residential care or in mainstream environments with low or medium socioeconomic status (SES). Results indicated that both families of children and youths in residential care and families of low SES were predominantly described with negative attributes. However, only the former were characterized by dysfunctional parenting-related attributes. Medium SES families were overall described with positive attributes. Furthermore, these social images were organized in different profiles. Implications for family intervention and reintegration are discussed

T1  - Schools as Change Agents in Reducing Bias and Discrimination: Shaping Behaviors and Attitudes
AN  - 2226628523
AB  - ObjectiveTo describe the issues associated with heightened levels of discriminatory behaviors and their effects on children and youth. We then describe efforts to ameliorate discriminatory behaviors at the school level, placing emphasis on practices that can be implemented within current school initiatives.MethodWe employed a thematic review approach to examine the effects of discriminatory behaviors on children and youth, as well as on school-based practices employed to redress such behaviors.ResultsSchools can act as change agents to curb the negative experiences youth have with discrimination, hateful speech and actions, and harassment. Many schools are successfully addressing these issues through their use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, social and emotional learning programs, bullying prevention programs, and interventions, which are designed to positively influence discriminatory behaviors and biased attitudes.ConclusionSchools should address issues like harassment, bullying, racism, and discrimination through the use of programs or interventions designed to reduce them, in order to provide more equitable schooling experiences and more equitable educational outcomes for all.

T1  - "When birds of a different feather flock together" – intercultural socialization in adolescents' friendships
AN  - 2317026993
AB  - Intercultural friendships are a powerful form of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice (Pettigrew, 1998). Little is known about if and how intercultural friendships may also foster intercultural competence. An important prerequisite for the development of intercultural competence is that adolescents reflect on cultural variations. We refer to the degree to which adolescents discuss cultural variations in intercultural friendships as intercultural socialization and explore the following research questions: (1) Does intercultural socialization in friendships mediate the relation between age, intercultural friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship), and adolescents' intercultural competence? (2) Do these relations depend on the adolescents' self-identification with majority and minority culture(s)? The sample included 571 adolescents in Germany (48% female, Mage = 13.69 years, 52% identifying only as members of the cultural majority, 48% (also) as members of a cultural minority. Intercultural competence was measured using a self-report questionnaire and open-ended questions capturing the adolescents' interpretation of and reaction to intercultural situations. Quantitative measures tapped into friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship). To test our model, we employed multigroup path analysis with latent variables in Mplus. Results showed that intercultural socialization linked age and intercultural friendship characteristics with adolescents' intercultural competence. The relations partly varied depending on student's cultural self-identification. We conclude that intercultural friendships are associated with important skills that are needed in increasingly multicultural societies if students experience and discuss cultural variations in these friendships.

T1  - Promoting Resilience During Adolescence: Voices of Latino Youth and Parents
AN  - 2268978466
AB  - Difficult social circumstances contribute to numerous problems among Latino youth, which can include risky behaviors, school disengagement, health disparities, and relatively high rates of unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS. To promote health and healthy development in spite of exposure to substantial social challenge, it is important to identify factors that contribute to resilience among Latino youth. We examine focus group data from the ¡Encuentro! study (10 youth groups, four parent groups) to learn elements identified by Latino youth and parents that support adolescents in reaching their goals. Honoring principles of community-based participatory research, a community–university analysis team coded data for emerging themes and identified protective factors within Masten’s resilience framework. All individual, social, and sociocultural protective factors in Masten’s framework were evident, including positive cultural standards, rituals, relationships, and supports. Challenges to resilience specific to Latino youth included prejudice and discrimination related to race/ethnicity and immigration.

T1  - Media experiences in community-driven rural areas: exploring children's media cultures in rural Gujarat, India
AN  - 2246310258
AB  - In this paper, we examine how social structures of gender, caste, and religion, within which children in India operate, inform their engagements with media technologies/narratives. We demonstrate our approach using the case of three villages in the Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, India. We examine children's media cultures using ethnographic methods which occasion long-term immersion and paying attention to children's narratives. We also argue that children experience and enact their agency while engaging with media from within the limitations or norms imposed by the social structures. This is evident in the simple negotiation strategies they have developed to challenge social structures and norms prevalent in their societies. Based on empirical evidence we conclude that the children's exposure to and consumption of media narratives under adult management allow the families and communities to reinforce the dominant rationality of patriarchy, caste hierarchy, and religious prejudice.

T1  - Migrants' lives matter: biographical research, recognition and social participation
AN  - 2322480792
AB  - Since the beginning of qualitative sociology migrations have been central to the development of biographical research. Migrant communities have interested the founders of the Chicago School, also concerned by questions of isolation and prejudice among ethnic and cultural minorities. Later socio anthropological research has equally given privilege to the study of biographies of migrants, providing a paradigm shift from national understandings of migrations to transnational ones. But the analysis of the mutual effects happening between researchers and participants in such a relational kind of work asks for more attention. Drawing from empirical work conducted with migrants and refugees in Portugal, this paper proposes to deepen such analysis. Focus is brought to the subjective dimensions of the encounter happening between the different subject positions at play. It implies the incorporation of the awareness of structural inequity in the development of methodological tools capable of listening to the truth of each participant. Guided by the search for a theoretical-practical coherence, this essay proposes an analysis of the specific degrees of recognition provided by biographical research among migrants and refugees, in dialogue with the philosophical contributions of Axel Honneth and Richard Kearney. The empirical scope of this interdisciplinary proposition resonates with our public and civic research position defending that 'Migrants' Lives Matter'.

T1  - Plural Belongings: Mothering Co-resident Children Post-migration in the USA
AN  - 2266690833
AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new ‘here’. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers’ experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women’s mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers’ experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant’s needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms.

T1  - Structural racism as the fundamental cause of the academic achievement gap
AN  - 2235410844
AB  - Over six decades since the Supreme Court ruled that all American children have the right to a high quality education, the academic achievement gap remains an important social problem in the United States. Researchers interested in understanding the achievement gap generally seek to find the mechanisms that can explain why Black students continue to achieve at lower levels than their White counterparts. This research has shown that differences in socioeconomic status, family cultural resources, school quality and racial composition, and bias and prejudice in schools all act as mechanisms that link race to academic achievement. In this paper, we review studies from the past 10 years on the academic achievement gap. We argue that while all of the factors identified in the literature can add insight to how race structures educational achievement, the fundamental cause of the achievement gap is structural racism, a system of social organization that privileges White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color. We argue that acknowledging structural racism as the fundamental cause of the achievement gap can provide a unifying framework for interpreting findings from studies of specific mechanisms link race to academic outcomes.

T1  - When friendship is stronger than prejudice. Role of intergroup friendships among adolescents in two distinct socio-cultural contexts of immigration
AN  - 2230253866
AB  - Despite the structural characteristics of international migration in most European countries, the persistence of prejudice and negative attitudes towards immigrants represents an unsolved problem that erodes social cohesion. European institutions continue to be concerned about the spread of xenophobia, especially among young generations. This article aims to shed light on the crucial role of intergroup friendships, considered a key factor in reducing the hostility toward immigrant groups. In particular, the aim is to verify the effects of intergroup friendships on prejudice, using data derived from an international survey carried out in France and Italy, two emblematic European countries as regarding the experience of international migration. 1,642 French and Italian adolescents, selected by a rationale choice sample, were involved: multivariate analysis confirmed the hypothesis that adolescents who hold intergroup friendships show lower levels of prejudice. The influence of the intergroup friendships on the decrease of intolerance is evident especially on socioeconomic and security issues while for the identity matters its effects are moderated by the country of residence of the participants. Considering these results, positive contacts among local and immigrant populations are recommended in order to reduce social fragmentation and foster social cohesion.

T1  - Attitudes toward Same-Sex Marriage and Parenting, Ideologies, and Social Contacts: the Mediation Role of Sexual Prejudice Moderated by Gender
AN  - 2033531692
AB  - Recognition of same-sex marriage and parenting has increased in the last two decades but remains a controversial issue in which public opinion plays a role, as it can influence political leaders but also determine the immediate environment of same-sex families. The literature highlights the effect of religiosity, political orientation, beliefs about etiology of homosexuality, and social contacts with gay men and lesbians on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and parenting (ASSMP). The aim of this study was to explore the under-studied mediation role of sexual prejudice in this process and how participants’ gender moderated the mediation effects. Data were collected from 1416 heterosexual French students and analyzed with moderated mediation models in accordance with recent recommendations from Hayes (2013). Sexual prejudice mediated the effects of religiosity, political orientation, and etiological beliefs on ASSMP more strongly in men than in women. It also mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons and same-sex couples on ASSMP in men but not in women. The results highlight the need to explicitly deconstruct negative beliefs about homosexuality during debates about same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting, even when prejudice against homosexuality itself is not explicit in opponents’ discourse.

T1  - The Association of Acculturation and Complementary Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices Among New Chinese Immigrant Mothers in England: A Mixed Methods Study
AN  - 2329576155
AB  - First-generation Asians experience acculturation changes in health status and dietary patterns, moving closer to those of the dominant group and the increased fat and caloric intake patterns of the United States.

The feeding practices of mothers can be categorised into five domains. (a) The laissez-faire mother does not limit dietary quality or quantity of the child and interacts little. (b) The pressuring/controlling mother is concerned with increasing the amount of food the child consumes and soothes child using food. (c) The restrictive/controlling mother limits unhealthy foods and the quantity of food the child consumes. (d) The responsive mother is attentive to the hunger and satiety cues of the child and monitors the dietary quality the child receives. (e) The indulgent mother does not limit the quantity or quality of food the child consumes [14].

Surveys The basic demographic data of participants was collected at the start of the survey and included questions on age, place of birth, education level, employment status, marital status, length of stay in the UK and number of children.

MIRIPS contain questions about basic information (i.e., age, sex, education, religion, socioeconomic status, ethnic origin, individual marriage preference, neighbourhood, ethnic composition and place of birth/length of residence) and 16 scales: languages known/used, social contacts, travel, cultural identity, security, acculturation attitudes and expectations, perceived discrimination, multicultural ideology, tolerance/prejudice, attitudes towards immigration, attitudes towards ethnocultural groups, psychological problems, sociocultural competence, self-esteem, life satisfaction and social desirability scale.

T1  - The Influence of Minority Stress, Gender, and Legalization of Civil Unions on Parenting Desire and Intention in Lesbian Women and Gay Men: Implications for Social Policy and Clinical Practice
AN  - 2204269630
AB  - Although the rate of lesbian and gay (LG) parents is increasing, lesbian and gay adults are less likely than heterosexual adults to be parents, as desire and intention to become a parent tend to be lower. This study aims at assessing 290 childless LG individuals (120 lesbian women and 170 gay men) to explore the influence of minority stress, gender differences, and legalization of civil unions in Italy on parenting desire and intention. The results indicated that the minority stressors associated with parenting dimensions included prejudice events, outness, and internalized homophobia for lesbian women, but only felt stigma among gay men. Support from family or significant others buffered the effects of minority stressors on parenting dimensions. Thus, the minority stress processes partly explain the intention and desire to become parents in LG childless individuals. Furthermore, lesbian women showed higher levels of parenting desire and intention than gay men and the levels of these parenting dimensions increased after the law on civil unions was enacted. The findings have important implications for both social policies and clinical practice.

T1  - Lesbians' experiences and attitudes towards parenthood in Greece
AN  - 2180534263
AB  - Same-sex parenthood is controversial subject. In this paper, we provide insights into the attitudes and experiences of self-reported lesbians regarding parenthood or the prospect of becoming a parent in the current Greek social and cultural context. In Greece, lesbians are not allowed access to in vitro fertilisation (IVF), while a solitary ('single') woman is allowed access for medical reasons. Fifty-nine (59) semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with women. What emerged from our data was a clear trend for participants to wish to have their own biological children based mostly on the belief that pregnancy would lead to a sense of self-completeness and/or fulfilment. Women also reported the negative impact of prejudice and social oppression on their reproductive autonomy. Interviewees reported that their reproductive choices were negatively influenced by their family and the wider socio-cultural environment. Even within a semi-permissive legal framework, impaired social acceptance of lesbian parenthood prohibits lesbians from becoming mothers. A major reason responsible for the positive attitude of most participants to shared biological motherhood was an altruistic attitude towards their partners.

T1  - Justification-Suppression and Normative Window of Prejudice as Determinants of Bias Toward Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexual Adoption Applicants
AN  - 2172269362
AB  - Despite gains in equality for lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGB), these couples still face discrimination in adoption scenarios. Guided by the normative window of prejudice and the justification-suppression model, participants read about a suitable or unsuitable couple applying to adopt a child. Participants indicated whether the couple should be allowed to adopt the child and how committed the couple is to being parents. Heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to LGB parents; sexual orientation was not related to adoption decisions. There was a significant interaction between sexual orientation and suitability for perceptions of commitment to parenting: in the suitable condition, heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to gays; in the unsuitable condition, heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to bisexuals. This interaction was nonsignificant for adoption decisions. Future research should determine if these findings relate to other sexual orientations or gender identities.

T1  - Nation, national remembrance, and education — Polish schools as factories of nationalism and prejudice
AN  - 2698636919
AB  - This article describes and attempts to explain the reasons for the conservative and nationalist character of Polish schools. The author uses data from surveys, analyzes political programs, postulates concerning education put forward by conservatives, and quotes poems emphasizing national identity from textbooks used at schools to teach reading skills. According to the author, it can be observed that nationalists build an atmosphere of aversion to immigrants, which affects racism in the school hallways. The article also presents the phenomenon of so-called school chambers of national remembrance, which are part of patriotic rituals practiced by Polish society. The author emphasizes that nationalism is the basis for changes in history programs of study, which are part of the educational reform implemented by the Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość — PiS) government. The cultural soft power, which is used to make reality more “national,” complements the administrative and political hard power of the PiS party — both tools are used to create an authoritarian-nationalist vision of social order.

T1  - “Pray That God Will Change You”: The Religious Social Ecology of Bias-Based Bullying Targeting Sexual and Gender Minority Youth—A Qualitative Study of Service Providers and Educators
AN  - 2082916836
AB  - The bullying of sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) is pervasive, with documented negative impacts on health. We explored the social ecology of bullying of SGMY, with a focus on religion as a source or context of bullying. Semistructured interviews with service providers, educators, and administrators in Toronto, Canada, who work with SGMY explored perspectives on the bullying of SGMY, focusing on religiously based bullying and strategies for intervention. Interviews (45-60 minutes) were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. The data revealed religiously based homophobic discourse that permeates religious (places of worship, faith-based schools) and secular microsystems (public schools, families) across SGMY’s social ecology. The language and ideology of “sin” and “conversion” were evidenced in direct religiously based bullying of SGMY in schools, and victimization in places of worship and family microsystems, as well as serving as a rationale for bullying and nonintervention by teachers, school staff, administrators, and family members. Multisectoral and multilevel influences of religiously based sexual prejudice on the bullying of SGMY suggest that existing individual-level and microsystem-level responses in schools should be augmented with institutional, policy, and legal interventions in SGMY’s more distal social ecology in order to effectively prevent religiously based homophobic bullying.

T1  - Linguistic Cultural Capital among Descendants of Mixed Couples in Catalonia, Spain: Realities and Inequalities
AN  - 2081349727
AB  - Spain, along with the region of Catalonia in particular, has seen a significant increase in mixed unions between immigrants and natives, which, in turn, has given rise to a growing number of young people with mixed origins. Yet little is known about how these mixed families and individuals negotiate cultural differences and view their 'mixed cultural capital.' Drawing on 29 in-depth interviews with youth of diverse mixed cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds residing in Catalonia and 58 in-depth interviews with immigrants in mixed unions, this paper focuses on the role of language as a form of cultural capital. Do mixed families use a number of languages in their everyday lives? Which languages are transmitted, preferred, and used, and why? We find that mixed families are generally multilingual, as the knowledge of different languages is thought to contribute to communication with relatives, social integration, and social mobility. However, children and youth of mixed descent who belong to minoritized ethnic or racial groups may resist learning or actively using the language of their immigrant parent to avoid stigmatization and socially imposed categories of 'foreignness.' Therefore, stigmatization and prejudice may be limiting linguistic cultural capital - a key benefit of mixedness - in Catalonia.

T1  - Notifying Neglect: Child Protection as an Application of Bureaucratic Power against Marginalized Parents
AN  - 2058267390
AB  - The goal of this contribution is to bring to light some systemic applications of organizational power that occur within the child protection system in Iceland. The specific focus is on the ways in which notifications are made to the child protection system concerning allegations of parental neglect on the part of parents with disabilities and a criticism of some specific mechanisms by which these notifications may contribute to unjust custody deprivation proceedings. We suggest that accusations of bias or prejudice within the child protection system need to be grounded upon the demonstration of concrete mechanisms which illustrate this bias in practice. In this contribution, we chose to focus on the power of notifications and to explore the institutional logic and practices that can result in unjust custody deprivation decisions. A critical analysis of the knowledge production of custody deprivation is required to fully understand these process as systematic applications of power and to recognize the problematic nature of child protection work that weighs heavily against marginalized parents.

T1  - Why there is less supportive evidence for contact theory than they say there is: A quantitative cultural–sociological critique
AN  - 2043991145
AB  - The finding that ethnic prejudice is particularly weakly developed among those with interethnic friendships is often construed as confirming the so-called ‘contact theory,’ which holds that interethnic contact reduces racial prejudice. This theory raises cultural–sociological suspicions, however, because of its tendency to reduce culture to an allegedly ‘more fundamental’ realm of social interaction. Analyzing data from the first wave of the European Social Survey, we therefore test the theory alongside an alternative cultural–sociological theory about culturally driven processes of contact selection. We find that whereas interethnic friendships are indeed culturally driven, which confirms our cultural–sociological theory, contacts with neighbors and colleagues do indeed affect ethnic prejudice. They do so in a manner that is more complex and more culturally sensitive than contact theory suggests, however: while positive cultural stances vis-à-vis ethnic diversity lead interethnic contact to decrease ethnic prejudice, negative ones rather lead the former to increase the latter.

T1  - Sexism and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting in a Sample of Heterosexuals and Sexual Minorities: the Mediation Effect of Sexual Stigma
AN  - 2023984942
AB  - The present study aimed to: (a) investigate the relationship between attitudes toward same-sex parenting and sexism both in heterosexuals and sexual minorities; (b) verify whether sexism predicted negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting via the mediating role of sexual stigma (sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and internalized sexual stigma [ISS] in lesbians and gay men [LG]). An Italian sample of 477 participants (65.6% heterosexual people and 34.4% LG people) was used to verify three hypotheses: (a) heterosexual men showed higher levels of sexism than heterosexual women and LG people; (b) heterosexual men reported more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting than those of heterosexual women and LG people; and (c) sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people mediated the relationship between sexism and attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Overall, men and heterosexual people showed stronger sexist tendencies and more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Moreover, sexism affected attitudes toward same-sex parenting via sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people. These results suggest that negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting reflect sociocultural inequalities based on the traditional gender belief system and points to the necessity of social policies to reduce prejudice toward sexual minority groups.

T1  - Modeling racial disparities in physical health via close relationship functioning: A life course approach
AN  - 2078152946
AB  - Objective The aim of the present study was to test a life course model in which racial disparities in physical health between Caucasian and African Americans are driven by disparities in close relationship functioning. This model also examined relative evidence for intergenerational transmission of relationship functioning and ongoing exposure to prejudice and discrimination as two pathways that might shape adult relationship functioning. Method A sample of 523 Caucasian and African American men and women were prospectively tracked from a birth cohort initiated in the 1960s. Reports of parental relationship functioning were obtained from participants and their mothers in adolescence. In midlife, participants completed measures of perceived discrimination (lifetime and everyday discrimination), close relationship functioning (relationship strain and support) and physical health (self-rated health, resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure). ResultsAs hypothesized, close relationship functioning was a strong predictor of physical health in adulthood. Furthermore, we observed that perceived discrimination over the life course was linked to impaired relationship functioning. Evidence for intergenerational transmission of relationship functioning was more equivocal.ConclusionRacial disparities in physical health may be maintained via social factors throughout the life course. Although such factors have sometimes been considered outside the purview of the medical field, it is vital that researchers and clinicians begin to more fully address the implications of social forces in order to remediate racial health disparities.

T1  - "SO MANY CLEVER, INDUSTRIOUS AND FRUGAL ALIENS": Peter Sandiford, Intelligence Testing, and Anti-Asian Sentiment in Vancouver Schools between 1920 and 1939
AN  - 2042185936
AB  - According to Jamieson and Sandiford, "Pure blood Indian children" gave "inferior performances" on intelligence and achievement tests; however, "I.Q. seem[ed] to rise with the admixture of white blood.According to her, Canada was "allowing to enter our fair land this degenerate stock of foreign countries," many of whom simply became special class students and "clogg[ed] our educational system."[...]the testing program was presented as a way to compare the achievement of rural pupils to urban, to reform school finance, to guide curricular choices, and generally to increase the efficiency of the public schools in the same manner as American school surveys purported to do for public school systems in the United States.51 Putman and Weir believed that those who criticized intelligence testing on moral grounds did not appreciate the usefulness of such "objective" scientific data collection; they believed that normal intelligence was related positively to an individual's social worth.52 Yet Major M.J. Crehan of the Vancouver School Board made a submission to the Putman-Weir Commission during its 1924 fact-finding hearings in which he expressed his belief that all Asians should be segregated within the public schools. "A few Japanese and Chinese students" were included in the general study of intelligence, but the use of the English language during testing was judged not to be "fair to them."[...]a "special study of the mental capacity of Japanese and Chinese pupils" was included as a separate section of Sandiford's test report.61 The other type of tests administered by Sandiford and his assistant, Ruby Kerr, were achievement tests.

T1  - Are allies who we think they are?: A comparative analysis
AN  - 2025458638
AB  - Although dominant group allies have been increasingly studied by social psychologists interested in positive intergroup relations and the promotion of social justice, most of the existing research focuses on self‐identified allies or dominant group individuals who are engaging in social justice activities. Little comparative work has examined white allies who were specifically identified as such by people of color. Two studies assessed qualities associated with affirming attitudes (low prejudice, high internal motivation to respond without prejudice, allophilia, and awareness of privilege) and informed action (activism) expected to be distinctively characteristic of allies. Nominated white allies in Study 1 had lower prejudice and higher levels of internal motivation to respond without prejudice than nonnominated white participants; this was replicated in Study 2, which compared nominated “allies” and “friends.” In Study 2, nominated white allies rated themselves as lower on prejudice than nominated white friends. They also scored higher on internal motivation to respond without prejudice, understanding of white privilege, and activism than nominated white friends. There were no differences on self‐reported allophilia between the two groups. Allies were rated by the people of color who nominated them as higher on qualities of outgroup affirmation and informed action than were nominated friends. Limitations of and implications for these findings are discussed.

T1  - From segregation to intergroup contact and back: Using experiments and simulation to understand the bidirectional link
AN  - 1993908771
AB  - Research on intergroup contact has mostly viewed desegregation as a necessary condition for contact to unfold its power to reduce prejudice. Through residential and school choices, however, prejudice also contributes to segregation. To shed light on this bidirectional link, we conducted two survey-based experiments with stratified quota samples of German adults. In Study 1, respondents with less contact and more prejudice indicated a lower likelihood of renting an apartment in a neighborhood with a larger proportion of minority members, although housing quality and crime rate were held constant. In Study 2, similar results were obtained for the likelihood of enrolling their child at a school with a larger proportion of minority students. Building on these results in a computer simulation, we find that because contact only reduces prejudice, but does not produce pro-minority preferences, spontaneous desegregation is unlikely to occur even under the most favorable structural and economic conditions.

T1  - From Personal Experiences to Classroom Teaching: A Socio-Psychological Study of Social Inclusion and Exclusion
AN  - 2088824939
AB  - Creating an inclusive classroom environment where learners appreciate diversity and value positive interpersonal associations is a challenge faced by the teachers worldwide. This is particularly so in the Indian context, where the complex phenomena of social categorization impacts the individual in manifold ways from a tender age. In the context of student-teacher relationship, the personal experiences of the teacher have a trickle-down effect on student socialization patterns. This paper explores the teachers' personal experiences of social inclusion and exclusion and its impact on his/her classroom interactions with students. Our sample consisted of 23 teachers (18 females and 5 males) working in low-income schools in Delhi. Extensive narratives were undertaken and subject to thematic analysis. Teachers expansively described their experiences of facing social exclusion. Although the staff maintained an outward semblance of inclusivity, the undercurrents of exclusion and marginalization were noted. The need for social approval and maintenance of a politically correct façade was the guiding force for many teachers. Yet many of them expressed their own prejudices and biased thoughts about social groups. The findings are discussed in the light of current theorization in the area.

T1  - Parental Perspectives on Parent–Child Conflict and Acculturation in Iranian Immigrants in California
AN  - 2017556674
AB  - Iranians have settled in a number of areas in the United States, especially Southern California and Texas, and experience substantial prejudice as a result of perceptions of their religion and national origin. This study explored the relationship between Iranian immigrant parents’ acculturation and the level of conflict they experience with their U.S.-born children. A survey was used to collect data from a sample of 100 first-generation Iranian immigrant parents living in Orange County, CA, with children aged 11–22 years. Parent-acculturation levels were expected to predict parent–child conflicts (PCCs) resulting from potential acculturation gaps between children and parents. Results demonstrated a moderate positive relationship between Iranian cultural involvement and PCC and a weak negative relationship between American cultural involvement and PCC. The effects of various demographic variables were also considered. Results show higher PCC levels among lower income families, suggesting a need for support from schools, counselors, or other institutions.

T1  - No te dejes pisotear por nadien: Examining Latino Immigrants' Efforts to Resist Discrimination
AN  - 2007392821
AB  - Latino immigrants in the United States face a hostile climate, including policies that reinforce community-level prejudices and acts of discrimination. Discrimination has an impact on the well-being of individuals who are targeted. The purpose of this study was to learn from Latino immigrant parents about responses to incidents with discrimination, including the process by which they determine how to respond. Fifty-four Latino immigrants participated in in-depth interviews. Using constructivist grounded theory methods, a model was developed to reflect participants' responses to discrimination. Findings indicate Latino immigrants' responses to discrimination evolve in a consciousness-raising process, including five phases of awareness: recognizes discrimination; questions discrimination; engages in reflection/dialogue on issues of race and discrimination; acknowledges value in self; and takes action. Moving through these phases, participants are more critically reflective on personal experiences and larger environmental contexts. Participants also engage in assessment of risks and opportunities when deciding how to respond to discrimination. Documentation status, English proficiency, and knowledge of systems of care affected their ability/decision to advocate. This study offers guidance for social service providers to support and collaborate with immigrants to increase their capacity to advocate. Findings suggest that future research is needed to explore the connection between phases of response and well-being.

T1  - Islamophobia: What Teachers Can Do To Reduce It in the Classroom
AN  - 2007680714
AB  - The year 2017 marked the sixteenth year anniversary of the destruction of the World Trade Center, the worst domestic attack in US history. The global environment has been very different since Sep 11, 2001. Prior to that date, terms such as terrorism, terroristic actions, and Islamophobia were not commonly heard. The world environment has changed greatly since then. Now people all over the world are continually on edge. When considering a dictionary definition of Islamophobia, the Oxford Dictionary states it as a "dislike of, or prejudice against, Islam or Muslims, especially as a political force." Islamophobia is not only focused on Islam or Muslims, but also on anyone "who may appear to be Muslim". Here, Hossain addressing the issue of Islamophobia from pre-school to college classrooms.

T1  - Resilience in the face of peer victimisation and discrimination: The who, when and why in five patterns of adjustment
AN  - 2046625062
AB  - Victimisation has a negative effect on psychosocial functioning. Based on the resilience theory, and with a sample of 2975 Portuguese students, the present study aims to: i) identify patterns of adjustment in the face of peer victimisation and perceptions of discrimination; ii) explore the association between the patterns of adjustment and the characteristics of participants (the who) and of the victimisation (the when and why). Cluster analysis revealed five patterns of adjustment: Unchallenged; Externally Maladjusted; Internally Maladjusted; Resilient, and At-Risk. The results suggest that there is no complete resilience in the face of social victimisation. Group differences were found regarding: i) gender, type of course, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, parental educational level and religious beliefs; ii) the age at which peer victimisation was more frequent, and; iii) the motives underlying discrimination. Globally considered, peer victimisation is representative of the wider cultural environment and interventions should also target social prejudices.

T1  - Gender differences among Czech youth in prejudice towards minorities
AN  - 1886293218
AB  - Using a large survey of Czech high school students (n = 1103), aged 15-20 years, this paper explores youth prejudice to a wide range of minority groups (n = 21) where family, school, and community contexts are taken into account. General Structural Equation Models are used to explore the determinants of prejudice for 21 minorities using a comparative explanatory framework where the focus is gender differences in prejudice to minorities are examined using three social theories: Social Dominance Theory (SDT), the Theory of Gendered Prejudice (TGP), and Gender Role Beliefs (GRB). This research shows that gender plays a strong role in expressing prejudiced attitudes where females express (a) less prejudiced attitudes toward the Roma, black Africans, Gays and those with mental or physical disabilities, and (b) more prejudiced attitudes towards the homeless, Vietnamese, Muslims, and lesbians. This gendered pattern is explained in terms of insights from SDT, TGP, and GRB.

T1  - Evidence of Validity of the Beliefs About Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale
AN  - 1883505343
AB  - The aim of the study is to provide evidence about the validity and reliability of the Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale. The scale identifies two types of rejection of same-sex parenting: individual opposition and normative opposition. Individual opposition identifies opinions involving open and more aggressive rejection toward the effects of the child-rearing and educational practices of same-sex parents. The attribution of the children's possible psychological difficulties and maladjustments is directly linked to the sexual orientation of the same-sex parents. Normative opposition identifies beliefs and opinions linked to everyday heterosexism that are present in our society and represent a subtle form of heterosexism. The scale was administrated to 326 Spanish heterosexual university students. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor structure. The findings showed that personal contact inversely correlates with the rejection of same-sex parents, the etiology of the homosexual orientation correlates with rejection of same-sex parents when the belief is that homosexuality is learned, and supporting the civil rights of gay people also correlates with rejection of same-sex parents. These findings can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual and family diversity.

T1  - Welland Ontario's Springfield Plan: Post-War Canadian Citizenship Training, American Style?
AN  - 2032478903
AB  - After World War II, minority activists and their Anglo-Canadian allies convinced the Ontario Ministry of Education to bring the Springfield Plan to Welland, Ontario, as a pilot project to combat racist and religious prejudice through the public school system. Pioneered in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Plan taught children the importance of tolerance by stressing that minority groups had made important contributions to the local community, the nation, and the world beyond. In Welland, however, the Plan only lasted for a few years because many influential Canadians failed to recognize the pervasiveness of discrimination, while non-British immigrants tended to see new industrial unions as better vehicles for claiming their rights. In addition, the Plan was unsuited to the understanding of Canada as a “bi-racial” country founded by the English and French.Alternate abstract:Après la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, des militants issus des minorités et leurs alliés anglo-canadiens convainquirent le ministère de l’Éducation de l’Ontario d’introduire le Plan de Springfield à Welland (Ontario), à titre de projet pilote destiné à combattre le racisme et les préjugés religieux par l’intermédiaire du réseau d’écoles publiques. Lancé à Springfield (Massachusetts), celui-ci enseignait aux enfants l’importance de la tolérance en soulignant que les groupes minoritaires avaient apporté d’importantes contributions à la collectivité locale, au pays et au monde extérieur. À Welland, toutefois, le Plan ne dura que quelques années parce que bon nombre de Canadiens influents refusèrent de reconnaître l’omniprésence de la discrimination et que, de leur côté, les immigrants non britanniques eurent tendance à voir les nouveaux syndicats industriels comme de meilleurs outils pour faire valoir leurs droits. De plus, le Plan n’était pas conçu pour faire comprendre le Canada comme étant un pays « biracial », fondé par les Anglais et les Français.

T1  - Addressing dualisms in student perceptions of a historically white and black university in South Africa
AN  - 1870347276
AB  - Normative discourses about higher education institutions may perpetuate stereotypes about institutions. Few studies explore student perceptions of universities and how transformative pedagogical interventions in university classrooms may address institutional stereotypes. Using Plumwood's notion of dualism, this qualitative study analyses unchallenged stereotypes about students' own and another university during an inter-institutional collaborative research and teaching and learning project. The project was conducted over 3 years and 282 psychology, social work and occupational therapy students from a historically black and white institution in South Africa, participated in the study. Both black and white students from differently placed higher education institutions display prejudices and stereotypes of their own and other institutions, pointing to the internalisation and pervasiveness of constructions and hegemonic discourses such as whiteness and classism. It is important to engage with subjugated student knowledges, in the context of transformative pedagogical practices, to disrupt dominant views and cultivate processes of inclusion in higher education.

T1  - Multicultural integration in British and Dutch societies: education and citizenship
AN  - 1895242141
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to review and synthesize published studies and practice in the “integration” of ethnic and religious minorities in Britain and The Netherlands, 1965-2015, drawing out implications for current policy and practice.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is an evaluative review and report of results of work on citizenship education for young Muslims and their peers in English schools.FindingsYoung Muslims have positive attitudes to “good citizenship”, as Islamic socialization makes them particularly responsive to citizenship messages. But there is hard-core racial prejudice and Islamophobia in about 25 per cent of adults. In The Netherlands, this xenophobia has supported far-right politicians who are strongly anti-Muslim. This paper cites evidence that continued prejudice may lead to alienation and radicalization of some minorities.Research limitations/implicationsUnchecked prejudice concerning minorities can have negative implications for both majority and minority groups – this broad hypothesis deserves further research in both Dutch and British societies.Practical implicationsIn Britain, success in Muslim schools in fostering positive citizenship implies that Muslim groups can maintain “quiet dignity” in following Islamic pathways to good citizenship.Social implicationsState support for religious-foundation schools should be offered to all religious groups and should not be withheld from Muslim minorities for “security” reasons.Originality/valueThis overview by two Muslim educators offers new insights and proposals in the acceptance of Muslim minorities in Europe.

T1  - The Social Determinants of Polymorphous Prejudice Against Lesbian and Gay Individuals: the Case of Portugal
AN  - 1858002074
AB  - In the present article, we analyze polymorphous prejudice against lesbians and gays according to a sample of Portuguese heterosexual individuals. We tested the differential importance of demographic-, ideological-, and psychological-level variables to predicting this phenomenon. Our results show that male, Catholic, right-wing respondents with fewer lesbian and gay (LG) friends prove the group exhibiting the highest levels of polymorphous prejudice. Furthermore, the introduction of psychological-level variables into the regression models increased the explained variance in polymorphous prejudice, above and beyond the remaining predictors. Additionally, we report different patterns of results when deploying regression analyses at the level of the sub-scales of polymorphous prejudice. We discuss our results within the light of contemporary sexual prejudice frameworks before reviewing the utility of results to interventions targeting discriminated LG individuals.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF MINORITY STRESS ON SUBSTANCE USE DISPARITIES AMONG SEXUAL MINORITY US HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
AN  - 1937686197
AB  - Compared to sexual nonminority youth, sexual minority youth report greater substance use and experience increased stress due to prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and victimization related to their sexual minority status. School-related minority stressors may include being bullied, harassed, and attacked at school. Non-school-related sources of stress disproportionately experienced by sexual minority youth may include early sexual debut, forced sexual intercourse, and other adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Research suggests that increased stress may help to explain the disproportionate use of substances like alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs by sexual minority youth. This study examined the effect of school-related and non-school-related minority stress on substance use disparities among sexual minority U.S. high school students. Data from the national 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative sample of 15,624 U.S. high school students, were analyzed to determine the effect of school-related (violent threats and physical attacks, bullying, and feeling unsafe at school) and non-school-related (early sexual debut and forced sexual intercourse) minority stress on substance use disparities among sexual minority students (defined by sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts), by comparing unadjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and adjusted (for minority stressors. age, sex, and race/ethnicity) prevalence ratios (APR). All school-related and non-school-related stressors were significantly more prevalent among sexual minority than sexual nonminority students. In unadjusted analyses, every category of substance use was significantly greater (95% confidence interval for PR did not include 1.0)* among students who identified as lesbian. gay, or bisexual than students who identified as heterosexual; and significantly greater among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. After controlling for minority stressors, disparities by sexual identity decreased substantially and were no longer statistically significant for cocaine use (PR=2.52* vs. APR= 1.25), methamphetamine use (PR=3.96* vs. APR 1.54), heroin use (PR=4.60* vs. APR= 0.90), and injection drug use (PR=4.93* vs. APR= l.38); disparities for cigarette use, alcohol use, marijuana use, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs decreased, but remained statistically significant. Disparities by sex of sexual contacts decreased substantially and were no longer statistically significant for heroin use (PR=4.08* vs. APR= 1.57) and injection drug use (PR=4.03* vs. APR= 1.34); disparities for use of other substances (except alcohol use) decreased, but remained statistically significant. These findings suggest that at least some of the disparity in substance use found among sexual minority students may occur in response to experiences of minority stress. Thus, school-based substance use prevention may benefit from inclusion of strategies to minimize minority stress by fostering environmental supports for sexual minority students, including antibullying and anti-harassment policies. and the fostering of safe spaces for sexual minority youth in the form of gay-straight alliances (GSAs) or other support groups. School- and communitybased strategies to improve access to social and mental health services may also help to reduce minority stress and substance use by preventing or mitigating the effects of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, and other ACEs.

T1  - Problems Confronting Fathers in the Education of their Pre-school Age Children and the Implications for South African Early Education Policy
AN  - 2110238033
AB  - The Draft Early Education Policy and other related policies noted that parents, including fathers, are supposed to play an active role in their children’s pre-school education. This paper aims to investigate problems confronting fathers and hindering them from being involved in pre-school education and implications for policy. The key finding of this paper is that problems confronting fathers in pre-schools are mainly familial, that is, prejudiced belief systems, legislative gaps, the fathers financial and employment status, and the relationship quality of parents. Therefore, it is evident that the identified problems can result in the envisaged policy objectives not being realized. Consequently, there is a need to implement intervention programs that are meant to equip fathers and communities in understanding parenting roles and implications of child related policies and customary laws on active fatherhood. Policy reviews looking at violation of children’s rights versus parental care, especially by fathers, are also necessary.

T1  - Whose family fits? Categorization and evaluation of same-sex and cross-race-parent families: GPIR
AN  - 1854784978
AB  - As family structures diversify, attitudes towards "nontraditional" families (e.g., same-sex-parent and cross-race families) appear to be becoming more favorable. Despite more favorable attitudes, we propose that explicitly and implicitly people view nontraditional families as less family-like than traditional (i.e., heterosexual, same-race) families. We also propose that people will hold the behavior of nontraditional (vs. traditional) families to higher standards. In Study 1, participants explicitly rated nontraditional (vs. traditional) family photos as less family-like and as less loving. In Study 2, using a reaction-time measure, participants took longer to correctly categorize nontraditional (vs. traditional) families into the family category, suggesting that at an implicit level people have greater difficulty recognizing nontraditional families as "family." In Studies 3 and 4, ambiguous (i.e., positive and negative) behavior licensed more harsh evaluations of a nontraditional family--but did not affect evaluations of a traditional family--relative to learning only positive family behavior. Despite survey data that suggest that people's views of nontraditional families are becoming more favorable, our evidence indicates that people nonetheless harbor prejudice against certain family structures. Beyond documenting two biases against nontraditional families, this work highlights the need for prejudice researchers to examine meaningful levels of social identity, such as family units, that are intermediate between individuals and broad social classes.

T1  - Don't judge a living book by its cover: effectiveness of the living library intervention in reducing prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people
AN  - 1817003843
AB  - In Hungary, prejudices toward Roma and the LGBT community are highly salient and explicit in public opinion, the media, and in the political discourse. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction intervention--in which participants as "Readers" have engaging contact with living "Books" who are trained volunteers from the Roma and LGBT communities. In a pre-post intervention study with high school students (N=105), results suggest that the Living Library intervention reduced participants' scores on multiple measures of prejudice. The Living Library intervention appeared to be effective among both those participants whose friends endorsed prejudice or more tolerant attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people. In sum, Living Library appears to be a useful method for reducing prejudice in contexts which are characterized by strong negative attitudes toward these different groups.

T1  - "Boys Don't Cry"--or Do They? Adult Attitudes Toward and Beliefs About Transgender Youth
AN  - 1811906108
AB  - The present survey study examined the attitudes of U.S. adults toward transgender children and adolescents, as well as their behavioral intentions, in two hypothetical scenarios involving gender variant youth. Participants recruited online (N=281) reported generally favorable attitudes toward transgender minors, but expressed some hesitation to allow a transgender child to use the restroom aligned with their gender as opposed to their birth sex or to share a room with same gender peers on a school trip, possibly due to conflating gender identity with sexual orientation in these situations. Attitudes were less positive in respondents who reported a religious affiliation, conservative social political views, and stronger conformity to certain traditional gender norms--particularly in men. Even after controlling for these factors, stronger belief in environmental versus biological causes of transgender identity was linked to more negative attitudes. Participants' behavioral intentions were driven partly by their attitudes and causal attributions, but also by their age and, at least for women, personal connections to the transgender community. We discuss implications for the discourse surrounding transgender youth and the need for educating the public on the development of gender identity as well as the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation.

T1  - The New Ruling Class
AN  - 1803180639
AB  - Last fall, Toby Young did something ironic. Toby is the son of Michael Young, the British sociologist and Labour life peer whose 1958 satire The Rise of the Meritocracy has been credited with coining the term. Toby has become an education reformer in his own right, as founder of the West London Free School, after a celebrated career as a journalist and memoirist (How to Lose Friends and Alienate People). In September, he published an 8,000-word reconsideration of his father's signature concept in an Australian monthly. The old man was right that meritocracy would gradually create a stratified and immobile society, he wrote, but wrong that abolishing selective education was the cure. His outlandish resort to eugenics suggests that Toby Young found himself at a loss for solutions, as all modern critics of meritocracy seem to do. The problems they describe are fundamental, but none of their remedies are more than tweaks to make the system more efficient or less prejudicial to the poor.

T1  - The impact of Islam and the public and political portrayals of Islam on child-rearing practices - Discursive analyses of parental accounts among Muslims living in Denmark
AN  - 1773275719
AB  - With the rise of Islamist terrorist attacks in the US and Europe the impact of Islam on child-rearing practices has become a matter of public attention and debate. Within the political discourse in the Western world and in the mass media, Muslims are often being portrayed negatively. Research has documented how Muslims living in the West are adversely affected by the negative portrayals of Islam associated with the War on Terror. The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of Islam on child-rearing practices and parental identity formation among self-identified Muslims in Denmark. Using a discursive approach to analyzing interviews with parents in 29 Middle Eastern refugee families, six rhetorical strategies were identified: (1) minimizing differences, (2) highlighting compatibility, (3) emphasizing positive aspects of Islam, (4) countering common prejudice, (5) actively distancing oneself from terrorists/extremists, and (6) separating Islam as a religion from cultural traditions. It is argued that the global as well as national political discourse post 9/11 is reflected in all of the six rhetorical strategies. Whether parents position themselves as having a high or low bicultural identity or a Muslim parental identity, their positioning involves drawing on the discursive resources from the mass media, the global and national political and public discourse. Furthermore, it is argued that all rhetorical strategies can be seen as attempts to counter the hurt associated with the negative portrayal of Islam.

T1  - Do we know what we are asking? Individual and group cognitive interviews<sup>1</sup>: Postdisciplinary Humanities & Social Sciences Quarterly
AN  - 2583763215
AB  - The paper deals with cognitive interview, a method for pre-testing survey questions that is used in pilot testing to develop new measures and/or adapt ones in foreign languages. The aim is to explore the usefulness of the method by looking at two questionnaires measuring anti-Roma prejudice. The first, the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), contains questions that are dominantly used to test two dimensions of social perceptions of various groups: warmth and competence. The second, Interventions for Reducing Prejudice against Stigmatized Minorities (INTERMIN) consists of the items most frequently used in contact research to measure attitudes, social distance, anxiety, trust and behavioural intentions towards outgroups. Two rounds of cognitive interviews were held on both questionnaires to verbally evaluate participants’ understanding and/or interpretation of the draft questions. The first round was attended by university students, while the second round (with improved versions of the questionnaires) was done with high school students, as they are the target group for planned interventions based on the contact paradigm. The paper explains the problems/difficulties the participants had answering some of the questions and our attempts at improving the questionnaires. The problems can be grouped around six issues: The first two deal with the strategies participants used to answer our questions – whom exactly did they have in mind when answering the questionnaires and whose viewpoint did they represent in their answers. The next four problems are around nuances in the formulations of our questions and generally have to do with how the participants interpreted our questions – they concern assumptions that distinct items were logically interconnected, the period of time and locality referred to in our questions, translation and transferability of meanings from one language to another and double negation.

T1  - Friend or Foe? Attitudes Towards Immigration from Other European Union Countries
AN  - 1972409149
AB  - Over the decades Europe has become a destination for different groups of migrants, including mobile citizens from the European Union Member States. At the same time European citizens have become more mobile with a growing number of cross-border practices connecting them to places and people abroad through migration, travel, social networks or consumption practices. The main contribution of this study is in analysing to what extent processes of Europeanization, at an individual and country level, matter for sentiments towards immigration. Data suggest that social globalization processes may produce a sense of threat, but individual transnationalism seems to provide a remedy against prejudice.

T1  - Salir adelante (perseverance): Lessons from the Mexican immigrant experience
AN  - 1808601267
AB  - Summary 
Although migration and immigrant issues have been well studied in sociology, economics, and demography there is significantly less information specific to Latino immigrants within the field of social work. This is of particular concern as the population of Latino immigrants and their children continues to grow and access areas of social work practice and policy development. This research study focuses on understanding the experience of first-generation immigrants of Mexican origin living in Denver, Colorado, through the use of qualitative research methods. Seven Mexican immigrants living in Denver described their experience through an in-depth interview process. Grounded theory was the chosen method for analysis. 
Findings 
Four themes emerged during the data analysis process: (1) 'We are working people'; (2) 'I am not an animal' (experiencing racism, prejudice and discrimination); (3) fear; and (4) internal strength. Together these themes create a conceptual framework that is useful as a starting place to understand the lives and culture of Mexican immigrants. This conceptual framework highlights how immigrants negotiate racism, prejudice, discrimination, and fear through their strong work ethic and the belief in their ability to ' 
 
   salir adelante 
  ' (to persevere or better oneself or one's family situation). 
Applications 
Results indicate that Mexican immigrants are faced with numerous challenges, particularly due to racist laws, discriminatory procedures, and acts of prejudice. However, results also suggest that Mexican immigrants and their cultural resources provide a source of hope, allowing them to persevere even as they face challenges. The findings have several implications for direct service, advocacy and social justice, and social work education.

T1  - Broadening the mind: Beneficial effects of sojourn experiences and contact with visiting international students on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior
AN  - 1761734788
AB  - Opportunities for intergroup contact are particularly important for prospective teachers because they bear responsibility for an ethnically diverse student population. Using data from a sample of 330 students inscribed in Austrian university colleges of teacher education, we investigated the long-term effects of international student exchange on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior (MAPB). Both sojourning and domestic students' friendships with visiting international students (VIS) were evaluated as potential instances of naturally occurring intergroup contact that can affect students' MAPB. Sojourning students had an increased MAPB even nine months after returning to their home country. No effect was found for domestic students' friendships with VIS. Possibly, the quality of these friendships was insufficient to result in long-term prejudice reduction. Implications of these results are discussed, and the need to advance interventions that are appropriate to improve domestic students' contact with VIS is ascertained.

T1  - School-level contextual predictors of bullying and harassment experiences among adolescents
AN  - 1751218078
AB  - Bullying and prejudice-based harassment frequently occur in school settings and have significant consequences for the health and wellbeing of young people. Yet far fewer studies have examined the role of the school environment in peer harassment than individual factors. This multilevel study examined associations between a variety of school-level risk and protective factors and student-level reports of bullying and prejudice-based harassment during adolescence. Data come from 8th, 9th, and 11th graders who completed the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey (N = 122,180 students nested in 505 schools). School-level variables were created by aggregating student report data in five areas: academic orientation to school, internal assets, teacher-student relationship quality, feelings of safety at school, and receipt of disciplinary action. Results indicated that youth attending schools with a higher proportion of students with strong internal assets had lower odds of nearly every type of bullying and prejudice-based harassment assessed when compared to youth attending schools with a lower proportion of students with strong internal assets. Additionally, the proportion of students feeling unsafe at school was a fairly consistent risk factor for most types of peer harassment. Findings support the idea that prevention programs aimed at improving school-wide internal assets and feelings of safety at school may be key prevention points.

T1  - Understanding the Selection Bias: Social Network Processes and the Effect of Prejudice on the Avoidance of Outgroup Friends
AN  - 1767328597; 201605714
AB  - Research has found that prejudiced people avoid friendships with members of ethnic outgroups. Results of this study suggest that this effect is mediated by a social network process. Longitudinal network analysis of a three-wave panel study of 12- to 13-year-olds (N = 453) found that more prejudiced majority group members formed fewer intergroup friendships than less prejudiced majority group members. This was caused indirectly by the preference to become friends of one's friends' friends (triadic closure). More prejudiced majority members did not have a preference for actively avoiding minority group members. Rather, they had the tendency to avoid friends who already had minority group friends and thus could not be introduced to potential minority group friends. Instead they became friends with the majority group friends of their friends. This research shows how a social networks perspective can further our understanding of the processes underlying intergroup contact. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Adolescents' Perceptions of Opportunities in the U.S. South: Postracial Mirage or Reality in the New Black Mecca?
AN  - 1900186754
AB  - The scholarly community has eagerly assessed adults' perspectives on race and opportunity in the "postracial" era. Noticeably absent are studies that probe youths' perceptions of social and educational opportunity within this era, given the relationship between education and upward mobility, and the symbolism embodied in Obama's 2008 election as the first African-American president of the United States. This paper uses data drawn from a four-year longitudinal study that examined the educational experiences of Black adolescents in Metro Atlanta, Georgia-referred to as the "New Black Mecca." Interview data from a subset of 75 Black adolescents participating in an ethnographic study, and 1,329 surveys from a racially diverse group of adolescents across three different high schools, capture: (a) how Black adolescents embraced meritocratic notions of opportunity-while inheriting a social awareness of race-based opportunities, (b) Black adolescents' use of destigmatization strategies to thwart prejudice, and (c) the protective role a predominantly Black suburban context plays in mitigating the effects of day-to-day encounters with racial discrimination.

T1  - When Prejudice Is Popular: Implications for Discriminatory Behavior
AN  - 1718068191; 201532549
AB  - Prejudice and popularity represent two major areas of research. Yet studies have not considered whether prejudiced adolescents actually can be popular. Among 572 high school students (Mage = 15.80 years), the current study tested the association between popularity (based on sociometric peer nominations) and sexual prejudice against gay and lesbian individuals, moderated by gender and perspective taking. As hypothesized, the association was significant for males but not females, and it was significant for adolescents lower on perspective taking but not those higher on perspective taking. Moreover, adolescents who were popular and expressed strong sexual prejudice were more likely to engage in homophobic behavior than prejudiced adolescents who were less popular. Popular adolescents with strong sexual prejudice beliefs may be more prone to use homophobic behavior as a way to maintain their dominant position. Similarly, prejudiced adolescents who are popular may face less pushback for their engagement in homophobic behavior. Continued attention to the connection between sexual prejudice and popularity is important because of the high status, influence, and visibility of popular adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How contact shapes implicit and explicit preferences: attitudes toward Roma children in inclusive and non-inclusive environment
AN  - 1674422111
AB  - In two studies, the authors examined the effects of intergroup contact in inclusive and non-inclusive environments on children's explicit and implicit prejudices. In both studies, supervised contact with Roma peers, instructed by inclusive program, led to a more positive explicit evaluation of Roma and less social distance, while it had no significant impact on implicit attitudes. In contrast, implicit attitudes were related to mere exposure to Roma (Study 2). Intergroup anxiety and self-disclosure mediated the effect of inclusiveness level on explicit, but not on implicit attitudes. The results indicate that two types of attitudes might be formed via different routes, and that mere exposure and supervised contact influence them differently. This information could help tailor future prejudice reduction programs.

T1  - Beyond “Post-Race Paralysis”
AN  - 2406943833
AB  - The challenges of facilitating conversations on racial inequality, whiteness, and privilege in classrooms include student disengagement and students’ accusations of prejudice among instructors, particularly instructors of color. Moreover, the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 has promoted the claim that we are now “post-race” and thus no longer need to talk about race. Both students and instructors who believe otherwise and are committed to bringing up these topics in class risk facing ridicule or hostility and for instructors, even threats to their job security or life. However, in a public university where, ideally, racial inequality and privilege intersect, the classroom can be a space for critical dialogue and coalition building around racial justice. I discuss two pedagogical strategies that build opportunities to help students and instructors overcome “post-race paralysis”—the difficulty talking about race in the post-Obama era—and instead practice conversations towards anti-racism.

T1  - Contact Theory in a Small-Town Settler-Colonial Context: The Reproduction of Laissez-Faire Racism in Indigenous-White Canadian Relations
AN  - 1700675646; 201524700
AB  - This article builds on group position theory and the subcategorization model of intergroup contact by illustrating how, in a small-town settler-colonial context, contact tends to reproduce, rather than challenge, the inequitable racial structure. In Northwestern Ontario, Indigenous-settler relations are characterized by widespread intergroup marriage and friendship as well as pervasive prejudice and discrimination. Using 18 months of fieldwork and 160 interviews and surveys with First Nations, Metis, and non-Indigenous residents, I show that although contact is associated with less 'old-fashioned' prejudice (i.e., overt categorical hostility), it does not necessarily eliminate whites' superior sense of group position. Even white individuals who have close Indigenous friends or spouses often express laissez-faire racism. Three mutually reinforcing social processes -- subtyping, ideology-based homophily, and political avoidance norms -- interact to sustain whites' sense of group superiority and justifications for racial inequity. These processes are facilitated by historical and structural conditions, in this case colonization and small-town dynamics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The greatest magic of Harry Potter: Reducing prejudice
AN  - 1654892806
AB  - Recent research shows that extended contact via story reading is a powerful strategy to improve out-group attitudes. We conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees). Results from one experimental intervention with elementary school children and from two cross-sectional studies with high school and university students (in Italy and United Kingdom) supported our main hypothesis. Identification with the main character (i.e., Harry Potter) and disidentification from the negative character (i.e., Voldemort) moderated the effect. Perspective taking emerged as the process allowing attitude improvement. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed in the context of extended intergroup contact and social cognitive theory.

T1  - Reproduction of Conflict in History Teaching in Ukraine: A Social Identity Theory Analysis
AN  - 1728663421; 201534339
AB  - Based on 60 semistructured interviews with history teachers in Ukraine, the ways in which social identity impacts reproduction of intergroup prejudice and conflict on the level of secondary education are explored. This involves an analysis regarding how salience and meaning of social identity of the teachers affect how they present the in-group and other groups to school pupils. The analysis reveals how teachers create conflict narratives in their classrooms by altering the teaching program and textbooks to promote their vision of a nation and the rights of specific groups to participate in nation-building processes and to define enemies and allies. The major channels of this influence are specific concepts of national identity (ethnic, multicultural, and civic), social boundaries, and collective axiology. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Inherence-based views of social categories
AN  - 1660024922; 201505515
AB  - Children adopt an inherence-based view of some social categories, viewing certain social categories as reflecting the inherent features of their members. Thinking of social categories in these terms contributes to prejudice and intergroup conflict. Thus, understanding what leads children to apply inherence-based views to particular categories could provide new direction for efforts to reduce these negative social phenomena.

AN  - 1660024800; 201505490
AB  - Prior work has detailed the constructivist processes that lead individuals to categorize others along particular dimensions (e.g., gender) and generate the content (e.g., stereotypes) and affect (e.g., prejudices) associated with social groups. The inherence heuristic is a novel mechanism that appears to shape the content and rigidity of children's social stereotypes and prejudices. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Imagined contact as a prejudice-reduction intervention in schools: the underlying role of similarity and attitudes
AN  - 1552385833
AB  - The present research tested a prejudice-reduction intervention based on imagined contact. White children imagined interacting with a child from an ethnic out-group (Asian) once a week for 3 weeks, or did not take part in this activity (control group). Compared with the control group, children who engaged in imagined contact subsequently showed more positive attitudes, greater perceived similarity, and willingness for intergroup contact. The effect of the intervention on willingness for contact was mediated by positive attitude change. Implications for imagined-contact theory and the development of prejudice-reduction techniques for schools are discussed.

T1  - No Blacks Allowed: Segregated Gifted Education in the Context of Brown v. Board of Education
AN  - 1692289490; 201522737
AB  - This article examines the under-representation of Black students in gifted education, asserting that social inequalities (e.g., prejudice and discrimination) contribute to segregated gifted education programs. Under-representation trends are presented for gifted education, along with methods for calculating under-representation and then inequity goals. Philosophically, this article is grounded in disparate impact discourse, where outcome is more cogent than intent. Denying access to gifted education based on race is immoral and illegal. Pragmatically, under-representation is couched under the larger and more comprehensive achievement gaps and inequities in school settings with implications for de jure segregation. We discuss the under-representation of Black students in gifted education with Brown v. Board of Education as the legal foundation and then focus briefly on a recent court case in gifted education (McFadden v. Board of Education for Illinois School District U-46) for a contemporary point of discussion. Recommendations for desegregating gifted education for Black students regarding attitudes, instruments, and policies and procedures are provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Management of Prisoners' Children in the Russian Federation
AN  - 1559004785; 201434115
AB  - The inherited geography of the penal estate in the Russian Federation, which results in prisoners being sent long distances to serve their sentences, creates difficulties for maintaining prisoners' family ties. Using the results of interviews conducted with prisoners, former prisoners and relatives in the Russian Federation in 2007-2011, the article examines the patterns of contact between minors and their incarcerated parents in the context of arrangements put in place by the prison service to support the parent-child relationship. Despite arrangements that appear positive on the surface, societal prejudice and historical practice combine with geography to militate against good outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Heterosexual Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage: The Influence of Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting
AN  - 1552662396
AB  - Legal recognition of same-sex marriage is a controversial social issue. Despite a positive shift in attitudes toward gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, sexual prejudice still exists. Research suggests that religion and religiosity, contact, education, sex, gender ideologies, age, and marital and parental status contribute to biases against sexual minorities. Similar findings have been established for attitudes toward same-sex marriage; however, attitudes toward same-sex marriage have been found to be more complex and resistant to change, suggesting the influence of other factors. One potential influence that has not been investigated is the influence of attitudes toward same-sex parenting on attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Contemporary research indicates that people are still hesitant about same-sex couples raising children, which may influence their attitude about same-sex marriage. Further research to investigate the influence of attitudes toward same-sex parenting on attitudes toward same-sex marriage is warranted, and findings from those studies may be useful in educational settings or promotions for social change.

T1  - What causes prejudice? How may we solve it? Lay beliefs and their relations with classical and modern prejudice and social dominance orientation
AN  - 1559007579; 201432163
AB  - This research aimed to examine lay beliefs about the causes of and solutions to ethnic prejudice towards immigrant populations in the Italian context. The research had two main goals: (a) to explore in Italy what non-experts think causes ethnic prejudice against immigrants, and how they suggest we combat it; (b) to assess whether lay perceptions of causes of ethnic prejudice mediate the relationship between SDO and ethnic prejudice, and whether such mediational effects would depend on the form of ethnic prejudice considered (classical vs. modern). In particular, we hypothesized that lay beliefs about the causes of (but not lay beliefs about solutions to) prejudice towards immigrants may mediate the relation between SDO and prejudice towards immigrants. 520 Italian high school students participated in the study and completed a set of questionnaires regarding these issues. Results showed that Italian respondents were especially likely to attribute the causes of ethnic prejudice towards immigrants to ignorance and close-mindedness, and to recommend as main solutions open-mindedness and tolerance of others' values. Moreover, as predicted, beliefs about causes of ethnic prejudice significantly mediated the relation between SDO and modern (but not classical) prejudice. Implications of our findings for social dominance theory were discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Incorporating Sociology into Community Service Classes
AN  - 1512595205
AB  - Sociologists and instructors who teach about community service share an affinity for understanding and addressing social problems. While many studies have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating community service into sociology courses, we examine the benefits of incorporating sociological content into community service classes. The authors supplemented a community service course at a large public university with sociological theories, concepts, and analyses. Our data suggest that this integration increased student understanding of the social structural factors that adversely affect the populations they served, sharpened student awareness of the various forms of prejudice and discrimination against these populations, enhanced student appreciation of their own privilege within the community service continuum, and facilitated student awareness of how understanding the plight of populations in need makes community servants more capable and humane. We argue that with the rapid growth of interest in community service across college campuses, sociologists are ideally situated to provide beneficial training outside the confines of their classrooms.

T1  - Explaining dehumanization among children: The interspecies model of prejudice
AN  - 1541997944; 201426785
AB  - Although many theoretical approaches have emerged to explain prejudices expressed by children, none incorporate outgroup dehumanization, a key predictor of prejudice among adults. According to the Interspecies Model of Prejudice, beliefs in the human-animal divide facilitate outgroup prejudice through fostering animalistic dehumanization (Costello & Hodson, 2010). In the present investigation, White children attributed Black children fewer 'uniquely human' characteristics, representing the first systematic evidence of racial dehumanization among children (Studies 1 and 2). In Study 2, path analyses supported the Interspecies Model of Prejudice: children's human-animal divide beliefs predicted greater racial prejudice, an effect explained by heightened racial dehumanization. Similar patterns emerged among parents. Furthermore, parent Social Dominance Orientation predicted child prejudice indirectly through children's endorsement of a hierarchical human-animal divide and subsequent dehumanizing tendencies. Encouragingly, children's human-animal divide perceptions were malleable to an experimental prime highlighting animal-human similarity. Implications for prejudice interventions are considered.

T1  - The Gay Second Generation: Sexual Identity and Family Relations of Filipino and Latino Gay Men
AN  - 2076975415
AB  - While studies have considered how race has reshaped how children of immigrants adapt to US life, studies have not thoroughly considered how sexual identity affects their assimilation. With a focus on familial incorporation, this study draws from the narratives of second-generation Filipino and Latino gay men to show that sexual identity deeply shapes the degree to which gay children of immigrants are able to secure social support and moral acceptance from their parents. These men employ strategies to maintain rapport with their families before and after coming out of the closet, a process I term moral management. While this study focuses on a unique population, the findings have greater implications for uncovering the mechanisms of intergenerational conflict and consensus among immigrant populations, as well as the dynamics of overcoming social prejudices within minority communities.

T1  - A meta-analytic test of the imagined contact hypothesis
AN  - 1512219580; 201408606
AB  - Imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) is a new indirect contact strategy for promoting tolerance and more positive intergroup relations. Despite its relatively recent inception, there have now been over 70 studies showing that imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member can reduce prejudice and encourage positive intergroup behavior. With this meta-analysis, we provide the first quantitative review of imagined contact effects on four key measures of intergroup bias: attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behavior. We also test for moderators arising from both group and study design characteristics. The analysis found that imagined contact resulted in significantly reduced intergroup bias across all four dependent variables (overall d+ = 0.35). The effect was significant for both published and unpublished studies, and emerged across a broad range of target outgroups and contexts. The effect was equally strong for explicit and implicit attitude measures, but was stronger on behavioral intentions than on attitudes, supporting the direct link between imagery and action proposedly underlying mental simulation effects. Most design characteristics had no significant impact, including valence of the imagined interaction, type of control condition, and time spent imagining contact. However, the more participants were instructed to elaborate on the context within which the imagined interaction took place, the stronger the effect. The imagined contact effect was also stronger for children than for adults, supporting the proposition that imagined contact is a potentially key component of educational strategies aiming to promote positive social change.

T1  - Changing the ideological roots of prejudice: Longitudinal effects of ethnic intergroup contact on social dominance orientation
AN  - 1512218304; 201408603
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) has been reported to be strongly related to a multitude of intergroup phenomena, but little is known about situational experiences that may influence SDO. Drawing from research on intergroup contact theory, we argue that positive intergroup contact is able to reduce SDO-levels. The results of an intergroup contact intervention study among high school students (Study 1, N = 71) demonstrated that SDO levels were indeed attenuated after the intervention. Furthermore, this intervention effect on SDO was especially pronounced among students reporting a higher quality of contact. A cross-lagged longitudinal survey among adults (Study 2, N = 363) extended these findings by demonstrating that positive intergroup contact is able to decrease SDO over time. Moreover, we did not obtain evidence for the idea that people high in SDO would engage less in intergroup contact. These findings indicate that intergroup contact erodes one of the important socio-ideological bases of generalized prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - The Role of Perceived Peer Prejudice and Teacher Discrimination on Adolescent Substance Use: A Social Determinants Approach
AN  - 1504423407; 201407585
AB  - Although Black adolescents have reported a lower prevalence of substance use relative to non-Hispanic Whites, Black youth are disproportionately affected by adverse social outcomes. Social scientists have highlighted that using a framework that includes perceived peer prejudice and teacher discrimination as social determinants of adolescent risk behaviors is essential to fully understanding substance use behaviors in adolescents. However, this area of research remains underdeveloped. This study examined whether and to what extent perceived peer prejudice and teacher discrimination affect binge drinking and marijuana use by Black (n = 514) and non-Hispanic White (n = 2,818) adolescents using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave 2, Public Use dataset. Findings suggest that peer prejudice increased the risk of substance use in non-Hispanic White youth only, whereas experiences of teacher discrimination increased the risk of substance use in both Black and non-Hispanic White youth. The study's limitations are noted, and implications for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Different Type of Summer Camp: SNCC, Freedom Summer, Freedom Schools, and the Development of African American Males in Mississippi
AN  - 1463011759; 201346757
AB  - The civil rights movement of the late 1950s and 1960s had a transformational effect on American society and on grassroots movements for social justice at home and abroad during that era and beyond. But much of the history of the push for racial equality in America is often told as if it is on a constant repetitive loop, when other accounts are given less attention. One less talked about story is the innovative way that the youthful Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) carried out major campaigns in the south, and particularly Mississippi, when other groups were hesitant to do so. During and long before the movement, Mississippi was a stronghold of racial prejudice and violence against African Americans. Despite the dangers associated with engaging in civil rights work in Mississippi, the SNCC workers, many of them only college students, planned a massive campaign to confront the system of injustice in the state during the summer of 1964. This undertaking came to be known as the "Freedom Summer." Significantly, the organization established summer "Freedom Schools" as a compliment to the summer project that would address the severe lack of attention school-aged Black children received as a result of Mississippi's intentional neglect. It is within this story that we find a compelling case for the need to identify alternative means of providing academic support for marginalized youth. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contact between Catholic and Protestant schoolchildren in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1433108256
AB  - This study explored segregation and sectarianism among children in integrated and non-integrated Northern Irish schools. Results revealed a substantial relationship between 2 types of intergroup contact--cross-group friendship and extended contact--and lower levels of prejudice. While cross-group friendships were associated with more positive intergroup relations via the mediating mechanisms of self-disclosure and empathy with the out-group, extended contact worked by eliciting positive perceived peer norms toward the out-group. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for intergroup relations among children in conflict societies.

T1  - Social Bias and the Development of Self-Control: Results From a Longitudinal Study of Children and Adolescents
AN  - 1448998061; 201344972
AB  - Gottfredson and Hirschi's general theory of crime has sparked a tremendous amount of research examining the link between levels of self-control and involvement in delinquent and criminal acts. Recently, studies testing this theory have begun to investigate the factors that are related to the development of self-control. The current study expands on this body of research by examining whether social bias, as measured by the ability to identify facial expressions, contributes to variation in self-control in a sample of children. Analysis of data drawn from the National Survey of Children revealed some evidence that children who had difficulty correctly identifying facial expressions depicting fear and happiness had lower levels of self-control, whereas errors in identifying faces expressing anger were related to higher levels of self-control. The authors discuss the need for Gottfredson and Hirschi's theory on the development of self-control to be expanded. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - Contemporary research emphasises the dynamic intergroup nature of acculturation processes involving both immigrants and nationals. Using data from a sample of 372 U.S. national children (aged 6-9 years), we examine the relationship between acculturation attitudes, conceptualized as desire for cultural maintenance and desire for intergroup contact between immigrants and nationals, and attitudes towards Somali immigrants (intended behaviour, prejudice, perceived norms and intergroup anxiety). Prosocial behaviours were highest among children who simultaneously endorsed cultural maintenance and intergroup contact attitudes. These findings and their implications are discussed.

T1  - Modern Prejudice and Same-Sex Parenting: Shifting Judgments in Positive and Negative Parenting Situations
AN  - 1373429719; 201330628
AB  - The current study compares the effects of traditional and modern antihomosexual prejudice on evaluations of parenting practices of same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Undergraduate university student participants (N = 436) completed measures of traditional and modern antihomosexual prejudice and responded to a vignette describing a restaurant scene in which parents react to their child's undesirable behavior. The parents' sexual orientation and the quality of their parenting (positive or negative quality) were randomly varied. It was predicted that participants who score higher in modern prejudice would rate the negative parenting behaviors of same-sex parents more negatively than similar behaviors in opposite-sex parents. It was also predicted that this modern prejudice effect would be most pronounced for male participants. Both hypotheses were supported. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - THE IMPACT OF CROSS-GROUP ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS ON INTERGROUP PREJUDICE
AN  - 1531933020; 201423096
AB  - Considerable research has been devoted to understanding intergroup contact. In this paper, Orta aimed to highlight theoretical processes that reduce cross-group prejudice and promote intergroup cooperation. Therefore, she focused on the role of social contact in the form of romantic relationship between individuals belonging to different (e.g., racial, ethnic, religious) social groups. In emerging work convincing evidence has been provided that cross-group friendships reduce intergroup prejudice (Levin, van Laar, & Sidanius, 2003). Accordingly, cross-group romantic relationships should also reduce intergroup prejudice. Overall, in this paper she emphasized the significance of affective ties among members of different social groups, along with the unique role that social contact plays in reducing intergroup prejudice.

AB  - Ziege's book focuses primarily on the two main empirical studies carried out by Max Horkheimer's Institute of Social Research during its exile in the United States in the 1940s: a relatively unknown and never-published study of anti-Semitism among American workers and the much better known, five-volume Studies in Prejudice. Ziege poses and successfully answers the question of why the Institute began to focus more on empirical studies and anti-Semitism in the 1940s. Her thorough archival research illuminates as never before the Institute's relations to the main organizations that funded its ambitious empirical projects during this time: the American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Labor Committee. She also provides the richest existing account of how the experience of American exile affected the Institute's theoretical premises and empirical work. By distinguishing between the Institute's 'esoteric' theoretical assumptions, which maintained a large degree of continuity with its earlier work, and a willingness to work at the 'exoteric' level with many scholars who didn't share these assumptions, Ziege explains how the Institute made certain concessions to mainstream American academic culture without ever abandoning the radical intentions of Critical Theory.

T1  - When the direct route is blocked: The extended contact pathway to improving intergroup relations
AN  - 1283642022; 201303583
AB  - Direct intergroup contact can be described as the "royal road" to reducing prejudice and intergroup conflict. Although direct contact with an outgroup member may be limited, a promising alternative route is that of extended (indirect) contact. According to extended contact theory, awareness that ingroup members have outgroup friends can improve people's relations with the outgroup. A key issue that has not been addressed is how the amount of direct and extended contact interact to affect intergroup relations. Three field-based studies demonstrated that when direct contact is low, higher levels of extended contact predict lower prejudice and higher voluntary engagement with outgroup culture, both cross-sectionally (Studies 1 and 2) and longitudinally (Study 3). However, when direct contact is high, extended contact does not affect intergroup relations. These findings show that only when there is limited opportunity for direct contact, awareness of larger numbers of ingroup-outgroup friendships can be very effective for improving intergroup relations.

AN  - 1221414261; 201244308
AB  - Social and political tensions heightened after the attacks of 9/11 have created an increase in Islamophobia. Historically, vilified depictions of Muslims have legitimized discriminatory acts against Muslim Americans. In this context, Islamophobia has infiltrated our classrooms, making it urgent for educators to develop a critical pedagogical stance that counters discrimination and demystifies stereotypes against Muslim American students.

T1  - Sociology by Any Other Name: Teaching the Sociological Perspective in Campus Diversity Programs
AN  - 918716624
AB  - This article suggests that the way in to sociology may not always be through the front door. The authors demonstrate how students in a three-day campus diversity program develop a sociological imagination despite not having a formal affiliation with the sociology department. In particular, students demonstrate a move from color blindness into racial consciousness and a shift from individual prejudice into institutional privilege when understanding both diversity issues and their own personal biographies. In short, despite not knowing the phrase, they develop a sociological imagination. While the goal is not to diminish the significance of traditional sociology classrooms, the authors argue that programs like theirs may diminish resistance to learning about privilege and inequalities once students enter the classroom. Such programs may also have the benefit of attracting students to the discipline and creating a more welcoming environment for related programs and events on campus. It is one model of public sociology that other campus communities may mirror outside of the traditional classroom environment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Do ethnically diverse schools reduce ethnocentrism? A two-year panel study among majority group late adolescents in Belgian schools
AN  - 1417523538; 201332162
AB  - Contact theories on the development of ethnocentrism assume that interaction with ethnic minority representatives will reduce prejudice. We test this assumption among a representative sample of Belgian late adolescents (n = 2828), taking the class level as interaction context. Given an average class size of 13 pupils/class, it can be expected that within the class room an intensive interaction between pupils occurs, thus providing an ideal setting for testing the contact hypothesis. The Belgian Political Panel Study (BPPS, 2006-2008) allows for longitudinal multilevel analysis, tracing effects over time. The analysis shows no significant effects of diversity as such on ethnocentrism. The perception of ethnic and cultural tensions at school, however, is associated with the strengthening of prejudice two years later on. A dating thermometer question had a significant relation with diversity level, but this more personal question too reacted strongly to the presence of ethnic tensions. We conclude that there is no mechanical effect of diversity in class rooms, but that this effect is dependent on the perceived quality of the intergroup relations, in line with the contact theory as developed by Allport and Pettigrew.

T1  - A Participatory Approach to Healing and Transformation in South Africa
AN  - 1285125805; 22145721
AB  - In this article I describe my personal journey from working as private practitioner to participating in the wider South African society. Post-apartheid South African society struggles with overwhelming problems related to poverty, illness, violence, sexism, and racism. Moreover, in those communities where the trauma is most severe, professional resources are scarce. I propose a participatory approach which invites therapists to respond to these socio-economic and political challenges and the problems that arise from them by thinking and acting outside the constraints of their consultation rooms and of traditional therapeutic conversations, into active participation in ways that might support healing and social transformation. I use two examples to illustrate and discuss the participatory approach with which I have engaged for over 10 years. The illustrative examples show how a participatory approach can create ripples that impact communities in healing and transformative ways. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Has the Child Welfare Profession Discovered Nepotistic Biases?
AN  - 893390025; 22388880
AB  - A major trend in foster care in developed countries over the past quarter century has been a shift toward placing children with "kin" rather than with unrelated foster parents. This change in practice is widely backed by legislation and is routinely justified as being in the best interests of the child. It is tempting to interpret this change as indicating that the child welfare profession has belatedly discovered that human social sentiments are nepotistic in their design, such that kin tend to be the most nurturant alloparents. Arguably, however, the change in practice has been driven by demographic, economic, and political forces rather than by discovery of its benefits. More and better research is needed before we can be sure that children have actually benefitted.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Perceived Discrimination and Antisocial Behaviors in Puerto Rican Children
AN  - 864994153; 21113817
AB  - This study examined whether perceived discrimination was related to antisocial behaviors (ASB) in a probability sample of Puerto Rican children living in the South Bronx, New York and the San Juan Metropolitan area of Puerto Rico (N = 1,271). After adjusting for a host of well-known factors associated with ASB, such as sociodemographic variables (i.e., age, gender, household composition), psychosocial stressors (i.e., stressful life events, exposure to violence), and various forms of violence and abuse (i.e., coercive parental discipline, verbal, psychological, physical and sexual abuse), perceived discrimination remained a robust correlate of ASB among both samples. Findings are discussed with reference to the detrimental associations of perceived discrimination. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 1417524805; 201332225
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Journal peer review in context: A qualitative study of the social and subjective dimensions of manuscript review in biomedical publishing
AN  - 902082528; 201123754
AB  - Peer- and editorial review of research submitted to biomedical journals ('manuscript review') is frequently argued to be essential for ensuring scientific quality and the dissemination of important ideas, but there is also broad agreement that manuscript review is often unsuccessful in achieving its goals. Problems with manuscript review are frequently attributed to the social and subjective dimensions of the process (e.g. bias and conflict of interest). While there have been numerous efforts to improve the process, these have had limited success. This may be because these efforts do not account sufficiently for all of the social and subjective dimensions of the process. We set out, therefore, to characterise the most salient social and subjective dimensions of the manuscript review process, from the perspective of practising reviewers and editors. Open-ended interviews were carried out with 35 journal editors, and peer reviewers in the UK, USA and Australia. It emerged from these interviews that reviewers and editors were conscious of a number of social and subjective influences on the review process including: a wide variety of motivations for participation, complex relations of power, epistemic authority and moral responsibility, and unavoidable prejudice and intuition. Importantly, these social and subjective influences were often viewed positively and were seen as expressions of, rather than threats to, editors' and reviewers' epistemic authority and expertise. From this we conclude that the social and subjective dimensions of biomedical manuscript review should be made more explicit, accommodated and even encouraged, not only because these dimensions of human relationships and judgements are unavoidable, but because their explicit presence is likely to enrich, rather than threaten the manuscript review process. We suggest a 'dialectical' model which can simultaneously accommodate, and embrace, all dimensions of the manuscript review process. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The Influence of Discrimination on Inmigrant Adolescents´ Depressive Symptoms: What Buffers its Detrimental Effects?
TT  - Influencia de la Discriminación en los Síntomas de Depresión en Adolescentes Inmigrantes: ¿Qué Elementos Mitigan sus Efectos Perjudiciales?
AN  - 2479456004
AB  - The present study examined the link between perceived discrimination, depressive symptoms, cultural identity and social support at school reported by immigrant adolescents. Participants were 214 mostly male, immigrant adolescents in grades 9 through 13 of high schools in two small cities in northern Italy. Results showed that discrimination has a significant detrimental effect on psychological well-being of foreign-born adolescents. Additionally, the current study outlined that the only protective factor for depressive symptoms, among the analyzed variables concerning cultural identity and school social support, was social support from teachers. None of the analyzed moderators buffered the relationship between discrimination and depressive symptoms reported by immigrant adolescents. These results have implications for preventive interventions for immigrant adolescents and suggest a protective role for teachers. Future research should detect strategies to reduce discrimination and prejudice toward immigrant adolescents and detect factors that may buffer detrimental effects of discrimination on psychological well-being.Alternate abstract:
El presente estudio examina la relación entre discriminación percibida, síntomas de depresión, identidad cultural y apoyo social percibido en una muestra de 214 estudiantes adolescentes inmigrantes. Todos ellos cursaban estudios entre los grados 9 y 13 en institutos de enseñanza secundaria de dos pequeñas ciudades del norte de Italia. Los resultados confirmaron que la discriminación posee un efecto perjudicial significativo en el bienestar psicológico de los adolescentes nacidos en el extranjero. Además, el presente estudio confirma que el apoyo social por parte de los profesores es un factor protector contra los síntomas de la depresión. En cambio otros potenciales moderadores analizados, como identidad cultural y otras fuentes de apoyo social, no mitigaron la relación entre discriminación y síntomas de depresión en los adolescentes inmigrantes. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones para el diseño de intervenciones preventivas con adolescentes inmigrantes puesto que subrayan el papel protector del profesorado. Futuras investigaciones deberían centrarse en detectar estrategias para reducir la discriminación y prejuicios hacia los adolescentes inmigrantes y detectar los factores que puedan mitigar los efectos perjudiciales de la discriminación en el bienestar psicológico.

T1  - Teaching Children Fairness: Decreasing Gender Prejudice Among Children
AN  - 1030869572; 201230111
AB  - Elementary school children (66 girls and 55 boys, aged 10-13 years) in the Western United States participated in a program designed to teach them about fairness and to decrease their engagement in gender-prejudice behaviors. The study utilized a pretest/posttest design comparing students in the treatment group to students in a control group. Children and teachers completed measures regarding the children's engagement of gender prejudice among their classmates, and students participated in focus groups after completing the program. At posttest, students in the treatment group reported experiencing less gender-prejudice by their classmates than students in the control group. Teachers also reported fewer gender-prejudice behaviors by the students in the treatment group. Qualitative analyses of the focus groups revealed that the students reported learning to challenge gender role stereotypes and endorsed a commitment to treating boys and girls fairly.

T1  - Essentialist theory of 'hybrids': From animal kinds to ethnic categories and race
AN  - 835111524; 201100426
AB  - This article presents a theory of the perception of hybrids, resulting from cross-breeding natural animals that pertain to different species and of children parented by couples with a mixed ethnic or racial background. The theory states that natural living beings, including humans, are perceived as possessing a deeply ingrained characteristic that is called 'essence' or 'blood' or 'genes' in everyday discourse and that uniquely determines their category membership. If, by whatever means, the genes or essences of two animals of different species are combined in a hybrid, the two incompatible essences collapse, leaving the hybrid in a state of non-identity and non-belonging. People despise this state and reject the hybrid (Study 1). This devaluation effect holds with cross-kind hybrids and with hybrids that arise from genetically combining animals from incompatible habitats across three cultures: Austria, India and Japan (Study 2). In the social world, groups and ethnic or racial categories frequently are essentialized in an analogue way. When people with an essentialist mindset judge ethnically or racially mixed offspring, they perceive a collapse of ethnic or racial essence and, consequently, denigrate these children, as compared to children from 'pure' in-group or out-group parents (Study 3). The findings are discussed in terms of the widespread 'yuck factor' against genetically modified animals, in terms of the cultural concepts of monstrosity and of racism and prejudice.

T1  - Intergroup friendships on campus: Predicting close and casual friendships between White and African American first-year college students
AN  - 758124171; 201056728
AB  - Intergroup friendships have been linked to important outcomes such as reduced prejudice, increased empathy for outgroups, and lower intergroup anxiety. However, little is known about the factors facilitating such friendships. This longitudinal study therefore examined factors associated with the development of friendships between White and African American freshmen at a predominantly White university. African American (vs. White) and male (vs. female) students had more intergroup friendships at the end of freshman year. Friendships between African American and White freshmen were also associated with more direct and indirect intergroup contact during high school, less prejudice upon entering college, having an outgroup roommate (White or African American), having any roommate, and having more contact with outgroup members during the academic year.

T1  - Cultural Orientation as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Chinese American Adolescents' Discrimination Experiences and Delinquent Behaviors
AN  - 734378301; 19834795
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among Chinese American adolescents' discrimination experiences, cultural orientations, and delinquent behaviors. Data were collected from three hundred and eleven Chinese American adolescents (58% girls) and their parents when the adolescents were 7th or 8th graders and again 4 years later. The data analyses demonstrated that adolescents' perceptions of discrimination and victimization experiences were significantly related to their delinquent behaviors conditionally based upon their cultural orientation. Specifically, adolescents' high Chinese cultural orientation amplified the negative impact of discriminatory experiences on delinquent behaviors whereas high Western cultural orientation protected them against that impact. The significance of both ethnic and mainstream cultural orientations for understanding ethnic minority adolescents' adjustment and improving their adjustment outcomes is discussed.

T1  - Perceived Entitativity and the Black-Sheep Effect: When Will We Denigrate Negative Ingroup Members?
AN  - 734592682; 20397595
AB  - Although ingroup favoritism is a robust effect, there are notable exceptions. For example, the outgroup extremity effect indicates outgroup derogation, whereas the black-sheep effect indicates ingroup derogation. We propose that perceived entitativity, the degree to which a group is viewed as a unified social entity, may help explain ingroup derogation. Negative ingroup members from high perceived entitativity groups may pose a meaningful threat to the perceiver's social identity that can be alleviated by denigrating the target (i.e., the black-sheep effect). Participants evaluated high or low quality essays attributed to ingroup and outgroup members. Participants did not differentiate based on ingroup/outgroup membership for low perceived entitativity groups. However, when rating high perceived entitativity groups, ingroup extremity emerged. These results confirm and provide explanations for ingroup denigration. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Culturally Distinctive and Academic Socialization: Direct and Interactive Relationships with African American Adolescents' Academic Adjustment
AN  - 204636738; 20084565
AB  - Theories of ethnic minority development have largely suggested that African American parents engage in a combination of practices that include culturally distinctive socialization as well as behaviors that are characteristic of more universal forms of academic socialization. However, few studies have examined how these socialization dimensions interact to influence the academic adjustment of African American adolescents. The current study explored the independent and interactive roles of parental academic and culturally distinctive socialization on the academic adjustment of African American adolescents. The sample was comprised 144 African American adolescents (M = 12.4; SD = 1.14; 56% female). Findings provided partial support that cultural and academic socialization were independently associated with indicators of academic adjustment. However, the interaction between these dimensions also was associated with youths' adjustment in the academic domain. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
