T1  - Scientistic Prejudice and Methodological Pluralism
AN  - 2431837684
AB  - This paper aims to point out that the publication of the five volumes by Thomas and Znaniecki The Polish Peasant in Europe and America opened new scenarios, and gave its fundamental contribution in authorising a new way of conducting researches, which voluntarily distances from the 'scientistic logic' to recognise the heuristic-interpretative value of narration, though without denying the usefulness of the quantitative approach. That being stated, the specific purpose of this paper is twofold: focusing on the heuristic-interpretative value of narration while reconstructing, at the same time, the common thread that, starting from The Polish Peasant in Europe and America, connects apparently distant texts and authors stimulating a reflection on the development of empirical research and on its future.

T1  - Evidence for blatant dehumanization of mental illness and its relation to stigma
AN  - 2391192430
AB  - People with mental illness face stigma, and due to their low social status, they may also face blatant dehumanization that denies their status as fully evolved human beings. In the current research, three studies documented the existence of blatant dehumanization of mental illness. Study 1 (N = 112) showed that participants rated people with mental illness in general as being significantly less human than other dehumanized social groups such as Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Study 2 (N = 158) showed that dehumanization occurs for specific mental disorders but that the level of dehumanization varies widely among disorders. Study 3 (N = 223) documented significant correlations between dehumanization of mental illness and standard measures of stigma such as fear, pity, and social distance. Overall, the results establish the relevance of blatant dehumanization to mental illness stigma and suggest new directions for understanding stigma.

T1  - Don’t Put Words in My Mouth: Self-appointed Speaking-for Is Testimonial Injustice Without Prejudice
AN  - 2391187272
AB  - In this paper, I will characterize a phenomenon I call ‘self-appointed speaking-for’, and show how it constitutes a counter-example to Miranda Fricker’s definition of testimonial injustice (TI), expanding our understanding of the category. Self-appointed speaking-for occurs when one speaks on behalf of or in place of another individual or group without their authorization. It is the sort of phenomenon that occasions complaints like, ‘You put words in my mouth’; that happens when someone else answers a question directed at you; or when someone purports to represent the perspective of a group they are not affiliated with or entitled to represent. I argue that this is a central case of Fricker’s testimonial injustice, on the grounds that it inflicts the same harms as other kinds of TI — particularly demeaning someone in their capacity as a giver of knowledge — in a way that is both epistemically and ethically culpable. TI is wrong not only for the harms it generates but also because its cause — prejudice — is ethically wrong and bad epistemic practice. As I show, self-appointed speaking-for is wrong for the same reasons as prejudice is, no matter what motivates it.

T1  - Exploring gender discursive struggles about social inclusion in an online gaming community
TT  - Gender discursive struggles
AN  - 2533911165
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to adopt a critical relational dialectics framework to identify and explore gender discursive struggles about social inclusion observed in an online gaming community, in South Africa.Design/methodology/approachThe paper uses a technique called contrapuntal analysis to identify and explore competing discourses in over 200 messages on gender struggles about social inclusion posted in the local community’s gamer discussion board, based on seven threads initiated by women gamer activists.FindingsThe findings show how four interrelated gender discursive struggles about social inclusion and social exclusion animated the meanings of online gamer relations: dominance vs equality, stereotyping vs diversity, competitiveness vs cooperativeness and privilege vs empowerment.Practical implicationsGame designers should reinforce more accurate and positive stereotypes to cater for the rapidly growing female gamer segment joining the online gaming market and to develop a less chauvinistic and more diversely representative online gaming community. Enlightened gamers should exercise greater solidarity in fighting for gender equality in online gaming communities.Originality/valueThe critical relational dialectics analysis adopted in this study offers a promising avenue to understand and critique the discursive struggles that arise when online gamers from the different gender groups relate. The findings highlight the unequal discursive power and privilege of many white male gamers when discussing social inclusion. Advancing our understanding of these discursive struggles creates the possibilities for improving social inclusion in online gaming communities.

T1  - Leavers and Remainers after the Brexit referendum: More united than divided after all?
AN  - 2384832056
AB  - Since the British ‘Brexit referendum’ in 2016, tensions between ‘leave’ and ‘remain’ voters have been growing. Using a novel analytical approach based on the full distribution of responses rather than their arithmetic means, Study 1 (N = 1,506) showed on average 90% of overlap among Leavers and Remainers across a range of important variables. Even on the variables that are commonly used to illustrate how Leavers and Remainers differ (e.g., prejudice against immigrants), the amount of overlap was larger than 50%. In Study 2 (N = 206), we demonstrate the importance of focusing on similarities between groups: Presenting the full distribution of responses from Leavers and Remainers rather than their mean differences caused more accurate perceptions of the actual differences and similarities between both groups and higher perceived intergroup harmony. We conclude that similarities between Leavers and Remainers are substantial and that our proposed approach may help to de‐escalate tensions between these and other groups.

T1  - Sociology and evolutionary biology: A troubled past, a promising future
AN  - 2409515681
AB  - The New Evolutionary Sociology offers a comprehensive review of the history of evolutionary analysis in sociology that demonstrates its present value ‘once old biases and prejudices are mitigated and, eventually, eliminated’ (p. 14). In the book’s first part, the authors highlight the prominence of evolution in the theorizing of sociology’s founders and the reaction against this approach when it was used to support ethnocentrism, racism, and fascism. The second part describes non-sociologists’ attempts to reconnect evolutionary biology and social science through sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. The book’s last part presents new evolutionary approaches within sociology, focusing primarily on comparative research with primates and a neurosociological explanation of the evolution of the human brain.

T1  - Identification with the American South and Anti-Muslim Attitudes
AN  - 2353195013
AB  - The number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the U.S. nearly tripled between 2015 and 2016. In addition, the number of hate crimes committed against members of the religion jumped 67% in 2015 alone. Addressing the rise in anti-Muslim prejudice is critical. We examined (N = 406) the role of regional identification in predicting anti-Muslim attitudes. That is, identification with the American South, a more conservative and religious part of the country with a history of slavery and violent secession movements, predicted anti-Muslim attitudes. This relationship was mediated by conservation values. For Southerners who strongly identified with “the South”, the endorsement of values related to a general resistance to change led to greater anti-Muslim attitudes. Anti-Muslim bias may lie in perceptions of threat: for strongly identified Southerners, the Muslim faith is viewed as a societal threat.

T1  - How Empathic Concern Fuels Political Polarization
AN  - 2330853881
AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been a marked increase in partisan social polarization, leaving scholars in search of solutions to partisan conflict. The psychology of intergroup relations identifies empathy as one of the key mechanisms that reduces intergroup conflict, and some have suggested that a lack of empathy has contributed to partisan polarization. Yet, empathy may not always live up to this promise. We argue that, in practice, the experience of empathy is biased toward one’s ingroup and can actually exacerbate political polarization. First, using a large, national sample, we demonstrate that higher levels of dispositional empathic concern are associated with higher levels of affective polarization. Second, using an experimental design, we show that individuals high in empathic concern show greater partisan bias in evaluating contentious political events. Taken together, our results suggest that, contrary to popular views, higher levels of dispositional empathy actually facilitate partisan polarization.

T1  - Managers’ Conceptions and Their Effects on the Perception of Employees with Disabilities
AN  - 2635381057
AB  - The research aimed to identify managers’ conceptions of disability and the relationship that was established between these conceptions and their perception of the persons with disabilities (PWD) performance, bond, benefits of hiring, and training needs. 257 managers answered a questionnaire in order to identify conceptions of disability in organizations. Descriptive statistics, factorial analysis, and hierarchical analysis of grouping were performed while using IBM Statistic 20.0.0. The results show that managers who have the spiritual and the conception based on inclusion perceive the insertion of PWD as beneficial to the organization. Those who conceive disability as a question of normality perceive the PWD performance as inferior to those without disabilities, which implies that PWDs should be segregated; and, the managers who perceive disability as a social problem are likely to place PWDs in the workplace according to their potential. The results can be fruitfully used by managers, human resources’ professionals, academics, and the society to promote inclusion.

T1  - Between Nationalism and Pragmatism: The Roma Movement in Interwar Romania
AN  - 2511165614
AB  - In the interwar period, for the first time in their history, Romanian Roma managed to organise themselves on a modern basis, by forming Roma associations and unions, and issuing their own newspapers and programmes. In an effort to define themselves, they became politically active, claiming and negotiating rights. In my article I analyse the context of the interwar Roma movement, how Roma leaders of the time saw themselves and their movement, what programme(s) they had, and how they tried to achieve their goals. This was a serious challenge: As they were not self-sufficient, they heavily depended on support from Romanian institutions, and hence they had to act with caution in order to avoid any hostile reactions from the Romanian majority. Overall, the discourse of Roma elites in interwar Romania ranged between: 1) a national approach directed inwardly, toward the Roma, for ethnic mobilisation purposes, including calls to unite in order to acquire their rights, efforts to combat ethnic stigmatisation, discussions on ethnonyms (Gypsy vs. Roma) or on the importance of Roma in Romania and worldwide, the beginning of a national/ethnic mythology (past, origin, enslavement, heroization vs. victimization, etc.); and 2) a pragmatic approach directed outwardly, toward Romanian authorities and public opinion; rather than a national minority, Roma leaders presented the Roma as a social category with specific needs, due to their historical legacy. Of these two, throughout the interwar period, pragmatism prevailed. Special emphasis was placed on the issue of social inclusion, and on identifying specific problems and solutions (i.e., better access to education, settlement, deconstruction of prejudices, etc.).

T1  - Searching for a Roommate: A Correspondence Audit Examining Racial/Ethnic and Immigrant Discrimination among Millennials
AN  - 2474445826
AB  - Survey research finds that millennials have less prejudiced views of racial/ethnic minorities than other generations, leading some to label millennials as postracial. However, attitudinal survey research may be subject to social desirability bias because it documents statements or beliefs instead of actions. Moreover, most audit studies focus on people who make hiring decisions or own rental property and are therefore often older than millennials. This study uses a correspondence audit to investigate discrimination among millennials via “roommate wanted” advertisements. We sent over 4,000 emails and found a tiered pattern of discrimination against Asian (Indian and Chinese), Hispanic, and Black room-seekers. However, whether Asian and Hispanic room-seekers face significant discrimination varies based on whether they use predominantly White first names or traditional first names. Our findings shed light on the future of our racial system, expand our knowledge of discrimination beyond the traditional Black/White binary, and illustrate the persistence of anti-Blackness.

T1  - Social Psychological Factors Behind Ethnic Discrimination in Employee Selection
TT  - Çalışan Seçiminde Etnik Ayrımcılıǧın Arkasındaki Sosyal Psikolojik Faktörler
AN  - 2451874094
AB  - The present study examines the social psychological factors behind the ethnic discrimination of Kurdish groups in organisations by applying audit studies. The hypotheses derived from Social Identity and Social Dominance theories were tested in two studies. The findings revealed that the employment chances of candidates from the Southeastern province of Turkey where a sizable Kurdish population lives is significantly lower than those from other regions. The finding that decision-makers maintain a high level of social distance from the Kurdish ethnic group when compared to other social groups points to a tendency to discriminate against Kurdish people.Alternate abstract:Bu çalışma, organizasyonlarda Kürt etnik grubuna karşı etnik ayrımcılıǧın ardındaki sosyal psikolojik faktörleri "saklı seçim testleri" (audit studies) kullanarak incelemiştir. Sosyal Kimlik ve Sosyal Baskınlık teorilerinden elde edilen hipotezler iki çalışmada test edilmiştir. Bulgular, kalabalık bir Kürt nüfusun yaşadıǧı Güneydoǧu Anadolu bölgesinden olan adayların istihdam şansının diǧer bölgelerden olan adaylara göre daha düşük olduǧunu ortaya koymuştur. Karar vericilerin, Kürt kökenli adaylara karşı, diǧer etnik gruplarla kıyaslandıǧında, daha yüksek bir sosyal mesafeyi korudukları bulgusu Kürt kökenli bireylere karşı ayrımcılık yapma eǧilimine işaret etmektedir.

T1  - The Use of Partial Least Squares–Path Modelling to Understand the Impact of Ambivalent Sexism on Violence-Justification among Adolescents
AN  - 2423833364
AB  - Gender violence is generally conceived as a phenomenon concerning only adults. Nonetheless, it is also perpetrated within teenagers’ relationships, as many empirical studies have shown. We therefore have focused our attention on a non-probabilistic sample consisting of 400 adolescents living in Naples (Italy), to study the association between sexism and the justification of violent attitudes. Generally, sexism is recognised as a discriminatory attitude towards people, based on their biological sex. However, it is conventional to talk about sexism as a prejudice against women. The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) for adolescents was used to evaluate the two dimensions of ambivalent sexism, i.e., hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS). Moreover, the questionnaire regarding attitudes towards diversity and violence (CADV) was administered to assess participants’ attitudes towards violence. A Partial Least Square–Second Order Path Model reveals that girls’ ambivalent sexism is affected more by benevolent sexism than hostile sexism. On the contrary, among boys, hostile sexism has a higher impact. Finally, benevolent sexist girls justify domestic violence more than boys do.

T1  - Their American Dream
AN  - 2388609718
AB  - Centuries before W.E.B. DuBois named the colorline—i.e., racism—as the problem of the 20th century, skin color stratification was a persistent phenomenon. In 1983 Black feminist, scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winning author Alice Walker termed “colorism” as “prejudicial or preferential treatment of same-race people based solely on their [skin] color”. Using the tools of genealogy, I conducted a critical family history of my parents, Lem and Mae’s, pursuit of their American Dream. Such exploration digs deep to decipher the nexuses of a family’s evolution. Dr. Maya Angelou routinely shared stories about her past to impart the importance of embracing one’s history. For my parents, the American Dream meant opportunity, which included home ownership. Their American Dream began as African Americans in the United States’ Jim Crow south. Lem was a light-skinned man; Mae a dark-complexion woman. They met, married, and bought a small home in segregated Columbia, South Carolina. Bearing the cloak of oppression, my parents joined millions of southern Blacks in the Great Migration relocating to northern cities—my parents landed in Boston, Massachusetts. Throughout their journey, Lem and Mae reached back to their ancestors, and drew from within themselves to improve their circumstances.

T1  - From Insult to Estrangement and Injury: The Violence of Racist Police Jokes: PROD
AN  - 2300927973
AB  - This article examines racially derogatory police jokes, what we call “racist blue humor,” as discourse that negatively targets and ridicules racial and ethnic minorities as inferior, dangerous, or as objects of symbolic and cultural violence. We argue that racist blue humor fosters the social acceptability of prejudice and discrimination among officers, normalizing a culture of dehumanization that legitimizes structural and direct violence. We analyze illustrative cases of racist blue humor in the light of critical race theory, humor studies, and other work in behavioral science to elaborate this violence and its potential for harm across multiple contexts. Racist blue humor engenders legal estrangement, diminishes protection and representation in law, and heightens exposure to police and other state violence. We conclude with considerations for research and policy, including order-maintenance policing of racist blue humor.

T1  - Taste and Organization Studies
AN  - 2301806438
AB  - Using the example of the British fish and chip shop, I explore the socio-historical connections among culture, taste and organizations. Specifically, the British ‘chippie’ illustrates how cultural tastes affect our comprehension of organizations. In examining this occupation in depth, we see how the fish and chip shop reveals the ways class and cultural prejudices affect how an organization is perceived. Considering an organization’s history offers us a glimpse into how organizational tastes are shaped by broader social processes. Additionally, I explore taste and organizations through diverse theoretical lenses. First, the chippie constitutes an organizational example of Pierre Bourdieu’s contrast between taste as luxury and taste as necessity. Second, the work of Hannah Arendt highlights the intersubjective nature of taste, and its connection with judgement. Third, exploring taste with Antoine Hennion’s writings reveals the connection between practices and things. Examining taste through diverse theoretical lenses can thus open up productive lines of inquiry for taste and organizational studies.

T1  - Structural boundaries that effect the representation of gender and disability in works of fiction from the United States and United Kingdom
AN  - 2281591725
AB  - Discussions of intellectual disability are found in medical journals, published biographies, and disability research. However, outside the realm of medicine or personal reminiscence intellectual disability struggles for spaces of social, historical, cultural and imaginative representation. This article addresses these struggles for space and specifically focuses on the imagined space of narrative fiction. Being imagined spaces they should easily be able to accommodate people with disability, and yet, very few characters with intellectual disability are represented or more importantly have agency in narrative fiction. Drawing on work from feminist geographies and literary geographies this article addresses the limiting narrative structures that have been used against fictional characters who have a disability and ways authors may move beyond these limitations. Reconciling feminist geographies and literary geographies allows new critical spatial knowledge around disability to emerge. It is not enough to write characters with disabilities into narrative fiction if the structures surrounding them remain limiting and prejudiced. This article discusses the three main limiting structures in narrative fiction: character representation, narrative voice and genre. Looking at narrative fiction through feminist and literary geographies reveals how these limiting structures function as power hierarchies, and importantly, shows how these imposed structures can be subverted and changed.

T1  - Malthus on social classes: higher, lower and middle
AN  - 2429014702
AB  - Malthus’s views on the relative roles and importance of the social classes—higher, lower and middle—are presented. The view commonly expressed in the secondary literature that he was prejudiced in favour of the upper classes is questioned. The view that he was uncaring or unsympathetic toward the labouring classes is said to lack textual support. It is argued that the economic importance he attributed to the middle classes and to a greater equality in the distribution of property, income and wealth is an essential, although frequently neglected, feature of his political economy.

T1  - Targeted violence perpetrated against women with disability by neighbours and community members
AN  - 2301903917
AB  - This article explores attacks by neighbours and/or members of local communities on women with disability as a form of hate crime and, more specifically, targeted violence. We draw on interviews conducted in 2017 with women with disability living in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia. These women spoke about ongoing experiences of physical, sexual, psychological, emotional and financial violence perpetrated by members of their local communities. They stressed the severity of this violence, the impact on their security and feelings of safety, and barriers to accessing justice. These women faced both disbelief and police indifference after reporting. Their experiences convey how they met with prejudice that casts the lives of people with disability as less worthy, and the effects of a hatred/vulnerability dichotomy that ultimately limits adequate responses. In the absence of a shared understanding of these crimes, disablist norms prevail, exposing women to ongoing violence and limiting access to justice.

T1  - Exposure to Evidence of White Privilege and Perceptions of Hardships Among White UK Residents
AN  - 2218683277
AB  - Research suggests that when confronted with evidence of privileged status White people will act to mitigate this evidence by reporting greater levels of personal hardships. There is little research exploring white privilege, or its consequences, in the UK, despite playing host to a diverse, multi-racial population. In the current study, 148 White individuals participated in an online experiment of the impact of exposure to evidence of White privilege. Individuals exposed to evidence of white privilege reported lower perceived personal privilege and greater personal life hardships, than those in the non-exposure condition. Exposure to hardships and belief in White privilege were independently related to reports of hardships but not when belief in personal privilege was considered. Findings suggest that exposure to evidence of White privilege may result in majority group members over-reporting personal hardship, but this may be lessened where personal privilege can be made salient.

T1  - At their wits’ end? How divorced women cope with workplace harassment in Sri Lanka
AN  - 2289443275
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine how and with what reasons, divorced women respond to harassment they face at work, within a patriarchal culture of stigma and prejudice about divorced women. This inquiry will be performed by integrating stigma-management and identity-management research with research on responding to and coping with harassment.Design/methodology/approachUsing qualitative research methodology, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were carried out with 12 divorced working women.FindingsFindings of the study illuminate the manner in which stigma management interacts with harassment coping/respond mechanisms in dynamic ways, leading to complex response strategies for divorced women, which can be broadly identified as stigma-focused response strategies and harassment-focused response strategies. A strategy typology – consisting of seven major quadrants and nine major strategies therein – is thus provided, explaining how divorced women struggle to maintain their identity and manage stigma while coping with harassment.Practical implicationsThe paper point towards the need for organisations to be mindful of the struggles of stigmatised individuals in coping and responding to harassment, and their distinct situations and experiences in developing and implementing interventions such as training, awareness creation and policies on harassment.Originality/valueWhile research on reaction to harassment is abundant, how divorced women – as a stigmatised and marginalised group of individuals in society – cope with harassment at work is almost non-existent. The present study fills this gap by exploring harassment responses at the nexus of stigma and identity management.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to analyse empirically the racial relations of segregation of the black population in the city of Salvador, Brazil, which built according to a subtle model of the construction of differentiated spaces for the white population and the black population in the city.Design/methodology/approachThe methodology used for the construction of this manuscript was that of the action research, through the insertion of the researcher within the field of study, obtaining observational perceptions of the inhabited place and collecting reports of the research subjects inserted in the field of study.FindingsThe present research obtained as final results the explicit characterisation of a veiled and subtle model of racial segregation imposed on the black population of the city of Salvador, manifesting the clear prejudice of the white population and also a state racism directed to the oppressed black population.Originality/valueThe originality of the research consists in the fact that there is no research modality within Brazil for the analysis of historical apartheid policies. The Brazilian state, in this sense, appears within the current framework of academic research as a clear incentive and propagator of governmental actions that corroborate the maintenance of the exclusionary city system, which separates the black and white population in differentiated social spaces.

T1  - Fiction and Politics of Islamophobia: A Case Study of Greg Hrbek's Not on Fire, but Burning
AN  - 2416861206
AB  - Islamophobia is defined as a closed-minded hatred, fear or prejudice toward Islam and Muslims that result in discrimination, marginalization, and oppression. This phenomenon was strengthened after September 11 marked a watershed in the history of America. In the wake of 9/11, Islamophobia was promulgated in a plethora of textual and visual narratives, including novel. This paper studies Islamophobia in Greg Hrbek's latest novel Not on Fire, But Burning (2015). A close reading of the novel reveals that the novel couples Islam with terrorism and barbarity, and sets forth the Self/Other dichotomy, which is rather cherished in the discourse of Islamophobia. As observed in a long history of Islamophobic rhetoric, Hrbek's novel depicts that certain people, undoubtedly Muslims, are outside the American system of values, ready to catch America off-guard. With the images the work promotes of Islam and its followers, it is argued that Not on Fire, But Burning reinforces Islamophobia and biased frames of reference on Islam and Muslims.

T1  - Negotiating Theory When Doing Practice: A Systematic Review of Qualitative Research on Interventions to Reduce Homophobia
AN  - 2400040059
AB  - We performed a systematic review of qualitative research on interventions to reduce homophobia. Specifically, we conducted a thematic analysis of participant feedback given in 30 qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Participants often described interventions as “eye-opening.” However, they also criticized many interventions for their mismatch with the social, historical, or institutional context in which they were conducted. Some participants rejected the interventions altogether, describing them as offensive or disgusting. We drew three conclusions. First, participants not only were actively making sense of the interventions but also were often aware of philosophical and political tensions (especially liberal vs. queer approaches). Second, participants sometimes used the perceived inadequacy of the intervention for the local context as an argument to resist change. Finally, tensions in participant feedback (eye-opening vs. disgusting) can be read as evidence that reducing homophobia is “dirty work”: such work is both vital for society and despised by many.

T1  - Interrupted Constructions: The Brazilian Health-Industrial Complex in Historical Perspective
AN  - 2234425958
AB  - Officially launched in 2007, Brazil’s health-industrial complex can be seen as an institutional innovation that seeks to overcome social inequality in health care, dependency on foreign technology, and weaknesses in the national innovation and productive structures. An analysis adopting a historical perspective and deploying Celso Furtado’s concept of the marginalization-modernization polarity shows how misarticulated social and economic policies hindered earlier efforts to construct a robust domestic health-pharmaceutical sector. To the extent that this polarity persists, an understanding of the trajectory of this (indeed, any) high-tech sector can be achieved only by considering the social and economic dynamics that continue to shape Brazil’s development. Despite its promise, the rise of the hybrid neodevelopmentalist state has not succeeded in overcoming the marginalization-modernization polarity. Without resolving old inconsistencies between industrial, macroeconomic, and social policies, it has introduced new ones that, as in the past, risk hindering the success of this institutional experiment.Alternate abstract:Lançado oficialmente em 2007, o complexo industrial de saúde brasileiro pode ser visto como inovação institucional que busca suplantar a desigualdade social no tratamento de saúde, a dependência na tecnologia estrangeira, bem como as deficiências na inovação e nas estruturas produtivas nacionais. Uma análise que adota uma perspectiva histórica e utiliza o conceito da polaridade entre marginalização e modernização, concebido por Celso Furtado, demonstra como políticas sociais e econômicas desarticuladas prejudicaram esforços para construir um setor doméstico de saúde robusto. À medida que essa polaridade persiste, uma compreensão da trajetória desse setor de alta tecnologia (e de fato de qualquer setor) pode ser alcançada somente por meio de avaliação das dinâmicas sociais e econômicas que continuam a moldar o desenvolvimento do Brasil. Não obstante as promessas que emanam do estado do neodesenvolvimento híbrido, sua ascensão não logrou o desmantelamento da polaridade marginalização-modernização. Além de não resolver antigas inconsistências entre políticas sociais, macroeconômicas e industriais, introduziu novas inconsistências que, como no passado, ameaçam o êxito desse novo experimento institucional.

T1  - The Discursive Resistance of Men to Gender-equality Interventions: Negotiating “Unjustness” and “Unnecessity” in Swedish Forestry
AN  - 2224306876
AB  - This article adds to the understanding of men’s discursive resistance in relation to gender-equality interventions at work. Using Swedish men forestry professionals as the empirical base, the result shows how discursive resistance were performative acts, part of the construction of the same gender-equality interventions and organizational contexts that they were perceived to describe. In this case, direct opposition to gender equality provided a limited discursive position and sets of logics available in practice. Instead, the possibilities to renegotiate gender-equality interventions as unjust and unnecessary required, we conclude that the industry’s ambition to hire and promote more women was perceived to have led to the use of affirmative action and the disruption of meritocratic principles and that the problems of gender equality were placed in the traditional forestry and among “prejudiced old men,” as oppose to the more “modern” and “women friendly” forestry of today.

T1  - ‘Would it not be better to get someone out workin?’: ‘Safe prejudice’ against Polish workers
AN  - 2171670678
AB  - One recurring criticism of immigrant groups is their alleged failure to be employed and contribute to the host society. Here we examine how speakers mobilise a criticism that has attracted less research attention: that through their economic activity immigrant groups usurp others’ employment entitlements. Discourse analysis of data from seven focus group discussions about pre‐Brexit Polish immigration into the UK, involving 31 UK nationals, shows that participants accomplish exclusionary outcomes in two divergent ways. The first attributes qualities to Polish workers but also makes explicit the consequences of these attributions for UK nationals, rendering speakers’ investment in such claims visible. The second relies on the production of category pairs, within which claims can be made for the category that excludes Polish workers. This use of categories comprises ‘safe prejudice’, a form of prejudice not previously identified but which is less open to challenge than other forms of prejudiced talk.

T1  - Influence of Raters' Attributes on Biases Toward Immigrants
AN  - 2291990755
AB  - Although immigrants offer many benefits for organizations and our society, they continue to experience unfair discrimination, prejudice, and hostility in the employment process. One contributing factor towards the negative perceptions toward immigrants are the raters' attributes (i.e., decision makers in the workplace). These attributes include their demographic background (e.g., age, gender), differences between raters' and immigrants' cultural values, raters' personality, and raters' previous contact with immigrants. In order to understand raters ' biases toward immigrants, we used the social cognition framework (Miller & Brewer, 1984) to explain the reasons for these biases, and offered hypotheses to guide future research on the issue.

T1  - Social dominance orientation and stereotype influence perception of social distance between classes
AN  - 2230835141
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) and stereotypes about out-groups can influence social distance significantly. We tested the effects of these 2 factors on social distance and a probable mediation effect of upper class stereotype with participants from lower class groups of Chinese people in 3 studies (N = 105 in Study 1; N = 102 in Study 2; N = 112 in Study 3). The results in Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that higher SDO and a more positive stereotype elicited less social distance between lower class and upper class members. In Study 3, the mediation effect of stereotype was also significant. These results provide insight into the mechanism of the perceived social distance between social classes, which is meaningful for social harmony in China.

T1  - Racism and the Christian Church in America: Caught between the Knowledge of Good and Evil
AN  - 2201769724
AB  - Those persons with church membership or professing a faith or relationship with God represent a microcosm of society. Therefore, the demons of racism, bigotry, and prejudice found in society at large are found in the church. Despite the very nature of Christianity that calls on Christians to be a countervoice in the world against evil, many have capitulated to various strains of racism in the world and in the Church. Some Christian denominations have begun to explore racism in the church and have developed responses to addressing the issues in the church and in the world. This article examines the historical context of race and religion in the Christian church in the United States, and addresses the current efforts of some Christian denominations to become proactive in the struggle against racism.

T1  - Emotion regulation and prejudice reduction following acute terrorist events: The impact of reflection before and after the Boston Marathon bombings: GPIR
AN  - 2162278596
AB  - Research suggests that regulating negative emotional responses to threatening events can help reduce outgroup bias. The present research examined the effect of emotion regulation strategies on outgroup bias during relatively benign versus threatening time periods. Participants were assigned to regulate their emotions (reflection, rumination, or control) while reading a reminder of a past terrorist event and then reported their anger and bias toward Muslims. The bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon occurred during data collection, which allowed us to examine the effect of emotion regulation on bias before versus after these events via a 3 (emotion regulation) x 2 (timing of bombings) between-subjects design. A two-way interaction between emotion regulation condition and timing emerged on bias and anger. Reflection (compared to rumination or control) reduced bias and anger toward Muslims but only after the bombings. The reduction in anger mediated the effect of reflection on bias only after the bombings. The results provide evidence that reflection is effective at reducing bias when people are experiencing an intense outgroup threat.

T1  - The roots of Bernard Lewis' rage
AN  - 2177043542
AB  - In a review of Bernard Lewis' 1986 book Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice, Richard Wolheim makes the suggestive remark that the subtitle is 'not strictly accurate for the book manifestly and by design gives prejudice priority over conflict' (Richard Wolheim, 'Insult', London Review of Books, 9(6), 1987, available at: https://www.lrb.co.uk/v09/n06/richard-wollheim/insults, accessed 6 September 2018). Wolheim here touches on a principal feature of much of Bernard Lewis' work on Islam and Muslim societies: in Lewis' writings, prejudice has an unmistakable regulative presence. In the late 1970s, particularly after the publication of Edward Said's devastating criticism of orientalism (Orientalism was published 40 years ago this year), pride joined prejudice as a driver of what became Lewis' rage against those who refused to see the history of humanity as a series of inevitable clashes of civilisations. As Lewis steadily lost his academic pre-eminence, pride seems to have turned into resentment, driving Lewis to take up residence among the American neoconservatives.

T1  - Challenges in achieving sustainability in Iberian rural areas and small towns: Exploring immigrant stakeholders’ perceptions in Alentejo, Portugal, and Empordà, Spain
AN  - 2166104475
AB  - There is growing evidence of international immigration becoming increasingly influential in peripheral areas in some Southern European countries. Particularly in small localities, where the maintenance of a significant number of active populations is crucial for social, economic and environmental sustainability, immigration can be of vital importance for local and regional policy-making. This paper presents the perceptions, experiences and concerns of various international immigrant stakeholders in Southwest Europe regarding the main challenges in achieving sustainability. Its focus is on rural areas and small towns in Alentejo Litoral (Southwest Portugal) and Alt Empordà (Catalonia, Northeast Spain), places where foreign immigration is above the national average. Using qualitative methods (semi-structured interviews, literature review and participant observation), the main findings show how immigrant stakeholders’ perceptions of local sustainability are rich, engaged and diverse, including interesting differences between some Northwest European immigrants and less advantaged immigrants, e.g. Northwest European immigrants (i.e. British, Germans, French, Dutch, Belgians) stress environmental challenges for sustainability much more than the rest. Overcoming some native prejudices, immigrants in Alentejo Litoral and Alt Empordà also contribute to local knowledge of the ways to achieve dynamic local societies and economies, as well as conserve natural protected areas and agricultural environments.

T1  - Are people more prejudiced towards groups that are perceived as coherent? A meta‐analysis of the relationship between out‐group entitativity and prejudice
AN  - 2115989388
AB  - A meta‐analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between out‐group entitativity and prejudice. A quantitative analysis of 85 effect sizes from 33 independent samples showed a significant positive relationship between entitativity and prejudice (Fisher's z = .414, 95% CI [0.272, 0.557], p < .0001). Three possible moderators of the relationship between entitativity and prejudice were tested: conceptualization of the entitativity (essence‐based entitativity scale, agency‐based entitativity scale, common entitativity scale), the target of the prejudice, and the measures of prejudice (attitudes, emotions, behaviour towards out‐group). Results demonstrated that out‐group entitativity correlated with prejudice only when entitativity was conceptualized as an essence‐based or common‐based scale, and prejudice was measured as the attitude to the out‐group. The target of prejudice does not moderate the relationship between entitativity and prejudice.

T1  - Multicolored Blindfolds
AN  - 2133339156
AB  - Past studies have found that multicultural approaches to diversity can reduce prejudice and stimulate positive intergroup relations. The current research explored a possible negative side effect of multiculturalism: whether organizational diversity structures geared toward multiculturalism can conceal racial discrimination and delegitimize racial discrimination claims. Three studies found that, even when objective information was indicative of discrimination, both Whites and racial minorities perceived organizations which had diversity policies emphasizing multiculturalism as more fair toward minorities. This perception of (false) fairness led individuals to perceive less racial discrimination and to view claims of racial discrimination against that organization as less legitimate. Furthermore, we found that organizational multiculturalism and externally granted diversity awards both produced a (false) fairness effect. The results suggest an irony of multicultural diversity structures: They can create a false fairness effect that conceals and delegitimizes discrimination.

T1  - Women in Uruguayan Communism: Contradictions and Ambiguities, 1920s–1960s
AN  - 2084800031
AB  - This article examines the dynamics of women's participation in the Communist Party of Uruguay (PCU) from the 1920s to the 1960s. Despite its commitment to women's emancipation and to equality between men and women, the PCU's attitudes towards gender equality were often contradictory and its messages were ambiguous. Though it promoted women's participation, the Party oscillated between seeking to overcome social prejudices, upholding principled and dogmatic positions, and accommodating the conservative habits prevalent among the working class. Women were encouraged to take part in activities but not to assume leadership positions. The 1960s, ironically a period characterised by openness and political success, was a decade of regression in gender equality that stood in contrast to the Uruguayan Communists' long trajectory concerning women's rights.Alternate abstract:Spanish abstractEste artículo examina la dinámica de la participación de mujeres en el Partido Comunista del Uruguay (PCU) desde los años 1920 a los 1960.

T1  - Police perceptions of prejudice: how police awareness training influences the capacity of police to assess prejudiced motivated crime
AN  - 2058172902
AB  - Prejudice motivated crime (PMC) is defined as crimes motivated by bias, prejudice or hatred towards members of particular groups, communities and individuals. To understand how police awareness training facilitates or constrains the capacity of police officers to appropriately classify and respond to PMC, data were collected from a population of Police Recruits (PRs) and Protective Service Officers (PSOs) (N = 1609) to ascertain their perceptions of PMC pre- and post-PMC awareness training. These were used in a logistic regression model to identify factors explaining whether PRs and PSOs would identify a vignette/scenario as a PMC. We found PRs and PSOs were more likely to correctly identify a PMC scenario than a control scenario, but only 61% as likely to identify an incident as PMC post-PMC awareness training after accounting for other variables. We argue that awareness training programmes need to be more aligned to the specific needs of policing in diverse societies.

T1  - Objectification, Sexualization, and Misrepresentation: Social Media and the College Experience
AN  - 2313793045
AB  - Social media use can have major impacts on one’s construction of identity, sexuality, and gender. However, some social media sites exhibit problematic and prejudiced themes through their photo and video posts. This paper examines two Instagram sites specifically targeting traditionally college-aged individuals. These sites have tens of thousands of followers, post frequently, and solely focus on highlighting the college experience. Through a textual analysis of these two sites, problematic themes emerged, including objectification of female college students, submissiveness of female college students, and emphasis on a young white college experience. These themes are detailed and explored, followed by a discussion on their potential impacts on broader societal structures and ideas for education on gendered prejudices in the media.

T1  - The role of threat, emotions, and prejudice in promoting collective action against immigrant groups
AN  - 2047416325
AB  - In two studies we assessed the role of distinctiveness threat, group‐based emotions (angst, fear, and anger), and prejudice on people's willingness to engage in collective action against immigrant groups. In Study 1 (N = 222) White British participants were either informed that in the next 40 years the proportion of immigrants in the UK is unlikely to change (control condition) or that there will be more immigrants than White British people living in Britain (threat condition). We obtained support for a sequential multiple mediator model in which threat predicted British people's willingness to engage in collective action via the emotions first and then prejudice. This finding was replicated in Study 2 with an Italian sample (N = 283). These results enhance understanding of when and why advantaged groups undertake collective action against disadvantaged groups by demonstrating that distinctiveness threats and emotions promote such actions.

T1  - A dual process model of post-colonial ideology
AN  - 2085137785
AB  - We present an integrative model outlining how the threat and competition-based motives identified in the Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice are linked to the context-specific ideologies of historical negation and symbolic exclusion identified by the Dark Duo Model of post-colonial ideology. Using nationally representative data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (N = 12,586), we found reasonable support for the integrative model. Social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism were each independently and positively associated with historical negation and symbolic exclusion. These post-colonial ideologies in turn were associated with greater resource-specific policy opposition, and mediated associations between social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism with policy attitudes. The results show that broader ideological motives that maintain inequalities may also act as antecedents to culturally specific ideologies which provide more effective, context-specific means to legitimise inequalities faced by Indigenous groups.

T1  - Reinforcing Sexism and Misogyny: Social Media, Symbolic Violence and the Construction of Femininity-as-Fail
AN  - 2057939820
AB  - This paper demonstrates, through content analysis, how online audiences can enforce gender based violence (GBV) as a real threat in the online space through verbally aggressive speech acts that function as symbolic violence. I examine cases emerging out of the context of Trinidad and Tobago, to articulate, how, for example, prejudicial chastising of women is used as a discourse to not only shame and blame but construct femininity-as-fail, however that femininity is embodied. This symbolic violence I read as a spectre, a force that enforces, both in the offline and online, the reassertion of strict respectability and responsibility as standard. This is done through victim blaming and policing, especially of women's bodies, voice and agency. I assert that such talk constitutes an online environment that serves as fertile ground for the reconstitution of traditional and limiting notions of femininity. Such an environment also facilitates constant backlash against feminist discourses and feminist activism to attain gender justice in the Caribbean region. The online environment is a force that breaches offline boundaries across the globe, thus its effect must be accounted for as we attempt to build the resilience of feminist consciousness and gender justice.

T1  - The Process of the Universalization of Holocaust Education: Problems and Challenges
AN  - 2019980026
AB  - This article discusses the process of the universalization of Holocaust education and sets its conceptual and educational framework, highlighting its pedagogical challenges and hazards. It explores the phenomenon of the universalization of Holocaust education as a means to combat racism and to analyze how a particularistic educational issue has become the subject of global, universalistic concern. Through reviewing current literature, it argues that the complexity of this approach needs to be considered, particularly with the increasing violence and xenophobia in the world. Drawing on the paradigm of the Holocaust, this universal approach to anti-racist education to promote peace and harmony globally within civil society has been promoted as a way of countering prejudice. However, there are pitfalls to seeking universal lessons from a particularistic event. These challenges can be addressed to advance anti-racist education using the Holocaust as a case study and thus developing a reflective culture of remembrance.

T1  - Interventions Highlighting Hypocrisy Reduce Collective Blame of Muslims for Individual Acts of Violence and Assuage Anti-Muslim Hostility
AN  - 1999028580
AB  - Collectively blaming groups for the actions of individuals can license vicarious retribution. Acts of terrorism by Muslim extremists against innocents, and the spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes against innocent Muslims that follow, suggest that reciprocal bouts of collective blame can spark cycles of violence. How can this cycle be short-circuited? After establishing a link between collective blame of Muslims and anti-Muslim attitudes and behavior, we used an “interventions tournament” to identify a successful intervention (among many that failed). The “winning” intervention reduced collective blame of Muslims by highlighting hypocrisy in the ways individuals collectively blame Muslims—but not other groups (White Americans, Christians)—for individual group members’ actions. After replicating the effect in an independent sample, we demonstrate that a novel interactive activity that isolates the psychological mechanism amplifies the effectiveness of the collective blame hypocrisy intervention and results in downstream reductions in anti-Muslim attitudes and anti-Muslim behavior.

T1  - Tweeting back while shouting back: Social media and feminist activism
AN  - 1999858886
AB  - Shouting back’ or responding using a hashtag in digital spaces is a way of exposing the prejudice faced by people on a daily basis, while sharing and reacting to it, and provoking responses; social networking sites (SNSs) provide a visible platform for feminists to address experiences relating to sexism and misogyny. Guillard (2016, p. 1) argues that digital spaces are central to defining ‘a fourth wave of feminist practice’ and allow for global engagement, yet the use of digital media can be tokenistic (Kristofferson, White, & Peloza, 2014) and use of the Internet is insufficient to demarcate a new wave of practice. As feminist academics (Braun, 2011) writing from the United Kingdom, who have engaged with social media for a number of years, we seek to explore some of the issues related to social media-based feminist campaigns and examine the process of ‘shouting back’ against hegemony, misogyny and sexism. Digital spaces are a powerful influence on social movements (Earl & Kimport, 2011), and we consider some of the ways in which social media has contributed to the feminist movement.

T1  - Individual differences in the propensity to make attributions to prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 1989314758
AB  - Whether racism is perceived in ambiguous situations may depend on individual differences in perceivers’ beliefs about the prevalence of racial prejudice and discrimination, trivialization of targets’ concerns, and vigilance and confidence in recognizing instances of racial prejudice. In Studies 1 and 2, we develop a psychometrically sound measure of these beliefs, the Propensity to Make Attributions to Prejudice Scale (PMAPS), and provide evidence that the PMAPS is related to individual differences in the justification and suppression of prejudice. Studies 3 and 5 provide evidence that the PMAPS predicts attributions to prejudice in a variety of situations. Theoretically consistent racial and gender differences in the PMAPS were found in a large sample (Study 4). Together, these data provide evidence supporting the reliability and validity of the PMAPS and provide insights about the role that beliefs and expectations play in third-party observers’ judgments about expressions of prejudice.

T1  - Rhetoric and Etiological Beliefs About Sexuality: Reader Responses to Cynthia Nixon's New York Times Interview
AN  - 2002462532
AB  - In 2012, the U.S. actress Cynthia Nixon was quoted in the New York Times Magazine as having stated that "for me, it [being gay] is a choice. I understand that for many people it's not, but for me it's a choice, and you don't get to define my gayness for me." The interview attracted international media attention and public criticism by lesbian and gay activists. This article suggests a rhetorical approach to understanding etiological beliefs and provides a discursive analysis of 198 online comments by readers of Pink News, a gay news Web site that reported on Nixon's controversial interview. This article explores common arguments used in readers' comments about Nixon and examines the rhetorical construction of sexuality. The analysis examines three themes within the data. First, biological essentialism was treated by many readers as common knowledge; second, readers suggested that only bisexuals have "choice"; and, third, it was suggested by both Nixon's critics and her supporters that counterarguments colluded with homophobia. The article suggests that there is an ideological dilemma whereby both "born-this-way" and "choice" arguments can be understood as colluding with anti-gay prejudice.

T1  - Academic Value of Bilingual Education: Factors in Learning on Culture and Language
AN  - 1980705702
AB  - Bilingual education influences the academic achievement of students in a positive way. Building bridges between two languages in education benefits students by developing confidence and fluency in using written and oral second language for academic accomplishment and for daily communication. The purpose of this study is to investigate how a bilingual education program effects the minority groups’ academic achievements. An explanatory sequential mixed method was used for this study. Triangulation was used in both the quantitative and qualitative parts of the study to minimize prejudice and enhance honesty regarding the social phenomenon studied. Both the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed to examine the parameters to reveal academic achievements within a bilingual education context. For quantitative data collection, 140 participants responded the survey questions. For qualitative data collection, 12 participants were interviewed. Results indicated that bilingual education would help build stronger relationships between different ethnic groups and have a positive effect on all the academic achievement of minority students. Academic achievement is vital for minority people because, if they are not going to be educated or attend a university, they might be unable find a job and be involved in the community.

T1  - Positioning young refugees in Australia: media discourse and social exclusion
AN  - 1952104036
AB  - The aim of this article was to examine how media attention affects the social exclusion of young refugees negotiating their way towards settlement in Australia. Emerging stereotypes and prejudices against young male refugees require new ways of understanding the impact of global, national and local issues on their social exclusion. The article brings together the impact of (a) the global politicisation and backlash against refugees, (b) Australians negative perception of refugees and (c) the increased reporting of young African-Australian and Pasifika-Australians as the perpetrators of youth violence. The article recognises the overlapping dimensions of social exclusion for young refugees and considers their 'spatial', 'relational' and 'socio-political' exclusion. The examination of media reporting of a landmark legal case of discrimination and racial profiling reveals a discourse of media attention that has perpetuated the social exclusion of a group of young African-Australian refugees living on a Melbourne public housing estate. The sensationalist and prejudicial media connection of the landmark legal case, youth violence and young African-Australians living on the Flemington Estate demonstrates the challenges young male refugees face in negotiating their settlement in Australia. This article makes a contribution to understanding the multi-dimensional nature of youth exclusion in contemporary times.

T1  - Phenomenological social research: some observations from the field
AN  - 1961370229
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to undertake a phenomenological study of the working conditions and living standards of private security guards (private police) in New Delhi. The focus here is to bring forth their lived experiences as security guards. Design/methodology/approach The paper touches briefly upon the theoretical formulations on phenomenological sociology. The principal emphasis here is on the field application of phenomenology as a methodology of social inquiry - how phenomenology was put to use, the research problems encountered and how these research conundrums were navigated. The research makes use of interview as the technique of data collection. The study uses purposive and convenience sampling. Findings The research has tried to bring forth the lived experiences of the private security guards as regards to their job and living conditions, by "bracketing off" the author's biases to the best of the author's capacity. From the interview responses, some higher level concepts have been formulated, called the "essence" of lived experiences. Research limitations/implications As the sample size is small, the research cannot be considered a peremptory account of the "lived experiences" applicable to all the private security guards in Delhi. Such sweeping generalizations need to be avoided. Practical implications Besides highlighting the lived experiences of the private security guards, the larger purpose of this paper to solicit critical comments from the readers so that the field application of phenomenology could be better understood and refined further. Originality/value This is an original research work carried out by the author. During the fieldwork, "reflexivity" has been the author's constant companion, where the author has tried best to keep the author's prejudices at bay. Its value is twofold: first, as phenomenological research works on private security guards are few in India, this study can stimulate further research works in this field and second, the research can carry forward the debate on how to improve further phenomenological research works.

T1  - Is the racial composition of your surroundings associated with your levels of social dominance orientation?
AN  - 1953157466
AB  - We investigate the extent to which minority group members are surrounded by outgroup members in their immediate environment as a predictor of social dominance orientation. Using a large representative sample of New Zealanders, we found that minority group members in outgroup dense environments reported lower levels of social dominance orientation (Study 1). In studies 2 and 3, Asian Australian and Black American participants who were surrounded by outgroup members reported lower social dominance orientation. For majority group (White) participants there was no association between social dominance orientation and outgroup density. Study 4 explained the overall pattern: Black Americans surrounded by outgroup members perceived their group to be of lower status in their immediate environment, and through this, reported lower social dominance orientation. This article adds to growing literature on contextual factors that predict social dominance orientation, especially among minority group members.

T1  - Threat and Prejudice against Syrian Refugees in Canada: Assessing the Moderating Effects of Multiculturalism, Interculturalism, and Assimilation
AN  - 1966856374
AB  - A survey experiment (N = 529) was used to test the moderating effects of intergroup ideologies (assimilation, multiculturalism, and interculturalism) on the relationship between social dominance orientation (SDO) and expressions of prejudice under conditions of intergroup threat. Moderated multiple regression analyses suggest a multicultural integration frame moderates the relationship between SDO and feelings toward Syrian refugees in Canada when the target outgroup is portrayed as a source of intergroup threat. This moderating effect was unique to the relationship between SDO and feelings toward Syrians and did not extend to other correlates of prejudice including beliefs in zero-sum group competition or a multicultural ideology, nor did it extend to more general measures of prejudice (i.e., attitudes toward immigrants or evaluations of intercultural contact). Findings suggest the prejudice-reducing effects of a multicultural integration narrative affect group evaluations and functions by targeting beliefs in social dominance, rather than zero-sum group competition or ideological support for cultural diversity. The results offer insights into the prejudice-reducing potential for two alternative integration narratives that are institutionalized in Canada.

T1  - Contact, Perceptions of Threat, and Assessment of Migration Policies in Malta
AN  - 1964457242
AB  - Numerous studies examine the effectiveness of the contact hypothesis in resolving conflict. While ample research has been conducted regarding the prevalence of xenophobia with the rise of the refugee crisis worldwide and increasing perceptions of threat towards immigrants, little has been written on relationships between contact and assessment of immigration policies. This study explores the impact of different forms of contact between the Maltese and the Sub-Saharan African migrants in Malta on perceptions of threat and immigration policies. More specifically, this study asks what are relationships between forms of contact, perceptions of threat, and assessment of migration policies and institutions. The authors posit that perception of threat arrives from different patterns of interaction between the number of immigrants and type of contacts. They also explore the impact of the form of contact and level of threat on general support for migration policies and analyze how different types of threat affect support for particular policies. The study compares the intergroup contact in two localities of Balzan and Marsa that are both home to Open Centers for migrants.

T1  - Trump and Latin America: continuity and change
AN  - 1937790418
AB  - The election of Donald Trump to the US presidency came as a shock to progressive governments and social movements south of the Rio Grande, particularly as it took place in the wake of a number of successes by conservative forces in the region, and at a time when there had already been a substantial strengthening of US efforts to reassert its hegemony: US-backed destabilisation plans had by then started to pay substantial dividends in a series of countries that had not long before been widely regarded as having broken from the Washington Consensus as part of an unstoppable Latin American dynamic. Trump's initial support for isolationism has been considerably modified since he took office, but it is ideologically linked to an 'America First' rhetoric that has been deeply problematic. It panders to the worst racist prejudices against Latinos in the US, and has meant not only support for the building of the wall along the Mexican border, but a worrying introduction of military language with regards to 'enemy' governments down South.

T1  - The side effect of egalitarian norms: Reactive group distinctiveness, biological essentialism, and sexual prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 1928328440
AB  - In the context of sexual prejudice, in which group distinctiveness motivation is particularly strong for men, three studies tested the hypothesis that egalitarian norms can intensify reactive distinctiveness motives, and then paradoxically increase intergroup differentiation and prejudice. Depending on the studies, the egalitarian norm was experimentally manipulated or induced and kept constant. Group distinctiveness was manipulated through scientific support for the theory that a person's sexual orientation is determined by biological factors in terms of the extant biological differences (high distinctiveness) versus biological similarities (low distinctiveness) between heterosexual and gay people. Egalitarian norms increased men's (but not women's) intergroup differentiation (Study 1) and prejudice (Study 2) when group distinctiveness was low (as compared to high). This pattern was specific to men with high gender self-esteem, and appeared when the biological theory was framed in terms of intergroup differences rather than the uncontrollability of sexual orientation (Study 3).

T1  - Putting the brakes on prejudice rebound effects: An ironic effect of disparagement humor
AN  - 1900995077
AB  - When people high in prejudice censor prejudice in one setting, they can experience a prejudice rebound effect-subsequently responding with more prejudice than otherwise. Disparagement humor fosters the release rather than suppression of prejudice. Thus, two experiments tested the hypothesis that exposure to disparagement humor attenuates rebound effects. Participants suppressed prejudice by writing fewer anti-gay thoughts about same-sex adoption (Experiment 1) or by reporting greater support for same-sex civil rights (Experiment 2) when expecting to share their responses with others (non-prejudice norm condition) but not if others first exchanged anti-gay jokes (prejudice norm condition). High-prejudice participants then exhibited prejudice rebound in the non-prejudice norm condition only. They rated a gay man more stereotypically (Experiment 1) and allocated greater budget cuts to a gay student organization (Experiment 2) in the non-prejudice norm condition.

T1  - Healthism and Weight-Based Discrimination: The Unintended Consequences of Health Promotion in the Workplace
AN  - 1888375699
AB  - Health promotion programs have become increasingly common in U.S. workplaces, yet little research has examined the unintended and potentially negative consequences of these initiatives. Overweight and obese employees face widespread prejudice and pervasive discrimination in employment settings, and this study investigates whether workplace health promotion may lead to more negative outcomes for these workers. Using an experimental design, the author finds that overweight and obese employees are rated more negatively and receive lower hiring recommendations when evaluated for companies with health promotion programs. These findings suggest that health promotion increases the salience and perceived legitimacy of negative fat stereotypes that facilitate weight-based discrimination.

AB  - Present study was designed to develop a perceived discrimination questionnaire. To address the theme of perceived discrimination, an open ended interview was conducted on 30 subjects (15 OBC, 15 SC/ST). Initially a questionnaire was developed on the basis of these themes. And again, questionnaire was administered 120 subjects (40 Gen, 40 OBC and 40 SC/ST). Questionnaire has good psychometric properties. Findings of obtained data reveal that SC/ST categories members are victim of perceived discrimination. Other backward category manifested lower perceived discrimination but not equal to general category. Results support the evidence of social identity theory.

T1  - Threat as justification of prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 1854785525
AB  - When people feel prejudice toward a group, they can justify their prejudice by perceiving the group as threatening. Three experiments tested the hypothesis that prejudice causes threat perception, using affective conditioning to create new prejudice toward unfamiliar groups. The experimentally created prejudice increased threat perception (Experiments 1-3), except when threat information was inconsistent with conditioned affect (Experiment 3). Consistency of affect and threat information is necessary in order for threat to be a plausible justification of prejudice. Mere prejudice can cause perception of threat in the absence of information about the group; this finding suggests threats are not necessarily inherent to the characteristics of the group. Threat perception can be used as a way to explain the experience of prejudice, rather than forming the source of the prejudice itself.

T1  - Global identification predicts gay–male identity integration and well‐being among Turkish gay men
AN  - 2067639513
AB  - In most parts of the world, hegemonic masculinity requires men to endorse traditional masculine ideals, one of which is rejection of homosexuality. Wherever hegemonic masculinity favours heterosexuality over homosexuality, gay males may feel under pressure to negotiate their conflicting male gender and gay sexual identities to maintain positive self‐perceptions. However, globalization, as a source of intercultural interaction, might provide a beneficial context for people wishing to create alternative masculinities in the face of hegemonic masculinity. Hence, we tested if global identification would predict higher levels of gay–male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well‐being, via alternative masculinity representations for gay and male identities. A community sample of 219 gay and bisexual men from Turkey completed the study. Structural equation modelling revealed that global identification positively predicted gay–male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well‐being; however, alternative masculinity representations did not mediate this relationship. Our findings illustrate how identity categories in different domains can intersect and affect each other in complex ways. Moreover, we discuss mental health and well‐being implications for gay men living in cultures where they experience high levels of prejudice and stigma.

T1  - Investigating the Evolution of Ingroup Favoritism Using a Minimal Group Interaction Paradigm: The Effects of Inter- and Intragroup Interdependence
AN  - 1841158089
AB  - We investigated the effect of structural interdependencies between groups (especially inequality), and interdependencies between individuals on ingroup favoritism in minimal group situations. Previous research has attempted to determine whether ingroup favoritism is produced by categorization or intragroup interdependencies (reciprocation expectations), but recent literature suggests that it is not possible to tease these influences apart. We report two studies that investigate how ingroup favoritism evolves over time in social interaction. The levels of ingroup favoritism were affected by categorization and inequality, and the level of ingroup favoritism changed over time, increasing or decreasing depending on the nature of the initial intergroup structure. We conclude by providing two explanations for this change: emergent norms, and changes to the intergroup situation produced by interaction. Our experiments confirm the value of studying the evolution of minimal group behavior, especially for explaining why low status groups act to preserve intergroup inequalities.

T1  - When principled deviance becomes moral threat: Testing alternative mechanisms for the rejection of moral rebels: GPIR
AN  - 1853502111
AB  - Monin, Sawyer, and Marquez (2008) demonstrated that a rebel who refused to participate in a racially prejudiced decision task was derogated by actors who had themselves taken part in the task, but exalted by uninvolved observers. These authors argued that this rejection resulted from actors who expected and resented imagined moral reproach from the rebel. Two new studies address alternative explanations for such rejection of moral rebels. Study 1 rules out both (a) self-presentation and (b) a more cognitive alternative wherein anchoring on one's first impression of a task leads to do-gooder derogation. Study 2 breaks down the principled rebellion into its two components, a principled stance and rebellion itself, to show that both seem to play a part in derogation. Individuals imagine that moral others would reject them, which in turn leads to rejecting those deviants.

T1  - The Impact of Unpunished Hate Crimes: When Derogating the Victim Extends into Derogating the Group
AN  - 1812607487
AB  - Just world research has shown that observers derogate victims more for their misfortunes if the perpetrator is not harshly punished (Lerner in J Personal Soc Psychol 1(4):355-360, 1980 ). However, few studies have investigated minority group derogation as a just world preservation strategy after instances of intergroup harm-doing. This study is among the first to demonstrate the derogation of both individual victims and of the victim's minority group experimentally, using the context of a racist hate crime in Australia. In the present experiment, participants (N = 110) read a news article describing a hate crime against an Aboriginal Australian teenager and were informed that the perpetrator was harshly or leniently punished (secure vs. justice threat condition). Our results show that in the justice threat condition, participants not only derogated the individual Aboriginal Australian victim more after his death, they also expressed greater racism toward the victim's group. An indirect effect of the justice threat condition on modern racism via individual victim derogation was observed, along with moderating effects of individual differences in belief in a just world. These findings provide support for the alarming hypothesis that racist hate crimes are not only the manifestation of a racist society, but may also bolster racial prejudices if leniently treated. The results highlight the important role of political and judicial authorities, whose response or non-response to a hate crime can exacerbate or ameliorate existing prejudices.

T1  - Social Groups Prioritize Selective Attention to Faces: How Social Identity Shapes Distractor Interference
AN  - 1813899460
AB  - Human faces automatically attract visual attention and this process appears to be guided by social group memberships. In two experiments, we examined how social groups guide selective attention toward in-group and out-group faces. Black and White participants detected a target letter among letter strings superimposed on faces (Experiment 1). White participants were less accurate on trials with racial out-group (Black) compared to in-group (White) distractor faces. Likewise, Black participants were less accurate on trials with racial out-group (White) compared to in-group (Black) distractor faces. However, this pattern of out-group bias was only evident under high perceptual load—when the task was visually difficult. To examine the malleability of this pattern of racial bias, a separate sample of participants were assigned to mixed-race minimal groups (Experiment 2). Participants assigned to groups were less accurate on trials with their minimal in-group members compared to minimal out-group distractor faces, regardless of race. Again, this pattern of out-group bias was only evident under high perceptual load. Taken together, these results suggest that social identity guides selective attention toward motivationally relevant social groups—shifting from out-group bias in the domain of race to in-group bias in the domain of minimal groups—when perceptual resources are scarce.

T1  - Racialization of Subaltern Populations Across the Globe: the Politics of Difference
AN  - 1795747424
AB  - Issue Title: African Americans, Dalits and Tribals: A Comparative Analysis of Subaltern communities in India and the U.S.A The politics of difference - also named race or racism in various critical discourses - is the focus of this essay. The charge of being deviant, uncultured, "illegal" and out of place is leveled in a variety of ways, by those who claim the status of natural belonging, against subordinated and marginalized groups - from immigrants recently arrived in a place, to ancient inhabitants driven away from their lands and property and opportunities. The issue is not one of race but of racism, or what I describe as the deployment of difference. Whether grounded in genetic or biological condition, as it was in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or described more euphemistically as very deeply rooted (even if its sources supposedly lie in "history" and "culture"), the proposition commonly is that the difference at hand is not really bridgeable - at least in the foreseeable future. The deployment of such arguments of radical, incommensurable difference very often marks a shifting of weight from a barely acknowledged to a much more palpable prejudice and discrimination. A disdainful tolerance of groups that were generally ignored, that counted for little and sometimes remained literally uncounted, gives way to an increased marking and targeting of otherised communities.

T1  - Wealth Inequality Among Immigrants: Consistent Racial/Ethnic Inequality in the United States
AN  - 1777281812
AB  - Wealth is a strong indicator of immigrant integration in U.S. society. Drawing on new assimilation theory, we highlight the importance of racial/ethnic group boundaries and propose different paths of wealth integration among U.S. immigrants. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and quantile regression, we show that race/ethnicity shapes immigrant wealth inequality across the entire distribution of net worth, along with immigrants' U.S. experience, such as immigrant status, U.S. education, English language proficiency, and time spent in the United States. Our results document consistent racial/ethnic inequality among immigrants, also evidenced among the U.S. born, revealing that even when accounting for key aspects of U.S. experience, wealth inequality with whites for Latino and black immigrants is strong.

T1  - Attitudes towards Roma people and migrants: a comparison through a Bayesian multidimensional IRT model
AN  - 1764076363
AB  - In the context of social psychological research on relations between cultural defined groups, the main topics of interest include ethnic prejudice, attitudes and stereotypes. In the present study, in order to measure and compare attitudes towards Roma people and migrants and to investigate how these attitudes vary according to individual characteristics, we develop an integrated model which embeds a multidimensional Item Response Theory model for polytomous data into a structural equation formulation. Item and person parameters and structural coefficients are estimated on data collected through a web survey. Full probabilistic inference is performed by applying Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.

T1  - Poverty, social exclusion and the denial of rights to a fair hearing: a case study of employment disputes
AN  - 1947384658
AB  - Drawing on data from a research study of workers who sought justice following a dispute at work, this paper examines exclusion from systems of justice as a crucial element in understandings of poverty and social exclusion. We focus on the stories of those who attempt to use the employment tribunal system, which illustrate the multiple barriers to justice experienced by these workers. Arguing that the employment tribunal system provides a crucial forum independent from the workplace which can put a brake on prejudicial and arbitrary actions by employers, we conclude with suggestions for reform.

T1  - When the media meet: Problems and promises of EU-China dialogue in the journalistic sphere: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1781818143
AB  - This paper argues that lack of interpersonal interaction between media professionals in Europe and China partly accounts for continued misperceptions and gaps in understanding between both the nations. Investing into people-to-people dialogue is essential for journalists to overcome prejudice and to improve mutual knowledge. Days during which journalists are immersed into another country's culture and media scene have great potential to induce changes in perceptions, both at the individual and societal level. This can be attributed to the built-in multiplier effect of media publications reaching wide audiences. Drawing on the "Europe-China Media Exchange " set up, developed by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the article presents achievements (but also lessons) learnt from interpersonal exchange programs developed for European and Chinese journalists.

T1  - Obstacles to socioeconomic integration of highly-skilled immigrant women
AN  - 2084926719
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of obstacles to socioeconomic integration faced by highly-skilled immigrant women (HSIW) to Quebec, followed by a discussion of Quebec’s socio-political context and interculturalism, in an effort to better situate these obstacles. With these in mind, implications for diversity management are discussed. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is largely based on a review of the immigrant integration, interculturalism and diversity management literatures pertaining to the socioeconomic integration of highly-skilled immigrants. It focusses on the socioeconomic integration of HSIW in the Quebec context. Findings – The authors find that researchers should continue to examine aspects of the social and political contexts in which immigrant integration and diversity management take place when conducting studies in these areas. The authors also encourage continued research pertaining to specific groups, as these may bring to light-specific dynamics that can lead to exclusion. Practical implications – This paper includes implications for diversity management in organizations seeking to foster inclusive practices with regards to ethnic minorities and immigrants in general, and HSIW in particular. Originality/value – The paper sheds new light on immigrant integration and diversity management in Quebec by bridging the gap between three areas of study that are interconnected but seldom discussed together: socioeconomic integration of immigrants, interculturalism and diversity management in organizations.

T1  - AUSTRALIAN ATTITUDES TOWARD ASYLUM SEEKERS: ROLES OF DEHUMANIZATION AND SOCIAL DOMINANCE THEORY
AN  - 1746922434
AB  - We employed a theoretical model of dehumanization to identify the factors influencing attitudes toward asylum seekers within an Australian context. Specifically, we hypothesized that Australians high in social dominance orientation (SDO) would be more likely than those low in SDO to dehumanize asylum seekers. Participants (N = 311) completed an online survey designed to assess SDO, their attitudes and emotions toward asylum seekers, and their tendency to engage in dehumanization. Results indicated that the model can be successfully applied to an Australian context and that dehumanization played a significant role in influencing our participants' attitudes toward asylum seekers. Findings are discussed in terms of future research as well as policy implications for Australian immigration issues.

T1  - Not for Doctors Only: Ageism in Healthcare
AN  - 1750054853
AB  - Dr Robert N. Butler coined the term ageism in 1968 and spent his career trying to eradicate it. Unfortunately, despite his many accomplishments, systematic stereotyping and discrimination against people because they are old still occurs today. The healthcare community is not immune to the deleterious effects of ageism. It permeates the attitudes of medical providers, the mindset of older patients, and the structure of the healthcare system, having a potentially profound influence on the type and amount of care offered, requested, and received. Ageism among healthcare providers can be explicit or implicit. The geriatrician and writer Dr Louise Aronson describes a disturbing example of explicit ageism in which a surgeon asks the medical student observing his case what specialty she is thinking of pursuing. While ageism unfortunately still exists among the attitudes of health providers, older adults and the healthcare system itself, there are numerous interventions underway that should begin to mitigate it.

T1  - Ageism In Action? Ageism Inaction!
AN  - 1750054775
AB  - During the 1984 presidential debates, 73-year-old Ronald Reagan was asked whether he was too old to serve-to which he famously replied, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience." Though his response elicited a laugh from his opponent, both the question and the answer were examples of ageism in action. Sadly, not much has changed over the past thirty-one years, as Hillary Clinton (who will be 69 on Election Day 2016), has already been challenged with the same question-numerous times. Google "Is Hillary Clinton too old to be president?" and you'll find 110 billion references- and the election is still more than a year away. In 1968, Dr. Robert Butler, founding director of the National Institute on Aging, coined the term "ageism," four years after free speech activist Jack Weinberg first uttered the phrase, "Never trust anyone over 30." Yet, forty-seven years later, the FrameWorks Institute's report, Gauging Aging: Mapping the Gaps Between Expert and Public Understandings of Aging in America (Lindland et al., 2015), reveals that the notion of ageism doesn't even register on the public's radar-and this at a time when the subject of aging so dominates our public discourse..

T1  - How I Became an Old Person in Training
AN  - 1750054630
AB  - Aging is life itself. That's what makes it so damn interesting. But you wouldn't know it from all the hand-wringing on the part of most Americans when it comes to the prospect. Hey, it beats the alternative, people mutter reflexively. What does that saying actually mean? The only thing worse than being old is being dead. These men and women had endured plenty of loss and had all kinds of health problems, but they weren't depressed. They weren't afraid of dying. They were engaged and content. And they were typical of the fastest growing cohort of older Americans. Suppose they could see these hurtful stereotypes for what they are -- not to mention the external policies and procedures that put the ism after age. If people could step off the treadmill of age denial and begin to see how ageism segregates and diminishes their prospects. If they could catch our breath, then start challenging the discriminatory structures and erroneous beliefs that attempt to shape their aging.

T1  - Embodied prejudices: a study on diversity and practices
AN  - 2084926027
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyze organizational diversity with a focus on the concept of socially sustained practices, grounding the analyses in a practice-based approach. Design/methodology/approach – Based on data from ethnographic research, the author seeks to explain how the body and embodied marks that indicate an unequal distribution of power in society interfere with access to knowledge and in the organization of work. Findings – Data analyses suggest that embodied prejudices affect the division of labor and access to knowledge in organizational settings, contributing to perpetuating cultural and historical structures of domination that spark conscious attempts to manage race and gender diversity. Originality/value – Little research has investigated diversity from a practice-based standpoint. The originality of this paper is in its adoption of a phenomenological perspective to explain the experience of diversity as an ongoing bodily and embodied process.

T1  - Independent or ungrateful? Consequences of confronting patronizing help for people with disabilities: GPIR
AN  - 1933571156
AB  - People with disabilities routinely face a dilemma in dealing with patronizing help: While accepting unsolicited assistance may be harmful for its recipients, confronting the helper can lead to negative interpersonal repercussions. Across two studies, participants were presented with a scenario depicting an interaction between a blind target and a sighted pedestrian and asked to evaluate the behaviors of the characters involved. Study 1 showed that, whereas blind participants considered both patronizing and hostile treatment as inappropriate responses to the blind target's request for information, sighted participants saw patronizing help as significantly more appropriate than openly hostile treatment. Study 2 further demonstrated that, among sighted participants, blind targets were viewed as less warm and more rude when confronting benevolent versus hostile discrimination. These findings highlighted the difficulty of confronting patronizing treatment and have important implications for people with disabilities as well as other patronized minorities more generally.

T1  - What Determines Religious and Racial Prejudice in Europe? The Effects of Religiosity and Trust
AN  - 1668323177
AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of different dimensions of religiosity and trust on religious and racial prejudice in Europe. The sample is based on 37 European countries that are current or potential members of the European Union (EU). Using multi-level logistic regression modeling and the latest wave from the European Values Study data, we test the effects of both individual and country-level variables. Our results suggest that religious particularism is correlated with more religious and racial prejudice. Doctrinal belief and individual spirituality are both correlated with less religious prejudice only. Nonreligious individuals have the highest religious prejudice compared to members of religious denominations. Individual and country-level generalized trust, as well as trust in the EU, are all negatively correlated with religious and racial prejudice.

T1  - The Social Media Political Subject Is an Infant
AN  - 2343062754
AB  - Any random sampling of a Facebook timeline or Twitter feed, to take the obvious examples, provides a prepackaged view of global politics. It is restrictive because we choose it to reflect our own pet subjects, groups, likes, and world interests. The lens is prejudiced to reflect our race, class, gender, sexuality, ideology, and affective positionality. We enter a social media world as many as 10 or 50 times a day that has ourselves as the center of the universe. This communication world is similar to an infant’s world: Someone else decides what we can see, what we can consume, what is that extra treat we can earn, if we are good: in social media terms, if we pay for it by reputational capital, or simply, if we spend enough money.

T1  - Relation between medical sociology and sociology of ageing or later life. A new challenges, social expectations and dilemmas
AN  - 2406884150
AB  - Medical sociology has not paid special attention to observed demographic changes associated with the “greying of societies”. Lack of interest in ageing has resulted in the necessity to develop a new subdiscipline - sociology of aging. The evolution of this subdiscipline has been described in relation to social gerontology. Theories of aging (healthy, successful) have been presented in relation to new changes. Dilemmas and intractable problems focus on prejudices concerning the older persons, gender-related differences in the quality of life in older age, elderly abuse, and quality of life in mentally ill old people as well as other issues.

T1  - Homophobic bullying: evidence-based suggestions for intervention programmes
AN  - 2117399958
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of the basic factors of age and gender in homophobic bullying behaviour, in order that recommendations for the design of anti-bullying programmes specific to homophobic bullying could be made. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 475 fifth year students (ca. 16-17 years old) and 561-second year students (ca. 13-14 years old) at six secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland completed an English-language translation of a questionnaire previously used in a Norwegian study of sexual orientation and bullying behaviour (Roland and Auestad, 2009). Findings – No evidence of “age-related declines” were found in reports of either bullying or homophobic bullying. Males were significantly more likely than females to report involvement (as both perpetrators and targets) in both bullying and homophobic bullying. Practical implications – It was concluded that senior secondary school students, as well as their younger counterparts, should be involved in anti-bullying interventions; that males should be especially focused upon; and that programmes specific to anti-homophobic bullying, potentially targeting pre-adolescent students, should be supported. Originality/value – This paper suggests evidence-based priorities for intervention programmes specific to homophobic bullying, accounts of which have been, to date, absent in the research literature.

T1  - Gender Neutrality and the Pakistani Bureaucracy
AN  - 1553397610
AB  - Pakistan inherited the British Weberian model at its birth in 1947 (Braibanti, 1966). The Weberian framework is the basis of the professional code of the Pakistani bureaucracy. The Framework highlights the importance of gender neutrality towards ensuring impartiality, promotion of merit and efficiency in organizations. The Pakistani bureaucracy has been categorized as being Weberian by recent research, and hence should be gender neutral. This paper examines if the Pakistani bureaucracy is indeed gender neutral. It inspects the gender norms prevalent in the context of the macro sociocultural environment in Pakistan and finds that these norms are reflected in women's position in the bureaucracy. Using the perceptions of male and female bureaucrats and ministers as symptomatic evidence, the research deliberates on how the socially determined status hierarchies interact with organizational rules and regulations to perpetuate gender bias and lack of gender neutrality within the bureaucracy. The paper concludes by reinforcing that the bureaucracy operates in a larger social and cultural environment, which is unable to be a socially transformative agent in the case of Pakistan, and hence, is not gender neutral and by consequence, not Weberian.

T1  - The Influence of Time on Artworks: A Hermeneutical Reading of Holocaust Films
AN  - 1911178605
AB  - This article’s aim is to focus on the close relationship that exists between the notions of prejudice and historicity and the time in which a film director of genocide lives and the extent to which their temporality unavoidably colors their artistic response to a historical event, such as the Holocaust. In this regard, depending on such an event, a categorization of people will be offered: victims and survivors, survivors’ children who born after genocide, witnesses of victims and survivors, and, finally, people born after the genocide. In this way, according to the main argument of this essay, the time period the film director lives in relative to the event is one of the criteria for evaluating their artwork in virtue of the formation of their prejudices and of their approach to the Holocaust as a historical event. But it must be noted that this essay will not argue that films of the directors belonging to any of the particular categories are better representations of the Holocaust than the films of the others. Instead, it will be stated that there appears a two-stage linguistic gap among human beings when directors narrate their own experience or highlight the significance of the event per se.

T1  - Using the Science of Psychology to Target Perpetrators of Racism and Race-Based Discrimination for Intervention Efforts: Preventing Another Trayvon Martin Tragedy
AN  - 2222750583
AB  - Psychological science offers a variety of methods to both understand and intervene when acts of potential racial or ethnic racism, bias or prejudice occur. The Trayvon Martin killing is a reminder of how vulnerable African American men and boys, especially young African American men, are to becoming victims of social inequities in our society. We examine several historical events of racial bias (the Los Angeles civil disturbance after the Rodney King verdict, the federal government’s launch of a “War on Drugs” and the killing of Trayvon Martin) to illustrate the ways in which behaviors of racism and race-based discrimination can be viewed from a psychological science lens in the hopes of eliminating and preventing these behaviors. If society is to help end the genocide of African American men and boys then we must broaden our focus from simply understanding instances of victimization to a larger concern with determining how policies, laws, and societal norms serve as the foundation for maintaining implicit biases that are at the root of race-based discrimination, prejudice, bias and inequity. In our call to action, we highlight the contributions that psychologists, particularly racial and ethnic minority professionals, can make to reduce the negative impact of racial and ethnic bias through their volunteer/pro bono clinical efforts.

T1  - Discrimination and the Health of Immigrants and Refugees: Exploring Canada's Evidence Base and Directions for Future Research in Newcomer Receiving Countries
AN  - 1478096047; 22729289
AB  - Research and practice increasingly suggests discrimination compromises health. Yet the unique experiences and effects facing immigrant and refugee populations remain poorly understood in Canada and abroad. We review current knowledge on discrimination against newcomers in Canada, emphasizing impacts upon health status and service access to identify gaps and research needs. Existing knowledge centers around experiences within health-care settings, differences in perception and coping, mental health impacts, and debates about "non-discriminatory" health-care. There is need for comparative analyses within and across ethno-cultural groups and newcomer classes to better understand factors shaping how discrimination and its health effects are differentially experienced. Women receive greater attention in the literature given their compounded vulnerability. While this must continue, little is known about the experiences of youth and men. Governance and policy discourse analyses would elucidate how norms, institutions and practices shape discriminatory attitudes and responses. Finally, "non-discriminatory health-care" interventions require critical evaluation to determine their effectiveness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - "I Am First and Foremost a Man of Logic" - Stereotyping, the Syndrome Character of Prejudice, and a Glance at Anders Breivik's Manifesto
AN  - 1412576891
AB  - Attitudes, stereotyping, and prejudice are often conceived of as inner, mental or cognitive processes. Drawing on discursive psychology and critical theory, this article proposes a language-based understanding of stereotyping and the "syndrome character" of prejudice that is able to avoid certain epistemological shortcomings and connect social-psychological and sociological research. Stereotyping is outlined as a relational concept that denotes a linguistic mode of relating to the world, whilst the syndrome character of prejudice is conceptualized as a phenomenon that shows in particular stereotypical speech acts, but does not completely coincide with them. The impact of this conceptual figuration is empirically illustrated using Anders Breivik's manifesto. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Discrimination against Rural-to-Urban Migrants: The Role of the Hukou System in China
AN  - 1326723294
AB  - China's rural-urban dual society system is instituted by its unique hukou system. This system causes inequalities in social status between permanent urban and rural residents, and discrimination against rural-to-urban migrants is thus prevalent. A series of studies, based on system justification theory, sought to address the impact of the hukou system on the discrimination against rural-to-urban migrants. Study 1 showed that the justification of the hukou system could predict discrimination operationalized using a social distance measure. Study 2 found that priming of the proposed abolishment of the current hukou system led to reduced social distance. Study 3, using a recruiting scenario, further demonstrated that priming of the proposed abolishment of the system led to reduced discrimination in salary decision. Consistent with our predictions, discrimination against rural-to-urban migrants could be triggered by justifying the current hukou system, while priming of the abolishment of the system serves to decrease discrimination. The present research thereby sheds light on China's reform of its hukou system to achieve social justice and equality from a psychological perspective.

T1  - Understanding and addressing the stigma of mental illness with ethnic minority communities
AN  - 1313192774
AB  - Higher income societies have moved from institutional to community-based care for people experiencing mental illness. However, stigma and discrimination persists and undermines help-seeking, recovery and life chances. This study examines beliefs, stigma and the effectiveness of existing national mental health campaigns with Pakistani, Indian and Chinese heritage communities in Scotland, UK, using community based participatory research. Community organisers were trained and supported to co-facilitate focus groups with 87 people using a range of languages. Whilst diversity within and between communities was apparent, important trends emerged. People with mental illness experience high levels of stigma from communities. Families experience significant associated stigma. This shame combines with culturally inappropriate services to reduce help-seeking from mental health services, friends and families. Existing anti-stigma campaigns have failed to reach or engage with communities due to a combination of practical issues such as the use of inappropriate language, imagery and media, but also due to assuming western medical concepts of illness.

T1  - Self-Reported Discrimination and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Whites, Blacks, Mexicans and Central Americans
AN  - 927713012; 21562787
AB  - This study investigates whether self-reported racial discrimination is related to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Analyses focused on Whites (n = 52,571), Blacks (n = 4,343), Mexicans (n = 12,336), Central Americans (n = 1,504), Multi-ethnic Latinos (n = 1,102), and Other Latinos (n = 1,828) who participated in the 2003 and 2005 California Health Interview survey. Logistic and negative binomial regression was used to examine the association between HRQoL (assessed with the CDC unhealthy days measures) and self-reported racial discrimination. Discrimination was reported by 10% of Whites, 57% of Blacks, and 24-31% of the Latino groups. These reports were associated with increased number of unhealthy days, disability days, and poor self-rated health, even after, controlling for education and other factors. This association did not consistently vary by race/ethnicity. Racial discrimination may be a risk factor for poor HRQoL among diverse groups. Future research should examine the factors that may reduce potential exposure to racial discrimination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Rationality of Prejudices
AN  - 1332847772
AB  - We model an -player repeated prisoner's dilemma in which players are given traits (e.g., height, age, wealth) which, we assume, affect their behavior. The relationship between traits and behavior is unknown to other players. We then analyze the performance of “prejudiced” strategies—strategies that draw inferences based on the observation of some or all of these traits, and extrapolate the inferred behavior to other carriers of these traits. Such prejudiced strategies have the advantage of learning rapidly, and hence of being well adapted to rapidly changing conditions that might result, for example, from high migration or birth rates. We find that they perform remarkably well, and even systematically outperform both Tit-For-Tat and ALLD when the population changes rapidly.

T1  - Silenced Stories: How Victim Impact Evidence in Capital Trials Prevents the Jury from Hearing the Constitutionally Required Story of the Defendant
AN  - 1125220404; 201243110
AB  - This Comment will argue that, for the typical juror, the victim impact statement is much easier to identify with, drowning out the story of the defendant, who is faced with the prospect of capital punishment. This makes the emotional story of the victim the only story given meaningful consideration by the jury. Cognitive psychology shows that humans filter new information through existing schema. This Comment will define schemas and show how, because jurors generally have different life experiences than defendants, it is easier for the juror to identify with the murdered victim's schema than with the defendant's schema. Because of this, the stories told in victim impact evidence are unduly prejudicial, overwhelming any mitigating factors in a capital sentencing trial. Thus, the defendant does not have an opportunity to present evidence of his or her moral culpability as the Constitution requires in capital sentencing trials. This argument will consist of five parts. Part II will discuss the current state of capital punishment jurisprudence in the United States. Part III will give an overview of the current state of the law on victim impact evidence, outlining how the Supreme Court initially proscribed such evidence but later reversed itself, and in doing so failed to give guidance to lower courts on what manner of victim impact evidence was acceptable. Part IV will give an overview and explanation of what are known in cognitive psychology as schemas. This will include an explanation of how schemas cause people to filter information in a predetermined way, potentially ignoring information that does not easily fit into this format. Part V will show how the schemas of most jurors cause them to easily accept the emotionally charged stories presented in victim impact statements, thereby silencing defendants' stories. Part VI will analyze the case of United States v. Sampson, contrasting the story of the victim told by the victim impact evidence with the story of the defendant told by mitigating evidence.

T1  - Does the Lack of a Profit Motive Affect Hiring in Academe? Evidence from the Market for Lawyers
AN  - 900194625
AB  - The comparative performance of academic and economic markets continues to be debated. One factor potentially distinguishing academic markets is the profit motive. Profit and competition have been shown to curb discrimination in markets, and the absence of profit discipline could result in myriad forms of prejudice in academic hiring. We explore the role of the profit motive in the performance of academic markets by comparing the pedigree of employees of top law schools and top law firms. Top law schools are much more likely to employ graduates of top ranked law schools than elite law firms, and the difference exists at both the junior and senior levels. We find no evidence that the graduates of top 5 law schools outperform grads of less prestigious schools in publications or citations. In the absence of a profit motive, academic hiring appears more likely to indulge a preference for pedigree, and by implication, this may explain other scholarly prejudices in the academy.

T1  - Racial Group Membership Is Associated to Gaze-Mediated Orienting in Italy
AN  - 1309096430
AB  - Viewing a face with averted gaze results in a spatial shift of attention in the corresponding direction, a phenomenon defined as gaze-mediated orienting. In the present paper, we investigated whether this effect is influenced by social factors. Across three experiments, White and Black participants were presented with faces of White and Black individuals. A modified spatial cueing paradigm was used in which a peripheral target stimulus requiring a discrimination response was preceded by a noninformative gaze cue. Results showed that Black participants shifted attention to the averted gaze of both ingroup and outgroup faces, whereas White participants selectively shifted attention only in response to individuals of their same group. Interestingly, the modulatory effect of social factors was context-dependent and emerged only when group membership was situationally salient to participants. It was hypothesized that differences in the relative social status of the two groups might account for the observed asymmetry between White and Black participants. A final experiment ruled out an alternative explanation based on differences in perceptual familiarity with the face stimuli. Overall, these findings strengthen the idea that gaze-mediated orienting is a socially-connoted phenomenon.

T1  - Racial Discrimination in the Administration of the Death Penalty: The Experience of the United States Armed Forces (1984-2005)
AN  - 1125217499; 201243037
AB  - This Article presents evidence of racial discrimination in the administration of the death penalty in the United States Armed Forces from 1984 through 2005. Our database includes military prosecutions in all potentially death-eligible cases known to us (n = 105) during that time period. Over the last thirty years, studies of state death-penalty systems have documented three types of evidence of racial disparities in the treatment of similarly situated death-eligible offenders. The most common disparity or "race effect" is that capital charging and sentencing decisions are applied more punitively in cases involving one or more white victims than they are in similar cases with no white victims. These disparities are generally viewed as evidence of "race of victim" discrimination in the system. The next most common race-based disparity is the more punitive treatment of cases involving a black or minority defendant and one or more white victims compared to the treatment of cases involving all other similarly situated defendant/victim racial combinations. These disparities are viewed as evidence of "minority-defendant/white-victim" discrimination in the system. The least common racially based disparity is the more punitive treatment of cases involving black and minority defendants compared to the treatment of similarly situated white-defendant cases, regardless of the race of the victim involved in the case. These race effects are usually referred to as evidence of "independent" or "main effect" racial discrimination. The data in this study document white-victim and minority-accused/white-victim disparities in charging and sentencing outcomes that are consistent with these findings. The data also document independent minority-accused disparities of a magnitude that is rarely seen in state court systems. The principal source of the white-victim disparities in the system is the combined effect of convening authority charging decisions and court martial panel findings of guilt at trial -- decisions that advance death-eligible cases to capital sentencing hearings. The principal source of the independent minority-accused disparities in the system is the death-sentencing decisions of panel members in capital sentencing hearings. The evidence in the sixteen cases with multiple victims, which are the principal source of the race effects in the system, supports Supreme Court Justice Byron White's hypothesis that in death-eligible murder cases, the greatest risk of "racial prejudice" exists in highly aggravated minority-accused/ white-victim cases. There is, however, little or no risk of racial prejudice among the small group of cases that constitute the most aggravated military cases -- those with substantial military implications because they involve lethal attacks on United States troops or commissioned officer victims. Limiting death eligibility to death-eligible murders with substantial military implications could substantially reduce or entirely eliminate the risk of racial bias in the administration of the military death penalty. Without regard to the race of the defendant and victims, those cases uniformly receive more punitive treatment than "civilian-style" murder cases that have no military implications. This has particularly been the case between 1990 and 2005. Militarily implicated cases have accounted for 75% (6/8) of the military death sentences imposed during that period.

T1  - Straight Allies: What Predicts Heterosexuals' Alliance With the LGBT Community?
AN  - 1545066639
AB  - Despite their prominence in civil rights movements, out-group allies have been understudied. The current research examined out-group alliance, focusing on predictors of heterosexuals' advocacy for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights. Heterosexuals who were recruited through an online panel of research participants completed a survey containing measures of empathy, out-group contact, gender, education, and attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Additionally, participants indicated whether they had engaged in several allied behaviors (e.g., donating money for LGBT causes). Women, educated individuals, and those with gay and lesbian friends were more likely to be allies. Additionally, alliance was greatest among individuals lower in prejudice and simultaneously higher in positivity toward gays and lesbians. Implications regarding intergroup relations and future research are discussed.

T1  - Looking the Part: Social Status Cues Shape Race Perception
AN  - 1308804438
AB  - It is commonly believed that race is perceived through another's facial features, such as skin color. In the present research, we demonstrate that cues to social status that often surround a face systematically change the perception of its race. Participants categorized the race of faces that varied along White–Black morph continua and that were presented with high-status or low-status attire. Low-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as Black, whereas high-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as White; and this influence grew stronger as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 1). When faces with high-status attire were categorized as Black or faces with low-status attire were categorized as White, participants' hand movements nevertheless revealed a simultaneous attraction to select the other race-category response (stereotypically tied to the status cue) before arriving at a final categorization. Further, this attraction effect grew as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 2). Computational simulations then demonstrated that these effects may be accounted for by a neurally plausible person categorization system, in which contextual cues come to trigger stereotypes that in turn influence race perception. Together, the findings show how stereotypes interact with physical cues to shape person categorization, and suggest that social and contextual factors guide the perception of race.

T1  - The Devastating Impact of Prior Crimes Evidence and Other Myths of the Criminal Justice Process
AN  - 1125218629; 201243094
AB  - This Article argues that there is very good reason to believe that the misshapen stone should indeed be extracted and that the result would be a considerably less grotesque structure. There is abundant empirical evidence that prior criminal convictions weigh heavily in jurors' decisions about acquittal and conviction. That same empirical work suggests that jurors' learning directly through the evidence that defendant has been convicted of prior crimes makes very little difference to conviction rates. This seeming paradox is examined in considerable detail. Understanding how and why it arises suggests that the tendency in American law to suppress information about prior crimes (except under special circumstances) is a self-defeating strategy that not only lacks a convincing epistemic foundation but may also be responsible for the inadvertent conviction of innocent defendants. Arguably, it is often not the admission of prior crimes evidence that is unfairly prejudicial so much as its exclusion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup contact and reduction of explicit and implicit prejudice toward immigrants: a study with Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises
AN  - 816796077
AB  - A field study was conducted to test the effectiveness of intergroup contact (Allport, The nature of prejudice, 1954) as a predictor of explicit and implicit attitudes toward immigrants and to examine the processes driving its effects. Participants were Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises in Northern Italy who had daily contact with their immigrant workers. We tested a model in which contact ameliorated explicit attitudes, measured as support for social policies toward immigration, through reduced negative outgroup stereotypes. Furthermore, we predicted that contact would have a direct, unmediated effect on improved implicit attitudes toward immigrants, assessed with an Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., J Personal Soc Psychol 74:1464-1480, 1998). The results were fully consistent with predictions, thus providing strong support for the contact hypothesis at both an explicit and at an implicit level. The lack of correlation between explicit and implicit attitudes supports dual-process models, suggesting that the two types of attitudes are formed through different processes. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Discursive Meaning of Hope for Older Persons with Advanced Cancer and their Caregivers
AN  - 746622597; 20731889
AB  - RÉSUMÉ              Cette étude a utilisé l'approche du discours critique de van Dijik afin d'explorer le discours sociétaux actuel sur l'espoir, et d'explorer l'espoir des patients agées avec cancer terminale, leurs soignants et leurs infirmières primaires. Quarante-trois articles de presse traitant de l'espoir et de cancer ont été recueillies et analysées pour explorer comment l'espoir est socialement construite par les médias de presse. Des entrevues individuelles de face à face, qualitatives et ouvertes ont été menées avec trois triades, constitués d'un patient de cancer palliatif âgé, un conjoint, et une infirmière primaire. Le discours prédominant de l'espoir et de cancer dans les articles de presse a été considérée comme discriminatoire à raison de l'âge; il a transmit le message que le seul espoir légitime qui existe pour les personnes atteintes d'un cancer est d'espérer un remède. Ce message a causé de la confusion et de la détresse pour les patients, leurs conjoints, et leur infirmières primaires, étant donné que leurs propre discours d'espoir ont été axés sur le confort, la paix et le maintien des relations à la fin de vie. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]              ABSTRACT              This study used van Dijk's critical-discourse approach to explore the current societal discourse on hope and to explore the hope of older terminally ill cancer patients, their significant others and primary nurse. Forty-three newspaper articles dealing with hope and cancer were collected and analyzed to explore how hope is socially constructed by print media. Individual face-to-face, qualitative, open-ended interviews were conducted with three triads, each consisting of an older palliative cancer patient, a significant other, and a primary nurse. The predominant discourse of hope and cancer in the newspaper articles was considered ageist, conveying the message that only one legitimate hope existed for persons with cancer: hope for a cure. The study findings suggested that this message caused confusion and distress for the patients, significant others, and their primary nurses because their own discourses of hope were focused on comfort, peace, and maintaining relationships at the end of life.

T1  - The Neglect of Racism as an Ethical Issue in Health Care
AN  - 618697879; 19015986
AB  - Race and racism has been increasingly implicated in known disparities in the health and health care of racial, ethnic and cultural minorities groups. Despite the obvious ethical implications of this observation, racism as an ethical issue per se has been relatively neglected in health care ethics discourse. In this paper consideration is given to addressing the following questions: What is it about racism and racial disparities in health and health care that these command our special moral scrutiny? Why has racism per se tended to be poorly addressed as an ethical issue in health care ethics discourse? And why, if at all, must racism be addressed as an ethical issue in addition to its positioning as a social, political, cultural and legal issue? It is suggested that unless racism is reframed and redressed as a pre-eminent ethical issue by health service providers, its otherwise preventable harmful consequences will remain difficult to identify, anticipate, prevent, manage, and remedy.

T1  - "My God, They Must Have Riots On Those Things All The Time": African American Geographies And Bodies On Northern Urban Public Transportation, 1915-1940
AN  - 754040294; 201049545
AB  - Between the World Wars, public transportation in Northern cities like Chicago and New York allowed African Americans, many of them newly migrated from the South, to contest geographical and bodily boundaries. Attention to the public, liminal space of subways and streetcars complicates scholarly understanding of black mobility that typically centers on restrictive residential covenants. While covenants did confine African Americans to living in delimited black belts, the necessities of work or school and the gratification of leisure activities often led to interracial contact on public transportation outside black neighborhoods. Once on public transportation, the close proximity of white and black bodies both fueled and challenged prejudices that marked African Americans as loci of disease and violence; subways and streetcars were spaces for African Americans to enact and police standards of respectability within their own community. Mobility that offered both promise and peril in the interwar years also inspired aesthetic reflection on the modern black urban experience by writers like Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, and Ralph Ellison. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Discussing Depression with Vietnamese American Patients
AN  - 199541243; 19242803
AB  - Asian patients preferentially seek mental health care from their primary care providers but are unlikely to receive it. Primary care providers need culturally-informed strategies for addressing stigmatizing illnesses. Eleven Vietnamese American community members participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. The grounded theory approach was used for qualitative coding and thematic analysis. Vietnamese community members describe experiences with depression under four themes: 1. stigma and face, 2. social functioning and the role of the family, 3. traditional healing and beliefs about medications and 4. language and culture. Based on this data, we offer suggestions for improving culturally-informed care for Vietnamese Americans. Our study adds to the research aimed at improving communication and health care relationships between physicians and Vietnamese American patients. Physicians should learn to tailor their interviewing style to the increasingly diverse patient population.
