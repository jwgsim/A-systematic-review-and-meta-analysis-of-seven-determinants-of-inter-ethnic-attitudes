T1  - Greek High School Teachers' Homonegative Attitudes Towards Same-Sex Parent Families
AN  - 2660493814
AB  - The current cross-sectional study examined Greek teachers' attitudes towards marriage equality and beliefs about children's adjustment in same-sex parent families. A total of 183 teachers participated in this study. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Convenience sampling through teachers' social networks was utilised. This study's data were collected using two standardised instruments, attitudes toward same-sex marriage and children's adjustment in same-sex families. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the associations between the variables of this research. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was utilised to analyze the relationship between predictor variables and the children's adjustment in same-sex families' instrument. A negative stance toward same-sex marriage was a significant predictor of negative attitudes towards children's adjustment in same-sex parent families. The role of personal and contextual factors in determining teachers' beliefs about same-sex parenting was partially supported. This study fills an important gap by examining attitudes towards same-sex parenting in a context that directly influences high school students.

T1  - Trial and error: hate speech prosecution and its (unintended) effects on democratic support
AN  - 2616790576
AB  - Due to its controversial nature, hate speech prosecution of anti-immigration politicians is likely to affect citizens’ democratic support. Using a web experiment in which participants are exposed to a manipulated television news story about hate speech prosecution, we test these potential effects in the Dutch context. We demonstrate that effects on democratic support are driven by (dis)agreement with ideas expressed by the prosecuted politician in his alleged hate speech rather than by identification with his party. While a decision to not prosecute a politician does not seem to affect democratic support, a decision to prosecute a politician for hate speech decreases democratic support among citizens with anti-immigration attitudes, and increases democratic support among citizens with pro-immigration attitudes. Decisions to prosecute politicians for hate speech thus have important effects not just on supporters of the politician’s party, but also on other groups in society.

T1  - Understanding the appeal of libertarianism: Gender and race differences in the endorsement of libertarian principles
AN  - 2614034732
AB  - There is a stereotype of libertarians being young, college educated, white men and that the Libertarian Party lacks appeal among women and individuals of color. There is a great deal of research investigating gender differences in public opinion on a number of issues including the provision of government resources and government spending (Barnes and Cassese; Howell and Day). Nevertheless, there is no work specifically investigating why women and nonwhites do not find libertarianism appealing. We test several hypotheses using 2016 American National Election Study data and 2013 PRRI data. We find a sizeable and significant gender gap and race gap in support for libertarian principles. We investigate several explanations for these gaps finding moderate support for self‐interest, racial attitudes, and egalitarianism as reasons for women and African Americans being less supportive of Libertarian Principles. We believe that the modest success of and media attention garnered by Ron Paul and Rand Paul in recent years along with the success of the Libertarian Party presidential ticket in 2016 highlights the need to understand who is drawn to libertarianism and why.1

T1  - Social dominance orientation and differential affect toward immigrant origin groups: Evidence from three immigration-receiving countries
AN  - 2621588056
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that majority group members in immigration-receiving societies express differential levels of prejudice and stereotyping toward various immigrant origins. However, there is little research on whether this tendency to differentiate between more vs. less liked immigrant groups is informed by essential psychological motivations and systematically related to individual differences. In this paper, I test whether majority group members' propensity to express greater differences in affect toward immigrant origins is associated with social dominance orientation. Using survey studies carried out in the Netherlands, the United States, and Britain, I demonstrate that majority group members' tendency to express differential affect toward immigrant origins holds across national contexts. I also show that individual-level inclination to differentiate between more and less liked immigrant groups is consistently related to social dominance orientation in all three countries. Overall, my findings confirm the group-specific character of anti-immigration attitudes and highlight the role of social-dominance motivations in prejudice toward immigrants.

T1  - Hegemony, domination and opposition: Fluctuating Korean nationalist politics at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang
AN  - 2587504223
AB  - This article is concerned with the contested nature of nationalism expressed through sport. The 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang offers some useful episodes where I can investigate a different type of Korean nationalism represented through sport. At this Winter Olympics, I observed four distinctive discourses on Korean identity being displayed via the winter sporting competition: 1)  unified Korean ethnic nationalism, 2) South Korean state patriotic nationalism, 3) postcolonial anti-imperialist nationalism, and 4) cosmopolitan Korean identity. The four variants of nationalism were vying for the dominant position in the hierarchy of South Korean politics, and the Winter Olympics presented a platform on which each nationalist group asserts the legitimacy of their sense of nationhood. Therefore, I conclude that the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang was not simply a physical contest between athletes but more importantly, was a field of the hegemonic struggle between adherents of different nationalistic views.

T1  - Migration and the plurality of ethnic boundary work: A qualitative interview study of naming practices of migrants from former Yugoslavia in Germany
AN  - 2569345018
AB  - Most research on migration and ethnic boundaries is concerned with boundaries between a specific migrant minority and the ‘majority society’ in the destination country. However, migrant groups are not homogenous; within-group boundaries that are relevant in their context of origin may also play a role in the host context. Focusing on migrants from former Yugoslavia, we analyse the relevance of ethnic boundaries between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats in Germany. We do so by interpreting migrant parents’ practices of first-name giving as instances of ethnic boundary work. In the case of migrants from former Yugoslavia, first names are a salient marker of ethnic affiliation. Based on 22 semi-structured interviews, we distinguish between three types of ethnic boundary work based on first-name giving. ‘Particularists’ wish to express their ethnic affiliation via first names, and they maintain ethnic boundaries both towards the German majority society as well as other ethnic groups from former Yugoslavia. In contrast, ‘cosmopolitans’ reject names with specific ethnic references and base their choice on personal taste, often opting for international names, thereby rejecting ethnic boundaries towards other former Yugoslav groups. Finally, ‘negotiators’ stand in between. They blur boundaries towards the German majority society, but maintain boundaries towards other ex-Yugoslav ethnic groups. Overall, we find that ex-Yugoslav migrants’ strategies of ethnic boundary work are shaped by a multiplicity of reference groups, not just the relationship with the German majority society.

T1  - Promoting Northern Ireland’s peacebuilding experience in Palestine–Israel: normalising the status quo
AN  - 2555795326
AB  - Against the backdrop of enduring Israeli settler colonialist expansion in historic Palestine, the selective application of the Northern Ireland ‘Peace Process’ to the ‘Israel/Palestine Conflict’ ignores root causes and acts as a blunt instrument, one that sustains a deeply unjust status quo whilst eschewing decolonisation as the ultimate goal. We argue that the transposition of a Northern Irish peace model to Palestine/Israel serves to reinforce and embed the ‘conflict’ by promoting its own discourse of ‘peacebuilding’, one that is silent on the language of colonisation, which in turn marginalises the legitimacy of Palestinian anti-colonial resistance and prioritises westernised notions of ‘peace’ over international obligations to promote ‘justice’. Our argument is premised upon what is, in the main, a marginalised critique, namely that viewing the Northern Irish Peace Accord as ‘successful’ – an exemplary model suitable for application in other conflict/transitional spaces – depends on how one understands the agreement itself: as a tool to end ethnic conflict by fostering better cross-community relationships through a process of consociationalism that leads to reconciliation; or as a carefully constructed, bureaucratic means of providing a ruse of ‘peace’ whilst appeasing claims to self-determination and ignoring broader colonial history.

T1  - The development and initial validation of the White Fragility Scale
AN  - 2555179018
AB  - Over the last couple of years, the topic of White fragility has garnered a considerable degree of attention. White fragility is considered a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress can become intolerable and trigger a range of emotional and behavioral reactions intended to restore a sense of racial comfort (DiAngelo, White fragility: Why it's so hard for White people to talk about racism, 2018, Beacon Press). In effort to measure the expression of White fragility, we developed and evaluated the psychometric properties of the 21-item White Fragility Scale (WFS). Data consisted of two independent samples of White participants recruited from M-Turk (327) and a Midwest University's Psychpool (234). Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence for a bifactor model consisting of one general White fragility factor and three specific factors of Emotional Defensiveness, Accommodation of Safety, and Exceptionism. Ancillary bifactor indices supported treating the WFS as a unidimensional measure of White fragility yet also revealed meaningful utility of the Accommodation of Safety subscale. Concurrent validity evidence for the WFS was established through significant associations with modern racism, general and specific dimensions of colorblind racial attitudes, and social dominance orientation. In addition, nonsignificant, near-zero correlations with social desirability provided support for divergent validity. Recommendations for future research involving the WFS are provided as well as practical implications for professionals whose work requires a certain degree of racial stamina.

T1  - Opposition to the Affordable Care Act has Little to do with Health Care
AN  - 2530596965
AB  - The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has vastly reduced racial health insurance disparities, but efforts continue to repeal this health care law. It is not clear, however, whether this policy is rejected because of its health care provisions, or if the ACA is interpreted primarily as a social welfare policy aimed at providing resources specifically to non-white Americans. In this paper, we assess whether the racial divide in opposition to the Affordable Care Act is unique to this law or represents a reflection of a longer history of racialized social welfare policies in the U.S. The for this research come from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016 Time Series Study which targets United States-based citizens aged 18 and older. We conducted logistic regression to understand how racial attitudes and support for social policies relate to opposition to the ACA. Perceptions of the ACA, especially among white Americans, were related to both support for affirmative action in hiring and education and racial resentment more generally. Attitudes toward the ACA were unrelated to support for policies that have not been explicitly framed as benefitting non-white Americans. As public debates related to whether to amend the ACA or repeal and replace it altogether continue, scholars and public health practitioners should emphasize the role that racism and racial resentment more specifically play in health policy debates.

T1  - ‘PC worlds’: Ethno-nationalist identitarian theories of anti-political correctness
AN  - 2500887045
AB  - Over the past two decades, politicians and intellectuals have lent support to rising anti-immigrant sentiments, ethno-nationalist integralism and far-right populism by coining expressions such as ‘cultural exclusion’ and claiming to be speaking in the name of the ‘people’, often under cover of anti-political correctness. In this article I identify a series of recurrent features of such ethno-nationalist identitarian theories. The book I am critiquing, PC Worlds: Political Correctness and Rising Elites at the End of Hegemony (2019) by Jonathan Friedman, is a clear example of these trends. The scholar who had previously critiqued racialized politics and the reification of cultures now offers a book in favour of anti-immigrant ethno-nationalism and radical cultural othering. The article shows how this is the result of contradictions related to the evolution in his own thinking and situates these contradictions in regard to different theories of the nation-state. It also demonstrates how Friedman has proceeded to hollow out his own previous model, by making a distorted and normative use of it, and points out a number of weaknesses, particularly regarding the notions of ‘elites’ and ‘hegemony’. Finally, it questions the very project of conducting a study of political correctness.

T1  - Non-state order and strategic communication via symbolic dress in Yemen
AN  - 2486066223
AB  - How do people keep order in weak states? Formal institutions provide law and order in rich societies, but are feeble and capricious in much of the developing world. Instead, people turn to informal, group-based order that operates through reputation and contingent cooperation. Such order requires people to police social boundaries and contributions, looking for costly signals of membership and commitment to weed out mimics and shirkers. Data from Yemen show that people rely on tribes for security and dispute resolution under customary law. Yemenis use a prominent symbol of tribalism, the iconic tribal dagger, to communicate their affiliations and commitments to their customary responsibilities. Yet people vary in how well they understand the semiotic system, and the accuracy of the link between dagger-wearing and tribalism improves with sophistication. While the most knowledgeable Yemenis reveal their tribal types with the dagger, the least knowledgeable communicate nothing at all.

Запустив процесс коренизации управленческих кадров, Москва способствовала становлению современной национальной элиты на местах.

By launching the process of the de-Russification ('korenizatsiya') managerial personnel, Moscow has contributed to the formation of modern national elites on the ground. The implementation of the national-state construction project led to the nationalization of ethnic and interethnic relations and the sovereignization of the Union republics, а key factor in the collapse of the USSR.

T1  - “If You Don’t Speak English, I Can’t Understand You!”: Exposure to Various Foreign Languages as a Threat
AN  - 2565703048
AB  - The number of non-English speaking and bilingual immigrants continues to grow in the U.S. Previous research suggests that about one third of White Americans feel threatened upon hearing a language other than English. The current research examines how exposure to a foreign language affects White Americans’ perceptions of immigrants and group-based threats. In Study 1, White Americans were randomly assigned to read one of four fictional transcripts of a conversation of an immigrant family at a restaurant, where the type of language being spoken was manipulated to be either Korean, Spanish, German, or English. In Study 2, White Americans read the same fictional transcript—minus the Spanish; however, there was an addition of two subtitles conditions in which the subtitles were provided next to the Korean and German texts. The two studies suggest that exposure to a foreign language—regardless of whether they are consistent with Anglocentric constructions of American identity—lead White Americans to form less positive impressions of the immigrant targets and their conversation, experience an uptick in group-based threats, and display greater anti-immigrant attitudes. Moreover, there is evidence that the (in)ability to understand the conversation (i.e., epistemic threat) influences participants’ perceptions of immigrants and group-based threats.

T1  - EU nationals’ vulnerability in the context of Brexit: the case of Polish nationals
AN  - 2476107613
AB  - Since the late 1990s, populist discourse based on anti-immigration sentiments has been on the rise in Britain. This phenomenon reached a peak during the EU Referendum (ER) campaign and shortly thereafter. The ER has been linked to the upsurge in racially and religiously aggravated offences recorded post-July 2016. Polish nationals, who constitute the largest group of EU nationals in the UK, were targeted by many of these incidents. It could therefore be argued that, in the last years, and particularly, since the ER, EU nationals living in the UK have become more ‘vulnerable’. To test this hypothesis, this contribution is based on an interdisciplinary project that collected socio-legal evidence to compare the vulnerability of the Polish community in Southampton before and after the ER. The paper draws on vulnerability and psychology literature to differentiate between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ vulnerability. Our study deploys mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) to test changes in objective and subjective vulnerability among Southampton-based Poles before and after the ER. Our findings suggest that, following the ER, Poles felt significantly more vulnerable, especially in terms of subjective vulnerability, even if they had never experienced overt hate incidents or discrimination (objective vulnerability) before.

T1  - The Measurement and Structure of Microaggressive Communications by White People Against Black People
AN  - 2655924932
AB  - Previous research on microaggressions has emphasized the frequency of and distress produced by microaggressions as reported by people of color. The current research supplements the existing literature by developing a self-report measure of White individuals’ microaggressive likelihood against Black people, the Cultural Cognitions and Actions Scale (CCAS). Study 1 developed the CCAS through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of responses to CCAS items from a sample of 978 non-Hispanic White undergraduate students. The final scale comprised four factors (Negative Attitudes, Colorblindness, Objectifying, and Avoidance) assessing microaggressive likelihood, and CCAS total and factor scores were significantly related to several other indicators of racism and bias. Study 2 involved 31 of the previous participants in a lab-based discussion of race-related issues with a confederate and provided initial support for the predictive validity of the measure. Overall, this report supports a growing literature that microaggressions are more than innocuous, harmless behaviors, unrelated to racism, and instead represent relevant processes within the science of racism and bias. It also provides a potential means of testing the effectiveness of interventions intended to reduce the commission of microaggressions.

T1  - When economic and cultural interests align: the anti-immigration voter coalitions driving far right party success in Europe
AN  - 2449076459
AB  - This article contests the view that the strong positive correlation between anti-immigration attitudes and far right party success necessarily constitutes evidence in support of the cultural grievance thesis. We argue that the success of far right parties depends on their ability to mobilize a coalition of interests between their core supporters, that is voters with cultural grievances over immigration and the often larger group of voters with economic grievances over immigration. Using individual level data from eight rounds of the European Social Survey, our empirical analysis shows that while cultural concerns over immigration are a stronger predictor of far right party support, those who are concerned with the impact of immigration on the economy are important to the far right in numerical terms. Taken together, our findings suggest that economic grievances over immigration remain pivotal within the context of the transnational cleavage.

T1  - Defending democracy against technocracy and populism: Deliberative democracy's strengths and challenges
AN  - 2442640816
AB  - Any account of liberal representative democracy will more or less explicitly address the following three conditions for democracy to work.1 First, the legitimacy of democracy depends on some real link between the public will and the public policies and office holders selected. Yet this ideal is severely undermined when the will of the people is in large part manufactured by political elites (Fishkin & Mansbridge, 2017, p. 7). In this case, the causal arrow goes in the wrong direction—to the extent that large minorities or sometimes majorities of existing liberal democracies are dissatisfied with, and feel left out or alienated from, the democratic practices and routines they experience (Offe, 2017, p. 15). We may safely infer that this concern to a large degree fuels populist anger, protest, and contestation. A second condition, however, is meant to provide an answer to the question how to best make collectively binding decisions that from an anticipated future standpoint we have no reason to regret. You may call this the concern for the epistemic dimension (or the epistemic properties and characteristics) of the process, rules and procedures of political decision‐making and its modalities, a concern that feeds into another symptom of the malaise of democratic government and governance, that is, technocratic rule. Third, democracies should be regarded as self‐scrutinizing and self‐correcting political systems that can respond to externally induced as well as internal deviations from its normative ideals. This is why they face notorious and ongoing controversial demands for their own revision, development, and improvement—the challenge here consists in “a tricky recursive logic" (Offe, 2017, p. 14).Offering an attractive account of how these conditions are to be fulfilled in modern representative democracies, deliberative democracy has become a dominant school within democratic theory. Yet at the same time, and perhaps surprisingly, it has also become the culprit in a peculiar trial: Does deliberative democracy offer justifications for institutional reforms that effectively depoliticize decision‐making and erect an elitist, technocratic, "postdemocratic" order? And does it, in consequence, also bear responsibility for populist reactions against this elitist order that insulates decision‐making processes from "ordinary people"? In this paper, we want to show that this assumption is baseless. Neither does deliberative democracy justify depoliticization or technocratic rule, nor do technocratic and populistic approaches present viable alternatives to the conceived shortcomings of liberal representative democracy—they rather miss the democratic core of collective action altogether.

T1  - Congregants and Citizens: Religion and Naturalization among US Immigrants: IMR
AN  - 2439232120
AB  - Scholars and pundits have long debated whether religion helps new immigrants integrate politically in the United States. Those who see religion as an integrative institution cite the country’s history of vibrant religious congregationalism that supports connections between the native and foreign born, while critics point to anti-immigrant hostility, Christian nationalism, and patterns of religious membership that can reinforce social segregation. This article aims to adjudicate this debate, using a large sample of survey data, the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), fielded among new legal residents in 2003/2004. I find that religious membership is associated with increased probability of naturalizing in a short (3.5–7 years) timeframe and is stronger for those with greater human capital and income and longer tenure in the United States. Involvement in US-origin congregations also exhibits a stronger effect on naturalization than involvement in national-origin congregations. Additionally, I find that religious minorities, though less likely to be members of congregations, are independently more likely than Christian immigrants to naturalize in the same timeframe. These results are interpreted as support for a view of organized religion as a setting for American identity formation and a basis for mobilizing resources in response to anti-immigrant sentiment. For certain groups, organized religion seems to support a type of selective acculturation that combines American citizenship with the establishment and/or retention of a distinct ethno-religious identity. The article thus affirms, with caveats, the broader relevance of a long tradition of ethnographic scholarship on immigrant religion in the United States.

T1  - Exclusion, violence, and optimism: Ethnic divides in Kyrgyzstan
AN  - 2405145505
AB  - The nation-building projects in much of post-socialist Eurasia have been characterized by the promotion of ethnic majorities and marginalization of minority groups. In dialogue with the scholarship on nation-building, ethnic exclusion and conflict, and ethnic migration, this study examines individual views on current and future interethnic relations, assessments of prospects for own ethnicity, expectations for future economic changes, and intentions to migrate abroad in the multiethnic nation of Kyrgyzstan. I use nationally representative survey data to model differences in these outcomes across the majority-minorities divides and between regional subgroups of the nation’s ethnic majority. The results show that a native minority that experienced recent ethnic violence has the most negative assessment of current interethnic relations. However, the minority group of outside origin, which never suffered direct violence but whose size and societal preeminence have eroded rapidly, is least optimistic about the future and is most inclined to migrate. Yet, the analyses also detect substantial regional differences within the ethnic majority, underscoring the complexity of historically-rooted ethnocultural and socioeconomic cleavages as well as of more recent political experiences. I interpret these findings within the context of evolving meanings of ethnic identity and national belonging in this rapidly changing society.

T1  - The Costs of Silencing the Self and Divided Self in the Context of Physical Abuse, Racial/Ethnic Identity, and Medication Adherence in Women Living with HIV
AN  - 2397279979
AB  - Racial/ethnic minority status and physical abuse history are risk factors for higher mortality rates and lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in women living with HIV (WLWH) in the United States. The current study tested the hypotheses that minority status and physical abuse history might lead women to silence the self (minimize and hide thoughts and feelings in order to avoid relational conflict, loss, and/or abuse) as measured by the Silencing the Self Scale (STSS), and that STSS might mediate and moderate relationships of physical abuse and racial/ethnic minority status with ART adherence. Divided Self (DS; acting in ways inconsistent with inner thoughts and feelings), an STSS subscale, was targeted for study along with the total STSS score. Participants were 513 women from the U.S. Women’s Interagency HIV Study (Mage = 46; 387, 75%, Black; 66, 13%, Hispanic; 60, 12%, White). Multiple logistic regressions indicated that across all racial/ethnic groups, physical abuse history related to higher DS and lower adherence. DS significantly mediated relationships between abuse and adherence. Compared to White women, Black women demonstrated worse ART adherence, but had lower total STSS. Racial/ethnic minority women and women with a physical abuse history who had higher DS had lower adherence than other groups. Results indicate that being a racial/ethnic minority or having a history of physical abuse may increase vulnerability to the deleterious effects of DS on ART adherence, findings that can help inform interventions to decrease health disparities in WLWH.

T1  - The Relationship between Prejudice and Wage Penalties for Gay Men in the United States
AN  - 2392948725
AB  - This article estimates the empirical relationship between prejudicial attitudes toward homosexuality and the wages of gay men in the United States. It combines data on prejudicial attitudes toward homosexuality from the General Social Survey with data on wages from the U.S. Decennial Censuses and American Community Surveys—both aggregated to the state level. The author finds that a one standard deviation increase in the share of individuals in a state who are prejudiced toward homosexuals is correlated with a decrease in the wages of gay men of between 2.7% and 4.0%. The results also suggest that the prejudice of managers is responsible for this correlation. The author finds that a one standard deviation increase in the share of the managers in a state who are prejudiced toward homosexuals is associated with a 1.9% decrease in the wages of gay men. The author finds no evidence that the wage penalty for gay men is correlated with the prejudice of customers or co-workers.

T1  - Diversity, Leadership, and Authenticity in the Undocumented Youth Movement
AN  - 2352527728
AB  - Copyright © The Race, Ethnicity, and Politics Section of the American Political Science Association 20192019The Race, Ethnicity, and Politics Section of the American Political Science AssociationThe undocumented youth movement is diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and immigration status. I argue that racial and immigration status diversity has a direct impact on the movement's ability to “expand the scope of conflict,” that is to say recruiting new members, reaching out to elected officials, and establishing representative leadership—elements that are critical to the sustainability and effectiveness of a movement. Findings also indicate that immigration status diversity plays a complex role. The presence of citizen allies brings both risks and benefits to the movement, as they reinforce the electoral connection sought by elected officials while at the same time jeopardizing the authenticity of the movement. Results are based on field research conducted between 2012 and 2015 in NJ and NY, including participant observation in state-level campaigns and interviews with over 130 immigrant youths, allies, and elected officials. This article contributes to the social movement literature by providing empirical evidence of the challenges present within diverse coalitions. It addresses the question of immigration status diversity, an issue that affects the immigration movement but speaks more broadly to the role of allies in social movements.

T1  - Change in school ethnic diversity and intergroup relations: The transition from segregated elementary to mixed secondary school for majority and minority students
AN  - 2341199309
AB  - This research examined the impact of a change in school diversity on school children's intergroup relations. A longitudinal survey tracked 551 White British and Asian British students (Mage = 11.32) transitioning from elementary (time 1) to secondary (time 2) school in an ethnically segregated town in the United Kingdom. We estimated a multivariate, multilevel model. A cross‐sectional comparison of segregated schools and a mixed elementary school at time 1 revealed that both Asian and White British in the mixed school reported more positive intergroup relations. A longitudinal analysis found that the transition from segregated elementary to mixed secondary schools was associated with Asian British developing more positive intergroup relations. White British reported overall less positive intergroup relations, although only trust decreased; evidence from other measures remains inconclusive. The findings are important for understanding early stages of diversity exposure, and the impact of changing diversity levels on majority and minority groups.

T1  - Becoming American by becoming Muslim: strategic assimilation among second-generation Muslim American parents
AN  - 2324806375
AB  - Strategic assimilation describes how individuals use boundary work to construct identities which allow them to selectively maintain ties to a minority community while assimilating into the mainstream. However, scholarship that accounts for the role that minority religious identity plays in these processes is warranted. The current study fills a theoretical and empirical niche by exploring boundary work among not only racial, but religious minorities in their processes of identity construction and assimilation. Based on two years of ethnographic fieldwork as well as 72 in-depth interviews with Muslim Americans in Metro-Detroit, I demonstrate how upper-middle-class suburban second-generation parents actively deconstructed class, racial, and ethnic boundaries to construct boundaries around religious identity and generational identity. In so doing, they consciously crafted a de-ethnicized interpretation of Islam and hence a Muslim American identity that they saw as integral in promoting upward assimilation for themselves and their third-generation children.

T1  - Azawad: A Parastate Between Nomads and Mujahidins?
AN  - 2546609891
AB  - As part of the collective work “Inconvenient Realities: Parastates, between Statehood and Frozen Conflict,” this article discusses today’s status of Azawad, a relatively remote parastate occupying the territories of northern Mali, currently entrapped in a low intensity conflict involving non-state actors, local security forces, and external interveners. By retracing the history and the development of Azawad, the article identifies the different and partly contrasting socio-economic and ethnic elements at the basis of Azawadian parastatehood, and it charts the dialectical process of co-construction, which have shaped and inextricably linked together the Azawad and the Malian state. Moreover, it underlines the complex and evolving relations existing between “nationalist” Tuareg rebels and jihadist groups, with the aim to problematize the classical distinction between secessionist and terrorist parastates. By showing the connections between parastatehood, hybrid governance, patronage politics, and statelessness characterizing the situation in the Azawad, the article claims that the current condition of stalled conflict represents a temporary and unstable arrangement, which is paving the way for further parastatehood projects to arise.

T1  - Adaptive Strategies during Times of Conflict and Transformation: Copiapó Valley under the Spanish Conquest in the Sixteenth Century
AN  - 2350018712
AB  - This article explores the changes and adaptation of warfare strategies in indigenous societies during the Spanish conquest, through a case study of Copiapó valley in northern Chile. Using ethnohistorical and archaeological data, it explores the experiences and actions of collective agents who transformed their warfare practices and social alliances in order to fight for their autonomy and survival. The Copiapó people transformed from a society characterized by low-scale intermittent warfare to one that employed an intensive mode of conflict and developed broader inter-ethnic alliances. Their relative success in this last stage eventually proved to be an effective bargaining tool to negotiate better conditions for their incorporation into the new colonial system.

T1  - Hope turned sour: second-generation incorporation and mobility in U.S. new immigrant destinations
AN  - 2316331930
AB  - The number and size of "new immigrant destinations" (NIDs) in the United States grew quickly over the 1990s and 2000s, but Latino newcomers residing in them witnessed a profound negative turn in institutional and political reception after 2005. The present article takes stock of the causes and consequences of this shift, showing how intensifying enforcement and exclusionary policy-making at the federal and state levels after 2005 stoked anti-immigrant sentiment and institutional closure in many NIDs, especially in the South. Though the Latino "second generation" is just now beginning to come of age and to enter the workforce in NIDs, offering new opportunities for data collection and analysis going forward, the extant literature suggests that this shift has significantly weakened its prospects for structural incorporation and upward economic mobility, which are now strongly stratified by citizenship and legal status.

T1  - Relationship Distress as a Mediator of Adverse Childhood Experiences and Health: Implications for Clinical Practice with Economically Vulnerable Racial and Ethnic Minorities
AN  - 2323262135
AB  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are interpersonal sources of distress negatively correlated with physical and mental health, as well as maladaptive intimate partner conflict strategies in adulthood. Economically vulnerable racial and ethnic minorities report the greatest disparities in exposure to ACE, as well as relationship distress and health. Yet, little is known about the connections between ACE, relationship distress, and health. We therefore tested a theoretical model for the mediating role of relationship distress to explain the ACE‐health connection with a sample (N = 96) predominantly racial/ethnic minorities (87%) with low income. We applied partial least squares structural equation modeling with bootstrapping (N = 500). Relationship distress strengthened the predictive relationship between ACE and health, and accounted for 42% of the variance in health. The results provide preliminary support for relationship distress as a social determinant of health disparities with implications for interdisciplinary health intervention.Alternate abstract:Las experiencias adversas de la infancia son fuentes interpersonales de distrés correlacionadas negativamente con la salud mental y física así como con estrategias desadaptativas de conflicto con la pareja íntima en la adultez. Las minorías étnicas y raciales económicamente vulnerables informan las mayores divergencias en la exposición a experiencias adversas de la infancia, así como en el distrés en la relación y en la salud. Sin embargo, se sabe poco acerca de las conexiones entre las experiencias adversas de la infancia, el distrés relacional y la salud. Por lo tanto, evaluamos un modelo teórico para el rol mediador del distrés relacional a fin de explicar la conexión entre la salud y las experiencias adversas de la infancia con una muestra (N = 96) de minorías raciales o étnicas (87%) predominantemente de bajos recursos. Aplicamos un modelo de ecuaciones estructurales utilizando regresión parcial por mínimos cuadrados con análisis de remuestreo (N = 500). El distrés relacional fortaleció la relación predictiva entre las experiencias adversas de la infancia y la salud, y justificó el 42% de la varianza en la salud. Los resultados ofrecen un respaldo preliminar del distrés de la relación como determinante social de divergencias en la salud con implicancias para una intervención interdisciplinaria en la salud.Alternate abstract:不良童年经历(ACE)是和成年人身体精神健康以及适应不良亲密伴侣冲突策略负面相关的人际间困扰来源。经济方面弱势的少数族裔人群报告接触ACE以及关系困扰和健康方面最大的差异。我们因此测试了一个用于调解关系困扰角色的理论模型来解释ACE和健康之间关系。我们使用了一个主要由低收入少数族裔(N = 96)(87%)构成的样本。我们应用了有自举的部分平方结构登时模型(N = 500)。关系困扰增强ACE和健康之间的预测关系,并导致健康方面42%的变量。结果对关系困扰作为健康差异的一个社会决定因素提供初步支持,并对学科间健康干预有意义。

T1  - SOCIALLY DESIRABLE REPORTING AND THE EXPRESSION OF BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS OF RACE
AN  - 2413373786
AB  - In recent decades, dramatic developments in genetics research have begun to transform not only the practice of medicine but also conceptions of the social world. In the media, in popular culture, and in everyday conversation, Americans routinely link genetics to individual behavior and social outcomes. At the same time, some social researchers contend that biological definitions of race have lost ground in the United States over the last fifty years. At the crossroads of two trends—on one hand, the post-World War II recoil from biological accounts of racial difference, and on the other, the growing admiration for the advances of genetic science—the American public’s conception of race is a phenomenon that merits greater attention from sociologists than it has received to date. However, survey data on racial attitudes has proven to be significantly affected by social desirability bias. While a number of studies have attempted to measure social desirability bias with regard to racial attitudes, most have focused on racial policy preferences rather than genetic accounts of racial inequality. We employ a list experiment to create an unobtrusive measure of support for a biologistic understanding of racial inequality. We show that one in five non-Black Americans attribute income inequality between Black and White people to unspecified genetic differences between the two groups. We also find that this number is substantially underestimated when using a direct question. The magnitude of social desirability effects varies, and is most pronounced among women, older people, and the highly-educated.

T1  - Refining the Line of Distinction between Ethnic Conflict and Security Dilemma: Towards a Theory of Identity Driven Ethnic Conflict
AN  - 2308442377
AB  - The concept of security dilemma has been widely applied to ethnic conflicts in former Yugoslavia and the post-Soviet space. This paper argues that for both methodological clarity and policy formation, we should distinguish between ethnic conflicts caused by security dilemma and ones triggered by ethnic identity. It is argued that identity plays a different role in security dilemmas, but a major one in identity-based ethnic conflicts. Although ethnic identity may be at stake in the operation and dynamics of security dilemma, it is not the causal variable in the outbreak of ethnic conflict. Identity-based conflicts may reproduce many of the features of the security dilemma but have other causal factors. Distinguishing between the differing role of identity in security dilemma and identity based-ethnic conflicts may further our understanding of why certain conflicts have become so intractable, while others are relatively easier to resolve. For testing the hypothesis, empirical evidence is presented from two conflicts in the post-Soviet space with variations in the causal variable.

T1  - Immigrant life satisfaction in Europe: the role of social and symbolic boundaries
AN  - 2211284035
AB  - The cross-national investigation of immigrant subjective well-being remains an understudied field, especially with regard to the link between institutional settings and individual outcomes. We approach this gap by investigating the role of policies regulating immigrant integration for life satisfaction. Immigrants' status and life chances depend on the inclusiveness of integration policies in forms of rights given to immigrants in the receiving country. These policies differentiate immigrants from natives: exclusionary integration policies understood as social boundaries should result in lower levels of well-being. We also consider an alternative policy type (i.e. multicultural policies) as well as symbolic boundaries (i.e. natives' attitudes towards immigrants). We distinguish between national citizens, EU citizens and third-country nationals (TCNs). Results based on up to five rounds of data from the European Social Survey indicate that in terms of life satisfaction only TCNs profit from inclusive integration policies. Furthermore, while political multiculturalism does not play a role, we find that EU migrants appear more susceptible to the negative impact of natives' anti-immigrant attitudes. Policy-making is more important for TCNs, while a migrant-friendly opinion climate is more important for EU migrants. These findings are robust to controlling for unobserved time-constant country heterogeneity via country fixed effects.

T1  - Can agricultural intensification help attain Sustainable Development Goals? Evidence from Africa and Asia
AN  - 2242707065
AB  - Market-oriented agricultural intensification is a major development strategy, yet its alignment with sustainable development goals (SDGs) is unclear. We apply indicators for SDG 2 (eradicate hunger) regarding income, food production, food security and land tenure to recent intensifications in Rwanda and Laos to reveal their disaggregated impacts. We find while market-oriented intensification may generate poverty reduction, it also exacerbated marginalisation and poverty through various forms of land tenure insecurity. Ethnicity and gender were influential factors in Rwanda, and post-conflict resettlement policies in Laos. We discuss implications for development practice and selection of suitable indicators to reflect the ambition of the SDGs.

T1  - Economic Vulnerability, Cultural Decline, and Nativism: Contingent and Indirect Effects
AN  - 2190948013
AB  - ObjectiveNativism, or anti‐immigrant preferences, is increasingly evident within democratic mass publics. In this article, we explore whether economic concerns, perceptions of social decline, or some combination of the two shape these attitudes.MethodOur data are comprised of more than 8,000 survey respondents from nine Western, industrial democracies (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United States). Using mediation analysis, we test for the extent to which economic anxiety and perceptions of cultural decline exert direct and indirect effects on nativism.ResultsOn balance, the effect of economic anxiety—concern regarding job loss and negative economic assessments—on nativism is mostly indirect, affecting nativism by influencing perceptions of cultural decline.ConclusionGiven the strong association between perceptions of social decline and nativism, it appears as though anti‐immigrant sentiments draw from cultural rather than economic concerns. The story, however, does not end there. Perceptions of societal decline are strongly influenced by economic anxiety.

T1  - Elementary School-age Children's Attitudes Toward Children in Same-Sex Parent Families
AN  - 2219122916
AB  - As numbers of families with same-sex parents increase in the United States, children are more likely to encounter diverse family structures. Given that young children can demonstrate in-group bias, prejudicial attitudes, and social exclusion, it is important to understand how children perceive their peers in diverse families. To our knowledge, no studies have assessed elementary-school-age children's attitudes about same-sex parent families. Here, 131 elementary school students (Mage = 7.79 years; 61 girls) viewed images of same-sex (female and male) and other-sex couples with a child and then were asked about their perceptions of these families, particularly the children. Results indicated participants' preferences toward children with other-sex versus same-sex parents. Developmental and practical implications about children's attitudes toward sexual minority parent families are discussed.

T1  - Introduction: European Social Policy and Society after Brexit: Neoliberalism, Populism, and Social Quality
AN  - 2161096834
AB  - The narrow referendum decision for British exit from the European Union (Brexit), and its explosive political consequences, has become a lens through which decades-long tensions in European society can be viewed. The result, which was expected to be a clear Remain victory, has been interpreted as various combinations of: the unleashing of xenophobic and racist anti-immigrant sentiment; a kick back against disinterested elites by ‘left behind’ people; the fermenting of nationalist populism by political and media actors; a clash of cultural values; a rejection of ‘market is all’ globalisation in favour of national borders; or as a reaction against austerity, inequality and insecurity (Corbett, 2016; Goodwin and Heath, 2016; Hobolt, 2016; Inglehart and Norris, 2016; Kaufmann, 2016; Pettifor, 2016; Room, 2016; Seidler, 2018; Taylor-Gooby, 2017). This British-made shock has parallels in and consequences for wider European society. In the Referendum, the EU became an emblematic representation of the distrusted, remote, technocratic elites, who are said to be responsible for an unbelievably large number of societal ills. Meanwhile across Europe there are varieties of Eurosceptic populism and distrust of elites on both the right and left (Ivaldi et al., 2017).

T1  - Racial Segregation and Southern Lynching
AN  - 2120542747
AB  - The literature on ethnic fractionalization and conflict has yet to be extended to the American past. In particular, the empirical relationship between racial residential segregation and lynching is unknown. The existing economic, social, and political theories of lynching contain implicit hypotheses about the relationship between racial segregation and racial violence, consistent with more general theories of social conflict. Because Southern lynching occurred in rural and urban areas, traditional urban measures of racial segregation cannot be used to estimate the relationship. Earlier analysis has analyzed the relationship between lynching and racial proportions, a poor proxy for racial segregation. We use a newly developed household-level measure of residential segregation (Logan and Parman 2017) that can distinguish between the effects of increasing racial homogeneity of a location and the tendency to segregate within a location given a particular racial composition to estimate the correlation between racial segregation and lynching in the southern counties of the United States. We find that conditional on racial composition, racially segregated counties were much more likely to experience lynchings. Consistent with the hypothesis that segregation is related to interracial violence, we find that segregation is highly correlated with African American lynching but uncorrelated with white lynching. These results extend the analysis of racial/ethnic conflict into the past and show that the effects of social interactions and interracial proximity in rural areas are as important as those in urban areas.

T1  - Understanding the dynamics among acculturative stress, coping, and growth: A grounded theory of the Korean immigrant adolescent experience
AN  - 2167806469
AB  - The purpose of the present study is two-fold. First, it aims to develop a theoretical model of the acculturative process of immigrant adolescents based on the understanding of the relationships among acculturative stress, coping, and growth. Second, it aims to propose a typology that offers distinct patterns in the process of acculturation and the resulting outcomes. Using the grounded theory method, the study identified stress related to communication problems, ethnic prejudice, academic pressure, homesickness, and interpersonal conflict. The lack of social support and the school climate were identified as contextual factors of perceived stress. Peer mediation and motivation were identified as intervention factors of coping behaviors. The immigrant adolescent coping behaviors included media use for emotional release, focus on a goal, connectedness to the home country, and the creation of social capital in the host country. The typology of different acculturative patterns classified immigrant adolescents into three types: adaptive, academic, and competent. Based on the findings, the significance of family functioning, peer mediation, self-expansion motivation, and coping behaviors to create social capital for immigrant adolescents' normal development was discussed.

T1  - Believing Facts in the Fog of War: Identity, Media and Hot Cognition in Ukraine's 2014 Odesa Tragedy
AN  - 2139173112
AB  - How do people form beliefs about the factual content of major events when established geopolitical orders are violently challenged? Here, we address the tragic events of 2 May 2014, in Odesa, Ukraine. There, Euromaidan protest movement supporters and opponents clashed following Russia's annexation of Crimea and the onset of the Donbas conflict, culminating in the worst civilian death toll the city had seen since World War II. Shortly after, we surveyed Ukraine's population about who they thought had actually perpetrated the killings and relate people's answers to alternative narratives (frames) that an original content analysis finds were available to Ukrainian citizens through different media. We find evidence, consistent with theories of hot cognition and motivated reasoning, that the Odesa violence triggered emotional responses linked to ethnic, regional, and partisan identity, which then activated attitudes associated with these identities that, in turn, led people to adopt very different (sometimes highly improbable) beliefs about who carried out the killings. Ethnic identity in particular is found to have strongly moderated the effects of television, with Ukrainian television greatly influencing Ukrainians but backfiring among Russians, and Russian television mainly impacting non-Ukrainians. Education and local information are found to reduce susceptibility to televised factual narratives.

T1  - School books or wedding dresses? Examining the cultural dissonance experienced by young Gypsy/Traveller women in secondary education
AN  - 2099589225
AB  - Although considerable attention has been given to issues impacting on the educational experiences of Gypsy/Traveller learners in the UK, most of the literature is oriented towards ethnicity rather than gender. This paper illuminates the experiences of young Gypsy/Traveller women who are engaging with secondary education, and functioning in a dual cultural framework, in a time of increased gender equality. The intersectionality of culture, class and religion frequently conflicts with the notions of gender equality and education, requiring young women to make difficult choices. It is suggested there is an urgent need to problematise and deconstruct stereotypes typically held about Gypsy/Traveller girls, as not all young women feel disengaged, restricted, excluded and in conflict. While some young women, as is their right, wish to conform to cultural-gendered norms, this study has revealed some strong, resilient women who critically challenge values and norms within their community, which negate their right to a full education, to bring about positive change.

T1  - Unpacking Immigrant Health: Policy, Stress, and Demographics
AN  - 2072563519
AB  - Currently, immigration and the status of immigrants are prevalent issues in the national and academic rhetoric as immigration policy is at a standstill in the U.S. At a federal level, passing any humane immigration policy is an uphill battle as the current administration fuels hatred towards this population which often includes referring to immigrants as criminals, animals, and in general dehumanizing the popu- lation. The intersection of such rhetoric and aggressive enforcement practices serves to create oppressive living environments where immigrants work, engage socially, and raise their children. Concomitantly, the status of immigrants’ health and well-being is a critical issue among a segment of immigration scholars because as the restrictive immigration policy context and anti-immigrant rhetoric increases so does the risk for poor health outcomes among immigrants and their families. Emerging evidence suggests that documenta- tion status is a social determinant of health and subsequently has been linked to poor health outcomes (Vargas Busta- mante et al. 2012) through increased stress. Additionally, a growing body of literature reveals the far-reaching effects of anti-immigrant sentiment and policies beyond undocu- mented individuals to family members and entire communi- ties (Vargas and Ybarra 2017; Viruell Fuentes et al. 2012). Immigrants represent 13.3% (42.4 million individuals) of the total U.S. population (Camarota and Zeigler 2016), it is estimated that 11 million immigrants are undocumented (Krogstad et al. 2017), and nearly 26% of children in the U.S. have an immigrant parent (Migration Policy Institute 2016a). Thus, the health consequences associated with the current immigration climate may impact a large segment of the U.S. population, making it a public health concern. This special issue is the first part of a 2-part series on Race and Immigration. In part one, we present a compilation of articles on immigrant health. Collectively, these papers “unpack” various factors that play a role on immigrant’s health and overall well-being. The studies span issues of policy enforcement, how the effects of policy are manifested in the lives of immigrants, and differences by socio-demo- graphics across various groups of immigrants. The first three papers emphasize policy issues.

T1  - Roma political agency and spaces of social inclusion and exclusion: the contradictions of Roma self-governance amidst the rise of Hungary’s radical right
AN  - 2066659276
AB  - This paper examines the perspectives of local Roma leaders regarding the ongoing impacts, contradictions and civic outcomes of Hungary’s 1993 Act 77 on the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities, legislation that created the framework for minority self-governance among Hungary’s thirteen recognized minority groups. We use interview data with Roma self-government leaders to examine the perceptions and experiences of Roma leaders regarding nationality self-governance as, alternately, a mechanism for enhancing social inclusion and political agency and/or, an institution that only exacerbates the exact exclusions it purports to address. We find that while some Roma nationality self-government leaders have been able to assert political agency and use local nationality self-governments for local initiatives, they report marked limitations in the scope of what they are able to do. This is accentuated in places marked by ethnic conflict where leaders struggle with balancing political agency against political cooptation.

T1  - The Portuguese Calçada in Macau: Paving Residual Colonialism with a New Cultural History of Place
AN  - 2100382553
AB  - Drawing on ethnographic research, this article examines the ways in which the calçada portuguesa (“Portuguese pavement”) that the late Portuguese administration developed in Macau (China) was converted into a “cultural item” of Macau’s visual and urban identity. It shows how a project loosely linked to the demise of the colonial, while reclaiming space through a contested operation of urban renewal, transformed the calçada into a seemingly desired spatial and historical narrative, tied to the production of heritage and the emergence of a stronger “theming” strategy of tourism promotion for Macau. Primarily an urban project employed in the revitalization of the cityscape, the incipient calçada encountered culturally inspired resistance and animosity from the Chinese population. At first embodying a contested image and legacy, the pavement has, nevertheless, undergone symbolic regeneration through discursive and material readjustment following its localization into the cultural history of place. Throughout this process, past and present were conflated in a fabrication that eventually undermined the reminiscent equivocal nature of interethnic relations that marked the transition from colonial to postcolonial Macau.

T1  - Make America Christian Again: Christian Nationalism and Voting for Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election
AN  - 2375458033
AB  - Why did Americans vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential election? Social scientists have proposed a variety of explanations, including economic dissatisfaction, sexism, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. The current study establishes that, independent of these influences, voting for Trump was, at least for many Americans, a symbolic defense of the United States' perceived Christian heritage. Data from a national probability sample of Americans surveyed soon after the 2016 election shows that greater adherence to Christian nationalist ideology was a robust predictor of voting for Trump, even after controlling for economic dissatisfaction, sexism, anti-black prejudice, anti-Muslim refugee attitudes, and anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as measures of religion, sociodemographics, and political identity more generally. These findings indicate that Christian nationalist ideology-although correlated with a variety of class-based, sexist, racist, and ethnocentric views-is not synonymous with, reducible to, or strictly epiphenomenal of such views. Rather, Christian nationalism operates as a unique and independent ideology that can influence political actions by calling forth a defense of mythological narratives about America's distinctively Christian heritage and future.

T1  - The impact of acknowledgement and denial of responsibility for harm on victim groups' perceptions of justice, power, and intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2047415574
AB  - Acknowledgement of responsibility for in‐group harmdoing is considered a precondition for reconciliation. However, we know little about its impact on victim groups. Using a mixed methods approach, in two studies in Bangladesh we examined the role of acknowledgement and denial of responsibility on intergroup outcomes. Study 1 used an open‐ended survey to assess Bangladeshis' perceptions about acknowledgement and denial of responsibility for the mass violence committed by the Pakistani army on Bangladeshis during the 1971 war. Study 2 experimentally examined the effects and the potential mechanisms (emotional reactions, perceived injustice, and relative power) through which acknowledgement and denial of responsibility impact two intergroup outcomes: out‐group animosity and willingness for contact. Both studies demonstrated the importance of anger and perceived injustice as mediators of the effects of acknowledgement and denial of responsibility on intergroup outcomes. We draw implications for theory and for strategies to address past victimization across different contexts of conflict.

T1  - Diaspora mobilisation for conflict and post-conflict reconstruction: contextual and comparative dimensions
AN  - 2033278357
AB  - This special issue seeks to move the scholarly conversation beyond notions of conflict-generated diasporas as simply agents of conflict or peace. The field is ripe to unpack the notion of context for diaspora mobilisation in International Relations, the focus and novelty of this special issue. Theorising in this volume goes beyond current prevalent thinking that contexts are host-states in which diasporas live, and original home-states to which they are transnationally connected. The emphasis here is that diasporas have linkages to different contexts, and that their embeddedness in these contexts - simultaneously or sequentially in time - either shapes their mobilizations or is shaped by them. The volume theorises about spatialities and temporalities of diaspora engagement: it emphasises spatial notions such as multi-sited embeddedness, positionality, and translocalism on the one side, and temporal notions such as critical junctures, transformative events, simultaneity, crises, and durability of conflicts on the other. This collection further adds new thematic areas to current scholarly inquiry, opening the discussion beyond interest in diaspora remittances, economic development, and extraterritorial voting. The authors take little-explored paths to examine diasporas as agents in transitional justice processes, contested sovereignty, and fragile and de facto states, as well as in civic and ethnic-based activism.

T1  - Acculturation expectation profiles of Russian majority group members and their intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2085135800
AB  - Employing a person-oriented approach to acculturation expectations held by Russian majority group members, we investigated the presence of groups of profiles and relationships between acculturation expectation profiles and intergroup attitudes. Applying latent profile analysis, we found three easy-to-interpret acculturation expectation profiles: biculturalism expectations, alternate-biculturalism expectations (with public-private domain differences in preference), and assimilation expectations. The subsequent comparative analysis showed that these profiles mainly differed in the extent of the desirability of maintenance of heritage culture, and adoption of the mainstream culture by immigrants only in private domains of life. The biculturalism expectation profile contained individuals who support the idea of a multicultural society. The alternate-biculturalism expectation profile contained individuals with slightly less emphasis on adoption of mainstream acculturation for immigrants, a distinction between preferences in the public and private domains of life, more focus on public domains, and less right-wing authoritarianism. The assimilation expectation profile contained individuals with a higher dangerous worldview and endorsement of discrimination, and lower support of a multicultural ideology, willingness to engage in intergroup contact, and desire of maintenance of heritage acculturation for immigrants. Our study demonstrated the value of a person-oriented approach in a population where subgroups differ in the domain dependence of their acculturation expectations.

T1  - Ghostly Specters, Haunted Ruins and Resistance to the Amnesiac and Exclusivist Divided City
AN  - 2296324239
AB  - “Ghosts”, notes Edensor, “haunt the regulated city and the impossible dreams of totalization”; they disturb political imperatives designed to “bury the past too swiftly in search of the new.” Among many things, ghosts and haunted ruins irradiate the logic and consequences of urban economic development in city centers. This form of urban cloning is an identikit regeneration scheme drawing on adaptive commercial reuse and gentrification, including a sanitized version of localism, which designates areas of the city as themed historical quarters. Ghostly apparitions and hauntings can come in many forms. Hauntings may be old abandoned buildings that stand as anomalous figures in a milieu dominated by the cult of regeneration. These hulking monuments represent complex forms of memory that challenge blank slate ideologies and modes of political amnesia imposed by planners and political elites. Ghosts are also figures – individuals and groups – that are not supposed to be visible in particular spaces. They have supposedly been socially cleansed, removed from and proscribed access to their right to the city. Since they expose hidden narratives and injustices, ghosts can also point the way to new alternatives in imagining political community. While not explicitly deploying the conceptual language of “hauntology,” Thomas F. Carter’s 2003 article “Violent Pastime(s)” prefigures and positions these forms within the context of divided cities – cities that have experienced ethnic violence. In such cities, the gentrification process has an added dimension. These reconstruction projects focus on the city center and its rebuilding symbolizes the successful appearance of the peace process. In divided cities, neoliberal urban regeneration often intersects with the ideals of the “capitalist peace,” an attempt to discipline these places through incentivizing foreign direct investment, tourism and privatization. Urban destruction, in such environments, is transformed into the new chic. Carter focuses on Belfast, a quintessentially divided city. During the conflict, which began in 1969 and officially ended with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, 1400 deaths and over 20,000 people were injured in the city. While a peace process has taken root, the city is better described as “post-violent” rather than “post-conflict” with a toxic mix of territoriality, poverty, paramilitarism and intensifying segregation in the most disadvantaged housing estates.From the 1990s a number of new major infrastructure projects were established in Belfast city center, including a major shopping mall and the commercial redevelopment of the riverfront. As part of recent attempts to “normalize” Belfast, the city center contains the “Cathedral,” “Laganside,” and the “Titanic Quarters” – areas the authorities call “character zones” – that they hope will facilitate “cultural reanimation” and the local economy. The Titanic Quarter, a £7billion, 185-acre site located on deindustrialized shipyards, comprises 180,000 square meters of leisure space, including a heritage center. Opened in 2012, the Titanic Quarter is a slice of nostalgia intended to celebrate an era supposedly before the violent conflict when Belfast was an industrial powerhouse. Such forms of regeneration strive to make memory and identity as objects of public attention by constructing emotional attachment to places and periods from the past as a means of building civic solidarity.

T1  - Oil Multinational Operations in the Niger Delta and its Impact on Indigenous Language of Host Communities
AN  - 2057944020
AB  - In both academic and government administration discourse and debates on the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, significant emphasis has been placed on the devastation of the environment by oil and gas exploration, and its attendant and accompanying socio-economic, political and environmental challenges identifiable by the rate of persistent conflict, bastardization of the people's social values and piercing poverty worsened by the greed of oil companies and limited response by the government of Nigeria. This work is novel in that it takes a departure from the usual analysis and common discourse by empirically investigating, using both qualitative and quantitative research design method, the impacts of the operations of oil multinationals on the indigenous language of host communities in the Niger Delta region. This is against the critical role played by linguistics in fostering the spirit of ethnic identity, unity, loyalty and nationalism which in turn engender peace and sustainable development. Thus, the work examines the dynamics of interconnectedness between the (un)friendly activities of the multinational corporations and the (under)development and (under)representation of the host communities' language. It will also examine the extent to which oil exploration activities have been responsible for the disruption of indigenous cultures as well as its effect on people's indigenous and local languages in the region. The study calls for the re-visitation of the operations of oil multinationals in the region for the avoidance of another form of (linguistic) imperialism, especially in the face of debates on multinational hegemony as they can help in the linguistic and cultural development of Nigeria.

T1  - Humanitarian interventions and the media: broadcasting against ethnic hate
AN  - 2012872237
AB  - Humanitarian interventions routinely come with media components, because of the media's assumed ability to counter hate and support reconciliation. Radio programmes for peace should enable audiences to withstand manipulation and react non-violently in conflict situations. Based in the ideological tradition of modernisation theory, these programmes assume that violent conflict can be overcome by educating individuals. Based on original data from South Sudan, this paper argues that social structure and duty to leaders play a bigger role and that present media interventions are ill suited to the problem. Interventions need to be tailored to the situation instead of relying on generalised responses.

T1  - Choosing a Specialty: Intersections of Gender and Race among Asian and White Women Medical Students in Ontario
AN  - 2113187959
AB  - Forty years ago, Bourne and Wikler (1978) wrote about the challenges women faced in medical school, arguing that women's specialty choices were structurally conditioned by the subtle discrimination they faced, as well as the masculine nature of medical practice. Since then the demographic make-up of the medical profession has changed: today, many entrants are not only women, but also members of racial/ethnic minorities. Have these changes affected women's medical specialty decisions? Adopting an intersectional theoretical lens, this paper explores the experiences and career specialty choices of White and Asian women medical students. We find that discrimination and concerns over work-family conflict continue to shape the specialty choices of women in medicine, but that White and Asian women's experiences differ in meaningful ways. Asian women experience racialized gender discrimination and distinct family pressures, compared to their White counterparts, complicating their specialty choices, and reproducing inequality within the profession.Alternate abstract:Il y a quarante ans, Bourne et Wikler (1978) écrivaient sur les défis auxquels les femmes étaient confrontées dans les écoles de médecine, postulant que les choix de spécialité des femmes étaient structurellement conditionnés par la discrimination subtile qu'elles subissaient, ainsi que par la nature masculine de la pratique médicale. Depuis lors, la composition démographique de la profession médicale a changé : aujourd'hui, de nombreux participants ne sont pas seulement des femmes, mais aussi des membres de minorités raciales / ethniques. Ces changements ont-ils affecté les décisions des femmes en matière de spécialité médicale ? En adoptant une grille théorique intersectionnelle, cet article explore les expériences et les choix de carrière spécialisés des femmes blanches et asiatiques, étudiantes en médecine. Nous constatons que la discrimination et les préoccupations relatives au conflit travail-famille continuent de façonner les choix de spécialité des femmes dans le domaine médical, mais que les expériences des femmes blanches et asiatiques se démarquent de façon significative. Les femmes asiatiques connaissent une discrimination raciale fondée sur le genre et des pressions familiales distinctes, comparées à leurs homologues blanches, ce qui complique leurs choix de spécialité et reproduit l'inégalité au sein de la profession.

T1  - Realistic Group Conflict and Voting for the 2002 Aboriginal Treaty Negotiations Referendum in British Columbia
AN  - 2007683893
AB  - Although Indigenous peoples constitute one of the most socially, economically, and politically marginalized groups in the world, relatively few quantitative social scientists have studied the broader public's views of this ethnicity globally or in Canada. To help isolate the roots of such attitudes, this research note investigates why ordinary British Columbians decided 1. to vote in; and 2. to vote "yes" on the controversial 2002 Aboriginal Treaty Negotiations Referendum. The essay examines the theoretical literature on attitudes toward ethnic minorities in the abstract, which suggests that support for the measure might have been rooted in various forms of realistic group conflict. To evaluate this theory, the research note next examines data from the April 2002 BC Reid Express Poll as well as official census and voting results. Cross-tabulations of the Reid Poll and Gary King-method ecological-inference analysis of the election statistics indicate that regional and ethnic differences but not individual economic circumstances seem to have motivated much of the conflict over this measure.

T1  - Young sexual minority women's definition of community: Toward addressing health disparities in the LGBTQQ community
AN  - 1977214846
AB  - In accord with Healthy People 2020 goals, the elimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) health disparities will require community-level strategies to address stigma, discrimination, and prejudice linked to poor health. We explored how young sexual minority women (YSMW) define LGBTQQ community, community connection, community engagement, and community tensions because these concepts have implications for development and evaluation of health disparities interventions. A total of 30 YSMW (aged 18-24 years) from Michigan participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Participants varied by sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. We analyzed transcribed interviews using thematic analysis and compared emergent themes across sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. Women described community connection in terms of organizational involvement, participation in LGBTQQ spaces, and collective social identity. Participants noted how community connections were linked to stigma towards the LGBTQQ community. YSMW highlighted how divisive tensions exist within subgroups constituting the LGBTQQ community, hindering opportunities for social advocacy, unified policy priorities, and community-level interventions. The heterogeneity of YSMW's experiences identifying with the LGBTQQ community and engaging within LGBTQQ spaces suggest that researchers should attend to the role of community dynamics when developing health disparities interventions and policies. Efforts to reconcile tensions within the LGBTQQ community may strengthen and advance policymakers' ability to address sexuality-related disparities.

T1  - Acculturation Conflict, Cultural Parenting Self-Efficacy, and Perceived Parenting Competence in Asian American and Latino/a Families
AN  - 1972244025
AB  - Parents from immigrant backgrounds must deal with normative parenting demands as well as unique challenges associated with acculturation processes. The current study examines the independent and interactive influences of acculturation conflict and cultural parenting self-efficacy (PSE; e.g., parents' confidence in instilling heritage, American, and bicultural values in their children) on perceptions of general parenting competence. Using data from 58 Asian American and 153 Latin American parents of children in grades 6-12, ethnic differences were also explored. Results suggest that lower acculturation conflict is associated with higher perceptions of general parenting competence for both Asian and Latin American parents. Higher cultural PSE is associated with higher perceived general parenting competence for Latino/a parents only. One significant interaction was found, and only for Asian Americans, whereby the negative association between acculturation conflict and perceptions of parenting competence was weaker for those who felt efficacious in transmitting heritage messages. Results are discussed in light of clinical implications and the need for further recognition and study of culturally relevant factors and frameworks among families from immigrant backgrounds.
Los padres de origen inmigrante deben ocuparse de las exigencias de la crianza normativa así como de los desafíos únicos asociados con los procesos de aculturación. El presente estudio analiza las influencias independientes e interactivas del conflicto de aculturación y la autoeficacia en la crianza cultural (por ejemplo, la confianza de los padres en inculcar valores patrimoniales, estadounidenses y biculturales en sus hijos) en las percepciones de la competencia en la crianza general. Utilizando datos de 58 padres asiático-americanos y 153 padres latinoamericanos de niños entre sexto y doceavo grado, también se analizaron las diferencias étnicas. Los resultados sugieren que un menor conflicto de aculturación está asociado con mayores percepciones de competencia en crianza general tanto en los padres asiático-americanos como en los latinoamericanos. Una mayor autoeficacia en la crianza cultural está asociada con una mayor competencia en la crianza general percibida solo en los padres latinos. Se descubrió una interacción significativa, y solo en los asiático-americanos, a través de la cual la asociación negativa entre el conflicto de aculturación y las percepciones de la competencia en crianza fue más débil para aquellos que se sintieron eficaces en la transmisión de mensajes sobre la tradición. Se debaten los resultados teniendo en cuenta las implicancias clínicas y la necesidad de un reconocimiento y estudio más profundos de los factores y los marcos relevantes a nivel cultural entre las familias de origen inmigrante.

T1  - Same‐Ethnic, Interethnic, and Interracial Friendships Among Asian Early Adolescents
AN  - 2296042148
AB  - This study examined the psychological functions of three friendship types (i.e., same ethnic, interethnic, and interracial) in a sample of 785 sixth‐grade Asian students (Mage = 11.5 years). Participants listed their friends in sixth grade and whether each nominated friend was the same or a different ethnic group. They also reported on their ethnic identity, intergroup relations, and perceived school safety. Results showed that same‐ethnic friendships were related to stronger ethnic identity and interracial friendships were uniquely related to school safety. Interethnic friendships (an Asian friend from a different country of origin) when perceived as same ethnic functioned similarly to same‐ethnic friendships, whereas interethnic friendships perceived as from a different ethnic group, like interracial friendships, were associated with better intergroup relations. Implications for studying friendships in ethnically diverse samples are discussed.

T1  - From 'A Frontier Land' to 'A Piece of North Africa in Italy': The Changing Politics of 'Tunisianness' in Mazara del Vallo, Sicily
AN  - 1957280450
AB  - This article analyzes the conditions leading to the 'ethnic packaging' of the Casbah neighborhood in Mazara del Vallo, Sicily, and the economic and political struggles that ensued. By studying the changing relationship between the neighborhood's built environment, the racialization of Tunisian migrants and the town's transitioning economy, it analyzes transformations of the Casbah from a working-class Sicilian neighborhood, to an 'insanitary' Tunisian ghetto, to a showcase of the town's Mediterranean multiculturalism. Through this analysis, the article makes three arguments. Firstly, by showing that 'ethnic packaging' does not always lead to gentrification but may engender other types of conflict, it argues that the 'marketization' of urban diversity has a variety of consequences tied to cities' positions in broader geographies of uneven development. Secondly, by showing that the changing racialization of Tunisian migrants was produced both through changes to Mazara's built environment and through shifting territorial relations within Italy and across the Mediterranean, it develops a multi-scalar analysis of racialization. Thirdly, by showing that Sicilian depictions of Tunisian migrants changed according to shifting understandings of Sicilian modernity vis-à-vis the north of Italy, it argues that Italian immigration discourses develop in relation to internal forms of 'othering' of southern Italians.

T1  - Hip Afrikaners and neo-tribalism in post-apartheid South Africa
AN  - 2001035702
AB  - This article situates the contemporary commodification of Afrikaner ethnic identity in the ethos of late capitalism, which attributes a central place to aesthetics in the global economy. The manner in which the commercial appeal of markers of Afrikaner ethnicity significantly vacillates across time is of concern here. It is argued that (post)modern expressions of Afrikanerness give access to the superior sensibilities central to hipsterism (which hinge on idiosyncratic or discerning modes of consumption), but also augment such knowledges via an ethnocentric vocabulary which is intelligible mainly to the Afrikaner consumer. By organising themselves into so-called “tribes”, premised on the collective consumption of particular goods in order to become visible—and visibly “cool”—to others, some Afrikaner youths possibly negotiate the loss of a coherent ethnicity (precipitated by the downfall of apartheid and Afrikaner nationalism) by forging new affective and aesthetic connections. A number of commodity items and images illustrative of such processes are discussed. Speculation is offered on the (economic and social) limitations and potentials of the notion of “hip Afrikanerness” available for appropriation by racial or ethnic others who also seek a sense of distinction via consumer culture.

T1  - Structural Violence, Intersectionality, and Justpeace: Evaluating Women's Peacebuilding Agency in Manipur, India
AN  - 1924842292
AB  - The general scholarship on armed conflict in Manipur, India, ignores the experiences of women as agents. Feminist scholarship counters this tendency, revealing women's everyday responses to the violence that constrains them. However, this scholarship often fails to be intersectional, and it lauds every instance of women's agency without evaluating it in terms of its ability to build peace. Employing Kimberlé Crenshaw's underused distinction between structural and political intersectionality and Saba Mahmood's concept of agency, I analyze my field research conducted with women's peacebuilding groups in Manipur in 2014 and 2015. Using structural intersectionality, I first describe the qualitatively different experiences of women peacebuilders living at different social locations. Using political intersectionality as a normative tool, I then show that ethnic and religious hierarchies often disrupt women's attempts to build peace. Interethnic peacebuilding groups that rely on gender-based solidarity tend to privilege the experiences of the women coming from the majority ethnic group. Other peacebuilding groups, bound by ethnicity, often distrust and resent women who come from different ethnic enclaves. I argue that women's peacebuilding agency must aim at an inclusive justpeace if it is to succeed. We should evaluate agency, rather than glorifying all instances of women's responses to violence.

T1  - In 'no man's land': the im/mobility of Serb NGO workers in Kosovo
AN  - 1924017048
AB  - While the technical dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade proceeds, inter-ethnic tensions in the city of Mitrovica in north Kosovo continue to instil uncertainty and insecurity among its inhabitants. This article delves into the im/mobilities for NGO work that the ethnic and conflict related division of the town poses for local Serb NGO workers. The division of the city into a Serbian north and a Kosovo Albanian south, with separate political systems and influence from the international peacebuilding mission, poses obstacles for inter-ethnic cooperation between north and south NGOs. The article explores the ways in which Serb NGO workers navigate these obstacles in order to create physical, social and economic mobility for themselves. It identifies two interrelated dynamics essential to understanding the impact on NGO workers of the conflict reality: one is between national identity and ethno-political space in the context of the specific community; the other, between the local moral order of being 'good Serbs' and internationally formulated aims to engage the locals in peace and reconciliation work. The paper argues that the focus of international peacebuilding missions on inter-ethnic cooperation and policy influencing activities, at least for Serb NGO workers in Mitrovica, impedes the mobility of local NGOs.

T1  - Figured Worlds and American Dreams: An Exploration of Agency and Identity Among Latinx Undocumented Students
AN  - 1900289441
AB  - Undocumented students find themselves on continuously shifting ground, calibrating each decision they make in accordance with or as a strategic reaction to the existing political climate. Specifically, some undocumented students find themselves in an ongoing internal battle to fashion an identity that both counters the pervasive stereotypes of undocumented people through a process of hyperdocumentation (Chang in Harv Educ Rev 81(3):508-520, 2011 ), while simultaneously bearing the weight of fierce anti-immigrant sentiment. In this article, we ask the following questions: How do Latinx undocumented students navigate educational spaces? In what ways do their legal statuses impact the production of their identities? How do they exert agency within the parameters of their undocumented status? In answering these questions, we explore the ways in which some undocumented students figure--or take agency in shaping meaning of--their worlds, find identity in their education, and leverage community cultural wealth (Yosso in Race Ethn Educ 8(1):69-91, 2005 ) as a source of critical hope and resilience in their quest to achieve the ever-nebulous American Dream.

T1  - Collective memory and reputational politics of national heroes and villains
AN  - 2697558547
AB  - The politics of memory plays an important role in the ways certain figures are evaluated and remembered, as they can be rehabilitated or vilified, or both, as these processes are contested. We explore these issues using a transition society, Georgia, as a case study. Who are the heroes and villains in Georgian collective memory? What factors influence who is seen as a hero or a villain and why? How do these selections correlate with Georgian national identity? We attempt to answer these research questions using a newly generated data set of contemporary Georgian perspectives on recent history. Our survey results show that according to a representative sample of the Georgian population, the main heroes from the beginning of the twentieth century include Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Ilia Chavchavadze, and Patriarch Ilia II. Eduard Shevardnadze, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, and Vladimir Putin represent the main villains, and those that appear on both lists are Mikheil Saakashvili and Joseph Stalin. We highlight two clusters of attitudes that are indicative of how people think about Georgian national identity, mirroring civic and ethnic conceptions of nationalism. How Georgians understand national identity impacts not only who they choose as heroes or villains, but also whether they provide an answer at all.

T1  - Competition over collective victimhood recognition: When perceived lack of recognition for past victimization is associated with negative attitudes towards another victimized group
AN  - 1906667164
AB  - Groups that perceive themselves as victims can engage in "competitive victimhood." We propose that, in some societal circumstances, this competition bears on the recognition of past sufferings--rather than on their relative severity--fostering negative intergroup attitudes. Three studies are presented. Study 1, a survey among Sub-Saharan African immigrants in Belgium (N=127), showed that a sense of collective victimhood was associated with more secondary anti-Semitism. This effect was mediated by a sense of lack of victimhood recognition, then by the belief that this lack of recognition was due to that of Jews' victimhood, but not by competition over the severity of the sufferings. Study 2 replicated this mediation model among Muslim immigrants (N=125). Study 3 experimentally demonstrated the negative effect of the unequal recognition of groups' victimhood on intergroup attitudes in a fictional situation involving psychology students (N=183). Overall, these studies provide evidence that struggle for victimhood recognition can foster intergroup conflict.

T1  - Political and Linguistic Identities in an Ethnic Conflict
AN  - 1865121347
AB  - Language is a powerful marker for social discrimination, often associated with stereotypes and prejudices against various social groups. However, less is known about the psychological role of language during ethnolinguistic conflicts. In such conflicts, the political rivalry is closely intertwined with language ideology. We consider two independent paths through which language might trigger social discrimination. The first one is related to linguistic identity, where a person could favor those who speak like her. The second one is related to political identity, where a person could favor those who use the language associated with the person's political views. In the context of the conflict in Ukraine, we find empirical support only for the political identity explanation and no support for the linguistic identity one.

T1  - Using Groups to Measure Intergroup Prejudice
AN  - 1851015712
AB  - Implicit measures of racial attitudes often assess reactions to images of individuals to infer attitudes toward an entire social category. However, an increasing amount of research indicates that responses to individuals are highly dependent on context and idiosyncratic features of individual exemplars. Thus, using images of individuals to assess beliefs about a whole social category may not be ideal. Across three time points, we predicted that using images of groups would mitigate the influence of idiosyncratic features of individual targets and, thus, provide a better measurement tool to assess beliefs about a category to which all group members belong. Results revealed that an implicit measure that presented images of Black and White groups had greater construct validity, test-retest reliability, and predictive validity as compared with an implicit measure that presented the same exemplars individually. We conclude that groups provide a window into existing beliefs about social categories.

T1  - Between entrenchment, reform and transformation: ethnicity and Lebanon's consociational democracy
AN  - 1825233408
AB  - Consociationalism has become a key institutional mechanism for managing conflict after civil war. Proponents argue that a period of consociational influence can contribute to the erosion of ethnic cleavages and even a society where ethnicity is depoliticized. Critics, however, are sceptical of this claim and argue that consociationalism institutionalizes ethnic identities and stymies the transition to a healthier democracy. In response, proponents outline a liberal model of consociationalism which limits the pre-determination of ethnicity in social and political structures. Yet, problematically, consociations in postwar societies often provide guarantees of ethnic representation in order to entice belligerents to abandon violence for democracy. This issue of transitioning from a corporate consociation to a more liberal form requires sustained analysis. This paper examines this conundrum by examining contemporary Lebanese consociationalism. Given that ethnicity is central to debates about revising consociationalism, via qualitative interviews with Lebanese political elites and civil society activists, the paper analyses how these subjects conceptualize ethnicity in contrasting ways which generate different approaches to consociationalism but which ultimately frustrate meaningful reform. It does this by exploring various debates to entrench, reform or transform Lebanese consociationalism.

T1  - Political and institutional determinants of immigration policies
AN  - 2076967896
AB  - This paper investigates how the interplay of parties' preferences, political institutions and electoral competition affects the liberalisation of immigration policies. It joins a growing body of research that focuses on the role of domestic factors in shaping immigration policies. While several studies point to the important role of partisanship and the activation of public opinion, they fail to provide a clear mechanism that takes into account differences in parties' preferences as well as the institutional context they act in. By adding two crucial factors to the analysis, this paper presents a new framework for liberal change in the field of immigration politics. First, institutional veto points determine if left-of-centre parties can reform policies according to their preferences. Second, the degree of electoral competition and the politicisation of immigration issues affect how susceptible political parties are to the anti-immigrant sentiment in the population. A time-series cross-section analysis of 11 countries from 1980 to 2006 shows that left-of-centre governments are more likely to pass liberal reforms, but only if they are not facing an open veto point. Moreover, increased levels of electoral competition coupled with a politicisation of the immigration issue reduces the likelihood of liberal reforms.

T1  - Who's Asking? Interviewer Coethnicity Effects in African Survey Data
AN  - 1876118805
AB  - Face-to-face interviews constitute a social interaction between interviewer and respondent, and in the African context, social interactions are strongly shaped by ethnicity. Yet research using African survey data typically fails to account for the effect of shared ethnicity on survey responses. We find that respondents give systematically different answers to coethnic and noncoethnic interviewers across surveys in 14 African countries, but with significant variation in the degree of bias across question types and types of noncoethnic dyads, with the largest effects occurring where both the respondent and interviewer are members of ethnic groups with a history of political competition and conflict, and where the respondent or interviewer shares an ethnicity with the head of state. Our findings have practical implications for consumers of African survey data and underscore the context dependence of the social interaction that constitutes the survey experience.

T1  - The rediscovery of 'the national' in the 1990s - contexts, new cultural forms and practices in reunified Germany
AN  - 1817008098
AB  - This article examines how and in which societal and political contexts nationhood is expressed and symbolised in reunified Germany. This 'rediscovery' of nationhood since the 1990s mixes new and old motifs of the cultural repertoire of 'the national' for different purposes. Three main contexts triggered a rediscovery of 'the national' after 1989: reunification, immigration and the retrenchment of the social state. I argue, by analysing ethnographic material and political discourses, that these contexts, on the one hand, rearticulate old forms of ethnic and cultural nationalism and, on the other hand, create new images and symbols of an open civic society and immigration country. There are 'playful' forms, such as campaigns of nation branding, that symbolically include the 'productive' and 'useful' immigrant into the national project. Moreover, such campaigns serve to legitimatise the downsizing of the national state that - according to a neoliberal attitude - relies on a new community spirit of entrepreneurial, 'activated' citizens who 'help themselves'. Thus, focusing on these pluralised renationalisation processes makes evident how polyvalent 'the national' still is. It can be employed by those who attempt to 'reunite' the East and West Germans, by businesses to sell their goods and ideas and by almost any political orientation, be it right-wing or left-wing.

T1  - Lucrecia Martel's Nueva Argirópolis: Rivers, Rumours and Resistance
AN  - 1875427162
AB  - This article analyses Lucrecia Martel's 2010 short film Nueva Argirópolis, which was commissioned by the Argentine Ministry of Culture as part of the Bicentennial celebrations. It explains how the film both inhabits yet contests the discourses of the modern nation state underpinning those celebrations, in particular through its representation of conflict between the state and indigenous groups. Its representation draws on images proposed by an earlier work, Sarmiento's utopian tract of 1850, Argirópolis, images including the river and the island which in Martel's film undergo a resignification, which overturns Sarmiento's understanding of relationships between geography, capital, nation and ethnicity. Political and cultural debates of particular relevance to indigenous communities, such as access to land, as well as the way the indigenous are represented in state discourses, surface obliquely in this short film, which both represents diegetically the circulation and relay of rumours of indigenous resistance, as well as suggesting these formally through a soundtrack suffused with murmurs and barely audible sounds. The unsubtitled words of indigenous actors, as well as the authorities' attempts at investigation of indigenous political activity through staging encounters of (failed) interpretation, and the subversive mimicry by indigenous activists of hegemonic ideas of national foundation are themselves muted, rumoured suggestions of a resistance which always lies just outside this short film's visual grasp.

T1  - 'No more Turkish music!' The acculturation strategies of teachers and ethnic minority students in Flemish schools
AN  - 2076970551
AB  - While considerable research has focused on the process and factors affecting acculturation, there is little research that investigates how members of minority and majority groups define acculturation in educational settings. Ethnographic research and qualitative interviews in three secondary schools in Flanders (Belgium) show that teachers and ethnic minority students have different ideas and expectancies regarding the concept 'integration', which appears to affect student-teacher relationship. Berry et al.'s [1989. "Acculturation Attitudes in Plural Societies." Applied Psychology: An International Review 3 (2): 185-206. doi:10.1111/j.1464-0597.1989.tb01208.x.] acculturation orientations are used as a theoretical template to analyse teachers' and ethnic minority students' discourses about acculturation. Analyses reveal that students of immigrant descent perceive acculturation mainly in terms of the establishment of intergroup contact. In contrast, teachers find it harder to disconnect cultural maintenance from contact and participation. By suggesting some form of cultural adoption, teachers hope to socialise their ethnic minority students into the culture of the dominant ethnic group and prepare them for their future. These distinct interpretations of 'integration' in everyday life (which actually refers to acculturation) often leads to misunderstandings between ethnic minority students and their teachers, even to conflict, as many students feel that their cultural background is disparaged and not fully valued in school.

T1  - Return Migration and the Profiling of Non-Citizens: Highly Skilled BRIC Migrants in the Mexico-US Borderlands and Arizona's SB 1070
AN  - 1813614774
AB  - Based on interviews conducted between 2011 and 2012, this paper examines how highly skilled migrants from Brazil, Russia, India, and China in Arizona have experienced acculturation to US racial norms and heightened anti-immigration sentiment since 9/11, which in this state culminated in the passage of Senate Bill 1070. We found that negative experiences with incorporation into US racial hierarchies, immigration enforcement at the Mexico-US border, and profiling as 'foreigners' had little impact on their deliberations to return to countries that have become new engines for global growth at a time of US economic decline. Interviewees tended to interpret their experiences as having been mistaken for members of other targeted groups, expected exemption from SB 1070 because of their highly skilled and/or documented status, and lacked knowledge of a now defunct provision in the bill that would have affected immigrants by criminalising failure to carry proper documentation. Instead of immigration experiences or the economic downturn in the US, participants were deterred from return because of perceived deficiencies in their countries of origin, which mitigated the attractiveness of the new economic opportunities there.

T1  - The Return of Prejudice in Europe's Regions: The Moderated Relationship between Group Threat and Economic Vulnerability
AN  - 1811370086
AB  - Using data from 16 countries and employing multilevel analysis that encompasses the national, regional, and individual levels, we find that both economic and social factors trigger anti-immigrant attitudes among Europeans. Regional per capita GDP is positively correlated with tolerant attitudes while the regional unemployment rate drives prejudice. We find a moderating relationship between immigrant population size and per capita GDP, which suggests that, as the size of the immigrant population increases, prejudice rises but only in poorer regions. In more affluent regions, an increase in the immigrant population corresponds to increased tolerance.

T1  - The global, the ethnic and the gendered war: women and rape in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
AN  - 1764148933
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted) 
The purpose of this study was to illuminate the perspectives of women who experienced sexual violence perpetrated in the warscapes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Civilians are targeted for rape, loot and pillage yielding deleterious effects on the social fabric and the sustenance the community provides. The article is based on 11 qualitative semistructured interviews and 4 written narratives from women of reproductive age, recruited from organizations providing support post-sexual violation. The study departs from a larger ethnographic project investigating the phenomenon of war-rape. Thematic analysis guided the analysis through the theoretical lenses of structural violence and intersectionality. The women expressed total insecurity and a multitude of losses from bodily integrity, health, loss of family, life course possibilities, livelihoods and a sense of place; a profound dispossession of identity and marginalization. Pregnancies resulting from rape reinforced stigma and burdened the survivor with raising a stigmatized child on the margins of society. Perpetrators of rape were mostly identified as Interhamwe (Rwandan Hutus rebels) who entered Congo after the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Their goal, according to the women, was to spread HIV and impregnate Congolese women, thereby destroying families, communities and society. The women survivors of war-rape described experiences of profound loss in this conflict which has global, ethnic and gendered dimensions. Congo's conflict thus requires critical reflection on how local wars and subsequent human suffering are situated in a matrix of globalization processes, enabled by transnational actors and embedded in structural violence.

T1  - Predicting Attitudes Toward Gay Men with Ambivalence Toward Men, Questioning Religion, and Gender Differences
AN  - 1771300048
AB  - Prejudicial attitudes and discrimination toward gay men is a common social problem in Turkey as it is in many other countries. It is important to understand the reasons behind the prejudice against gay men in a sexist and Muslim country, Turkey. The purpose of the study was to predict attitudes toward gay men with ambivalent attitudes toward men (hostility toward men, and benevolence toward men), questioning religion, and gender differences. Three hundred seventy-two (91 male and 281 female) heterosexual Muslim students from several universities in Ankara completed Attitudes toward Gay men Scale, Ambivalence toward Men Inventory, and Questioning Religion Scale. The mean age of the participants was 22.79 (SD=3.07). Results, in general, demonstrated that gender differences, benevolence toward men, and questioning religion predicted attitudes toward gay men. Men were more prejudiced against gay men than women. Participants who scored high on benevolence toward men and low on questioning religion were also more prejudiced against gay men than those who scored low on benevolence toward men and high on questioning religion. Further, gender differences was a moderator variable for the association between hostility toward men and attitudes toward gay men. When the regression analyses were performed separately for female and male participants, it was seen that hostility toward men, benevolence toward men, and questioning religion predicted attitudes toward gay men for women whereas for men only benevolence toward men and questioning religion predicted attitudes toward gay men. Results were discussed in the light of relevant literature.

T1  - Black Politics and the Neoliberal Racial Order
AN  - 1774329693
AB  - This article examines how the racial order in the United States has evolved since the Jim Crow era. Two leading characterizations of the current situation are that we live in a postracial society and that we live in an era best described as the New Jim Crow. We probe the key differences between the Jim Crow racial order and the racial terrain of the current period and come to the conclusion that both claims are inadequate because they are tied to a sanitized and restricted understanding of Jim Crow as a set of legal and state institutions and policies. As such, both frames neglect the economic sphere. This article addresses this silence in the context of black politics. Specifically, we argue that a neoliberal racial order has emerged and that analyses of black politics must attend to the way racial divisions have become magnified in economic policies and civil society. A key claim is that a critical difference between this era and the Jim Crow era is the adoption of neoliberal ideology and support for neoliberal policies by a wide and diverse segment of black elites.

T1  - Settler colonialism in Canada and the Métis
AN  - 1784151555
AB  - Although the literature on settler colonialism intends to identify what is specific about the settler colonial experience, it can also homogenize diverse settler colonial narratives and contexts. In particular, in Canada, discussion of the 'logic of elimination' must contend with the discrete experiences of multiple Indigenous groups, including the Métis. This article examines relationships between Métis people and settler colonialism in Canada to distinguish how Métis histories contribute to a broader narrative of settler colonial genocide in Canada. Cast as 'halfbreeds' and considered rebels by the newly forming Canadian nation-state, Métis peoples were discouraged from 'illegitimate breeding'. Moreover, their unique experiences of the residential school system and forced sterilization have heretofore been underexplored in historiographies of genocide and settler colonial elimination in Canada. These social, political and racial divisions in Canada are magnified through genocidal structures and they reach a critical juncture between colonialism and mixed ethnicities. At that juncture, groups like the Métis in Canada are within a metaphorical gap or, more accurately, a jurisdictional gap. Colonial treatment of the Métis demonstrates, in part, the broad reach of colonial control and how uneven it is, often to the detriment of the Métis and Indigenous groups in Canada.

T1  - From Meta to Micro: Examining the Effectiveness of Educational TV: PROD
AN  - 1730024660
AB  - There are numerous media offerings targeted to young audiences that claim to have educational benefits. It is hard to overemphasize the need for evidence about which of these offerings are effective, for which populations, and for which outcomes. The current article begins by discussing the value and limitations of meta-analysis (as opposed to narrative literature reviews) as a tool for marshaling such evidence. We illustrate these points with a recent meta-analysis of the educational impact of Sesame Street international coproductions. We then present two further studies that emerged from one aspect of the findings, examining effects of educational TV narratives on children's racial/ethnic attitudes.

T1  - The Decolonial Mandela
AN  - 1790887608
AB  - This article provides a fresh decolonial reading of Nelson Mandela's political life and legacy as an embodiment of critical decolonial ethics of liberation that is opposed to imperial/colonial/apartheid paradigm of war and its logics of racial profiling, classification, and hierarchization of human beings. The paradigm of war is underpinned by the paradigm of difference and working in combination, they enabled the denial of the humanity of black people, their enslavement, conquest, colonization, dispossession, exploitation, and notions of impossibility of copresence of human races. Mandela emerges at the center of this imperial/colonial/apartheid milieu vehemently opposed to the paradigm of war, logic of racism, and coloniality. After enduring 27 years of incarceration at the notorious Robben Island, Mandela avoided bitterness and preached the gospel of racial harmony, reconciliation, and democracy. His leadership during the transition from apartheid to democracy inaugurated a paradigm shift from Nuremberg paradigm of justice to a new paradigm of political justice privileging political reform and social transformation. As the first black president of South Africa, Mandela practically and symbolically made important overtures to the erstwhile white racists aimed at hailing them back to a new, inclusive, nonracial, democratic, and pluriversal society known as the rainbow nation.

T1  - Genocide as predation
AN  - 1735656935; 201537792
AB  - Donald Black (1983) distinguishes between moralistic violence, which occurs in response to conflict, and predatory violence, which enables exploitation. Genocide, I have argued in previous work (Campbell, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013), is moralistic. It is a form of social control that occurs in response to ethnic conflicts. But as I argue here, genocide is partly predatory. The perpetrators of genocide kill in response to grievances, but they may also rob and rape their targets, take their land, or force them to labor. Pure sociological theories of social control and predation can explain both aspects of genocide. The social conditions conducive to extreme moralism and extreme predation are similar, and so the targets of genocide are treated both as enemies to be eliminated and resources to be plundered.

T1  - Education in the conflict-affected Moluccas: Local tradition, identity politics and school principal leadership
AN  - 1718069885; 201531926
AB  - The Moluccas were among the provinces devastated by communal conflict following the fall of the New Order regime in 1998. Peace-building activities were conducted after the violence subsided. The field research for this ethnographic study was conducted in the province from January to December 2009. The objective of the study was to examine the nature and impact of peace education projects supported by foreign agencies in selected schools in the province. The findings show that suspicion and hatred between Muslim and Christian students remained intact in Schools 1, 2 and 3, despite the fact that they received a peace education intervention. In these schools, the peace education projects were framed within what was perceived as Moluccan local tradition. However, School 4 was able to mitigate the effects of the conflict and to nurture peace in the school, despite the fact that it did not receive a specifically tailored peace education intervention. Students of School 4 showed a strong preference for national identity, which encompasses religious and ethnic boundaries. The study indicates that identity politics were at play in the form of the inclusion of what was perceived as Moluccan local tradition but the exclusion of other possibilities in the peace education curriculum, as the cases of Schools 1, 2 and 3 show. The study also shows that school principal leadership was prominent in helping to create a peaceful atmosphere, as the case of School 4 reveals. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Political Polarization as a Social Movement Outcome: 1960s Klan Activism and Its Enduring Impact on Political Realignment in Southern Counties, 1960 to 2000
AN  - 1650145408; 201503076
AB  - Radical social movements can exacerbate tensions in local settings while drawing attention to how movement goals align with political party agendas. Short-term movement influence on voting outcomes can endure when orientations toward the movement disrupt social ties, embedding individuals within new discussion networks that reinforce new partisan loyalties. To demonstrate this dynamic, we employ longitudinal data to show that increases in Republican voting, across several different time intervals, were most pronounced in southern counties where the Ku Klux Klan had been active in the 1960s. In an individual-level analysis of voting intent, we show that decades after the Klan declined, racial attitudes map onto party voting among southern voters, but only in counties where the Klan had been active.

T1  - Do 'they' threaten 'us' or do 'we' disrespect 'them': Majority perceptions of intergroup relations and everyday contacts with immigrant minorities
AN  - 1700674506; 201524910
AB  - The present study examined how majority perceptions of intergroup relations afford different contact experiences with immigrant minorities. Majority students attending culturally diverse high schools first completed a survey that measured the extent to which they perceived immigrant minorities as either threatening to the majority or discriminated by the majority. Two weeks later, the same majority students kept a 1-week diary of their contacts with immigrant minorities. As expected, perceived threat at premeasurement was positively associated with situated threat-related appraisals and emotions (e.g., fear) during everyday contacts with immigrant minorities 2-3 weeks later. In contrast, acknowledgment of discrimination at premeasurement was positively associated with perspective taking and enrichment-related appraisals and emotions (e.g., admiration). These findings suggest that generalized threat perceptions can become self-enforcing through repeated threatening contact experiences; but also that an alternative perception of minorities as disrespected by the majority may underlie more positive contact experiences.

T1  - Creating positive out-group attitudes through intergroup couple friendships and implications for compassionate love
AN  - 1692289594; 201521301
AB  - Building personal relationships with out-group members is an important catalyst of positive intergroup attitudes. In a 2 * 2 experimental design, Caucasian and African American individuals and couples were randomly assigned to interact in either cross-race or same-race individual dyads and couple pairs. Participants completed pretest measures of race attitudes and engaged in a high self-disclosure closeness-induction task with an in-group or out-group race member in pairs of couples or individuals and completed measures of self-disclosure and intergroup attitudes. These results suggest that intergroup contact in the presence of romantic partners may be particularly effective for improving intergroup attitudes. We explore the implications of these results for developing compassionate love toward out-groups. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - No Blacks Allowed: Segregated Gifted Education in the Context of Brown v. Board of Education
AN  - 1650131314
AB  - This article examines the under-representation of Black students in gifted education, asserting that social inequalities (e.g., prejudice and discrimination) contribute to segregated gifted education programs. Under-representation trends are presented for gifted education, along with methods for calculating under-representation and then inequity goals. Philosophically, this article is grounded in disparate impact discourse, where outcome is more cogent than intent. Denying access to gifted education based on race is immoral and illegal. Pragmatically, under-representation is couched under the larger and more comprehensive achievement gaps and inequities in school settings with implications for de jure segregation. We discuss the under-representation of Black students in gifted education with Brown v. Board of Education as the legal foundation and then focus briefly on a recent court case in gifted education (McFadden v. Board of Education for Illinois School District U-46) for a contemporary point of discussion. Recommendations for desegregating gifted education for Black students regarding attitudes, instruments, and policies and procedures are provided.

T1  - The downsides of national identification for minority groups in intergroup conflicts in assimilationist societies
AN  - 1541997945; 201426781
AB  - The current study considered the downsides of national identification for minority groups in intergroup conflicts in assimilationist societies. This study examined how, in the Turkish national context, the national and ethnic identifications of ethnic Turks (N = 103) and ethnic Kurds (N = 58) predict construals (i.e., conflict frames, attributions of responsibility, and severity of harm) of Turkish-Kurdish conflict. The results indicated that, across groups, a shared national identification was associated with similar conflict construals in line with the official Turkish narrative, whereas ethnic identification was associated with opposing conflict construals that might help maintain the conflict. However, the conflict narrative related to national identification might produce a shared understanding of the conflict (i.e., more intergroup harmony) at the cost of neglecting the minority group's grievances in the conflict and legitimizing the status-quo, thus hindering efforts to enhance the minority group's disadvantaged status.

T1  - Managing Religious Conflicts in Nigeria: The Inter-Religious Mediation Peace Strategy
AN  - 1767327313; 201609171
AB  - Nigeria with over 150 million people consists of muslims and christians who live across the country. The religious divide in the country crisscrosses more than 250 ethnic groups as well as deep political divisions that cross religious lines. Over the last decade, numerous 'hot-spots' around the country have suffered from pervasive violent religious conflict, with devastating impact on the citizenry and the peaceful coexistence in the Nigerian state. It is not surprising therefore that the Federal Government of Nigeria and some non-governmental organizations have decided to pay special attention to this challenge by putting in place innovative structures designed to provide effective solutions to the phenomenon of violent religious conflicts in Nigeria. No doubt, the inter-religious mediation organ represents an energetic and indispensable vehicle for achieving lasting peace among divergent religious groupings in the country.

T1  - Gatekeeping Twitter: message diffusion in political hashtags
AN  - 1494750451; 201402838
AB  - This article explores the structure of gatekeeping in Twitter by means of a statistical analysis of the political hashtags #FreeIran, #FreeVenezuela and #Jan25, each of which reached the top position in Twitter Trending Topics. We performed a statistical correlation analysis on nine variables of the dataset to evaluate if message replication in Twitter political hashtags was correlated with network topology. Our results suggest an alternative scenario to the dominant view regarding gatekeeping in Twitter political hashtags. Instead of depending on hubs that act as gatekeepers, we found that the intense activity of individuals with relatively few connections is capable of generating highly replicated messages that contributed to Trending Topics without relying on the activity of user hubs. The results support the thesis of social consensus through the influence of committed minorities, which states that a prevailing majority opinion in a population can be rapidly reversed by a small fraction of randomly distributed committed agents.

T1  - Ethnodoxy: How Popular Ideologies Fuse Religious and Ethnic Identities
AN  - 1364700586; 201325914
AB  - Popular beliefs conflating ethnic identities with particular faiths can lead to marginalization of religiously and ethnically "other" and fuel ethnoreligious conflict even in secularized societies. Despite their importance to ethnoreligious conflict and coexistence, ideological conflations of faith and ethnos have previously received little scholarly attention. We fill the gap by introducing the concept of ethnodoxy: a collectively held belief system that rigidly links a group's ethnic identity to its dominant faith. We theorize this phenomenon at three levels: macro (the interplay between religion and ethnonational identities), micro (construction of ethnoreligious identities and imagined communities viewed from a social identity theory perspective), and meso (the nature and functions of popular ideologies and religiosities). Subsequently, ethnodoxy is conceptualized as an ideal-typical syndrome of six component beliefs. We further operationalize and verify the concept using representative national survey data from Russia. Findings show ethnodoxy's extent, coherence, dimensionality, and associations with religious and ethnic intolerance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Nationalism in the Russian media: content analysis of newspaper coverage surrounding conflict in Stavropol, 24 May–7 June 2007
AN  - 2697556699
AB  - This paper considers the role of Russian print media and government in forming and publicizing nationalist sentiment through a content analysis of newspaper coverage of ethnic conflict in Stavropol in 2007. It shows that though the government officially pursues an inclusive multicultural approach (which I call associative nationalism), newspapers owned by Kremlin-loyal business holdings printed quite nationalist and sensationalist versions of the events in question. I argue that this is a passive promotion of a dissociative type of nationalism on the part of the Kremlin, which works against its stated purposes of bringing together all those in the Russian territory into a united national identity.

T1  - Parent-child relations and psychological adjustment among high-achieving Chinese and European American adolescents
AN  - 1494749728; 201401023
AB  - Chinese American students are often perceived as problem-free high achievers. Recent research, however, suggests that high-achieving Chinese American students can experience elevated levels of stress, especially comparing to their peers from other ethnic groups. In this paper, we examine how family dynamics may influence psychological adjustment among a group of high-achieving adolescents. Drawing on survey data collected on 295 Chinese American and 192 European American 9th graders attending a highly selective magnet school, our findings show that Chinese American adolescents reported significantly lower levels of psychological adjustment (d=-.31), and significantly less family cohesion (d=-.34) and more conflict (d=.56) than their European American peers. Further, the ethnic differences on adjustment disappeared after controlling for perceptions of family cohesion and conflict, indicating that such perceptions may be a key factor in understanding the high academic achievement/low psychological adjustment paradoxical pattern of development among Chinese American adolescents.

T1  - Secondary Transfer Effects of Intergroup Contact: A Cross-National Comparison in Europe
AN  - 1364702694; 201323224
AB  - This article examines so-called secondary transfer effects of intergroup contact, a phenomenon whereby positive intergroup contact experiences can influence attitudes not only toward encountered (primary) outgroups but also toward other (secondary) outgroups that were not initially involved in the intergroup encounter. The current study relies on a unique cross-sectional sample of the general population drawn from eight European countries (N = 7,042) to examine the relationship between intergroup contact with immigrants and attitudes toward primary (immigrants) and secondary (homosexuals and Jews) outgroups. Results showed that intergroup contact was not only directly related with primary outgroup attitudes but also indirectly associated with secondary outgroup attitudes, via attitude generalization. These relationships occurred primarily for individuals low in social dominance orientation. Findings are discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding secondary transfer effects of contact as well as the role of social dominance orientation as a moderator of such effects.

T1  - 'Fear of numbers': Reflections on the South African case
AN  - 1914392932
AB  - Arjun Appadurai's The Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger (2006) draws largely on the case of India for empirical data. The 'fear of small numbers' that he discusses relates to the insecurity of contemporary societies, where 'pollution' of the national body by minority groups leads not only to irritation and discomfort but at times to the need for the violent cleansing of the pollutant, to conflict. Neville Alexander (2008), similarly, said that 'to define yourself into a minority corner in a situation such as the transition in South Africa is to play with fire in an almost literal sense'. In South Africa, historically, concerns with population numbers concern neither minorities nor majorities, but the manipulation of both through classification and counting of categories. South Africa presents us with the fear of numbers, both large and small. Such an approach demands acknowledgement of the complexity and international comparative studies of census-taking.

T1  - South Africans and Mexicans in Florida: Intergroup Conflict
AN  - 1928250865
AB  - Newly arriving immigrants from Southern Africa and Mexicans do not get on well in the sunbelt state of Florida. A persistent theme emerging from discussions with South Africans on their relationship with Mexicans is that both sides perceive the other as culturally ethnocentric. The antagonistic relationship between both social groups is due to strong ethnic bonds and the clash of cultures.

T1  - Managing culture in post-conflict societies
AN  - 862597361; 201110536
AB  - An extensive literature has paid attention to the role of cultural identity and symbols as markers of ethnic conflict. Yet we do not understand fully whether cultural expressions at the heart of the conflict are transformed into a new post-conflict symbolic landscape or whether they remain the source of ongoing cultural contestation. I explore this question by investigating cultural contestation in post-Agreement Macedonia and Northern Ireland. Theoretically, I consider the importance of cultural differences in the integration versus accommodation debate on constitutional design in divided societies. Empirically, I draw on original research from the two cases whereby the respective peace agreements were designed to manage a self-determination dispute. First, I argue that symbolic controversies relating to cultural emblems, flags and insignia pose a particular kind of test for the stability of power-sharing systems. In such instances ethnic elites are faced with the wider legacy and competing narratives of the conflict. In accommodationist systems, where the groups' cultural identity is to be promoted in both private and public spheres, instances of cultural contestation will likely trigger considerable political wrangling between ethnic parties in the search for compromise.

T1  - Introduction: The Problem of Violence
AN  - 964189691; 201207662
AB  - The scale and diversity of megacities finds analogous scale and diversity in the violence witnessed and experienced in these complexly dense urban sites. From full-scale military invasion to internecine ethnic and tribal conflict, from paramilitary incursions to strategic car bombs, from slum clearance to pervasive everyday low-level violence, from Mafia-led armies to incessant inflictions of violence on the urban poor, and from missile launches to machete attacks, megacities, most unfortunately, have them all. This article contextualizes many of the key concerns and issues addressed by the four main articles in the section; it does so by arguing for some specific historical, genealogical and technological explanations for the range and scale of violence inflicted upon and within megacity sites. The section proleptically discusses megacity phenomena that will be taken up in greater detail in the forthcoming second volume of the New Encyclopaedia Project Megacities: Problematizing the Urban.

T1  - Review of the Circumstances Among Children in Immigrant Families in Australia
AN  - 1939732155
AB  - Australia has always had a very high level of immigration. There were about 1.5 million children 0 to 17 years of age in immigrant families in Australia in 2001. This represented almost 33% of all children. More than a quarter of these children were in families from the most consistent countries of immigrant origin, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Another 17% were in families from other parts of Europe, while 10% were in families from New Zealand, and 3% were in families from other countries in Oceania. Compared with most other OECD countries, there is a dearth of research on children in immigrant families in Australia, and relatively limited administrative data that might allow us to compare immigrant families to other families in the general population. No recent studies track the educational, health, or employment trajectories of children in families in various immigrant groups. Research on children in immigrant families undertaken since the 1970s has been sporadic and fragmentary. None of the flagship studies on child well-being provides specific information about culturally and linguistically diverse children or children in immigrant families. There are no national studies on the involvement of these children with the child welfare, juvenile justice, or out-of-home care systems, and it is therefore not known if they are overrepresented or underrepresented. Studies tend to compare two or three ethnic or language groups, group all immigrants together, or classify immigrant children according to English-speaking or non-English speaking backgrounds. Australians pride themselves on the harmony and the relative lack of racial tension in their society, but hard data on indicators of racial harmony are scarce. We examine the limited evidence base below, and supplement an analysis of census data and data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). The findings are rather paradoxical. On the one hand the research confirms the serious disadvantages in well-being that children in certain immigrant groups face, relative to the overall population. The disadvantages include poorer educational outcomes, exposure to racism, the trauma of separation from the cultural and social networks of their countries of origin, challenges to adjusting to the Australian culture and life style, identity problems and less access to services and social support. These issues are heightened among immigrants who have come to Australia with fewer skills and fewer resources, as well as less knowledge of English. On the other hand the wellbeing of migrant children appears to be relatively good compared to the general Australian population and also compared to migrants in other OECD countries.

T1  - From Ethnic Boundaries to Ethnic Penalties: Urban Economies and the Turkish Second Generation
AN  - 758123995; 201057229
AB  - From the perspective of segmented assimilation in the United States, a key question is whether the children of immigrant workers in European societies will experience socio-economic inclusion ("assimilation") or exclusion ("segmentation"). This study focuses on the Turkish second generation in European cities as a critical case of ethnic segmentation. In particular, the analysis examines the role of urban contexts as moderators of "ethnic penalties" on socio-economic attainment. Using Census data, the authors find large net ethnic penalties for the Turkish second generation in the urban area of Brussels, where they make up the bottom end of the ethnic hierarchy. In comparison to the second generation living outside the urban area, however, they are more often in paid work, less rarely self-employed, and less totally excluded from high-end jobs. Our comparative findings run counter to common negative portrayals of post-industrial urban economies as a mobility trap for the children of immigrants. Instead, they suggest an upside to differential ethnic boundary dynamics in urban economic centers versus their national peripheries. To conclude, the authors discuss comparative implications for the fortunes of the second generation in European urban economies. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Parochial geographies: Growing up in divided Belfast
AN  - 1928193238
AB  - This article explores the ways in which teenagers occupy and manage space in one divided community in Northern Ireland. Drawing on stories, maps and focus group discussions with 80 teenagers, from an interface area in Belfast, the article reveals their perceptions and experiences of divided cities, as risky landscapes. Teenagers respond to these risks in various ways, at times reiterating traditional sectarian prejudices and at times demonstrating resilience in coping with growing up in a risky location. In the process, young people develop strategies of resistance, which at times support, and at times undermine, the wider ideologies underpinning ethnic conflict in Northern Ireland.

T1  - The More the Merrier? The Effects of Type of Cultural Diversity on Exclusionary Immigration Attitudes in Switzerland
AN  - 863244222
AB  - We investigate how different types of cultural diversity influence anti-immigration attitudes across Swiss municipalities. While from a threat theory perspective, a high number of immigrants within a region increases (perceived) threat which fosters negative immigration attitudes, intergroup contact theory contends that culturally diverse societal contexts increase opportunities for contacts with immigrants, which give rise to more positive immigration attitudes. Prior research on ethnic hierarchies and host society acculturation attitudes led us to hypothesize that the presence of valued, "culturally similar" immigrants from wealthier countries increases contact and decreases threat, thereby reducing anti-immigrant prejudice. The presence of devalued, "culturally distant" immigrants from poorer countries should increase threat perceptions and dissuade contact thus heightening prejudice. A multilevel study was conducted using the 2002 European Social Survey (N = 1472 Swiss citizens, N = 185 municipalities). Replicating previous research, contact reduced exclusionary immigration attitudes through reduced threat. On the municipality level, higher proportion of North and West European immigrants increased contact, thus reducing threat. A larger proportion of Muslims was related to an increase in threat, leading to more pronounced exclusionary attitudes, but also to increased contact. Finally, we discuss how the impact of diversity depends on the social construction of immigrant categories, respondents' social position and ideological stances, and the prevailing local ideological climate.

T1  - At Home in the Caribbean Diaspora: "Race" and the Dialectics of Identity
AN  - 884024969
AB  - For if it is possible to get black people or Indians to accept or buy into the idea of "race," if they can be made to regard "race" as a real and legitimate phenomenon, then one is very close to realizing an ideal situation of social control.  [...] my contention is that, because they are premised on colonially created racial divisions at home, diasporic politics do just that - they legitimize the idea that "races" are real entities.  [...] construed, "race" serves to distract the bulk of working-class, non-elite black and Indian people from developing a class awareness of their social circumstances.  [...] racial politics of the sort encountered in African Caribbean and Indo-Caribbean communities at home and in the diasporas use the notions of community, "race," and ethnicity as their main points of departure.
