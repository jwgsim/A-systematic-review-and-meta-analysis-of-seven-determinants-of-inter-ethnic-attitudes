T1  - Heider balance, prejudices and size effect
AN  - 2410650602
AB  - In a fully connected network of K individuals, links represent symmetric interpersonal relations with their signs – positive for friendly, negative for hostile ones. The network is balanced in the sense of Heider if it is divided into two, internally friendly but mutually hostile groups. A dynamics of the relations has been proposed which leads to balanced states; there, a separate differential equation is designed for each out of K(K-1)/2 links. Here we demonstrate that besides the balanced states, whole families of stable-unbalanced states exist, and the number of these states is limited only by the size of the network. Examples are given for three and four internally friendly, but mutually hostile groups.

T1  - Same same but different. How the play of difference intersects female refugee support workers’ constructions of a common identity
AN  - 2407556884
AB  - As in most parts of Europe, the influx of a large number of refugees from the summer of 2015 on has greatly stirred German society and politics and deeply divided the population on how to deal with asylum seekers and immigration. This article enters this controversy by examining supporters committed to the pro-refugee side of the debate – female volunteers in refugee support work. It investigates how the volunteers interpret their relationship with refugees and adopts the social-psychological hypothesis claiming that the construction of a common identity helps decrease prejudice and facilitate intergroup relations. However, I go on to argue that manifestations of difference continuously interfere with these conceptions of ‘sameness’, as difference is fundamental for the construction of identities and meaning in general. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews with female refugee support workers in Germany, this paper then traces how female volunteers imagine and locate ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ when working with refugees. The article shows that while outwardly, participants are keen to develop a sense of a shared identity with the refugees, distinctions through power hierarchies or cultural or gender identities disrupt their experience in ambivalent, complex and covert ways.

T1  - The drivers of prejudice with a special focus on religion—insights into anti-Muslim sentiment in Austrian society
AN  - 2409875208
AB  - Terrorist attacks, refugee movements from crisis regions as well as barriers to integration among immigrants have also been increasing fears of Islam in Austria, whereby Muslims are often regarded all too generally as outsiders to Austrian society. In this article the results of a representative study (Social Survey Austria 2018) are presented, which includes the first time a sophisticated scale on attitudes towards Muslims. In addition, a sequential multiple regression analysis will be used for a more detailed analysis of classical factors influencing critical attitudes towards Islam, whereby a new research gap will be addressed focusing on religious attitudes and practices of Austrians. The analysis of the extent of anti-Muslim sentiment in Austria reveals a dominant critical view. However, the influences of religious orientations are manifold: While conventional religious practice (such as church attendance and praying) as well as superstition reinforces animosities, inclusive religious attitudes and individual practices of spirituality lead to more tolerant attitudes. The results, which indicate a tendency towards greater tolerance among religious people, show that we are in Austria mainly confronted with cultural rather than interreligious conflicts, which are primarily centered around identity and recognition.

T1  - Punitiveness and Devaluation among Social Work Gatekeepers
AN  - 2403116171
AB  - This paper analyses the connection between a punitive educational orientation and different negative prejudices in the context of group-focused enmity. While punitiveness is a very rough and undefined term, it is the subject of lively debate within social work. Here, punitiveness is often understood as a move away from the former welfare state ideal by giving preference to harsh punishment rather than practices of resocialization. The results of a quantitative survey (n = 178) of future street-level bureaucrats in the social field show that a punitive educational orientation is positively related to prejudices. This has implications for theorizing on the role of punitiveness in intergroup conflict and especially for practical social work, as it devalues certain social groups that are addressees of social work through punitive practice. This also includes assumptions about citizenship, as statements are made about who belongs and who does not.

T1  - The nation as the cradle of nationalism and patriotism
AN  - 2330941541
AB  - This paper argues against dismissing as ‘populist nationalism’ every positive view of one's nation and ignoring patriotism as its antithesis. The European nation exists in two senses: as a large ‘social group’, a community of real people, and as an abstract community of cultural values promoted by intellectual elites grounded in a humanities‐based education. The widespread prejudice that condemns every positive expression of one's relationship to the nation has proved counterproductive because it has prompted ever stronger spontaneous reactions in the form of primitive nationalistic egoism. This has weakened the commitment people feel towards their nation and the humanistic potential that the nation possesses as a cultural community of values. Consequently, anti‐national European intellectual elites bear some responsibility – along with those preaching neoliberal individualism – for the success of populist demagogues and the decline in patriotic values. Given the state of education today, a revival of humanist culture for national elites seems impossible, making the continued rise of primitive nationalism appear unstoppable.

T1  - Suspicion and prejudice: The role of ideology in the study of Christian revival among the Roma
AN  - 2327307225
AB  - The state of affairs of some studies concerning Romani groups’ conversions throughout the world to the global evangelical movement, and the subtext that prevails in such studies, could reveal a persistence of ‘enlightened prejudice’ towards the nature of religions, namely, a kind of suspicion and authoritarianism that continues to tacitly fuel hostility against emerging religious phenomena, and the tendency of analysts to share, consciously or unconsciously, the language of the State, producing a negative vision of the Romani world. The creativity and autonomy exhibited by Romani Evangelism, which stays away from external financing and, generally speaking, policies of minority promotion, contribute to a vast trans-regional network of congregations, that aim towards an unprecedented global pan-Romanism with a strong social base. This is a response to a historic diaspora, and, in turn, a new form of the secular Romani diaspora.

T1  - Femmephobia: The Role of Anti-Femininity and Gender Policing in LGBTQ+ People’s Experiences of Discrimination
AN  - 2183931625
AB  - Since the 1970s social science researchers have documented the cultural devaluation of femininity and its impact on experiences of discrimination among sexual and gender minorities. Yet, despite the continued and accumulating evidence demonstrating the role of anti-femininity (or femmephobia) in these experiences, little research has specifically examined femininity as an intersecting component of discrimination. Using in-depth interviews with sexual and gender minorities (N = 38), the current study explores the intersecting role of femmephobia in experiences of discrimination. Under the global theme of “femininity as target,” 5 key subthemes were identified: femininity and passing, regulating sexualities, masculine right of access, biological determinism, and the feminine joke. Participants illuminated femmephobia as a regulatory power within LGBTQ+ communities and society at large, as well as how femininity itself operates as a target in their experiences of gender policing and discrimination. By turning attention toward femininity, the current paper provides a clearer understanding of what may possibly lay at the heart of many social issues surrounding discrimination and violence. These findings have implications for the study of social inequalities, as well as strategies for remedying the pervasive devaluation of femininity.

T1  - On the Descriptive and Expressive Function of Derogatory Group Labels: An Experimental Test
AN  - 2289483358
AB  - By using a pseudoword paradigm, we tested whether derogatory labels (e.g., pejorative labels addressing group members) differed from category labels and general slur in their descriptive (i.e., pointing to group membership) and expressive functions (i.e., perceived offensiveness and social acceptability). Results indicated that derogatory labels were similar to category labels in their descriptive function, and had higher expressive function than slurs. Participants’ prejudice toward the groups that were targets of derogatory label reduced their perceived offensiveness than in turn increased their social acceptability.

TT  - L'économie politique des droits de propriété intellectuelle : le paradoxe de l'Article 27 illustré au Ghana.
AN  - 2312785459
AB  - Orthodox copyright scholarship frames piracy in 'developing' countries as a detrimental and illegal practice that results from these countries' lack of economic, social and cultural development. It argues that piracy needs to be discouraged, regulated, and finally overcome for legitimate business to flourish. In this article, the authors challenge this viewpoint and question whether the implementation of international copyright instruments in legislation across Africa really promotes those local economies or if it merely exposes them to neo-colonial exploitation. While the early international treaties on intellectual property rights (IPR) were formulated by European states and implemented in most parts of Africa through colonial laws, more recent legislation has been globally implemented through institutions such as the United Nations or the World Trade Organization, which remain dominated by Western interests. Through a structured overview of the adoption of IPR treaties in African countries, the authors advance a political economy perspective of intellectual property rights as a (neo-)colonial regime.Alternate abstract:Les membres de l’école traditionnelle sur les questions de droits d’auteurs mettent en avant le piratage dans les pays « en développement » comme une pratique préjudiciable et illégale qui résulte du manque de développement économique, social et culturel de ces pays. Ils soutiennent que le piratage doit être découragé, réglementé et finalement surmonté pour que le commerce légitime puisse prospérer. À travers cet article, nous remettons en question ce point de vue et nous nous demandons si la mise en place de mesures internationales relatives au droit d’auteur dans la législation à travers le continent africain, favorise réellement ces économies locales ou si elles ne font que les exposer à l’exploitation néo-coloniale. Alors que les premiers traités internationaux sur les droits de propriété intellectuelle étaient formulés par des États européens puis appliqués à travers la plupart des régions d’Afrique à travers les lois coloniales, plus récemment la législation a été globalement mise en oeuvre par des institutions telles que l’Organisation des Nations unies ou l’Organisation mondiale du commerce, qui restent dominées par les intérêts occidentaux. À travers une vue d’ensemble structurée de l’adoption des traités sur les droits de propriété intellectuelle dans les pays africains, nous mettons en avant une perspective d’économie politique des droits de propriété intellectuelle en tant que régime (néo-)colonial.

T1  - Does Watching This Make Me Feel Ashamed or Angry? An Examination of Latino Americans’ Responses to Immigration Coverage
AN  - 2287952706
AB  - Content analyses of U.S. English-language news coverage of immigration indicate that these stories are laden with negative, threatening messages and have an almost exclusive focus on Latino immigrants. However, little is known regarding how non-immigrant Latinos process and interpret these messages. The current survey of adult non-immigrant Latinos living in the United States addresses this question by applying insights from the rejection-identification model and research on vicarious shame. Based on this research, experiencing group shame in response to immigration news should drive Latinos to distance themselves from this identity, leading to greater affiliation with American identity (to maintain a positive self-concept) and stronger support for restrictive immigration policies (to mitigate the potential threats). Alternatively, experiencing anger in response to this coverage should result in less distancing from the shared Latino identity (i.e., greater affiliation), prompting decreased association with American identity and less support for restrictive immigration policies. Results from the mediation model tested here found support for predictions stemming from both vicarious shame and rejection-identification assumptions, indicating that they represent distinct pathways to views on immigration attitudes and identity management. Furthermore, in line with social identity theory, Mexican Americans (vs. non-Mexican Latinos) were more likely to distance from the immigration message and perceive immigration coverage to depict negative beliefs others hold about their ethnic group (owing to the disproportionate emphasis on Mexicans in this coverage). Results are discussed in terms of the implications for group standing as well as the importance of legitimacy of media messages in this context.

T1  - Impairment, socialization and embodiment: The sexual oppression of people with physical disabilities
AN  - 2272039859
AB  - People with disabilities face multiple forms of social exclusion, discrimination, and oppression, including in the domain of sex and sexuality. From a critical psychoanalytic viewpoint, social responses to persons with impairments are strongly unconsciously mediated, and often dominated by projections based on archaic anxieties about dependency, vulnerability, and shame. Where disability meets sexuality, these defenses may be more prominent still, resulting, for one example, in the prejudiced myth that people with disabilities are disinterested in, or not capable of, sex. Using this theoretical stance, this paper examines how the developmental role of family and societal influences on the social constructions of sexuality and disability are internalized, resisted, and negotiated by two South Africans with physical disabilities. Data are drawn from interview material elicited via photovoice methodology. The interview narratives and photographic images are used to explore how sexual oppression may be internalized, creating intra-psychic barriers to inclusion for this already structurally disadvantaged group.

T1  - Personal Prejudice, Other Guilt: Explicit Prejudice Toward Black People Predicts Guilty Verdicts for White Officers Who Kill Black Men
AN  - 2202736270
AB  - Across the United States, acquittals of White police officers who have killed Black men have spurred clashes between those who see such situations as manifestations of racism and those who see them as race-irrelevant acts of officer self-defense. In this research, we explore the relationship between participants’ racial prejudice and construal of an event that leads to the death of a Black man. In Study 1, we found that participants’ racial prejudice predicts lower perceived guilt for a White officer who killed a Black man. In Study 2, we found evidence that the relationship between racial prejudice and guilt judgments is driven by increased perceptions that the officer was in danger and decreased perceived relevance of officer prejudice. Finally, Study 3 demonstrated that these patterns hold when the victim is Black, but not White. We conclude that racial prejudice shapes perceptions of legal responsibility for lethal interactions with Black men.

T1  - Implicit Bias Predicts Liking of Ingroup Members Who Are Comfortable With Intergroup Interaction
AN  - 2188929009
AB  - We test a novel framework for how ingroup members are perceived during intergroup interaction. Across three experiments, we found that, above and beyond egalitarian attitudes and motivations, White observers’ automatic responses to Blacks (i.e., their implicit anti-Black bias) shaped their affiliation toward ingroup targets who appeared comfortable engaging in interracial versus same-race interaction. White observers’ implicit anti-Black bias negatively correlated with liking of White targets who were comfortable with Blacks (Experiments 1-3). The relationship between implicit bias and liking varied as a function of targets’ nonverbal comfort in interracial interactions (Experiment 1). Specifically, implicit bias negatively correlated with liking of targets when targets’ nonverbal behaviors revealed observers felt comfortable with interracial contact, irrespective of the nature of those behaviors (Experiment 2). Finally, the relationship between implicit bias and target liking was mediated by perceived similarity (Experiment 3). Theoretical implications for stigma-by-association, social network homogeneity, and extended contact are discussed.

T1  - How Trump's Populism Shapes the Uptake of New Social Facts
AN  - 2182952661
AB  - How does Trump's populist message shape the uptake of new social facts? The answer, I argue, arises from the type of populist language spoken by Trump, which involves a triadic form of populism that champions ordinary people not just against an elite but also against a third group that the elite are said to protect at the expense of the ordinary people. This form of populism plays to prejudices and anxieties while sowing a post‐truth cynicism that erodes trust in the ability of established democratic institutions to make and validate truth claims. As trust in established norms erodes, Trump wields power to fill the gap with new “common sense” understandings about marginalized groups and socioeconomic discontent.

T1  - paper Migrants and Their Languages in Historical Perspective
TT  - MIGRANTI I NJIHOVI JEZICI U POVIJESNOJ PERSPEKTIVI
AN  - 2384505286
AB  - Historical legacies of past migrations and linguistic practices have an impact on the concerns about current migration and mobility processes, reminding us that mass migrations are not a new phenomenon. Mass migrations from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th century to North America present an interesting subject in view of regulating moving speakers and their languages and their reception in the new country. Using discourse analysis of historical data from contemporary newspapers and other sources, the paper explores practices of inclusion and exclusion of Slavic speakers on the ground of social prejudice and legitimized ethnic and racial segregating practices. The results show that paradoxically, immigrants coming from the multilingual empire who were admitted (about 80%) after restrictive procedures, in the end faced the demanding issue of enforced linguistic and cultural assimilation in order to become accepted as loyal Americans. We use these pieces of historical memory of mass migrations as a resource to understand the present attitudes and policies toward migrating people, and their languages and cultures.Alternate abstract:Migracije u prošlosti i s njima povezane jezične prakse važne su za razumijevanje suvremenih migracijskih procesa jer pokazuju da problem masovnih migracija nije nova pojava koja se obično smatra posljedicom globalizacije. Masovne migracije iz nekadašnje Austro-Ugarske u Ameriku osobito su zanimljive s obzirom na regulaciju migranata i njihovih jezika i odnos prema njima u novoj zemlji. Uz pomoć diskurzivne analize povijesnih podataka iz tadašnjih američkih novina i drugih izvora, u radu se istražuju prakse društvenog uključivanja i isključivanja govornika slavenskih jezika na temelju društvenih predrasuda i diskriminacije s obzirom na etničku pripadnost. Rezultati istraživanja pokazuju kako su oni migranti iz jednog višejezičnog carstva kojima je dozvoljeno useljavanje nakon restriktivnih postupaka (80%) bili podvrgnuti prinudnoj jezičnoj i kulturnoj asimilaciji kako bi postali priznati i lojalni američki građani. Ova povijesna sjećanja mogu pomoći u razumijevanju današnjih stavova i politika prema migrantima i njihovim jezicima i kulturama.

T1  - Racism in recent Greek migrant jokes
AN  - 2244703346
AB  - One of Davies’ significant contributions to the sociology of humor involves the exploration of the relation between jokes and the social order. He particularly argues that jokes seem to work like a “thermometer” conveying truths for the sociopolitical system. In our study, we aim to analyze jokes related to the migration crisis and circulated online since 2014 following Davies’ methodological guidelines. During the past few years, the number of migrants arriving at Greek shores has significantly increased. The prospect of Greece becoming a permanent base for these people has evoked diverse reactions. Migrant jokes seem to be part of Greek majority’s response to the migration ‘threat’ against national sovereignty and linguocultural homogeneity. They (re)produce and perpetuate xenophobia and racism by portraying migrants as ‘dangerous invaders’ in the Greek territory and as ‘culturally inferior’ people. Hence, such jokes align with dominant values and standpoints circulating in the Greek public sphere via underscoring the inequality between the Greek majority and migrants and via naturalizing the latter’s assimilation to majority norms and values.

T1  - Advocating for Fat Activism in a Therapeutic Context
AN  - 2227904157
AB  - Sizeism has a negative impact on women and perpetuates fat shaming. Conventional therapeutic suggestions for addressing weight concerns focus on self-discipline rather than on the larger social, cultural, or political contexts of weight stigma. Feminist scholars, therapists, and activists have encouraged social activism to promote psychological well-being and challenge systemic weight prejudice. Results of research on health prevention and promotion efforts have begun to shift thinking away from weight loss and toward deconstructing and changing anti-fat attitudes. We highlight some individual and community-based fat activists to illustrate how their strategies and ideas challenge sizeism in a variety of areas, including the rhetoric of fat, body positivity, photography/art, nutrition/exercise, and diversity/intersectionality. Fat activism has utility within a therapeutic context, especially for those who have experienced sizeism. We strongly encourage therapists to work closely with clients on finding sources and types of fat activism that represent their unique identities, which may be more difficult for those with marginalized identities.

T1  - Understanding sexual prejudice: The role of political ideology and strategic essentialism
AN  - 2166665277
AB  - Despite the increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBTQ community, sexual minorities continue to face prejudice and discrimination in many domains. Past research has shown that this prejudice is more prevalent among those holding conservative political views. In two studies, we merge strategic essentialism and motivated ideology theoretical perspectives to empirically investigate the link between political orientation and sexual prejudice. More specifically, we examine how conservatives strategically use different forms of essentialism to support their views of gay individuals and their reactions to messages aimed at changing essentializing beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 220), we demonstrate that conservatives endorse social essentialism (i.e., the belief that gay and straight people are fundamentally different from each other) more than liberals do. In turn, they blame gay individuals more for their sexual orientation and show more prejudice toward them. At the same time, conservatives endorse trait essentialism (i.e., the belief that sexual orientation is a fixed attribute that cannot be changed) less than liberals do, which in turn predicts greater levels of blame and prejudice for conservatives relative to liberals. In Study 2 (N = 217), we additionally show that conservatives, but not liberals, are resistant to messages aimed at increasing trait essentialism and reducing prejudice toward sexual minorities. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

T1  - Religion From the Target’s Perspective: A Portrait of Religious Threat and Its Consequences in the United States
AN  - 2159086468
AB  - Little is known about social identity threat from religion or religiosity. We collected data from a diverse sample of Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and Muslims across the United States (N = 970) to test whether, and for whom, religion and religiosity, like other social identities, can be consequential sources of identity threat. Results suggest that religious threat is highest among religious minority groups (Muslims and Jews) and highly religious Protestants. Threat predicted (1) lower belonging, (2) a greater propensity to conceal one’s religion, and (3) more intergroup bias, although these patterns varied somewhat by religion. Results illuminate how a broader social climate in which religion and specific religious groups are often the subject of heated rhetoric may trigger identity threat and exacerbate intergroup hostilities.

T1  - Does a multicultural perspective shape unbiased minds? The moderating role of outgroup threat
AN  - 2132137259
AB  - The multicultural perspective is an ideological orientation that values the recognition and inclusion of diverse ethnic and cultural groups as sources of identity and culture that are favorable to society, because they promote positive intergroup relations and social equality. However, there are conditions that moderate the constructive effects such a perspective potentially yields. In this research, we used experimental procedures to examine the effects of a multicultural perspective on levels of implicit and explicit prejudice aimed at Gitanos (Spanish Roma). In Study 1, we manipulated the content of a newspaper article to generate three conditions, which were (a) the multicultural perspective, (b) the use of counter‐stereotypical exemplars, and (c) the control. In Study 2, we not only evaluated the effect of the manipulation of the multicultural perspective relative to the control, we also assessed the extent to which symbolic and realistic outgroup threats moderate the effect of a multicultural perspective on implicit prejudice. Results showed lower levels of implicit prejudice in the multicultural condition than in the control condition. The multicultural perspective effectively reduced implicit prejudice when the perceived threat was low, but yielded no such observable effect when the perceived threat was high.

T1  - Right‐wing populism as a social representation: A comparison across four European countries
AN  - 2130792253
AB  - The rise of right‐wing populist parties has been widely discussed across the social sciences during the last decade. Taking a social representational approach, we analyse organising principles and anchoring of right‐wing populist thinking across four European countries (France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). Using European Social Survey data (Round 7), we compare political attitudes and self‐appraisals of citizens identifying with right‐wing populist, conservative right‐wing, and traditional left‐wing parties. The findings converge across the four countries to show that right‐wing populist identifiers diverge from both left‐ and right‐wing identifiers on vertical (between the “people” and the “elite”) and horizontal (between nationals and immigrants) dimensions of differentiation. Depending on the context, right‐wing populist identification was fuelled by material and physical insecurity, low political efficacy, and distrust of fellow citizens. We conclude that right‐wing populism requires multiple strategies of differentiation within and between groups to justify and sustain itself.

T1  - What Constitutes ‘Discrimination’ in Everyday Talk? Argumentative Lines and the Social Representations of Discrimination
AN  - 2100130068
AB  - Most people agree that discrimination is wrong, but the boundary between ‘discrimination’ and ‘not discrimination’ is often highly contested in everyday practice. We explore the social representations of ‘discrimination’ as an object of study in qualitative interviews and focus groups with both minority (self-identified as BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] and/or gay men) and majority (self-identified as White and/or heterosexual) participants (n = 54). Our analysis suggests three repeated and pervasive argumentative lines in social representations of discrimination: (1) that there are two distinct kinds of discrimination (hard vs. soft), (2) that you need to understand the intention of the actor(s), and (3) that a claim of discrimination requires strong evidence. We outline the macro Functions of these resources to argue that each was non-performative: They appeared to be tools to make claims of discrimination, but in practice they were much more effective at making claims of what was not discrimination.

T1  - Internalised and Social Experiences of HIV-Induced Stigma and Discrimination in Urban Ghana
AN  - 2103030740
AB  - HIV-induced stigma and discrimination remain a prevalent global challenge especially in low-income countries which may compromise the emotional and social well-being of people living with HIV (PLHIV). Despite the efforts so far, the incidence of HIV-related stigma remains high in Ghana. Drawing on the Goffman’s theory of social stigma and interpretivist research paradigm, the paper explores the lived experiences of 123 PLHIV in HIV-endemic cities in Ghana. Findings suggest that PLHIV largely suffer from three levels of stigma—internal, received and associated—with complex discriminatory dimensions. PLHIV are stigmatised and discriminated against at home, in the community and in institutional settings. This is manifested through familial neglect, social exclusion and poor access to jobs and health services. These prejudices presaged suicidal ideations, non-disclosure of HIV serostatus, poor adherence to treatment interventions and further spread of the epidemic. Progressive social and health policy framework and programmes on eradicating HIV are pressing. These should conspicuously include HIV-related stigma and discrimination through behavioural change and culturally acceptable public education about the myths and realities surrounding HIV in order to mitigate the associated debilitating outcomes.

T1  - Racism in the Structure of Everyday Worlds: A Cultural-Psychological Perspective
AN  - 2052688887
AB  - Theory and research in cultural psychology highlight the need to examine racism not only “in the head” but also “in the world.” Racism is often defined as individual prejudice, but racism is also systemic, existing in the advantages and disadvantages imprinted in cultural artifacts, ideological discourse, and institutional realities that work together with individual biases. In this review, we highlight examples of historically derived ideas and cultural patterns that maintain present-day racial inequalities. We discuss three key insights on the psychology of racism derived from utilizing a cultural-psychology framework. First, one can find racism embedded in our everyday worlds. Second, through our preferences and selections, we maintain racialized contexts in everyday action. Third, we inhabit cultural worlds that, in turn, promote racialized ways of seeing, being in, and acting in the world. This perspective directs attempts at intervention away from individual tendencies and instead focuses on changing the structures of mind in context that reflect and reproduce racial domination.

T1  - Understanding and Reducing Sexual Prejudice in Jamaica: Theoretical and Practical Insights From a Severely Anti-Gay Society
AN  - 2016560559
AB  - Jamaica has earned an international reputation for severe sexual prejudice-perhaps disproportionately so compared to other severely anti-LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) societies. Until recently, however, no quantitative empirical research had investigated Jamaica's sexual prejudice, leaving the prejudice poorly understood and methods of reducing it unclear. This article reviews empirical research on Jamaican anti-LGBT prejudice from the past 15 years. It situates Jamaica within the global context, explains the current understanding of the severity and nature of the problem, evaluates solutions currently being explored, and suggests promising strategies based on available evidence. Importantly, this article also reflects on lessons learned from Jamaica that are relevant for other severely anti-LGBT societies.

T1  - The social organization of workplace mental health: local and translocal ruling relations
AN  - 2036422901
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to make visible the ways in which peoples’ experiences of mental ill health are coordinated and produced in the workplace setting.Design/methodology/approachThis institutional ethnography draws from data collected from 16 informants in one Canadian industrial manufacturing plant to explicate how texts organize activities and align worker consciousness and actions with company expectations of a “bona fide” illness.FindingsThe findings demonstrate how a “bona fide” illness is textually mediated by biomedical and physical work restrictions, thus creating a significant disjuncture between an experiential and ruling perspective of mental ill health.Research limitations/implicationsThe work of employees living with self-reported depression becomes organized locally and translocally around the discourse of “mental illness is an illness like any other.” This presents a profound disjuncture between the embodied experience of being too unwell to mentally perform work duties, and the textually coordinated practices of what it means to access sick time for a “bona fide illness” within a biomedical-based attendance management protocol.Originality/valueThe current study adds to the literature by shedding light on the disjuncture created between the embodied experience of mental health issues and the ruling perspective of what constitutes a bona fide illness, adding a unique focus on how people’s use of attendance management-related supports in the workplace.

AB  - Most individuals are stigmatized at some point. However, research often examines stigmas separately, thus underestimating the overall impact of stigma and precluding comparisons across stigmatized identities and conditions. In their classic text, Social Stigma: The Psychology of Marked Relationships, Edward Jones and colleagues laid the groundwork for unifying the study of different stigmas by considering the shared dimensional features of stigmas: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, peril. Despite the prominence of this framework, no study has documented the extent to which stigmas differ along these dimensions, and the implications of this variation for health and well-being. We reinvigorated this framework to spur a comprehensive account of stigma’s impact by classifying 93 stigmas along these dimensions. With the input of expert and general public raters, we then located these stigmas in a six-dimensional space and created discrete clusters organized around these dimensions. Next, we linked this taxonomy to health and stigma-related mechanisms. This quantitative taxonomy offers parsimonious insights into the relationship among the numerous qualities of numerous stigmas and health.

T1  - Measuring the Tangible Fear of Heterosexist Violence
AN  - 2002087257
AB  - Fear of crime (FoC) has dominated the political landscape over the last 20 years, with many crime policy developments during this period linked not to actual experiences of violence but to the fear of victimization. Fear of crime studies, in most cases, are conducted with populations that have only a passing, mediated knowledge of crime victimization. The research discussed in this article, in contrast, considers the impact of FoC with a highly victimized community, and establishes psychometric testing to validate an instrument to measure the impact of that fear (Fear of Heterosexism Scale [FoHS]). If FoC is related to experiences of crime as the existing research suggests, then victims of heterosexist prejudice, discrimination, and/or violence would be more likely to fear such incidents in the future. It was also predicted that participants who concealed their sexual and/or gender identity and had lower levels of social connectedness would experience higher levels of fear. The findings highlight the importance of contextual factors in FoH, and identify the critical roles that disclosure and social connectedness play in ameliorating the damaging effects of heterosexist victimization.

T1  - Islamophobia in Canada: Measuring the Realities of Negative Attitudes Toward Muslims and Religious Discrimination
AN  - 2002171625
AB  - There has been growing discussion surrounding the phenomenon of Islamophobia in Western societies over the last few years. However, in-depth empirical research of the prevalence and patterns of prejudice toward Muslims remains scarce, especially in the Canadian context. With data from the 2011 Canadian Election Study and the 2014 General Social Survey, this study measures the extent to which negative feelings toward Muslims are present among the general adult population, and the extent to which Muslim Canadians themselves say they have experienced discrimination in recent years due to their religion, ethnicity, and culture.Alternate abstract:Au cours des dernières années, les discussions qui touchent la question de l'Islamophobie en Occident se font entendre de plus en plus. Toutefois, les recherches empiriques qui mesurent les dynamiques de ce phénomène sont rares, surtout en contexte canadien. En employant des données de l'Étude électorale canadienne de 2011 et de l'Enquête sociale générale de 2014, cette étude évalue la prévalence des attitudes négatives envers les musulmans parmi la population générale, ainsi qu'à quel point les musulmans canadiens eux-mêmes disent avoir vécu de la discrimination en raison de leur religion, de leur ethnicité et de leur culture.

T1  - ANTI-RACIST RACISM AS MILLENNIAL PATTERN OF PREJUDICE: THE STEALTH PERPETUATION OF WHITE SUPREMACY
AN  - 2233847694
AB  - The evolution of Western civilization has been stymied by the emergence of anti-racist racism. Anti-racist racism is a by-product descended from White supremacy and dedicated to the establishment of a preferred world order. Similar to White racism, anti-racist racism manifests as the need to dominate distinguished by anti-racist rhetoric in whatever venture being considered. The sanitized perception of anti-racist racism is reinforced by judicial and other institutional prestige. Thus, the will to undermine anti-racist racism is disserved by the fact that the West has now by stealth contributed to the perpetuation of White supremacy that has become the millennial pattern of prejudice. The most conscientious among the world's citizenry in an effort to alleviate it must then immediately and necessarily take it upon themselves to meet the racial challenges of the 21st Century and beyond.

T1  - Isolated and Afraid in a Small Town
AN  - 1941603523
AB  - Living in a small southern town, my narrative performance explores the anger, pain, and, at times, privilege of isolation when not having a queer community with whom to publicly mourn following the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Complicating this further is my dissonance as to whether or not the Orlando Latinx community is, in fact, my community at all to mourn. When finally finding and attending a vigil a town away, my identity as a queer femme woman was pushed to the side to make way for anti-second-amendment speeches, a political campaign opportunity, and a Muslim man trying to prevent Islamophobia. Weaving the metaphor of the brewing storm with my narrative of the problematics of small town advocacy, what unfolds is a collision of my identities crashing into my prejudicial thoughts and ideas, despite espousing "good liberal," antiracist, and intersectional politics. Ending with more questions than answers, I narrate the ways in which difference is erased in my small town, and yet, how simultaneously those of us fighting for social justice learn to negotiate challenges together, forging coalitions between people of differences.

T1  - The moral contents of anti-atheist prejudice (and why atheists should care about it)
AN  - 1929442897
AB  - Anti-atheist prejudice is pervasive worldwide. Past research indicates that this is driven by perceptions of atheist immorality, yet such perceptions have not been explored in detail. Using Moral Foundations Theory and samples of U.S. Christians, we investigated whether anti-atheist prejudice is explained by atheists' perceived adherence to certain foundational moral values more than others. Study 1 participants completed measures of moral value endorsements from the perspective of a typical atheist. Study 2 participants read that either atheists or people in general strongly endorse one of five moral foundations. Anti-atheist prejudice was consistently explained best by perceived atheist concern for values of caring/compassion rather than fairness/justice, loyalty, deferential respect, or purity/decency. Findings suggest that efforts to reduce anti-atheist prejudice should emphasize atheists' capacity for kindness and caring.

T1  - Exploring representations of Black masculinity and emasculation on NBC's Parenthood
AN  - 2013187969
AB  - Here, representations of Black masculinity and emasculation are explored on NBC's Parenthood. We question whether depictions of Black masculinity represented through Parenthood's character, Alex, are empowering or stereotypical; how do they reflect, destabilize, and/or reinforce heteronormative depictions of Black community members? Two seasons were analyzed using Owen's thematic analysis. Ultimately, Black males are portrayed as being societal failures, criminals, violent, and hypersexualized through his character. This embodiment ultimately preserves long-held images of Black men as "Toms, coons ... bucks ... as oversexed, aggressive, violent, animalistic, or emasculated" (Jackson, R. L. II. 2006. Scripting the black masculine body: Identity, discourse, and racial politics in popular media. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press). Practical recommendations and suggestions for researchers and media practitioners are provided.

T1  - The Social Psychology of the Great Recession and Social Class Divides
AN  - 1878222821
AB  - The Great Recession, a marked global economic decline that began in December 2007 in the United States, has affected the entire world economy, although more in some countries than others. It has increased income inequality, intergenerational tensions, and anti-immigrant prejudices. 
This issue aims to discuss social psychological effects of economic downturns on intergroup and interpersonal relations. Two lines of research, closely related, converge in this issue because the Great Recession has brought social-class inequality into the foreground of worldwide contention. The first line of research here explores how social-class membership influences interpersonal and intergroup processes: trust, deservingness, identity, educational attainment, stereotypes, ideologies, and group behaviors. The second line analyzes how the Great Recession has been affecting people's own lives and their psychological reactions, depending on their social class. Throughout this overview, we introduce the contributions to this special issue. The volume contributes to social psychological ideas about both social classes and the recession.

T1  - Social Identity and Attitudes Toward Cultural Diversity
AN  - 1856042729
AB  - Prior research indicates that there may be a disharmonious relationship between positive attitudes toward ethnic and cultural diversity and social identity within a socially dominant group. Recent work in cultural psychology, however, has implied that this disharmonious relationship may be confined to a specific representation of social identity. This research examined this possibility. Study 1 (N = 51,238) found that the negative association between national identity and diversity attitudes found among participants from Western societies did not extend to participants from non-Western societies. Study 2 (N = 222) recruited American and Japanese participants, disentangled two distinct representations of their social identity--collective and relational social identity--and found their differential associations with positive attitudes toward multiculturalism. Implications are discussed.

T1  - "I Think Some People Need Religion": The Social Construction of Nonreligious Moral Identities
AN  - 2266354999
AB  - In this article, we examine moral identity construction among nonreligious people. Based on 30 indepth interviews with nonreligious Americans unaffiliated with secular movement organizations, we analyze some ways nonreligious people may utilize their experiences with religion in society to define nonreligion as a sign of value, worth, and character. Specifically, we demonstrate how our respondents drew upon their childhood and current experience with religious others to construct nonreligous mora! identities by (1) defining religion as concerned with conformity and obedience rather than morality, (2) highlighting prejudicial assumptions religious people promote about nonreligious people, and (3) characterizing interactions with religious people as a mechanism that led them to seek meaning in their lives from other sources. In conclusion, we draw out implications for understanding (1) the social construction of nonreligious moral identities and (2) some ways current religious norms may serve as a pathway to nonreligion.

T1  - Power, politics and the street-level bureaucrat in Indigenous Australian health
AN  - 1844787058
AB  - Street-level professional workers' influence over Indigenous health policy implementation is an important variable in a contested policy environment distinguished by an Indigenous median age of death approximately 20 years less than for non-Indigenous citizens. Street-level workers are guided by personal political values in the ways that they prioritise their work and make decisions about the care that will be available to particular patients. The possibility that street-level workers may make decisions with reference to stereotypical or prejudiced judgements about Indigenous peoples makes their bureaucratic discretion a point of particular significance. Alternatively, their capacity to work on the assumption that they have the professional agency and a moral duty to make a substantive contribution to improving Indigenous health outcomes positions their work in the context of social justice. The street-level worker is, then, drawn into the politics of public policy and policy activism, where ideology sits alongside professional knowledge and skills as determinants of Indigenous health outcomes, and where public policy's intellectual and practical inconsistencies simultaneously constrain opportunities for bureaucratic discretion in some respects and provide new opportunities in others, such that the street-level worker is a central participant in the politics of Indigenous health.

T1  - The "Bad Is Black" Effect
AN  - 1840912547
AB  - Across six studies, people used a "bad is black" heuristic in social judgment and assumed that immoral acts were committed by people with darker skin tones, regardless of the racial background of those immoral actors. In archival studies of news articles written about Black and White celebrities in popular culture magazines (Study 1a) and American politicians (Study 1b), the more critical rather than complimentary the stories, the darker the skin tone of the photographs printed with the article. In the remaining four studies, participants associated immoral acts with darker skinned people when examining surveillance footage (Studies 2 and 4), and when matching headshots to good and bad actions (Studies 3 and 5). We additionally found that both race-based (Studies 2, 3, and 5) and shade-based (Studies 4 and 5) associations between badness and darkness determine whether people demonstrate the "bad is black" effect. We discuss implications for social perception and eyewitness identification.

T1  - Beware of "reducing prejudice": imagined contact may backfire if applied with a prevention focus
AN  - 1826492355
AB  - Imagined intergroup contact--the mental simulation of a (positive) interaction with a member of another group--is a recently developed, low-risk, prejudice-reducing intervention. However, regulatory focus can moderate of the effects of prejudice-reducing interventions: a prevention focus (as opposed to a promotion focus) can lead to more negative outcomes. In two experiments we found that a prevention focus altered imagined contact's effects, causing the intervention to backfire. In Experiment 1, participants who reported a strong prevention-focus during imagined contact subsequently reported higher intergroup anxiety and (indirectly) less positive attitudes toward Asians. We found similar moderating effects in Experiment 2, using a different outgroup (gay men) and a subtle regulatory focus manipulation. Theoretical and practical implications for imagined contact are discussed.

T1  - Perceptions of Threats to Physical Safety, Sexual Autonomy, Values, and of Discrimination Drive LGB Prejudices Toward Heterosexuals
AN  - 1837635305
AB  - Many studies have investigated heterosexuals' prejudices toward nonheterosexuals, yet LGB's prejudices toward heterosexuals remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we sought to determine the threats and opportunities (i.e., affordances) LGB perceive heterosexuals to pose and whether those affordances explain their sexual prejudices toward heterosexuals. Study 1 analyzed LGB's reasons for liking and disliking heterosexuals, which determined whether the threats predicted to be salient for LGB mirrored the affordances they generated. Study 2 measured these perceived affordances and examined the extent to which they drove LGB's prejudices toward heterosexuals. Generally, perceptions of discrimination and unreciprocated sexual interest threats drove anger, physical safety and sexual autonomy threats drove fear, and values threats drove moral disgust toward heterosexuals, although results varied slightly by perceiver and target groups. Goals to alleviate the tensions between heterosexuals and LGB require an understanding of the dynamics between these groups. This research provides preliminary insights into understanding those dynamics.

T1  - Understanding public reactions to commercialization of biobanks and use of biobank resources
AN  - 1810035717
AB  - Biobanks will be essential to facilitate the translation of genomic research into real improvements to healthcare. Biobanking is a long-term commitment, requiring public support as well as appropriate regulatory, social and ethical guidelines to realize this promise. There is a growing body of research that explores the necessary conditions to ensure public trust in biomedical research, particularly in the context of biobanking. Trust is, however, a complex relationship. More analysis of public perceptions, attitudes and reactions is required to understand the primary triggers that influence gain and loss of trust. Further, the outcomes of these analyses require detailed consideration to determine how to promote trustworthy institutions and practices. This article uses national survey data, combined with the results of a community consultation that took place in Tasmania, Australia in 2013, to analyze the specific issue of public reactions to commercialization of biobanks and their outputs. This research will enhance the ability of biobanks to respond preemptively to public concerns about commercialization by establishing and maintaining governance frameworks that are responsive to those concerns. The results reveal that it is possible to counter the 'natural prejudice' that many people have against commercialization through independent governance of biobank resources and transparency with regard to commercial involvement. Indeed, most participants agreed that they would rather have a biobank with commercial involvement than none at all. This analysis provides nuanced conclusions about public reactions towards commercialization and equips researchers and biobank operators with data on which to base policies and make governance decisions in order to tackle participant concerns respectfully and responsively.

T1  - Disgust predicts prejudice and discrimination toward individuals with obesity
AN  - 1793852378
AB  - This study examined the relevance of disgust to evaluations of an obese target person, and the connection between disgust and prejudice toward that person. Participants (n=598) viewed an image of an obese or non-obese woman, and then evaluated that woman on a number of dimensions (emotions, attitudes, stereotypes, desire for social distance). Compared with the non-obese target, the obese target elicited more disgust, more negative attitudes and stereotypes, and a greater desire for social distance. Furthermore, disgust mediated the effect of the target's body size on all of the outcome variables (attitudes, stereotypes, social distance). Disgust plays an important role in prejudice and discrimination toward individuals with obesity, and might in part explain the pervasiveness of weight bias.

T1  - To Laugh or not to Laugh: A Critical Discourse Analysis of the Humour Employed in Khabardaar
AN  - 1903923876
AB  - Although the primary function of humour is to make people laugh, it also plays a major role in shaping people's attitudes. Apparently the function of humour is to generate laughter in order to amuse people and release their tension but verbal humour also involves the use of language to construct or deconstruct people's identity. The aim of the current study is to explore the identity constructed through the humour employed in one of the programmes: Khabardaar telecast on Express, a Pakistani News channel, in order to unmask the hidden ideologies. Being a qualitative case study, instances of verbal humour taken from different shows of the programme are analyzed within the framework of Critical Discourse Analysis. The data analysis reveals that in most of the cases the physical features of people, including their obesity and skin colour, are made the target of humour. The study exposes injustice against such people who are considered physically unattractive, according to our cultural notion of attractiveness and addresses the issue of inequality highlighted by Fairclough (1995). The humour is not just confined to the physical appearance of people but also involves ridiculing people on the basis of their gender, ethnicity, and nationality. The paper ends with a note of recommendation for the TV channels in general and the comedians in particular, that advertently or inadvertently, become agents in spreading hatred and intolerance against individuals and groups leading to further reinforcement of different forms of prejudice that already exist in our society.

T1  - Transgender stigma and health: A critical review of stigma determinants, mechanisms, and interventions
AN  - 1751218162
AB  - Transgender people in the United States experience widespread prejudice, discrimination, violence, and other forms of stigma. This critical review aims to integrate the literature on stigma towards transgender people in the US. This review demonstrates that transgender stigma limits opportunities and access to resources in a number of critical domains (e.g., employment, healthcare), persistently affecting the physical and mental health of transgender people. The applied social ecological model employed here elucidates that transgender stigma operates at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, structural) to impact health. Stigma prevention and coping interventions hold promise for reducing stigma and its adverse health-related effects in transgender populations. Additional research is needed to document the causal relationship between stigma and adverse health as well as the mediators and moderators of stigma in US transgender populations. Multi-level interventions to prevent stigma towards transgender people are warranted. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615302185]

AN  - 1790889870
AB  - The Kal Oddars are a Denotified Criminal Tribe living in southern Tamil Nadu, India. With a history of nomadism, this community was categorised by the British as hereditary criminals. Though denotified today, the community still faces social exclusion, marginalisation and continued stereotyping by law enforcement agencies and society at large. This article describes the feminisation of stigma taking place within the community and its consequences. The continued stigma and the prejudices of society and the police have a profound impact on the position of the Kal Oddar women, who bear the brunt of all oppression.

T1  - The Effects of Civil Hate Speech Laws: Lessons from Australia
AN  - 1735658655; 201537807
AB  - This article examines the effects of hate speech laws in Australia. Triangulating data from primary and secondary sources, we examine five hypothesized effects: whether the laws provide a remedy to targets of hate speech, encourage more respectful speech, have an educative or symbolic effect, have a chilling effect, or create 'martyrs.' We find the laws provide a limited remedy in the complaints mechanisms, provide a framework for direct community advocacy, and that knowledge of the laws exists in public discourse. However, the complaints mechanism imposes a significant enforcement burden on targeted communities, who still regularly experience hate speech. We find a reduction in the expression of prejudice in mediated outlets, but not on the street. We find no evidence of a chilling effect and we find the risk of free speech martyrs to be marginal. We draw out the implications of these findings for other countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Achieving Social Change: A Matter of All for One?
AN  - 1710569040
AB  - Recently, there has been a growing interest in not only understanding the processes underlying responses to disadvantage, and ways of reducing prejudice, but also to gain insight into how experiences of prejudice and social disadvantage affect the need to address one's disadvantage. Our goal in this issue is to discuss how and when low status group members move from experiences of individual versus collective disadvantage to social change. In this article, we consider the individual coping and social change literature, departing from the analyses of individual-level responses to disadvantage, to those at the collective level, to discuss how both strands of research relate to social change. Throughout this article, we introduce the contributions to this special issue and discuss the caveats and paradoxes they raise with regard to the existent literature.

T1  - Self-Empowerment in Later Life as a Response to Ageism
AN  - 1752994655; 201600843
AB  - Ageism is alive and well, with old-age stereotypes lurking in public and private institutions. From the water cooler to the webpage, negative age bias is frustratingly prevalent. For older individuals, recognizing the current reality is a difficult, yet necessary, first step toward self-empowerment. Those who take that step position themselves to make their later years as productive and purposeful as they can be. Ageism has been described as prejudice against one's future self. It tells us that age is our defining characteristic and that, as midnight strikes on a milestone birthday, we will become nothing but old-emptied of our passions, abilities and experience-infused instead with frailty and decline'. A Yale study of Facebook underscored the problem. The authors analyzed each publicly accessible Facebook group that concentrated on older adults. Of the eightyfour groups analyzed, all but one of the site descriptions focused on negative age stereotypes. Seventy-four percent excoriated older individuals, 27% infantilized them, and 37 percent advocated banning them from public activities, such as shopping. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - American Academic Freedom and Chinese Nationalism: An H-Asia Debate
AN  - 1783248598
AB  - The unfolding of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) incident in spring 2006 led to lively exchanges and debates among scholars on the US-based Asian studies listserv, H-Asia, which lasted from early May to mid-June. They were the most rapid, intense exchanges and debates on a single topic in the more than two decades' history of the listserv, providing a small window onto the mentality of the academic world mostly dominated by US scholars regarding the MIT incident and other relevant issues. Some commentators on H-Asia were thoughtful and open minded. But a number of the posts, critical of the MIT students, quickly framed the debate as Chinese nationalism vs. US academic freedom. They implied that the MIT Chinese students were motivated by Chinese nationalism because of the Chinese Communist Party's indoctrination. According to those critics, the MIT Chinese students failed to appreciate the nuance of humanities and social sciences and the spirit of US academic freedom. This article takes a critical look at the H-Asia debate on Chinese nationalism and US academic freedom over the MIT incident. It raises a number of issues, including academic freedom; nationalism; academic hierarchy; culture of victimization; scholars' responsibility; racial, political, and cultural prejudice; and some Western scholars' own aversion toward "Chinese nationalism." It questions whether the threat to academic freedom is not within each of us because of our own prejudices.

T1  - “The White Space”
AN  - 2406941943
AB  - Since the end of the Civil Rights Movement, large numbers of black people have made their way into settings previously occupied only by whites, though their reception has been mixed. Overwhelmingly white neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, restaurants, and other public spaces remain. Blacks perceive such settings as “the white space,” which they often consider to be informally “off limits” for people like them. Meanwhile, despite the growth of an enormous black middle class, many whites assume that the natural black space is that destitute and fearsome locality so commonly featured in the public media, including popular books, music and videos, and the TV news—the iconic ghetto. White people typically avoid black space, but black people are required to navigate the white space as a condition of their existence.

T1  - More than Prejudice
AN  - 2406941807
AB  - Racism has always been “more than prejudice,” but mainstream social analysts have mostly framed race matters as organized by the logic of prejudice. In this paper, I do four things. First, I restate my criticism of the dominant approach to race matters and emphasize the need to ground our racial analysis materially, that is, understanding that racism is systemic and rooted in differences in power between the races. Second, I reflect critically on my own theorization on race (the racialized social system approach) and acknowledge that I should have explained better the role of culture and ideology in the making and remaking of race. Third, I describe some of the work I have done since this early work. Fourth, I advance several new directions for research and theory in the field of race stratification.

T1  - Applying the contact hypothesis to anti-fat attitudes: Contact with overweight people is related to how we interact with our bodies and those of others
AN  - 1738477004; 201538930
AB  - This paper is the first to apply the contact hypothesis, a social psychological theory of prejudice reduction, to the field of weight bias. It aims to investigate whether contact with overweight people is associated with the extent to which people report weight bias, as well as vigilance around their own bodies. In 2013 we recruited 1176 American participants to complete surveys regarding prejudice toward overweight people, as well as a suite of measures capturing people's relationships with their own weight (fat talk, drive for thinness, and body-checking behavior). Positive contact with overweight people predicted decreased prejudice, regardless of whether participants were overweight (p < .001) or not (p = .003). However, negative contact was a stronger predictor of increased prejudice (p < .001 for both samples). For non-overweight participants, any contact with overweight people (whether positive or negative) predicted increased body-checking behaviors (positive-p = .002, negative-p < .001) and fat talk (positive-p = .047, negative-p < .001), and negative contact predicted increased drive for thinness (p < .001). However, for those who were overweight a different picture emerged. While negative contact predicted increased body-checking behaviors (p < .001) and fat talk (p < .001), positive contact was protective, predicting decreased drive for thinness (p = .001) and body-checking behaviors (p < .001). This paper demonstrates that the interactions we have with overweight people are inherently tied to both our attitudes towards them and our relationship with our own bodies. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The mainly nameless and faceless dead: an exploratory study of the illicit traffic in archaeological and ethnographic human remains
AN  - 1680150711; 201516642
AB  - This paper represents an exploratory study of what is known about the current global trade in human remains, and in particular, specimens from archaeological or ethnographic contexts, regardless of which source countries they derive from and where they are destined. The paper is in four parts. In Part 1, we explain how the analysis of human remains forms an important component of archaeological research, and why looting activity at burial sites prejudice this research. In Part 2 we review the existing and relevant archaeological, ethnographic and criminological literature on the subject while in Part 3 we describe our own research into the online trade in human remains, both licit and illicit. To assess the current global prevalence and distribution of public and private dealers in human remains, keyword searches on common search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing), and online sites like eBay and Amazon were conducted. In Part 4 we draw some conclusions about our research and point in particular to various policy and law reform issues which require further consideration and study. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Identity or Behavior: A Moral and Medical Basis for LGBTQ Rights
AN  - 1667951069; 201512257
AB  - The progress of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and queer rights entails the erosion of prejudice, and erosion is a slow process. Much press accrues to the dramatic advancement of gay marriage, but that progress reflects decades of committed activism that antedate the sea change. Social science, physical science, politics, philosophy, religion, and innumerable other fields have bearing on the emergence of healthy LGBTQ identities. The field of bioethics is implicated both in revolutionizing attitudes and in determining how best to utilize such ameliorated positions. For decades, the debate around homosexuality has centered on whether it is a choice or an inherent quality. A growing segment of the population believes that gay people are 'made that way' and therefore do not deserve to be treated with the prejudice they might warrant if they had simply elected what others resisted. In effect, they are like disabled people, who can't help the challenges they face, and unlike murderers, who could choose not to kill. Anti-gay arguments tend to hinge on a view of gayness as a behavior; the liberatory ones, on gayness as an identity. A behavior can be avoided; an identity is integral and therefore warrants acceptance -- or even celebration. People have a right to their identities, even if they have the capacity to act out other, different identities. Bioethics is the field in which this distinction between gay acts and a gay self may be argued most directly. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Conceptual art and language: introducing a logico-semantic analysis
AN  - 2012906179
AB  - This article suggests a logico-semantic analysis of Keith Arnatt's Trouser-Word Piece and Victor Burgin's Room, based on Ludwig Wittgenstein's examination of the logical relationship between propositions and the world and M.A.K. Halliday's discussion of social semiotics. It reconsiders the use of language in conceptual art practices from a wider sociological and interdisciplinary perspective, and aims to show how their juxtaposition of different voices within a public context negotiates the space of art as a social space. Focusing on how artworks communicate in context, the following discussion presents the historical as well as the discursive environment in which Arnatt's and Burgin's works are situated and received; moreover, it examines how these works critically manipulate viewing and reading regimes, frameworks of evaluation and patterns of communication in order to create a situation of particular tension between perceptual and conceptual apprehension. In wider terms, this article demonstrates how critically engaged artworks manipulate the conditions of communication by utilizing loan rhetoric (a rhetoric external to the art context) and displace associate meaning in order to challenge the institutionalization of art's production and function. In doing so, they critically stage and contest the power structures that support corresponding hierarchies across producer, audience and mediator, and bring art's social modality into focus. Investigating the manipulation of language in conceptual art, this article proposes a method of analysis that becomes fundamental in studying contemporary multi-modal art production, and in understanding the dialectics of art'But the difficulty is to remove the prejudices communication and critical potential.

T1  - From object to subject: Deconstructing anthropology and HIV/AIDS in South Africa
AN  - 1735655550; 201537051
AB  - South Africa has the highest burden of HIV/AIDS in the world. Theories that account for this are wide-ranging. This article argues that anthropological theories advanced to speak to the widespread nature and particular patterning of HIV vulnerability revert to problematic notions that betray age-old prejudices that once characterised the discipline. I argue that these theories do not, in fact, go to the root cause debates that are more contemporary and thus credible in accounting for HIV/AIDS in South Africa. South Africa has some glaring properties that cannot be ignored when accounting for its HIV/AIDS epicentre status. This article is a critical appraisal of anthropological HIV/AIDS discourse in South Africa. I argue that, in fact, such discourse serves ubiquitous purposes that can be duly read when one considers the history of the discipline, practices in the discipline and the power dynamics that reside in and arise from scholarly interventions.

T1  - What Makes a Young Assertive Bystander? The Effect of Intergroup Contact, Empathy, Cultural Openness, and In-Group Bias on Assertive Bystander Intervention Intentions
AN  - 1559005085; 201433440
AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: 'empathy,' 'cultural openness,' 'in-group bias,' and 'intergroup anxiety.' British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Women as Expert Witnesses: A Review of the Literature
AN  - 1542001145; 201428651
AB  - This review of women's participation in the legal system as expert witnesses examines the empirical literature on the perceived credibility and persuasiveness of women compared with men experts. The effects of expert gender are complex and sometimes depend on the circumstances of the case. Some studies find no differences, some find favorable effects for women and others for men, and still others find that expert gender interacts with other circumstances of the case. The findings are interpreted through social role theory and the role incongruity theory of prejudice. Future directions for research are identified and implications are considered for attorneys who select and prepare expert witnesses. Suggestions for men's and women's behavior as expert witnesses are provided. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Imagining the Indian nationalist movement: Revolutionary metaphors in imagery of the freedom struggle
AN  - 1520342862; 201413671
AB  - Recent interventions suggest that the history of India's nationalist movement might be profitably reconstructed with reference to visual culture as a way of counteracting both dominant Congress teleologies and the colonial prejudices embedded in governmental records. This article furthers this hypothesis by undertaking a close examination of Desh Chintan, a rich nationalist image from the 1930s. Grounding Desh Chintan against a matrix of archival sources, banned literature, oral history interviews and other posters of the era presents a substantially different picture of the way in which the anti-colonial movement was conceived in the 1930s. This analysis suggests that there was a moment in the freedom struggle in which support for acts of retributive revolutionary violence were unproblematically maintained alongside genuine enthusiasm for the Gandhian program of non-violence.

T1  - Structural stigma and all-cause mortality in sexual minority populations
AN  - 1692288864; 201523499
AB  - Stigma operates at multiple levels, including intrapersonal appraisals (e.g., self-stigma), interpersonal events (e.g., hate crimes), and structural conditions (e.g., community norms, institutional policies). Although prior research has indicated that intrapersonal and interpersonal forms of stigma negatively affect the health of the stigmatized, few studies have addressed the health consequences of exposure to structural forms of stigma. To address this gap, we investigated whether structural stigma-operationalized as living in communities with high levels of anti-gay prejudice-increases risk of premature mortality for sexual minorities. We constructed a measure capturing the average level of anti-gay prejudice at the community level, using data from the General Social Survey, which was then prospectively linked to all-cause mortality data via the National Death Index. Sexual minorities living in communities with high levels of anti-gay prejudice experienced a higher hazard of mortality than those living in low-prejudice communities (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 3.03, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.50, 6.13), controlling for individual and community-level covariates. This result translates into a shorter life expectancy of approximately 12 years (95% C.I.: 4-20 years) for sexual minorities living in high-prejudice communities. Analysis of specific causes of death revealed that suicide, homicide/violence, and cardiovascular diseases were substantially elevated among sexual minorities in high-prejudice communities. Strikingly, there was an 18-year difference in average age of completed suicide between sexual minorities in the high-prejudice (age 37.5) and low-prejudice (age 55.7) communities. These results highlight the importance of examining structural forms of stigma and prejudice as social determinants of health and longevity among minority populations. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - TOWARD A FILIPINO CRITICAL PEDAGOGY: Exposure Programs to the Philippines and the Politicization of Melissa Roxas
AN  - 1551002759; 201429493
AB  - Scholars often turn to the activism of US-born Filipino Americans in their militant confrontation of the US-supported Marcos dictatorship during the 1970s and 1980s as a political apex. This claim raises a series of related questions. What has happened to such militant activism since the downfall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986? Does a Filipino American identity motivated by the eradication of US neocolonialism in the Philippines and the ideals of collective emancipation for Filipinos in the US, the Philippines, and throughout a global diaspora still exist in the twenty-first century? In seeking to address these questions, this article also considers the ways in which Asian American studies can continue to honor and build upon its rich social movement legacy by advancing theoretical frames that are in interchange with global struggles and community experiences of resistance. Due to the persistent nature of discrimination felt by Filipino immigrant families in the US, tactics were enacted to shelter their offspring from having to face similar expressions of racial prejudice and ridicule.

T1  - Familiarising the Gay, Queering the Family: Coming Out and Resilience in Mambo italiano
AN  - 1559003999; 201433005
AB  - This article explores how two Italian-Canadian families negotiate the coming out of their sons in the film Mambo italiano, a comedy/ drama released in 2003 and set in Montreal, Canada. The Italian-Canadian protagonist, Angelo, after years of living in the closet, decides to tell his parents he is gay, outing at the same time his Italian-Canadian lover, Nino, and provoking initially strong and vexed reactions in their respective families. Although full of stereotypes and cliches on ethnicity and gender identities, and following closely the so-called coming-out films' genre, arguably concerned with positive representations of gay coming-out experiences, the film portrays the ironic, creative, and interesting ways in which these Italian-Canadian families negotiate a coming out despite the homophobic prejudices they are imbued with. Moving from studies of family resilience, this article argues that the major strategies used for integrating gayness into the family are drawn from the resources available to (post)migrant families. These are the use of rituals and the adaptation of ethnic schemata to new realities in order to cope with the unfamiliar, and the ability to envision family as an evolving and changeable reality, as this capability and the hope for a better future is what had sustained the survival of migrants in a hostile land. These considerations are backed up with reference to Italian-Canadian and Italian-North/American gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) writers, whose concerns are similar to those found in Mambo italiano.

T1  - Are the latter-day saints too latter day? Perceived age of the Mormon Church and attitudes toward Mormons
AN  - 1512218347; 201408612
AB  - Two studies examine how social distance toward Mormons is affected by the relative recency of the Mormon religion. In Study 1, we found that the perceived age of the Mormon religion predicted social distance toward Mormons such that people who perceived Mormonism as more recent wanted more social distance from Mormons. In Study 2, we manipulated the antiquity or recency of the Mormon religion. We found that emphasizing the long history of the religion reduced social distance from Mormons (relative to emphasizing the religion's newness), an effect that was mediated by perceived legitimacy of the Mormon religion. These findings support past research showing that the longevity of a practice implies its goodness and that this inference extends to practitioners as well.

T1  - ATTITUDES TOWARDS MUSLIMS ARE MORE FAVORABLE ON A SURVEY THAN ON AN IMPLICIT RELATIONAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE (IRAP)
AN  - 1718067479; 201530636
AB  - Sugar ingestion bolsters cognitive resources, which should improve ability to inhibit expressing socially undesirable responses on explicit measures, including surveys. In this study, undergraduates drank regular or diet root-beer, then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) followed by an Anti-Muslim Prejudice Scale (AMPS). The IRAP indicated neutral attitudes about Muslims and positive attitudes about Westerners. However, the AMPS indicated significant pro-Muslim attitudes. There was no significant effect of drink on the AMPS. However, participants who drank regular root-beer showed stronger anti-Muslim bias on the IRAP. Increased bias following sugar ingestion may reflect a discrepancy between implicit and explicit measures. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Indian Fashion Show: Fighting Cultural Stereotypes with Gender
AN  - 1512218147; 201409162
AB  - Every American knows what an American Indian should look like. It is general American popular culture knowledge. But what most Americans in the 1930s through the 1950s 'knew' was not reality, it was an iconic Indian seen through the lens of essentializing American stereotypes. Anthropologists have long considered it part of their moral agenda to replace the cultural misinformation and overgeneralizations that ground stereotypes with culturally accurate information in order to eliminate prejudice, discrimination, and assumptions. This paper constitutes a case study of one anthropologist's attempts to eliminate entrenched, negative racial, ethnic, and cultural stereotypes about American Indians through stereotype transference, respect for cultural variation, and content eradication, espousing gender as the critical universal commonality that will eliminate discrimination. Frederic Douglas's innovative living display, the Indian Fashion Show, is embedded within a theoretical discussion of stereotyping as a sociocultural process. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Linguistic creativity in Nigerian Pidgin advertising
AN  - 1524820961
AB  - Advertising communication aims at attracting audiences' attention. It also motivates interest, changes perceptions, stimulates desires and manipulates social values and attitudes. In achieving these objectives, the language medium needs to be carefully selected, especially in a multilingual setting like Nigeria, given that language is the driving force that determines the effectiveness of ad messages. This paper explores the (socio)linguistic devices that are exploited in ad discourse in Nigerian Pidgin (NP) as well as the pragmatic and creative potentials of lexical innovation, code-switching, proverbs, humour and other stylistic strategies that are employed in both print and electronic ads in NP. The paper discovers that advertising in NP commands enormous public appeal because of its spread, flexibility and the creative possibilities it allows. Advertising communication presents yet another platform to deepen further the social utility and functional relevance of NP in the public space in spite of the widespread and age-long misconceptions and prejudices against it.

T1  - Migrant-Local Hiring Queues in the UK Food Industry
AN  - 1463012975; 201347764
AB  - The paper argues that a clear migrant-local hiring queue has emerged at the bottom of the UK labour market since EU enlargement (in 2004 and 2007). The hiring queue reflects a preference amongst low-wage employers in the UK food industry for newly arrived A8 and A2 migrants and related prejudice towards would-be domestic workers. Using interview and survey evidence -- from 37 horticultural growers/processors and 268 farmers, respectively -- we describe what these hiring queues look like. We then explain their emergence: arguing that migrant-local hiring queues are predominantly the result of the 'added value' that migrants from the EU periphery bring, over the short term, to the low-wage workplace.

T1  - Narrative encounters and changing perceptions of others
AN  - 1448995606; 201342713
AB  - Although each of the contributions to this issue of Peace and Conflict were submitted to the journal's editorial office independently, they all focus on a set of related topics -- dialogue, narrative, empathy, and perspective taking -- in the context of prejudice, stress, trauma, and heightened or intransigent conflict. They offer insight into peace and conflict that is broad in scope and attentive to detail. We see commonality in all of the articles in this issue as each examines what it means to encounter new knowledge, experiences, or social issues. By bringing together diverse theories, methods, and contexts -- micro and macro, historical and contemporary -- and applying them to key impediments to peace in today's world, this issue makes a valuable contribution to peace psychology and conflict studies. We are most appreciative of the many authors and reviewers who have contributed their research and expertise to this issue. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice: A Longitudinal Test During a Global Recession
AN  - 1559005139; 201431879
AB  - This study tested the pathways between personality, social worldviews, and ideology, predicted by the Dual Process Model (DPM) of ideology and prejudice. These paths were tested using a full cross-lagged panel design administered to a New Zealand community sample in early 2008 (before the effects of the global financial crisis reached New Zealand) and again in 2009 (when the crisis was near its peak; n = 247). As hypothesized, low openness to experience predicted residualized change in dangerous worldview, which in turn predicted right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Low agreeableness predicted competitive worldview, which in turn predicted social dominance orientation (SDO). RWA and SDO also exerted unexpected reciprocal effects on worldviews. This study provides the most comprehensive longitudinal test of the DPM to date, and was conducted during a period of systemic instability when the causal effects predicted by the DPM should be, and were, readily apparent.

T1  - The willingness of a society to act on behalf of Indigenous Australians and refugees: the role of contact, intergroup anxiety, prejudice, and support for legislative change
AN  - 1433108648
AB  - The relationship between contact and prejudice against Indigenous Australians and refugees was explored. Using path analysis, increased quality of contact significantly decreased prejudice toward Indigenous Australians, both directly and indirectly through intergroup anxiety; while increased quantity of contact reduced prejudice via a direct pathway. Decreased levels of prejudice toward Indigenous Australians led to increases in support for legislation, which led to increases in willingness to act. Similar results were found for the refugee analysis, except that there was no relationship between quantity of contact and other variables. Qualitative analyses revealed the importance of context, the nature of experience and indirect experience, and societal factors. Our results indicate the power of contact, as well as other structural, interpersonal, and personal factors.

T1  - Protecting the Right to Life of Journalists: The Need for a Higher Level of Engagement
AN  - 1512218858; 201409788
AB  - Journalists play a central role in fostering a society based on the open discussion of facts and the pursuit of the truth, as opposed to one based on rumor, prejudice, and the naked exercise of power. As a result, journalists are often literally in the line of fire and deserve special protection. This article considers the characteristics of deadly attacks on journalists over the last two decades and examines how the applicable legal and policy frameworks can be used better or improved to provide a higher level of protection. Impunity, often a by-product of the politicized nature of journalistic activities, is seen as the major cause of continuous attacks on journalists. The conclusion is drawn that one of the key elements of a strategy to better protect journalists is to "elevate" the issue on a number of fronts: to move prevention and accountability from the local to the central level within domestic jurisdictions, while simultaneously heightening the level of international engagement with this issue.

T1  - Learning to think differently: Diversity training and the 'good encounter'
AN  - 1551001199; 201429287
AB  - At a time of ongoing economic and social insecurity the capacity to live with difference is under renewed strain. In this context, community outreach organisations and projects of intervention that deal with diversity-related tensions are essential. This paper provides an empirical account of a diversity workshop run by an international organisation that aims to cultivate more peaceful modes of coexistence through attention to the everyday formation of prejudice. The paper has two key concerns. The first is to attend to the techniques employed to facilitate encounters with difference and to unpack the constructions of prejudiced thought. In the context of growing debates around the possibilities and challenges of coordinated contact, the paper engages with work that has articulated alternative ways of responding to difference through an attention to practices of embodied thought. The second concern focuses upon the conditions that make new ways of thinking possible and argues that in order to understand how such organisations might affect positive change, it is vital to understand how such workshops take-place. The paper therefore attends to the role of memory, habit and the working of particular affects such as shame, to open up a discussion about the ways in which workshop exercises might resonate beyond training events. The paper concludes with some reflections upon the implications for policies concerned with behavioural change in the context of developing relations across difference. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AN  - 1692287713; 201524353
AB  - Attitudes, stereotyping, and prejudice are often conceived of as inner, mental or cognitive processes. Drawing on discursive psychology and critical theory, this article proposes a language-based understanding of stereotyping and the 'syndrome character' of prejudice that is able to avoid certain epistemological shortcomings and connect social-psychological and sociological research. Stereotyping is outlined as a relational concept that denotes a linguistic mode of relating to the world, whilst the syndrome character of prejudice is conceptualized as a phenomenon that shows in particular stereotypical speech acts, but does not completely coincide with them. The impact of this conceptual figuration is empirically illustrated using Anders Breivik's manifesto. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This contribution addresses the issue of reduction of dehumanisation towards Blacks, an outgroup that has been historically targeted by heinous prejudice. The study tested, for the first time, whether the combination of multiple categorisation and human identity represents the most optimal condition for reducing dehumanisation towards Blacks. The main dependent variables were attribution of secondary emotions and inalienability of human rights. Results highlighted the combination of multiple categorisation and human identity as the most effective strategy in reducing dehumanisation towards Blacks. Evidence of this study sheds light on the possible ways through which conceiving others in terms of complex categorical criteria, that is, as members of the human group in conjunction with other communal or different social categories, can lead to more harmonious intergroup relations.

T1  - Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals
AN  - 1283641062; 201303101
AB  - Although biases against homosexuals (and bisexuals) are well established, potential biases against a largely unrecognized sexual minority group, asexuals, has remained uninvestigated. In two studies (university student and community samples) we examined the extent to which those not desiring sexual activity are viewed negatively by heterosexuals. We provide the first empirical evidence of intergroup bias against asexuals (the so-called "Group X"), a social target evaluated more negatively, viewed as less human, and less valued as contact partners, relative to heterosexuals and other sexual minorities. Heterosexuals were also willing to discriminate against asexuals (matching discrimination against homosexuals). Potential confounds (e.g., bias against singles or unfamiliar groups) were ruled out as explanations. We suggest that the boundaries of theorizing about sexual minority prejudice be broadened to incorporate this new target group at this critical period, when interest in and recognition of asexuality is scientifically and culturally expanding.

T1  - The Sexual Revolution's Last Frontier: How Silence About Sex Undermines Health, Well-Being, and Safety in Old Age
AN  - 1347785812; 201320323
AB  - As the 77 million baby boomers who brought people the sexual revolution inexorably age, they will face a striking paradox. The ignorance, prejudice, and silence about sex and sexuality they fought so hard to upend are still alive and well in old age. In May 2011, in a colloquium sponsored by The Harry & Jeanette Weinberg Center for Elder Abuse Prevention, the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College served as an historic backdrop for a daylong discussion about sex and aging, examining the subject across a spectrum -- as a health, human rights, social service, criminal justice, victim assistance, and ethical issue. In the largest ever study on sex and aging, researchers interviewed 3,005 community-dwelling people, ages 57 to 85, about their sexual practices, assessed their health status, and examined the correlation between the two. Overall, the study found that while sexuality declines with age, most older adults remain sexually active and report that sex remains an important part of life. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gender, Religion and an Immigrant Minority: Jewish women and the suffrage movement in Britain c.1900-1920
AN  - 1567049527; 201437804
AB  - Middle- and upper-class Jewish women enjoyed less equality within their faith communities than Christian counterparts. They were represented in every strand of the suffrage movement, and in 1912 formed the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage (JLWS), modelled on similar Christian leagues. A study of the origins of the JLWS, and its relations with parallel organisations, shows religious difference to have been no barrier, and even conducive to, cross-denominational collaboration. The JLWS confounded (largely male) communal expectations that it would not influence London's East End, and would exacerbate prejudice against Jews. Post-1918, Jewish women were denied the level of equality within their faith congregations achieved by their Christian peers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Self-reported discrimination and discriminatory behaviour: The role of attachment security
AN  - 1283641825; 201303115
AB  - Past research shows that attachment security is linked to low prejudice (Hofstra, Van Oudenhoven & Bunnk, 2005; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2001). We extend this research by examining the role of attachment security in discriminatory choices and discriminatory behaviour. The current study examines the influence of primed attachment security (vs. neutral prime) on self-reported discrimination and actual discriminatory behaviour towards Muslims. Results illustrate that primed attachment security (vs. a neutral prime) significantly predicts both the choice to discriminate against Muslims and subsequent behavioural discrimination towards a Muslim. Implications for increasing attachment security as a means of reducing prejudice and discrimination are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Where the rubber hits the road' en route to inter-group harmony: Examining contact intentions and contact behaviour under meta-stereotype threat
AN  - 1283641815; 201303174
AB  - Although inter-group contact reduces prejudice, intra-group contact is most typically preferred. Understanding factors contributing to out-group avoidance, therefore, is imperative. Unlike previous correlational studies, other-stereotype (out-group is biased) and meta-stereotype (out-group sees one's in-group as biased) information was manipulated in an inter-group contact setting, at the personal (you/partner) or group (in-group/out-group) level. Whites under threat generally indicated positive expectations and intentions to approach Black interaction partners. However, at the behavioural level, personal meta-stereotype manipulations (your partner thinks you are biased) generated out-group avoidance several times stronger than in the other threat conditions. Implications for the development of prejudice interventions are discussed within an aversive racism framework. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Dynamics and dilemmas in social psychology: Social relations, identities and cognition
AN  - 1041164323
AB  - This paper aims to provide a systematised overview of the paradigmatic orientations in social psychology in Portugal by identifying the most cited publications. Results show that the eight most cited thematic are: (1) deviance and reactions to deviance, (2) methodology, (3) prejudice and discrimination, (4) gender studies, (5) risk, environment and safety, (6) information processing, social judgment, familiarity and mood, (7) social representations and (8) social justice and belief in a just world. These eight most salient thematics can be sorted into three current paradigmatic orientations in contemporary social psychology: (a) social cognition; (b) the study of collective beliefs, ideologies and social representations; and (c) the study of identity and its impact on intra- and intergroup processes. The paper finishes with a reflection on the future developments of the discipline and the dilemmas that social psychology in Portugal could face. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Prejudice Against Muslim Australians: The Role of Values, Gender and Consensus
AN  - 1023026675; 201223735
AB  - Data from an Australian community survey (n = 189) examining the predictors of prejudice against Muslim Australians were analysed. Using thematic analysis, we investigated the specific values our participants reported regarding their perceptions of Muslim Australians and Islam. We then investigated the relationship between prejudice against Muslim Australians, the most important value priorities given by our participants, and other prejudice-related variables. After entry into a regression analysis, the participants high in prejudice were found to be significantly more likely to have lower educational levels and more right-wing views. They were also significantly more likely to report high levels of national attitudes (i.e. stronger identification with Australian identity), concern about gender equality within the Muslim community, less concern about equality generally and report that Muslims were not conforming to Australian values. High prejudiced participants also scored higher in the reporting of negative media-related beliefs, were more likely to perceive higher support in the community for their views than was the case and were more negative towards Muslim men than Muslim women. The implications for anti-prejudice interventions are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Cultural Inertia: The Relationship Between Ethnic Identity and Reactions to Cultural Change
AN  - 1347781576; 201318528
AB  - The Latino population in the United States is rapidly increasing. This increase produces cultural change, and the cultural inertia model suggests that cultural change is resisted if one's cultural identity must change. The present study investigates the role of ethnic identification in Latinos' reactions to pressures to assimilate to mainstream American culture. Perceptions of cultural change were manipulated and prejudice toward White Americans, support for pro-minority legislation, and individual differences in collective self-esteem and openness to cultural change were measured. When biased to believe that their culture will have to change, Latinos high in collective self-esteem expressed greater prejudice toward White Americans and stronger political advocacy for Latino culture. These results support the cultural inertia model and make recommendations for how to improve intergroup relations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Behavioural consequences of imagining intergroup contact with stigmatized outgroups
AN  - 1023028878; 201223706
AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an outgroup member would change intergroup behaviour. Participants who had imagined a positive interaction with an outgroup member or an unspecified stranger were told that they were about to take part in a discussion task with an outgroup member. They were taken to a room and asked to set out two chairs ready for the discussion while the experimenter left, ostensibly to find the other participant. The distance between the two chairs was then measured. Undergraduate students who imagined talking to an obese individual (Experiment 1) or a Muslim individual (Experiment 2) placed the chairs significantly closer than those in the control condition. They also reported more positive feelings and beliefs regarding Muslims. These findings highlight an important practical application of imagined contact: preparing people for successful face-to-face contact.

T1  - 'People Look at Us, the Way We Dress, and They Think We're Gangsters': Bonds, Bridges, Gangs and Refugees: A Qualitative Study of Inter-Cultural Social Capital in Glasgow
AN  - 1030867940; 201227899
AB  - It is widely recognized that refugee integration occurs most effectively within communities that are rich in inter-cultural social capital. This paper explores the dangers associated with intensely bonded and disconnected communities and the relationship between refugee marginalization and the presence of youth gangs. Drawing upon a small-scale qualitative study with young refugees in Glasgow, it seeks to explore the extent to and ways in which these young people experience social bonding and bridging and participate in gang culture. The findings suggest that excessive bonding social capital often limits opportunities for inter-cultural integration in Glasgow. Gang membership, although driven primarily by territorial issues, provides one site for ethnic solidarity and racial prejudice. The paper considers the potential for community initiatives to build inter-cultural cohesion, and ends by calling for changes to dispersal policy and for further research to explore the most effective vehicles for building social capital in multi-ethnic urban communities.

T1  - Individual differences in prejudice and associative versus rule-based forms of transitive reasoning
AN  - 1018342777; 201212791
AB  - Two experiments examined whether individual differences in prejudice are associated with different reasoning styles when targets and nontargets of prejudice are processed in the same context. High-prejudice and low-prejudice participants studied pairwise relations between four persons (one a prejudice target, three nontargets). Stereotypes were made salient by using specific ethnic names and stereotypic traits to define relations between the targets. Relations between the persons were always stereotype congruent in Experiment 1, whereas they were sometimes stereotype incongruent in Experiment 2. We examined study time, relational memory, and transitive reasoning in both experiments. The results of both experiments indicated that the high-prejudice participants studied sets of relations presented to them faster than did the low-prejudice participants. The high-prejudice participants were also more likely to show impaired relational memory and reasoning about nontarget persons but no such limitations with respect to target persons. This novel evidence that prejudice might substantially impair memory and transitive reasoning processes about nontarget persons is discussed in the light of alternative theoretical frameworks in the social cognition and emotion domains.

T1  - 'I am a Believer but not a Conformist': Negotiating Claims to being Religious among Syrian Christians and Muslims
AN  - 914766921; 201200126
AB  - Psychologists' attempts to define and measure religion reveal substantial variability, a lack of consensus, cultural variation and differences between religions. A discursive psychology approach can address variability in meanings and the inferential issues that may inform claims to be religious. This paper identifies strategies used by Syrian Muslims and Christians to affirm, reformulate or deny religiousness. The analysis is based on a corpus of data generated through semi-structured interviews with 158 men and women. It shows how some speakers affirm that they are religious and treat this as a non-accountable matter. When asked to describe the basis of being religious, they produced descriptions of their own practices or a set of general criteria. Other speakers denied or modified 'being religious', using an 'x but not y' formulation to reject one meaning (for example, conformist) in favour of another (for example, believer). Some speakers' self-ascriptions were reinforced by characterizing their own views of religion as morals and good behaviour. Thus speakers deploy multiple meanings of religion for different purposes. Moreover their accounts address inferential and interpersonal problems that arise when claiming to be religious: specifically that others may infer extremism or conformity, or prejudice against members of other religions. The implications of these observations for social psychological studies of religion are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Stereotypes as Justifications of Prejudice
AN  - 902085374; 201122138
AB  - Three experiments investigate how stereotypes form as justifications for prejudice. The authors created novel content-free prejudices toward unfamiliar social groups using either subliminal (Experiment 1, N = 79) or supraliminal (Experiment 2, N = 105; Experiment 3, N = 130) affective conditioning and measured the consequent endorsement of stereotypes about the groups. Following the stereotype content model, analyses focused on the extent to which stereotypes connoted warmth or competence. Results from all three experiments revealed effects on the warmth dimension but not on the competence dimension: Groups associated with negative affect were stereotyped as comparatively cold (but not comparatively incompetent). These results provide the first evidence that-in the absence of information, interaction, or history of behavioral discrimination-stereotypes develop to justify prejudice.

T1  - Proactive Performance: A Context for Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1283640952; 201304269
AB  - Over the years, Allport's (1954) contact hypothesis has become the primary theoretical approach to intergroup contact, yet researchers are just now beginning to explore specific contact contexts. This article introduces proactive performance as a context for intergroup contact. Specifically, interACT, a collegiate performance troupe located at California State University, Long Beach, is used to demonstrate how proactive performance meets the requisite conditions of the contact hypothesis; i.e., promoting social change. Moreover, proactive performance is able to account for several important mediating and moderating variables in intergroup contact. With this in mind, this article is illustrative of praxis, or the intersection between theory and practice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Discrimination and Reaction: The Practical Constitution of Social Exclusion
AN  - 894706039
AB  - This article explores and extends Blumer's work on race prejudice and discrimination by using empirical data from an ethnographic study of minority communities in Greece. Blumer explains prejudice as the result of an interactional process through which one group defines itself as superior or dominant in relation to the other. His work on race prejudice has often been misinterpreted as emphasizing the individual's subjective imaginary of the "other." Here I illustrate the importance of the intersubjective processes involved in defining a particular social situation as discriminatory. A central point of the article is to elaborate on his analysis by looking at the experience of prejudice and discrimination from the receiving end, through the participants' interpretation of their social interactions with the dominant group. Therefore I focus on how members of the subordinate group interact with the process that Blumer identifies. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - DISUNITY IN DIVERSITY: The Controversy Over the Admission of Black Women to the General Federation of Women's Clubs, 1900-1902
AN  - 872344502
AB  - From 1900 to 1902, the General Federation of Women's Clubs' official commitment to "unity in diversity" was tested to the limits when an explosive debate over the admission of African American women's clubs deeply, and in some cases irreparably, divided individual clubs and state federations and nearly resulted in the loss of half of the organization's burgeoning membership. The controversy reveals a captivating, complicated, and at times bizarre struggle between Northern and Southern white members of the General Federation to defend their particular views of race and, in many cases, to obfuscate their own deep-seated racial prejudices. Most members ultimately sacrificed principle for the sake of federation unity, albeit a unity without racial diversity, and thus squandered the opportunity to combine the talents and energies of all organized women in an effort toward social justice and humanitarian reform.

T1  - Seeing the Unseen: Attention to Daily Encounters With Sexism as Way to Reduce Sexist Beliefs
AN  - 1883896044
AB  - Three experiments were conducted in the United States and Germany to test whether women and men endorse sexist beliefs because they are unaware of the prevalence of different types of sexism in their personal lives. Study 1 (N = 120) and Study 2 (N = 83) used daily diaries as a method to encourage individuals "to see the unseen." Results revealed that encouraging women to pay attention to sexism, in comparison to attention to other social interactions, led to a stronger rejection of Modern Sexist, Neosexist, and Benevolent Sexist beliefs (Studies 1 and 2) and to negative evaluations of Modern and Benevolent Sexist men described in profiles as well as to more engagement in collective action on behalf of women (Study 2). In contrast, for men, paying attention to sexism did not have these effects. Results from Study 2 suggest, and from Study 3 (N = 141) confirm, that men's endorsement of Modern and Neosexist beliefs can be reduced if attention to sexism and emotional empathy for the target of discrimination is encouraged. Finally, a follow-up survey indicated that the attitude change in women and men was stable over time. The implications of these findings for interventions to reduce women's versus men's endorsement of sexist beliefs are discussed.

T1  - Constructing truths in a culture of disbelief: Understanding asylum screening from within
AN  - 1928619088
AB  - While a multitude of immigration officers enforce the numerous laws and policies regulating the arrival of asylum seekers, their work is often hidden from the public eye and ignored by academic debate, leaving fundamental questions unanswered: Is the migration debate blinded by bureaucracy or oblivious to the complexity of the asylum screening process? This article originates from an ethnographic study, which included over 80 interviews, six months of participant observation and four years of familiarization with the main actors, framed by a triangulation scheme that allowed in-depth exploration of the field from within. The study's conclusions expose how identifying immigration officers' subculture is key to understanding asylum controls and to reach beyond the legal shield and the rhetorical concepts of political debate. Based on this empirical research, this article exposes how officers' criteria for screening individuals are not derived from regulations or laws but their own categorizations, rules and values derived from ambiguous stereotypes nurtured by officers' experiences and social prejudices.

T1  - Bridging Inequality from Both Sides Now
AN  - 907550458
AB  - Because inequality is one of the central concerns of sociologists, it has been addressed, in various ways, by virtually all of the major traditions of sociological social psychology - social structure and personality, symbolic interactionism, and group processes (Cook, Fine, and House 1995).  [...] work in the group processes tradition addresses inequality at a more abstract level, by developing formal theories that examine how structures of power and status produce inequalities in interaction, influence, and benefits.

T1  - Making a difference? The use (and abuse) of diversity management at the UK's elite law firms
AN  - 856403704; 201107045
AB  - The UK's elite law firms have recently seen a shift from talking about equality of opportunity alone to the adoption of a diversity discourse as well. This article examines this transition for what it can tell us about the value of diversity strategies as a means for widening access to the corporate legal profession on the basis of social class, focusing on five elite law firms based in the City of London. A number of studies have demonstrated how cultural practices within the legal sector maintain exclusionary mechanisms based on class. There has been less attention to how this is sustained within an amended institutional framework which outwardly 'celebrates' difference. This research suggests that though diversity strategies do little to change organisational cultures, those that recognise both the depth of professional prejudice within the sector and the reality of educational inequality across the UK may prove relatively progressive nonetheless.

T1  - Bridging Inequality from Both Sides Now
AN  - 856403302; 201106773
AB  - In this article the authors expound upon the insight emanating from the conference organized by Gary Alan Fine and Alice Eagly re the sociological social psychology of inequality, and its structure in society, symbolic interactionism, and processes carried therein. The authors also discuss the identity factor more generally; and highlight the psychology of power relations, and the sociology re the theories of power and inequality, and references through Cook, Rice, and Molm. Then, from this standpoint the authors analyze the inequalities in exchange outcomes, and the role of affect and emotion in exchange processes, before delving into the links to psychology, and overview provided by Kelley et al. Next, the authors look at the subtleties and prejudices of psychological social psychology, and the linkages to sociology's task of integrating inequalities, and conclude with a further analysis and the implications of this bridging of the behavioral sciences.

T1  - The People Doth Protest Too Much: Explaining Away Subtle Racism
AN  - 852898227; 201102914
AB  - The present study examined whether the length of an individual's written explanation for an instance of subtle, attributionally ambiguous racism related to their perception of racism, levels of prejudice, and social dominance orientation. Individuals (n = 51) read a brief vignette describing an instance of subtle racism and then wrote a description explaining what they believed was happening in the situation. Individuals higher in prejudice and social dominance orientation wrote longer situational explanations. Individuals who wrote longer situational explanations were less likely to perceive the situation as racist and more likely to attribute that situation to a chance happening. Finally, longer explanations also contained more situational attributions unrelated to race. As the number of attributions unrelated to race increased, the perception of racism decreased. The present results suggest that longer explanations helped individuals explain away subtle racism. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Laughter the Best Medicine: Muslim Comedians and Social Criticism in Post-9/11 America
AN  - 822925377
AB  - This paper explores the role that Muslim standup comedians are playing in breaking down cultural barriers, promoting inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue, as well as tackling the misperceptions about Muslim and Arab Americans in the United States. I argue that Muslim comedians are increasingly taking on the role of Gramscian "organic intellectuals" capable of successfully participating in a quintessentially American activity -- standup comedy -- on behalf of their respective communities. Some scholars of Islam may argue that Muslim comedians, if they have any significance at all, are confined to the periphery of any meaningful discussions regarding Islam and Muslims after September 11. I will show that this is not only false, but fails to fully grasp the multifaceted responses that have arisen to combat Islamophobia and Arabophobia in the United States since the events of September 11, 2001.

T1  - The Personality Bases of Ideology: A One-Year Longitudinal Study
AN  - 764425730; 201064481
AB  - The cross-lagged effects of the Big-Five personality dimensions on Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) were examined over 1 year (N = 112). Consistent with the Dual Process Cognitive-Motivational Model, SDO and RWA exhibited markedly different personality bases. Low Agreeableness and unexpectedly high Extraversion predicted change in the motivational goal for group-based dominance and superiority (SDO), whereas Openness to Experience predicted change in the motivational goal for social cohesion and collective security (RWA). Neuroticism and Conscientiousness did not predict change in SDO or RWA over time. These findings extend previous cross-sectional (correlational) research and indicate that key dimensions of personality (primarily Agreeableness and Openness to Experience) are an important temporal antecedent of the group-based motivational goals underlying individual differences in prejudice.

T1  - Socializing on the Internet: Case Study of Internet Use Among University Students in the United Arab Emirates
AN  - 743050753; 201033915
AB  - This paper analyzes socializing on the Internet and attitudes towards the Internet as a medium of social interaction among university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It stems from a larger research project conducted at seven different institutions of higher education in the Abu Dhabi Emirate between 2007-2009 through anonymous questionnaires. A total of 571 students (353 female, 183 male) participated in the survey. In this paper we present only a small portion of the data and focus on (1) the intensity and frequency of Internet use; (2) identity and gender hiding in the virtual environment; (3) meeting internet acquaintances in real life; and (4) attitudes towards the Internet as a medium for social interaction. Responses were cross-analyzed in light of the participants' gender, age, and subjectively-perceived social status. Essentially, we argue that Emirati students dedicate a substantial amount of time and turn frequently to activities related to socializing on the Internet. Yet we have found significant differences in Internet usage and attitudes towards socializing on the Internet along the lines of gender, age, and social status. Generally, respondents tend to hide their identity more than their gender in the virtual environment; yet, women tend to hide both their identity and gender significantly more than men. More than half of the respondents think that the Internet is a medium through which they can communicate without being subjected to prejudice; yet men tend to be more positive than women about being treated differently on the Internet when people do know their gender. Finally, respondents who perceive themselves as having a higher social status tend to hide their identity less and are less distrustful of relationships formed via the Internet than are their counterparts, who perceive themselves as having middle class social status. Overall, the findings presented in this paper suggest that although the Internet can largely act as a vehicle for resisting social exclusion and gender segregation, it can also simultaneously serve as a mechanism for reinforcing pre-existing norms within newly-networked traditional communities. On a more general level, this paper aims to contribute to our understanding of global patterns of Internet usage and the complex interplay between technology, culture and identity.

T1  - NORMALIZATION AND LEGITIMATION: MODELING STIGMATIZING ATTITUDES TOWARD EX-OFFENDERS
AN  - 743048782; 201030031
AB  - Successful community reentry and the criminological impact of incarceration may depend in part on the attitudes (and consequent reactions) that prisoners encounter after release. Theories of social stigma suggest that such attitudes depend, in turn, on the levels of familiarity with the stigmatized group (the normalization thesis) as well as on the credibility and trust they accord to sanctioning agents (the legitimation thesis). To assess these two hypotheses, we present the first multivariate analysis of public attitudes toward ex-offenders. Data from a four-state, random-digit telephone survey of more than 2,000 individuals indicate that, net of controls, personal familiarity with ex-offenders may soften attitudes, whereas confidence in the courts may harden them. As expected, non-Hispanic Whites, conservatives, and southern residents hold more negative views of ex-offenders. Our findings lend indirect support to concerns that incarceration is becoming 'normalized', and we suggest strategies for reducing the stigma of incarceration. Adapted from the source document.
