T1  - Navigating diversity: Maternal ideologies and associations with child interethnic prejudice in the Netherlands
AN  - 2688508724
AB  - Parental diversity ideologies are linked to their own interethnic prejudice, but how do they relate to children's prejudice? This study examined self‐reported endorsement of colorblind ideology and multiculturalism among mothers (138 White Dutch, 65 Turkish‐Dutch, and 45 Afro‐Dutch) of 6‐to 10‐year old children (55% girls), and its association with child interethnic prejudice. Endorsement of multiculturalism was lowest among White Dutch mothers, and endorsement of colorblind ideology was lowest among Afro‐Dutch mothers. Maternal endorsement of multiculturalism was negatively related to child outgroup prejudice among White Dutch families and among Turkish‐Dutch families in the context of underrepresented outgroups, and results suggest no or opposite associations for colorblind ideology. Future research should explore what parenting based on these ideologies looks like, but the present study points parents in the direction of a multicultural, rather than colorblind, approach.

T1  - Racial Stereotype Endorsement, Academic Engagement, Mindset, and Performance among Black and White American Adolescents
AN  - 2648325498
AB  - The role of racial stereotypes in youth’s academic achievement becomes salient during adolescence. Yet, very few studies have investigated whether associations between Black and White American adolescents’ stereotype endorsement and their cognitive engagement, mindset beliefs, and performance in math differed by stereotype valence (i.e., positive versus negative) and youth gender. To address these gaps, this 3-year longitudinal study (n = 2546; age range = 11–16; 50% males, 60% White, 40% Black; 57% qualified for free lunch) investigated (a) whether Black and White American adolescents’ endorsement of positive and negative racial stereotypes differentially related to their cognitive engagement, ability mindset, and math performance and (b) whether gender moderated these relations. The results revealed that endorsing either negative or positive racial stereotypes (as opposed to those with unbiased beliefs) was linked to lower cognitive engagement and stronger fixed mindsets in math 1 year after, while endorsing negative racial stereotypes was linked to lower math scores. In addition, the intersection of adolescents’ race and gender moderated some of the observed effects. The inverse link between negative stereotype endorsement and math cognitive engagement was significant for Black girls but not for Black boys. The positive link between negative stereotype endorsement and fixed math ability mindset was stronger for Black girls than Black boys, whereas the link was stronger for White boys than White girls. These findings shed light on the direction and strength of the links between racial stereotype valence and math outcomes among Black and White youth.

T1  - “They created a team of almost entirely the people who work and are like them”: A qualitative study of organisational culture and racialised inequalities among healthcare staff
AN  - 2630549552
AB  - Racially and ethnically minoritised healthcare staff groups disproportionately experience and witness workplace discrimination from patients, colleagues and managers. This is visible in their under‐representation at senior levels and over‐representation in disciplinary proceedings and is associated with adversities such as greater depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, low job satisfaction and sickness absence. In the UK, little progress has been made despite the implementation of measures to tackle racialised inequities in the health services. So, what is it about the health service organisational context which shapes and maintains such inequities, and what role does discrimination, bullying and harassment play? Drawing on qualitative interviews with 48 healthcare staff in London (UK), we identify how micro‐level bullying, prejudice, discrimination and harassment behaviours, independently and in combination, exploit and maintain meso‐level racialised hierarchies. Within teams, the high diversity–low inclusion dynamic shaped and was perpetuated by in‐ and outgroup inclusion and exclusion processes (including “insidious dismissal”) often employing bullying or microaggressions. These were linked to intersecting factors, such as race, ethnicity, migration, language and religion, and could increase segregation. For racially and ethnically minoritised groups, ingroup maintenance, moving teams or leaving were also ways of coping with organisational inequities. We discuss implications for tackling racialised workplace inequities.

T1  - Intervening in Anti-Immigrant Sentiments: The Causal Effects of Factual Information on Attitudes toward Immigration
AN  - 2614690404
AB  - If preferences on immigration policy respond to facts, widespread misinformation poses an obstacle to consensus. Does factual information about immigration indeed affect policy preferences? Are beliefs about immigration’s societal impact the mechanism through which factual information affects support for increased immigration? To address these questions, we conducted an original survey experiment, in which we presented a nationally representative sample of 2,049 Americans living in the United States with facts about immigrants’ English acquisition and immigrants’ impact on crime, jobs, and taxes—four domains with common misperceptions. Three of these factual domains (immigration’s impact on crime, jobs, and taxes) raise overall support for increased immigration. These facts also affect beliefs that are directly relevant to that information. Moreover, those beliefs mediate the effect of factual information on support for increased immigration. By contrast, information about English acquisition affects neither policy preferences nor beliefs about immigration’s impact. Facts can leverage social cognitions to change policy preferences.

T1  - Integration policies and threat perceptions following the European migration crisis: New insights into the policy-threat nexus
AN  - 2616241282
AB  - The link between integration policies and intergroup attitudes or threat perceptions has received considerable attention. However, no studies so far have been able to explore how this relationship changed following the European migration crisis due to a lack of recent comparative policy data. Using new MIPEX data, this is the first study to examine mechanisms underlying the policy-threat nexus following the European migration crisis, distinguishing between several strands of integration policies, and realistic and symbolic threat. To do so, we combine 2017 Eurobarometer data with 2017 Migrant Integration Policy data, resulting in a sample of 28,080 respondents nested in 28 countries. The analyses also control for economic conditions, outgroup size, and media freedom. Multilevel analyses indicate that respondents living in countries with more inclusive integration policies in general report lower realistic and symbolic threat. When investigating different policy strands, we find that inclusive policies regarding political participation and access to nationality for immigrants are associated with lower realistic and symbolic threat. We compare our findings to those from prior to the European migration crisis and discuss the potential role of this crisis in the policy-threat nexus.

T1  - The implications of threat for blind and constructive patriots and immigration attitudes
AN  - 2559690821
AB  - Immigration attitudes are influenced by types of patriotism and the perceived threat that immigrants pose. Previous research indicated realistic and symbolic threat mediates the relationships between blind and constructive patriotism types and anti‐immigration attitudes in different ways. In two studies, the purpose was to replicate the mediating role of realistic and symbolic threat for the relationship between patriotism types and anti‐immigration attitudes, and to determine if inducing threat in constructive patriots would result in immigration attitudes like that of blind patriots. In both studies, hypotheses were confirmed. Blind patriotism predicts realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anti‐immigration attitudes. Realistic and symbolic threats provided moderated mediation between blind patriotism and anti‐immigration attitudes. Constructive patriotism negatively predicts anti‐immigration attitudes, but realistic and symbolic threats provide complete mediation for this relationship. The introduction of threatening information on future demographic changes had no impact on the relationship between blind patriotism, realistic and symbolic threats, and anti‐immigration attitude. However, the introduction of demographic threat modified the relationship for constructive patriots, leaving no predictive negative relationship with realistic threat, symbolic threat, or anti‐immigration attitude. The findings are important for understanding ethnic threat and the motivations to oppose immigrants in a changing United States.

AN  - 2533070218
AB  - This paper departs from an ethnography of Somali parents in Oslo, Norway, which examined perceptions of the Child Welfare Services (CWS). We explore how young second-generation parents portray middle class identities when they interact with school and kindergarten personnel. These are institutions under legal obligation to report to the CWS if they suspect neglect of children. Drawing on Goffman, we analyse how parents conduct and meticulously prepare for encounters with school and kindergarten personnel. These preparations pertain to countering ethnic stigma and avoiding racial scrutiny, in large part to avoid referrals to the CWS. Our paper makes the following contributions. In the study of child welfare and ethnicity, we stress the importance of visible ethnicity – or ‘race’ – and show how scepticism of CWS derives from suspicions of racial prejudice; strained relations between migrants and the CWS extend far beyond interactions between caseworkers and clients as they also stem from interactions with adjacent institutions. Regarding the study of ethnic relations, we argue that understanding performance of ethnicity requires inclusion of institutional contexts, such as the schools, kindergartens and the CWS.

T1  - Identities are no joke (or are they?): humor and identity in Vivek Mahbubani’s stand-up
AN  - 2618155975
AB  - Using the lenses of humor studies and narrative analysis, this paper discusses the stand-up comedy of Vivek Mahbubani, a Hong Kong-born stand-up comedian of Indian descent. Mahbubani uses humor about ethnicity-related issues to highlight the irrationality of racial discrimination and stereotypes. Specifically, Mahbubani challenges people’s preconceived ideas about the speakerhood of Cantonese and the local identity. The present study demonstrates how this comedian has effectively built humor into his narrative as a response to oppression, thus engaging the local, ethnically Chinese audience to reflect on the social and ethnic tension felt by minorities in Hong Kong. This study further argues that Mahbubani’s comedy reflects a more general trend in stand-up comedy: humor as a vehicle for a more inclusive and progressive grand narrative across different cultures; this trend stands in stark contrast to earlier ethnic jokes that often made minorities the target of verbal humor.

T1  - 'The Good Live-in Care Worker': Subject Formation and Ethnicisation in Austrian Live-in Care
AN  - 2582856410
AB  - This paper investigates subject formation processes in Austrian live-in care. Proceeding from a Foucauldian understanding of subjectivity as a product of powerful discourses and techniques and based on an intersectional discourse analysis of interviews with different actors involved in this arrangement, it shows how the ideal live-in care worker combines professional and language skills with characteristics such as an intrinsic motivation, emotional competences, and adaptability. Ethnicity-related discourses play an important role in this context, be it with regard to highly valued qualities or as a justification for control and/or support, and thus serve as a means to reproduce power relations.

T1  - The role of individuation in the development of intergroup relations
AN  - 2209515691
AB  - This commentary addresses the development of intergroup relations. We argue that children's reasoning about particular groups is strongly influenced by cues that shape the extent to which they conceive of group members in an undifferentiated way versus as distinct individuals. These cues include opportunities for contact with group members as well as the form and content of the information about social groups that children are exposed to. This approach to conceptualizing intergroup conflict builds upon important theoretical frameworks such as psychological essentialism, and it can be used to generate predictions about how intergroup attitudes will develop.HighlightsWe address the development of intergroup attitudes.We argue that development is influenced by cues that shape whether group members are viewed as distinct individuals.This framework points to ways to encourage intergroup understanding and reduce intergroup conflict.

T1  - Black Female Pilot Communicative Experiences: Applications and Extensions of Co-Cultural Theory
AN  - 2206006412
AB  - The study investigates the ways in which Black female pilots experience and manage their elite status as airline transport pilots (ATPs) and as co-cultural group members. Accordingly, Orbe's (1998b) co-cultural theory is used as a frame to understand how women of color negotiate workplaces where White male cultural norms are omnipresent. Using a phenomenological approach, the communicative lived experiences of two Black female ATPs are analyzed to reveal specific co-cultural communication practices enacted. The study is offered here as a testament to engaged research-that which advances theory (i.e., extending co-cultural theorizing in a new setting) and provides pragmatic insight into important contemporary issues (i.e., increased diversity in a historically White male profession).

T1  - Perceived group discrimination and psychological well‐being in ethnic minority adolescents
AN  - 2118275969
AB  - Few studies have examined the relation of perceived group discrimination and psychological well‐being. Yet, there are theoretical reasons to expect such a relation, and members of ethnic minorities usually perceive higher levels of group discrimination than personal discrimination. In this research, we investigated the associations between perceived group discrimination and several indicators of psychological well‐being among 354 Moroccan‐Dutch adolescents controlling for perceived personal discrimination and testing the extent to which ethnic group identification moderated these associations. Our results showed that higher perceived group discrimination was associated with higher parent‐ and adolescent‐reported internalizing (e.g., fear, worries) and externalizing problems (e.g., anger, aggression) but not with lower personal self‐esteem. For personal self‐esteem a negative association with perceived personal discrimination was found. Moreover, for adolescents with a strong ethnic group identification, there was no relationship between perceived group discrimination and parent‐ and adolescent‐reported internalizing problems, while for those with a weak ethnic group identification, perceived group discrimination was associated with more parent‐ and adolescent‐reported internalizing problems. Conversely, perceived group discrimination was unrelated to personal self‐esteem among low identifiers, but positively related to it among high identifiers. Results indicate that minority group members can be negatively affected by discrimination, even if they do not experience it at first hand. Thus, future research on the psychological effects of discrimination should include group perceptions.

T1  - Cross‐group friendships and psychological well‐being: A dual pathway through social integration and empowerment
AN  - 2115989590
AB  - This study investigated the associations between cross‐group friendships and psychological well‐being among a sample of physically disabled adults. A total of 269 disabled people (Mage = 39.13, SD = 13.80; 114 females, 152 males, 3 unknown) completed questionnaires including the quality of their friendships with non‐disabled people, perceived majority group's attitudes towards the minority group, collective self‐esteem, collective action tendencies, own outgroup attitudes, and psychological well‐being. Findings demonstrated that disabled people's cross‐group friendships were directly and indirectly associated with higher levels of psychological well‐being via two routes: one by promoting perceived majority attitudes which consequently led to more positive own outgroup attitudes (well‐being through social integration hypothesis) and the other by leading to higher levels of collective self‐esteem which enhanced collective action tendencies (well‐being through empowerment hypothesis). Findings offer important insights into the study of cross‐group friendships in relation to the psychological well‐being of stigmatized minority group members.

T1  - Friends, Neighbours, Townspeople and Parties: Explaining Canadian Attitudes toward Muslims
AN  - 2108624334
AB  - The 2015 Canadian federal election campaign put into focus relations between Muslim communities in Canada and wider Canadian society, featuring debates around banning the niqab, and a “barbaric cultural practices” hotline. At the same time, challenges in relations between Muslims and majority-group Canadians were not a new development in 2015: they had in the past faced periodic strains due to terrorism-related events, and attacks targeting Muslims in Canada. The Canadian case is in fact reflective of a challenge in intergroup relations facing several Western democracies. In light of this, what accounts for majority-group Canadians’ attitudes toward Muslims in Canada? Drawing on data from the 2011 and 2015 Canadian Election Studies and theories linking outgroup perceptions to intergroup contact (friends), local demographic context at both the micro-level (neighbours) and meso-level (townspeople), and political factors (parties), this article seeks to explain why majority-group Canadians hold alternately positive or negative views of Muslims.Alternate abstract:La campagne électorale fédérale canadienne de 2015 a attiré l'attention aux relations entre les communautés musulmanes du Canada et la société canadienne au sens large en raison des débats sur l'interdiction du niqab et la ligne d'aide sur les « pratiques culturelles barbares ». En même temps, des défis dans les relations entre les musulmans Canadiens et les Canadiens des groupes majoritaires n’étaient pas nouveaux en 2015. Des événements liés au terrorisme et des attaques visant des musulmans au Canada a autrefois soumis les relations à la pression. En fait, le cas canadien reflète un défi des relations intergroupes auxquelles sont confrontées plusieurs démocraties occidentales. Comment donc s'explique les attitudes des Canadiens des groupes majoritaires envers les musulmans au Canada? Utilisant les données de l’Étude électorale canadienne des années 2011 et 2015 et les théories concernant aux contacts intergroupes, les contextes démographiques locales au niveau micro et méso-urbain, et les facteurs politiques, cet article cherche à expliquer pourquoi les Canadiens tiennent les opinions alternativement positives ou négatives à l’égard des musulmans.

T1  - 'How did we get to where we are now?' Reflecting on Stuart Hall in Birmingham
AN  - 2019053903
AB  - In this piece I reflect on the city of Birmingham - as one trajectory in Stuart Hall's life among the many described in Familiar Stranger - for the significance it holds in terms of the development of race theory in the UK. Birmingham is often remembered among students, activists and scholars working or interested in the areas of race, ethnicity and culture, as the place that hosted Stuart Hall and the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) over half a decade ago. Here I consider the charged atmosphere of race relations associated with this period and place and how this marked a point of suture in Hall's thinking so far. I end by reflecting on the significance this has had in shaping the field of race and ethnic relations in ways that were significant then and now.

T1  - Rhythmanalysis as a tool in social analysis on ethnicity in Hong Kong
AN  - 1961172318
AB  - This article applies Henri Lefebvre's concept of rhythmanalysis to an exploration of ethnicity in Hong Kong. It argues that rhythmanalysis has tended to be used in social geography, architectural research, and cultural studies and has been overlooked as a methodological tool in regard to ethnicity. An historic narrative of ethnic diversity in Hong Kong is contrasted with contemporary transformations. It is argued that rhythmanalysis presents an alternative perspective that can deepen knowledge about enduring social patterns that serve to contextualise ethnicity and ethnic relations in a given space. In conclusion, it is argued that there is a need for greater recognition of ethnic diversity in Hong Kong as a means to assert a more confident and secure local identity.

T1  - The mediating role of coping self-efficacy beliefs on the relationship between parental conflict and child psychological adjustment
AN  - 1948293204
AB  - The effect of parental conflict on children's psychological adjustment is variable. Coping self-efficacy refers to a person's perceived ability to self-motivate and access the required cognitive resources to take control of, or exert their coping efforts in a stressful situation. This study investigated the mediating role of children's coping self-efficacy beliefs between parental conflict and children's psychological adjustment (internalizing, externalizing, anxiety, and prosocial behavior). The participants were 663 school students in grade 5 (M=10.17 years, SD=.53) and grade 7 (M=12.11 years, SD=.52). The ethnic composition of the sample was approximately 72% White, 20% Asian, 4% Middle Eastern, and 4% from other ethnic groups. Coping self-efficacy for avoiding maladaptive cognitions mediated the effect of parental conflict on children's internalizing symptoms longitudinally. The higher the level of parental conflict, the lower the level of children's coping self-efficacy for avoiding maladaptive cognitions and in turn the higher their levels of internalizing. These findings support the mediational role of children's coping self-efficacy beliefs in the context of parental conflict. It is proposed that these beliefs should be considered in designing and implementing preventative interventions for children in the context of parental conflict.

T1  - The dynamic relations between economic conditions and anti-immigrant sentiment: A natural experiment in times of the European economic crisis
AN  - 1950778094
AB  - Theories on intergroup relations suggest that negative attitudes toward immigrants tend to rise when economic conditions deteriorate. However, these arguments were mostly tested during times of economic prosperity in Europe. We put this theoretical expectation to test by analyzing two rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) with data from 14 West European immigration countries before (2006) and after (2010) the peak of the European economic crisis. Results show that anti-immigrant sentiments increased in countries where perceptions of economic insecurity also increased. Anti-immigrant sentiments decreased in countries where perceptions of economic insecurity declined. In contrast, changes in objective economic conditions (i.e. unemployment rates) during the same period of time did not display the expected effects in a similarly robust way.

T1  - Articulations of Islamophobia: from the extreme to the mainstream?
AN  - 1930436755
AB  - This article will examine the construction and functions of, as well as relationship between, the diverse and changing articulations of Islamophobia. The aim is to contribute to debates about the definition of Islamophobia, which have tended to be contextually specific, fixed and/or polarized between racism and religious prejudice, between extreme and mainstream, state and non-state versions or undifferentiated, and offer a more nuanced framework to: (a) delineate articulations of Islamophobia as opposed to precise types and categories; (b) highlight the porosity in the discourse between extreme articulations widely condemned in the mainstream, and normalized and insidious ones, which the former tend to render more acceptable in comparison; (c) map where these intersect in response to events, historical and political conditions and new ideological forces and imperatives and (d) compare these articulations of Islamophobia in two contexts, France and the US.

T1  - Fearing what? Vignette experiments on anti-immigrant sentiments
AN  - 2076976169
AB  - This study examines the impact of economic and safety threat perceptions on anti-immigrant sentiments. We investigate the extent to which public support for individual immigrants is affected by considerations about economic prospects and criminality of potential immigrants. We utilise survey vignette experiments conducted as part of the Panel Component of the European Social Survey in the Netherlands with a representative sample of the Dutch population. In the vignette experiments, we manipulated economic prospects and criminal background characteristics of immigrants, making them appear more or less likely to be an economic burden for and to pose a safety threat to the host society. Our findings demonstrate that both economic and safety considerations highly influence the public support for individual immigrants. We find that citizens' views on admissibility of individual immigrants are predominantly shaped by considerations about social welfare costs and criminality of potential immigrants. Our findings further illustrate that safety concerns are yielding to more exclusionist immigration policy preferences than economic threat considerations, especially when those safety threats are measured at the individual level rather than at the collective level.

T1  - Minority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health: A Study of Italian Transgender People
AN  - 1940950412
AB  - Transgender people often experience oppression because of gender nonconformity. They represent an extremely stigmatized population at high risk of developing mental health problems. The minority stress model is a theoretical model used to understand social stigma as a potential cause of mental health disparities faced by the transgender population. In Italy, studies applying this model to the transgender population are limited. The current study applied the minority stress model to a sample of Italian transgender people (n = 149), analyzing effects of prejudice events, expectations of rejection, and internalized transphobia, and their interaction with protective factors (resilience and social support), on mental health. The results suggest that exposure to everyday discrimination and internalized transphobia are associated with increased mental health problems, while perceived social support from family and resilience significantly reduced the strength of association between everyday discrimination and mental health. Findings have important implications for both social issues and policies.

T1  - Long-Lasting Fieldwork, Ethnographic Restitution and 'Engaged Anthropology' in Romani Studies
AN  - 1930727873
AB  - The history of relationships between Roma/Sinti and non-Roma/non-Sinti is marked and crossed by negative features and trails: anti-ziganismus, asymmetric power relationships within institutions and the absence of social justice in the school toward Romani minorities. This article--starting from the negative aspects of the inter-ethnic relations between Roma and majority societies--on the contrary explores the positive features of these relationships, through a long-lasting ethnographic research and through the intimacy and friendship of the author with the research' subjects. Without the deep connection and friendship established through the ethnographic relationship, these "positive" outcome would have remained eluded. The article will highlight how long-lasting ethnographic research is essential for the research' outcomes, but also for the improvement of social justice within institutions, impairing the asymmetric power relationships between non-Roma majority and Roma/Sinti minorities. Indeed, long-lasting ethnographic research, ethnographic restitution and an "engaged anthropology" approach are central issues for intercultural education both within institutions, such as school, and in less formal contexts, as urban quarters, low-income flats and extra-school contexts of multicultural societies.

T1  - Intersections of Multiple Oppressions: Racism, Sizeism, Ableism, and the "Illimitable Etceteras" in Encounters With Law Enforcement,
AN  - 1920538225
AB  - This think piece on the intersectionality of multiple oppressive markers incorporates critical race feminism, fat studies, body/embodiment studies, and dis/ability studies. It discusses the cases of two African Americans deemed irresolvable nuisances, treated as threats to police, and dealt with, with undue force, resulting in their untimely deaths. Eleanor Bumpurs, 66, was a black female of older age, ample size, with physical and mental disabilities; she was arthritic, fighting off hallucinations, and was economically disadvantaged. Eric Garner, 43, was a black male of ample size, with physical disabilities; he was diabetic, asthmatic, with sleep apnea and a heart condition, all of which made employment difficult for him. Intersectional identities determined what happened when each crossed paths with law enforcement. Intersecting oppressions of racism/classism/fat hatred/ageism/ableism/healthism resulted in the murder of Bumpurs in 1984 and Garner in 2014. Following Garner's execution, police supporters used multiple, intersecting forms of discrimination to sidestep the brutality: "Garner would've died going up a flight of stairs--he died because of preexisting medical conditions." This article argues that besides perpetuating the long history of portraying African American men as hulking brutes or as genetically inferior, such justifications aim to divert attention away from structural racism, cloaking it in sizeism/ableism/healthism.

T1  - Strengthening Purity: Moral Purity as a Mediator of Direct and Extended Cross-Group Friendships on Sexual Prejudice
AN  - 1881438993
AB  - The present research investigated whether enhanced perceptions of moral purity drive the effects of intergroup cross-group friendships on the intentions to interact with homosexuals. High-school students (N = 639) reported their direct and extended cross-group friendships with homosexuals as well as their beliefs regarding the moral character of the sexual minority. Participants further reported their desire to interact with homosexuals in the future. Results showed that both face-to-face encounters and extended contact with homosexuals increased their perceived moral purity, which in turn fostered more positive behavioral intentions. Results further revealed the specific role of moral purity in this sense, as differential perceptions along other moral domains (autonomy and community) had no mediation effects on behavioral tendencies toward homosexuals. The importance of these findings for improving intergroup relations is discussed, together with the importance of integrating research on intergroup contact and morality.

AB  - This special issue presents theoretical discussions and empirical research developed within the international project TOLERACE, The Semantics of (Anti-)Racism and Tolerance in Europe: Public Bodies and Civil Society in Comparative Perspective (2010–13), funded under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme. In this introduction, we present our approach to the study of (anti-)racism in contemporary Europe as well as the key issues explored in the research, which point to a persistent discomfort about discussing racism and to questions of academic compliance in knowledge production.

T1  - The Theory of Defense of One's Own Position: Self-Esteem and Conscience-The Ideologies of Privileged Groups
AN  - 1980700979
AB  - In the last thirty years, variation of opinion in accordance with income, occupation, status in the community, or class awareness has often been investigated. The results of some of these investigations have shown, for example, that in the US and West European countries the higher income groups are more in favor of certain institutional property rights and more against government control of business and further extension of government welfare activities. In the present paper, the author would like to show, first, that in a country where large-scale enterprises are government-owned, and political power is vested in the hands of the Communist party, quite opposite correlations may occur. Second, he will try to present a theory which may account for both kinds of correlations, as well as for certain findings traditionally considered as belonging to industrial sociology, the sociology of ethnic relations, or the sociology of military life.

T1  - Validation Study of the Revised Version of the Scale of Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity in Brazil
AN  - 1827659629
AB  - In Brazil, there is a deficit of culturally adapted tools to assess prejudice against sexual and gender diversity with empirically demonstrable validity and reliability. Prejudice against non-heterosexual orientations is a strong problem within Brazilian culture and is particularly related to nonnormative expressions of gender. To address these issues, a scale was created. The objective of this article is to validate the revised version of this instrument developed for the specificities of Brazilian culture and establish its reliability. The revised version of Scale of Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity (PASGD) was completed by 8,184 undergraduate students from southern Brazil. Analysis was conducted using the item response theory (IRT) model for rating scale data, criterion validity, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scale showed good validity and reliability. The results indicate that the PASGD is a useful tool for assessing prejudice in the Brazilian context, adapted for the local Brazilian reality.

T1  - Parent-Adolescent Conflict in African American Families
AN  - 1818624333
AB  - Parent-adolescent conflict is frequent in families and has implications for youth adjustment and family relationships. Drawing on a family systems perspective, we examined mothers', fathers', and two adolescent-aged siblings' (50.5 % females) reports of parent-adolescent conflict in 187 African American families. Using latent profile analysis in the context of an ethnic homogeneous design, we identified three family types based on levels of and differences between parent and youth conflict reports: low conflict, father high conflict, and younger sibling high conflict. Compared to low conflict families, youth in younger sibling high conflict families reported more depressive symptoms and risky behaviors. The results for parents' acceptance revealed that, in comparison to low conflict families, older siblings in father high conflict families reported lower acceptance from mothers, and mothers in these families reported lower acceptance of their children; further, older siblings in younger sibling high conflict families reported less acceptance from fathers, and fathers in these families reported less acceptance of their children. Results underscore the significance of levels of and both differences between and direction of differences in parents' and youth's reports of their "shared" experiences, as well as the importance of examining the larger family contexts of dyadic parent-relationships.

T1  - Afterword: from anxiety to hope
AN  - 1786265095
AB  - As I write this, yet another panic has erupted in Australia over a proposed mosque, one of many that seem to erupt on a regular basis, feeding social anxieties about a range of social 'problems' that are reduced to one Big Problem. As Wayne Modest and Anouk de Koning, the guest editors of this issue of Patterns of Prejudice, point out in their introduction. The current consternation about supposedly racially inspired sexual assaults in Germany is another moment in this same cycle of what they call anxious politics: a cycle that constructs particular kinds of social problems (and implies, for some, their 'solutions'). There are many way in which my home - Australia - is different to the European settings of this collection of papers but, when it comes to such processes, the similarities are often more obvious than the differences. The stories these scholars tell are comparable to ones I hear in Australia, the United Kingdom and North America. Given the 'global Islamophobia' of the last decade or so, this is not surprising. But it would be a mistake to think that these similarities mean there is a single story to be told: each of the papers here offers empirical detail, context and theoretical tools to capture the nuance of their subject matter. As with the best scholarship, it is by attending to both similarities and differences across contexts that we can profit from the accounts it gives, intellectually and politically. Moreover, these papers collectively pose a set of issues that should frame future research: a reconfiguration of conventional issues around citizenship and racialization, but also questions of hope and conviviality.

T1  - The Influence of Defendant Immigration Status, Country of Origin, and Ethnicity on Juror Decisions: An Aversive Racism Explanation for Juror Bias
AN  - 1761128025
AB  - This study examined prejudicial attitudes toward immigrant defendants who vary on legal status, country of origin, and ethnicity. Three hundred twenty mock juror participants read a trial transcript that varied defendants' immigration status (documented or undocumented), defendant country of origin (Canada or Mexico), and defendant race/ethnicity (Caucasian or Latino). Dependent measures included verdict, sentencing, culpability ratings, and trait assessments. European American mock jurors found undocumented, Latino immigrants from Mexico guilty significantly more often, more culpable, and rated this defendant more negatively on various trait measures in comparison with all other conditions. Latino mock jurors did not demonstrate ingroup favoritism or outgroup bias. This study examines aversive racism as a factor of this bias. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

T1  - 'We Inspire Each Other, Subconsciously': The Circulation of Attitudes towards Difference between Polish Migrants in the UK and their Significant Others in the Sending Society
AN  - 1784151121
AB  - In this article, I explore how attitudes towards difference in terms of ethnicity, religion, sexuality and gender travel between Polish migrants to the UK and their significant others in Poland. In doing so, I bring together and critically engage with two disparate literatures-on social remittances and family and peer transmission of attitudes. I demonstrate that what occurs between Polish migrants and their non-migrant significant others is a complex process in which favourable and prejudiced attitudes are passed on, challenged, rejected or negotiated. While I stress that both migrants and non-migrants influence each other's perceptions of difference, I show that non-migrants are more likely to assume the 'correctness' of migrant's attitudes due to the construction of migrants as trusted experts. Acknowledging the multidimensionality and simultaneity of such mutual influences, in the article, I call for the use of the term 'circulation' to describe the mobility of ideas, values and attitudes between people and places.

T1  - The Panacea and Perfidy of Cross Racial Foster Care on Children Living in Cross Racial Foster (CRF) Care Placements: Implications for Children's Needs and Rights
AN  - 1799007656
AB  - Internationally, regionally and in various national contexts, cross-racial foster care (CRFC) placement has been receiving wide debates and discourses with regards to its relevance and effectiveness as an option of custody for children in need of care and protection. The aim of this paper is, through a review of literature methodology, to discuss and debate the panacea and perfidy of the CRFC placements in the contemporary South African context with unrelenting burgeoning cases of orphans and vulnerable children in need of alternative care. The following aspects of CRFC were considered beneficial or a panacea: They offer vulnerable children (orphans) an opportunity for a second alternative care; a forum of ensuring vulnerable children get their basic needs such as food and shelter; offers an opportunity for acculturation to take roots. Contrastingly, the following aspects were considered undesirable or perfidious: possible loss of children's identity; discrimination and prejudice; loss of natural attachment; and challenges of adjusting to a new racial milieu. The paper is theoretically premised on the Systems theory. The paper recommends: training of cross racial foster care parents; as well as having the Department of Social Development to launch strong awareness campaigns to make the public understand the importance of CRFC placements in the country

T1  - Toward a comprehensive understanding of executive cognitive function in implicit racial bias
AN  - 1700675622; 201525230
AB  - Although performance on laboratory-based implicit bias tasks often is interpreted strictly in terms of the strength of automatic associations, recent evidence suggests that such tasks are influenced by higher-order cognitive control processes, so-called executive functions (EFs). However, extant work in this area has been limited by failure to account for the unity and diversity of EFs, focus on only a single measure of bias and/or EF, and relatively small sample sizes. The current study sought to comprehensively model the relation between individual differences in EFs and the expression of racial bias in 3 commonly used laboratory measures. Participants (N = 485) completed a battery of EF tasks (Session 1) and 3 racial bias tasks (Session 2), along with numerous individual difference questionnaires. The main findings were as follows: (a) measures of implicit bias were only weakly intercorrelated; (b) EF and estimates of automatic processes both predicted implicit bias and also interacted, such that the relation between automatic processes and bias expression was reduced at higher levels of EF; (c) specific facets of EF were differentially associated with overall task performance and controlled processing estimates across different bias tasks; (d) EF did not moderate associations between implicit and explicit measures of bias; and (e) external, but not internal, motivation to control prejudice depended on EF to reduce bias expression. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of global and specific EF abilities in determining expression of implicit racial bias. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Loving but not living the vernacular: A glimpse of Mazandarani-Farsi linguistic culture in northern Iran
AN  - 1738476867; 201538769
AB  - Traditional top-down conceptions of language policy and planning have been questioned by recent perspectives that advocate more localized accounts of language policy concerns in real-life social contexts. Schiffman's (1996) conception of linguistic culture is one of these bottom-up approaches, which focuses on covert language policies. This study investigates some aspects of such covert orientations of speakers of the Mazandarani language towards their local vernacular in the bilingual Mazandarani-Farsi context of northern Iran. It specifically attempts to explore the current linguistic culture atmosphere in terms of assumptions, prejudices, attitudes, and stereotypes with regard to Mazandarani. These aspects of public belief are particularly investigated as referring to language use in 'social situations', 'professional contexts', 'education', and 'media'. A group of 106 participants responded to a questionnaire that was aimed at eliciting their views on these linguistic culture domains as well as their 'attitude' towards Mazandarani. The study indicates that although the participants show very positive emotional attitudes towards their local language, their actual linguistic culture appears to be strongly in favor of the official national language, i.e. Farsi. Some concerns are raised as to the implications of such a loving-but-not-living linguistic culture for a more realistic understanding of language policy and planning. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - RACISM, GROUP POSITION, AND ATTITUDES ABOUT IMMIGRATION AMONG BLACKS AND WHITES
AN  - 1667950862; 201509533
AB  - Previous research has shown that racial or ethnic prejudice is one of the most influential antecedents of opposition to more expansive immigration policies. In this paper, we explore whether a theoretical perspective derived from the group position model might represent an additional and complementary explanation for immigration attitudes. We also compare how well the prejudice and group position models explain immigration attitudes among both White and Black Americans. Most of the previous work in this literature focuses solely on Whites' attitudes, and it remains unclear how well models designed with this group in mind might also apply to African Americans. We rely upon the 2004-2005 National Politics Study to explore the power of these models. In general, we find that measures derived from the group position model account for immigration attitudes even after controlling for various forms of out-group prejudice. The pattern of results also differs considerably across the two racial groups in our study. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Age norms for older adults among Koreans: perceptions and influencing factors
AN  - 1660022020; 201508187
AB  - Despite rapid social change that has influenced the social status of older adults, expectations about their behaviour and whether such expectations differ across generations remain unexplored in Korea. Based on ageing theories of activity, disengagement and modernisation, this study investigated age norms among Koreans conceptualised as shared expectations of appropriate behaviours of older adults. Competing perspectives in intergenerational relations and prejudice toward older adults were examined to test if they influenced age norms and if such associations varied across different age groups. Data were analysed from a survey of 1,445 individuals aged 20 and above who resided in 16 administrative districts of Korea. Comparisons of age norms across age groups indicated that the older adult group (age 65+) held more restrictive attitudes about social participation and engagement in various behaviours in old age than the middle-aged adults (ages 45-64) and younger adults (ages 20-44). Respondents with more prejudice towards older adults tended to place more restrictions on the behaviour of older adults. A significant interaction indicated that respondents whose views were in line with a generational conflictive perspective, assessed as reporting more competitive perspectives between young and old people and being less supportive of intergenerational programmes, had a more restrictive view about older adults' behaviours among the middle-aged group but less restrictive attitudes in determining acceptable behaviour in later life among the older adult group.

T1  - Are racist attitudes related to experiences of racial discrimination? Within sample testing utilising nationally representative survey data
AN  - 1559004871; 201431961
AB  - Although the relationship between an individual's racist attitudes and discriminatory behaviours has been widely studied, the association between racist attitudes among perpetrators and experiences of racism among targets has been under-examined. Based on data from the 2001-8 Australian Challenging Racism Project survey, this paper details a novel method to investigate the link between racist attitudes and experiences of discrimination utilising two separate models linked by nomination of cultural or ethnic groups who do not fit into Australian society (i.e., out-groups). Those identified as out-groups were more likely to report experiences of discrimination than those who were not nominated as out-groups. Overall, out-group nomination by those with racist attitudes strongly predict experiences of discrimination among these same target out-groups, OR = 2.2, F(6, 12,348) = 78.61, p < .001. Racist attitudes are related to racist behaviours among perpetrators that are, in turn, related to experiences of racial discrimination among targets. This study demonstrates that attitudes not only affect majority group behaviour but also drive the resulting experiences of discrimination for minority group members. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - The cult of the victim: an analysis of the collective identity of the English Defence League
AN  - 1650147806; 201502242
AB  - Since its creation in 2009 the English Defence League has become the largest street-based social movement in contemporary Britain. Its demonstrations have led to violence and community tensions in town and city centres throughout the country. While these street demonstrations have attracted some attention in academia, as of yet there has been no attempt to analyse the statements of the EDL as an organization. Oaten analyses the EDL's outgoing communicative transmissions and argues that the EDL as a movement is based on a sense of collective victimhood. By drawing on conceptions of collective victimhood from post-conflict studies, he suggests that only by understanding the EDL's collective victimhood can we understand its anti-Muslim and anti-establishment stance. His article stresses that collective victimhood is a zero sum identity, and highlights the fact that, as such, the EDL and its members continuously seek to portray themselves as the 'true' victims of abuse by government and British Muslims. Oaten concludes, in light of EDL leader Tommy Robinson's departure, by looking at the potential future trajectories of the EDL. He argues that, despite the fact that Robinson was central to the movement's collective victimhood frame of reference, the EDL continues to utilize the collective victimhood narrative in order to explain Robinson's departure. This suggests that collective victimhood had become a powerful category of self-identification for the movement, and that the movement can continue without Robinson. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The devil is in the details: Abstract versus concrete construals of multiculturalism differentially impact intergroup relations
AN  - 1542000590; 201426969
AB  - Three experiments integrated several theories in psychology and sociology to identify the conditions under which multiculturalism has positive versus negative effects on majority group members' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward ethnic minorities. On the basis of social cognitive construal theories, we predicted and found that construing multiculturalism in abstract terms by highlighting its broad goals reduced White Americans' prejudice toward ethnic minorities relative to a control condition, whereas construing multiculturalism in concrete terms by highlighting specific ways in which its goals can be achieved increased White Americans' prejudice relative to the same control (Experiments 1 and 2). Using social identity threat research, we found that construing multiculturalism in abstract terms decreased the extent to which diversity was seen as threatening national identity, whereas construing it in concrete terms increased the extent to which diversity was seen as threatening national identity; threat in turn fueled prejudice (Experiments 2 and 3). Perceivers' political orientation moderated the effects of multiculturalism construals on prejudicial attitudes and social distancing behavioral intentions (Experiment 3). Symbolic threat to national identity but not realistic threat to national resources mediated these effects. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate when multiculturalism leads to positive versus negative intergroup outcomes, why, and how political orientation shapes prejudice and behavioral intentions toward ethnic minorities.

T1  - DISTINCT EFFECTS OF IMAGINE-OTHER VERSUS IMAGINE-SELF PERSPECTIVE-TAKING ON PREJUDICE REDUCTION
AN  - 1551000269; 201429140
AB  - Two experiments tested the hypothesis that imagine-other and imagine-self perspective-taking have different implications for prejudice reduction when instantiated in intergroup exchanges characterized by the potential for evaluation. We reasoned that because imagine-other perspective-taking is more likely than imagine-self perspective-taking to lead individuals to an unproductive focus on how they themselves are evaluated, imagine-other perspective-taking would hinder prejudice reduction whereas imagine-self perspective-taking would not. Results across two different intergroup relationships were consistent with these predictions and further suggested that the negative implications of imagine-other perspective-taking were mediated by relative meta-stereotype activation, an index of the extent to which individuals focused more on how their own group was viewed than on their view of the outgroup. These findings highlight that considering how individuals' concerns with evaluation guide their thoughts and experiences during intergroup exchanges can help identify the likely effects of different intervention strategies in such contexts.

T1  - Why is the History of Heterosexuality Essential? Beliefs About the History of Sexuality and Their Relationship to Sexual Prejudice
AN  - 1531931079; 201423296
AB  - Heterosexual people with more positive attitudes to lesbians and gay men generally believe that homosexuality is immutable, is not a discrete social category, and that homosexuality exists in all cultures and time periods. Equivalent beliefs about heterosexuality and beliefs about components of sexuality have been less often researched. 136 people with diverse sexualities described heterosexuality as more universal across history and culture than homosexuality (Study 1). 69 heterosexual-identified participants similarly believed that love, identity, behavior, and desire were more historically invariant aspects of heterosexuality than of homosexuality (Study 2). Less prejudiced participants thought all components of homosexuality-except for identity-were more historically invariant. Teasing apart beliefs about the history of components of heterosexuality and homosexuality suggests that there is no 'essential' relationship between sexual prejudice and the tension between essentialist and constructivist views about the history of sexual identity.

T1  - Subversive friendships: Turkish and Armenian encounters in transnational space
AN  - 1559005779; 201431973
AB  - Kasbarian and Oktem explore the extent to which 'political friendships' between Armenians, Turks and Kurds-members of communities antagonized by the traumatic experience of genocide-can subvert hegemonic power arrangements of denial and nationalist mobilization. Based on participant observation and in-depth interviews with a group of Armenians and Turks in London, their paper explores how the members of this group experienced a transformation of their subject positions by facing each other's stories, gradually overcoming insecurities and fears of the Other. This dynamic process precipitated a shift of position, individually and collectively, enabling the formation of a community that acted beyond the confines of the reigning logics of nationalist projects. They argue that, in the relatively level playing field of the transnational, political and other friendships can develop to the point of becoming 'moral communities' that challenge established status quos and unequal power relations. Friendship and interpersonal relations that transgress these boundaries undermine reigning discourses and are, ultimately, political acts. However, these 'low' politics interactions still face the reality of 'high' politics, structured by the actions of an overbearing and semi-democratic Turkish state, the political expedience of third countries and a factious Armenian diaspora.

T1  - The Role of Ingroup and Outgroup Metaprejudice in Predicting Prejudice and Identity Undermining
AN  - 1718069871; 201530759
AB  - The present study aims to understand the role of ingroup and outgroup metaprejudice in predicting prejudice and identity undermining. I predicted that ingroup metaprejudice would mediate the effect of outgroup metaprejudice on prejudice and identity undermining either on minority subgroup or minority outgroup. The results from the majority of Sunni Muslim participants (N = 214) targeting Ahmadiyya (i.e., minority subgroup of Islam) and Christians (i.e., minority outgroup) showed that the effect of outgroup metaprejudice on prejudice, and identity undermining through ingroup metaprejudice, was significant. In general, the findings indicate that what group members think of what others are thinking may play a key role in influencing intergroup relations and perceptions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mixing bodies and minds: race, class and 'mixed schooling' controversies in New Orleans and Atlanta, 1874-87
AN  - 1520331128; 201413173
AB  - Educational access was central in the racial inscription of class identities in the late nineteenth century. In Atlanta and New Orleans, white newspapers, politicians and ordinary citizens launched vigorous campaigns against integrated schools, which resulted in limited access to elite public schooling for upwardly mobile Blacks. Jewell's study analyses these cases to explore social reproduction as a link between race and class as social structures. Whites in both cities used the concept of miscegenation, or racial mixing, to define Blacks' access to elite cultural knowledge and social networks as a violation of the colour line. Jewell argues that analyses of racial formation should give attention to discursive links between race and class in struggles over social reproduction because maintaining racial hierarchies in periods of social change requires constructing new cultural narratives that reproduce economic dominance over racial minorities.

T1  - 'Anyone Can Be an Illegal': Color-Blind Ideology and Maintaining Latino/Citizen Borders
AN  - 1512220922; 201408763
AB  - Previous research has shown that nativist ideology racializes nonwhite immigrants, but little research has looked at how color-blind racist discourse shapes how people accomplish this while maintaining a race-neutral identity. This study examines how online discussion forum participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance, which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to include nonwhite immigrants.

T1  - African American and Black Caribbean Mutual Feelings of Closeness: Findings From a National Probability Survey
AN  - 1550999634; 201429120
AB  - African American and Black Caribbean relations are described as strained. Standard portrayals of Black Caribbeans as a 'model minority' that has effectively assimilated into the American landscape often make explicit their distinctiveness from and enmity toward African Americans. Analysis using National Survey of American Life data (N = 6,082), exploring the nature and correlates of intergroup perceptions, reveals that both groups characterize their mutual relationships as being close. Gender and region of residence influence African American feelings of closeness toward Black Caribbeans, while for Black Caribbeans, perceived discrimination was significantly associated with feelings of closeness to African Americans. Black Caribbean immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries and Haiti felt closer to African Americans than did Jamaicans. In addition, foreign-born Black Caribbeans (first generation) felt closer to Black people from the Caribbean than second-generation Black Caribbeans. These and other findings are discussed in relation to research on intergroup closeness among African Americans and Black Caribbeans.

T1  - Enacting Cultural Interests: How Intergroup Contact Reduces Prejudice by Sparking Interest in an Out-Group's Culture
AN  - 1933733885
AB  - In the present research, we examined the hypothesis that cues of social connectedness to a member of another social group can spark interest in the group's culture, and that such interest, when freely enacted, contributes to reductions in intergroup prejudice. In two pilot studies and Experiment 1, we found that extant and desired cross-group friendships and cues of social connectedness to an out-group member predicted increased interest in the target group's culture. In Experiments 2 and 3, we manipulated cues of social connectedness between non-Latino American participants and a Latino American (i.e., Mexican American) peer and whether participants freely worked with this peer on a Mexican cultural task. This experience reduced the participants' implicit bias against Latinos, an effect that was mediated by increased cultural engagement, and, 6 months later in an unrelated context, improved intergroup outcomes (e.g., interest in interacting with Mexican Americans; Experiment 4). The Discussion section addresses the inter- and intragroup benefits of policies that encourage people to express and share diverse cultural interests in mainstream settings.

T1  - Demonizing and redeeming the gaucho: social conflict, xenophobia and the invention of Argentine national music
AN  - 1494748886; 201402125
AB  - Plesch examines changing attitudes towards the gaucho as a musician in nineteenth-century Argentina through literary, musical and iconographic sources. She proposes the existence of a discursive formation gaucho, whose archive comprises travellers' writings, official reports, memoirs, visual arts, literature and music. Despised and persecuted throughout most of the nineteenth century, the gaucho was considered by Argentine elites as the epitome of 'barbarism', and his music was consistently described in derogatory terms. This attitude would be dramatically reversed towards the end of the century, when he was promoted to the role of national character and his cultural universe used as a source for the construction of a distinctive Argentine high culture that included the visual arts, literature and music. Plesch analyses the dominant discourse on the gaucho from colonial times to the publication of Martin Fierro (1872) and identifies four strategies of Othering at work: debasement, homogeneity, timelessness and Orientalism. They constitute, in the symbolic realm, the counterpart to the larger strategy of domination of the gaucho. In the second part of the article she examines the use of the gaucho and his world in the aesthetic production of Argentine cultural nationalism, isolating three key features: use, nostalgia and distancing. These are connected to the xenophobia unleashed by mass immigration and the modernization of the country, and the consequent need for elites to create a distinctive type of Argentine identity. The antithetical representations of the gaucho and his music, Plesch concludes, can only be understood in relation to the changing needs and political agendas of hegemonic society.

T1  - 'Onward Blackshirts!' Music and the British Union of Fascists
AN  - 1494748588; 201402084
AB  - Macklin explores the role of music in British fascism's 'palingenetic' project for national rebirth. Taking as his starting-point the cultural production and criticism of music emanating from within the British Union of Fascists (BUF), he argues that music played an integral part of the fascist experience, representing far more than mere 'entertainment'. Macklin examines how the BUF used music to underpin party mobilization strategies, to anchor choreographed set-pieces like meetings and marches, and to reinforce 'collectives of emotion' among participants as well as unaligned spectators. Having discussed the integrative mechanisms through which the BUF sought to capitalize on music's emotive appeal, and particularly the ideological content of 'Fascist songs', Macklin's article moves to examine the party's reaction to jazz. Not only did it offend British fascism's conservative cultural aesthetic but it served as a cipher for the wider sense of degeneracy British fascists believed had afflicted race and nation.

T1  - Engaging with intergroup prejudice in victims of violent crime/attack
AN  - 1448995485; 201342821
AB  - The development of powerful intergroup prejudice appears to be common in victims of crime and human inflicted trauma. Despite this, the phenomenon appears to have received little explicit attention in either the traumatic stress or the social conflict literature. It is maintained that failure to attend to this dimension of the impact of traumatic stress of interpersonal origin has problematic implications for both individual wellbeing and social cohesion. Using clinical observations and qualitative research data collected in South Africa to underpin the primarily conceptual arguments of the article, the authors seek to describe, illustrate, and understand intergroup prejudice as it emerges consequent on trauma exposure. In addition, the article takes up the apparent reluctance of therapists or counselors to deal with such material, arguing that the technical, ethical, and political complexities of engagement with this kind of content in the clinical context (and beyond) require careful and thorough exploration.

T1  - Heterosexual Students' Experiences in Sexual Orientation Intergroup Dialogue Courses
AN  - 1463013039; 201345780
AB  - Heterosexism contributes to an unsafe campus climate for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) college students. Intergroup dialogue courses about sexual orientation seek to build awareness, cross-group relationships, and commitment to social action to address anti-LGB prejudice and discrimination. Although dialogue courses are growing in popularity, few courses address sexual orientation. To advance knowledge of these dialogues, this qualitative study explores heterosexual students' motivations and expectations, challenges, and learning outcomes related to their participation in intergroup dialogue courses on sexual orientation. Core themes include desire to learn about the LGB community, concerns about offending classmates, anxiety around LGB stigma, conflict with classmates around controversial topics, affirming LGB people, and learning about heterosexism, privilege, and intersectionality of identity. Implications for intergroup dialogue pedagogy and research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Radical-right narratives in Slovakia and Hungary: historical legacies, mythic overlaying and contemporary politics
AN  - 1364704285; 201323532
AB  - In the last several years, radical-right rhetoric has gained further ground in the political discourse of Slovakia and Hungary. This increasingly overt spiral of tension has been fuelled not only by radical-right actors, such as the Slovenska narodna strana (SNS, Slovak National Party) and Jobbik (Movement for a Better Hungary), but also by mainstream parties such as SMER in Slovakia and Fidesz in Hungary. The legitimizing radical-right frames have mostly been founded on politicized historical narratives related to the intertwined processes of nation- and state-building in both countries. Pytlas seeks to describe and analyse this phenomenon, focusing on historical legacies, their mythologized reinterpretations as well as their application to contemporary politics. The debates on the Slovak language law of 2009 and the Hungarian citizenship law of 2010 shall be used as empirical examples of this 'mythic overlaying' mechanism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Modern genocidal dehumanization: a new model
AN  - 1364704270; 201323563
AB  - While there has been a great deal of scholarly discussion of dehumanization in specific cases of genocide, few have asked why it manifests, whether it is present in all cases or what function/s it performs. These questions-and therein a broader problematic concerning the validity and usefulness of the concept-remain open. Savage's article addresses this gap in the literature by proposing a novel model of genocidal dehumanization that is conceived as a discursive strategy. In doing so, it takes a comparative approach, surveying previous work on genocidal dehumanization emerging from different disciplines and examining definitional problems. In demonstrating why the conditions of modernity-specifically, the rise of the state and changing perceptions of legitimate violence-require dehumanization as an accompaniment to genocide, the paradigm of initially 'good' or 'ordinary' perpetrators is rejected. Genocidal dehumanization is shown to perform two distinct functions: motivation, and legitimization. Manifestations of genocidal (and non-genocidal) dehumanization can therefore be placed on a continuum of extremity. Ultimately, Savage proposes a new structural and functional model of genocidal dehumanization. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Islamophobia never stands still': race, religion, and culture
AN  - 1347784059; 201318923
AB  - Islamophobia bundles religious, ethnic and cultural prejudices together even though a narrow definition of the term flags religion as playing the central part. Calls for decoupling religion from ethnicity and culture appear justifiable: religions are increasingly disconnected from the cultures in which they have been embedded. But established political discourse infrequently makes such distinctions and may go further to racialize cultural and religious attributes of non-Europeans through essentialist framing. Islamophobia becomes a cryptic articulation of race and racism even if overtly it appears as religiously-based prejudice. Islam has been culturalized and racialized by its adherents and antagonists alike. Survey data on attitudes towards Muslims confirm such framing: the most common grounds given for experiencing discrimination was race or ethnic origin; religion and belief system were cited less often. Racialization, race and differential racism have become more endemic to Islamophobesa stigmatizing of Muslims, but to categorize Islamophobes as racists is bad politics.

T1  - Bending without breaking the mould: race and political representation in the United Kingdom
AN  - 1322723532; 201310831
AB  - Saggar draws together research evidence and practitioner insights to evaluate and interpret change in race and political representation in Britain. The starting point is to ask: how far have British democratic institutions been responsive to the emergence of an ethnically diverse society? There have been significant impacts of such diversity on attitudinal change, demographic and electoral composition and political participation. Saggar's article proceeds in four parts. First, the issue of the political integration of ethnic minorities is discussed, including theoretical debates about political difference in outlook and in behaviour across and within ethnic groups, as well as the ways this may be connected to ethnic background. Second, key normative and empirical arguments are examined about why political change and ethnic pluralism matters, and to whom. The structure, institutions and processes that shape representative outcomes form the backdrop to the remainder of the article. The third section highlights aspects of the party and electoral landscape that disproportionately influence the electoral prospects for discrete minorities. Finally, attention is given to the rise of a 'political class' and discusses how these filters can skew the opportunities available to minorities. Saggar concludes with a discussion of long-term political integration, the emerging focus on executive appointments, and how, through political integration and social cohesion, minorities can affect the wider political system they have joined.

T1  - Aversive Racism and Intergroup Contact Theories: Cultural Competence in a Segregated World
AN  - 1541997652; 201426942
AB  - The United States remains highly segregated, and social work students are likely to live and work in segregated contexts. What implications does this have for their cultural competence? Does segregation affect social workers' ability to serve diverse clients without bias? This article reviews two social psychology theories, aversive racism and intergroup contact, for use by social work educators. Together, these theories suggest both the likelihood of social worker prejudice within a context of segregation and an evidence-based method for improvement. The article concludes by offering strategies for incorporating both theories in cultural competence education. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The "Turkish Model" of Sociology: East-West Science, State Formation, and the Post-Secular
AN  - 1463008782; 201345494
AB  - The field of sociology in Turkey has a history that is perhaps unique to Europe (and the "West") in its co-founding with a modern nation-state, and yet its story is more central to the discipline's general development than that of a marginal "outlier." Positioned at an East-west crossroads, Turkey, and its sociological tradition, have been in an ongoing conversation between the two cultural poles. Drawing on Edward Said's Orientalism, this article traces the discipline's history through the lens of an East-west gaze. Touching on the lived public social questions that this story invokes, regarding ethnic relations, gender, migration, democracy-building, religion, and international relations, this article surveys the growth and present state of the discipline, including methodological trends and current issues.

AB  - We disagree with Dixon et al. by maintaining that prejudice is primarily rooted in aversive reactions toward out-group members. However, these reactions are not indicative of negative attributes, such as trait bigotry, but rather normative homophily for peers with similar perceived attributes. Cognitive biases such as stereotype threat perpetuate perceptions of inequipotential and subsequent discrimination, irrespective of individuals' personality characteristics.

T1  - Do Muslims in Germany Really Fail to Integrate? Muslim Integration and Trust in Public Institutions
AN  - 1322723519; 201310748
AB  - Multivariate analysis of 2008 data from the German Social Survey (ALLBUS) provides firm evidence on the basis of one important dimension of political integration-individuals' trust in the political system-that Muslims are integrating well into German society. The results are significant despite controls for multiple indicators of respondents' social capital, socioeconomic status, post-material views, ideological position, partisan support for parties in power, assessment of government performance, interest in politics, and amount of television viewing. Furthermore, Muslims' level of religiosity does not influence their level of political trust. The findings raise new questions about integration in that the significantly lower levels of political trust found among non-Muslims may negatively affect their views of government and its efforts to respond to Germany's Muslim population. Skepticism and distrust of government by non-Muslim ethnic Germans may undermine important programs designed to bridge the actual value and cultural differences which remain the source of the ignorance that fuels prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Spaces of Encounters: Immigration, Race, Class, and the Politics of Belonging in Small-Town America
AN  - 1364700093; 201323470
AB  - Small towns throughout the rural upper Midwest have been experiencing dramatic economic restructuring and an unprecedented influx of new immigrants of color, triggering conflicts and tension between almost exclusively white residents and the new immigrants. Analyzing the roots and content of white residents' responses to their encounters with new immigrants in a small town in rural Minnesota, the concept of spaces of encounters draws attention to the relational quality of identities and attitudes and the active role of emotions and spatiality in processes of Othering and racialization, as well as the potential of the encounter to disrupt preconceived boundaries and racial stereotypes. White residents racialize immigrants and space, although the specific form taken by processes of racialization is inflected by individuals' social positionality and place identities and by longer term and broader scale racial stereotypes and dominant discourses about immigration, race, and nation in the United States. The racialization of immigrants defends white privilege and culture; recovers an imagined idealized place, past, and future; and establishes that belonging to the national and local community is conditional on immigrants conforming to white American values and norms-an assimilationist imaginary that runs up against the multicultural and multiracial reality of the town. Residents' reflections on their own racial prejudice and different forms of racism, as well as intimate social relations they forge with individual migrants, hold promise for social relations that transcend differences across racial and cultural divides.

T1  - Is racial bias malleable? Whites' lay theories of racial bias predict divergent strategies for interracial interactions
AN  - 1347785943; 201318844
AB  - How do Whites approach interracial interactions? We argue that a previously unexamined factor -- beliefs about the malleability of racial bias -- guides Whites' strategies for difficult interracial interactions. We predicted and found that those who believe racial bias is malleable favor learning-oriented strategies such as taking the other person's perspective and trying to learn why an interaction is challenging, whereas those who believe racial bias is fixed favor performance-oriented strategies such as overcompensating in the interaction and trying to end the interaction as quickly as possible. Four studies support these predictions. Whether measured (Studies 1, 3, and 4) or manipulated (Study 2), beliefs that racial bias is fixed versus malleable yielded these divergent strategies for difficult interracial interactions. Furthermore, beliefs about the malleability of racial bias are distinct from related constructs (e.g., prejudice and motivations to respond without prejudice; Studies 1, 3, and 4) and influence self-reported (Studies 1-3) and actual (Study 4) strategies in imagined (Studies 1-2) and real (Studies 3-4) interracial interactions. Together, these findings demonstrate that beliefs about the malleability of racial bias influence Whites' approaches to and strategies within interracial interactions.

T1  - Creating difference: the racialization of Germany's Jewish soldiers after the First World War
AN  - 1283644054; 201303333
AB  - In books, exhibitions and memorials, the Jewish soldiers who fought for Germany in the First World War have become a measure of the magnitude of the National Socialists' genocidal crimes. The message is a simple one: such was the brutality of the regime that it even murdered those who had loyally fought for Germany. In many ways, though, this focus on the Holocaust has led Jewish participation in the First World War to be viewed as a point of separation between Jews and other Germans. In contrast, Grady argues that the Jewish soldiers were only gradually removed from narratives of the German war effort. Indeed, he suggests that the alienation of the Jewish soldier occurred not so much during the Great War but rather during the final years of the Weimar Republic as Nazi antisemitism grew. After 1945, this image of war-time isolation was reinforced as Holocaust awareness in West Germany and elsewhere started to increase. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity, God Concepts, And The Indigenization Of A Guatemalan Popular Saint
AN  - 1221412092; 201244356
AB  - How do we understand debates regarding the ethnicity of supernatural agents in societies that have recently given rise to ethnic social movements? This article addresses this question through ethnographic research among indigenous and non-indigenous devotees of the popular saint San Simon in Guatemala's central highlands. Drawing on Bourdieu's concept of the religious field and Taussig's history of mimesis and alterity, I note the ethnicity of saints is the juncture of two forms of alterity, the ontological alterity of supernatural agents and the sociological alterity of ethnic groups. I argue that indigenous devotees decolonize Maya spirituality through the indigenization of San Simon, while his indigenization among spiritist ladino devotees reproduces colonial concepts of the magically powerful Other. These devotees' positions illustrate how such "god concepts" can serve as interpretations of changes in asymmetric ethnic relations, with implications for our general understanding of the intersection of religion and ethnicity in multicultural states.

T1  - The antisemitism of Henry Wickham Steed
AN  - 1283644047; 201303379
AB  - Henry Wickham Steed (1871-1956), then editor-in-chief of the London Times, adopted an ambiguous position with regard to The Protocols of the Elders of Zion when the tract first appeared in English in 1920. He neither endorsed nor rejected it but instead mused in the editorial pages of The Times about whether it might be authentic. The following year, when The Times correspondent in Istanbul brought out proof that The Protocols was a forgery, Steed accepted his correspondent's findings and publicly retracted his earlier ambivalent position. This incident reflects on Steed's (deserved) reputation as an antisemite but it also suggests something of the complexity of his position. Steed's denunciations of Jewish influence, discovered, by his own account, through his experience as a foreign correspondent in Vienna before the First World War, are recurrent in his writings. At the same time, Steed lent strong support to Zionist aspirations at the time of the Balfour Declaration and thereafter, and, in the 1930s, he was among the very first English critics of Hitler's antisemitism. In this article, I propose to offer some hypotheses regarding Steed's antisemitism. Strange as it may sound in the wake of the Second World War, it was Steed's visceral Germanophobia that lay at the heart of his antisemitism. Until the advent of the Third Reich, Steed identified Jews with Germans and with German interests. As an ardent exponent of the 'principle of nationality', however, Steed consistently extended his advocacy of statehood for various Eastern European nationalities to the Jewish national cause. A final factor that helps to explain Steed's suspiciousness and gullibility is that, by disposition and as a lifelong journalist, he was drawn to conspiracy theories. He created a number of sensations in his career and, to return to the example of The Protocols, he was loath to discount so spectacular a conspiracy story. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Photographing Handsworth: photography, meaning and identity in a British inner city
AN  - 1283644041; 201303284
AB  - 'If you say "Handsworth",' the novelist Salman Rushdie remarked in 1986, 'what do you see? Most people would see fire, riots, looted shops ... and helmeted cops ... a front page story.' In the 1980s, 'front page' images of violence and disorder had come to define areas of black settlement such as Handsworth. However, for both Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, photography has the potential of unearthing alternative histories of black people in Britain. Connell explores how this might work in practice by taking Handsworth, an inner-city area of Birmingham, as its case study. Following the Handsworth riots in 1985, a photograph of the 'black bomber' appeared on the front page of every national tabloid newspaper, and Handsworth became conceptualized by the media as 'Frontline Britain'. At the same time, there are numerous examples of photographs from within Handsworth that attempt to present a different view of the community: images taken at high-street portraiture studios, community photography projects and the documentary work of the professional photographers Vanley Burke and Pogus Caesar. What such images offer the historian, it will be shown, is not clear cut. Photographs from within Handsworth are suggestive of possible themes in any alternative history of race in Britain, particularly in their emphasis on everyday life. However, Connell shows that it is also necessary to understand what is often the unacknowledged politics behind these images, something that makes them-in differing ways-as problematic as the stereotypical narratives presented on the front pages of tabloid newspapers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Unskilled" Workers: Social Skills Stereotypes Affect Evaluations of Biracial Job Applicants
AN  - 1266147523; 201300451
AB  - Why do Black/White workers earn wages similar to Black workers ($6.30 less per hour than White workers), despite encountering less negative, anti-Black sentiment from others? We propose that Black/White workers must contend with stereotypes suggesting that biracial people are socially unskilled. In the present study we observed that, regardless of whether job candidates were rejected for external reasons (interviewer prejudice) or whether candidates acted in undesirable ways (claimed discrimination), participants rated Black/White applicants as less socially skilled and as more likely to have demonstrated poor interview skills than Black applicants. Implications for biases against hiring biracial people are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The New "New Racism" Thesis: Limited Government Values and Race-Conscious Policy Attitudes
AN  - 1023026007; 201223844
AB  - Some contend that Whites' application of values to form opinions about race-conscious policy may constitute a subtle form of racism. Others challenge the new racism thesis, suggesting that racism and values are exclusive in their influence. Proponents of the thesis assert that many Whites' attitudes about such policy are structured by a mix of racism and American individualism. The author suggests that an even more subtle form of racism may exist. Racism may actually be expressed in opposition to big government. The test results presented here indicate that the effects of limited-government values on attitudes about race-conscious policy are conditional on levels of racial prejudice for many Whites, whereas the effects on racially ambiguous social welfare policy attitudes are not. The author contends that these results provide support to the argument that racism still exists and has found a new subtle expression.

AB  - Integrated threat theory, realistic conflict theory, and group justification (based on social identity theory) were evaluated in the international context of Japanese prejudice toward North Korea and South Korea. Military threat emerged as an important addition to the four threats outlined by integrated threat theory. Three perceived North Korean threats (realistic [domestic] threat; intergroup anxiety; military threat) predicted prejudice toward North Korea. North Korean prejudice predicted negative stereotypes, supporting group-justification theory. Perceived North Korean realistic [domestic] threat predicted prejudice toward South Korea. Prejudice toward South Korea predicted negative stereotypes of North Korea, suggesting a mechanism by which prejudice generalizes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Culture and Contact in the Promotion and Reduction of Anti-Gay Prejudice: Evidence from Jamaica and Britain
AN  - 1283641964; 201303498
AB  - Jamaica has been called "the most homophobic place on Earth" (Padgett, 2006, p. 1), and has been involved in numerous international incidents with Britain, and other countries, concerning anti-gay prejudice. However, neither the severity of Jamaican anti-gay prejudice, nor any means of reducing this prejudice has ever been empirically investigated. Intergroup contact-social interaction with a person from another group-is one of the most successful and widely used social-psychological interventions to reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. In this article, we compared sexual prejudice in Jamaica to that in Britain and investigated the relationship between contact and sexual prejudice in both countries. Jamaican participants reported more negative attitudes toward gay men than did British participants, but contact was more strongly associated with reduced sexual prejudice for Jamaican participants than for British participants. Implications for reducing Jamaican sexual prejudice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Gays and Lesbians: A Latent Class Analysis of University Students
AN  - 1283638447; 201303441
AB  - The profession of social work advocates for civil rights for gay men, lesbians, and bisexual persons. However, a number of social work students and practitioners harbor antigay bias that in prior variable-centered research has been determined to be related to race, relationship status, and age. The purpose of this research was to use latent class analysis (LCA), a person-centered statistical technique, to cluster 394 university student survey responses to the Attitudes Toward Lesbian and Gays short-form instrument. The analyses indicated three groups that can be profiled as unbiased, moderately biased, and highly biased. Analysis of variance and multinomial regression verified LCA findings that are consistent with prior research. The importance of selecting appropriate educational approaches to address antigay bias among social work students and practicing social workers is discussed, and recommendations for continued research, including a national random survey of social work students and licensed social workers, are made.

T1  - "It's all so different here": Initial Employment and Social Engagement Experiences of South Africans in New Zealand
AN  - 1125222087; 201240522
AB  - South African immigrants in New Zealand have been largely ignored by researchers in comparison with 'visible' migrants from Asia and the South Pacific. This paper examines the initial settlement experiences of a group of skilled South Africans with regard to employment and social engagement. It has two key aims: to show that despite their 'invisibility' South Africans were not immune to initial settlement difficulties; and to identify the cause(s) of such difficulties. The evidence indicates that cultural, social and economic differences between South Africa and New Zealand were the primary causes of the difficulties experienced. Prejudice was also a factor but was usually less overt, more complex and sometimes just a matter of suspicion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Advice-taking as an unobtrusive measure of prejudice
AN  - 1081864339; 201235398
AB  - A new unobtrusive measure of prejudice is proposed based on an advice-taking task. The computer-based task requires participants to find a token hidden behind one of two boxes. Prior to making their choice, however, someone (depicted by a name or a face) provides advice as to the token's location. An unobtrusive measure of prejudice is derived by manipulating the advice-giver's social group (e.g., male or female, Asian or White) and comparing the proportions of advice taken from each group. In Experiment 1, although the participants were not aware of it, they took more advice from males than from females. In Experiment 2, the relative proportion of advice taken from Asian versus White advice-givers correlated with responses to a news story pertaining to Asians. In Experiment 3, the relative proportion of advice taken from Asian versus White advice-givers correlated with scores on the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and predicted discriminatory behaviour, as indexed by the lost e-mail technique, better than other measures. In Experiment 4, scores on the advice task were uncontaminated by social desirability concerns and reactance and reflected the relative amounts of trust that people placed in different social groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that the advice task may be a useful tool for researchers seeking an unobtrusive measure of prejudice with predictive validity.

T1  - Conflating Apples and Oranges: Understanding Modern Forms of Racism
AN  - 964196868; 201207406
AB  - Social scientists generally agree that the post-Civil Rights form of racism is different from that which existed in the Jim Crow-era in the United States. However, beyond this agreement, what exactly modern racism is and "looks like" is debatable. With this in mind, a surprising and somewhat disturbing trend frequently occurs among social scientists that can have real consequences within academia and the general public: conflation. In naming a newly developed concept as "racism", social scientists often conflate three interrelated concepts: racial prejudice, racial discrimination, and racism. This paper clarifies these three interrelated concepts and the problems with conflating them. Additionally, this paper describes many of the alternative conceptions of racism in the post-Civil Rights era, identifying where conflation exists in each concept. In closing, the paper describes the implications of conflation for social science research and the American public. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Onerous passions: colonial anti-miscegenation rhetoric and the history of sexuality
AN  - 964197855; 201207421
AB  - Ehlers's analysis revisits Foucauldian conceptualizations of the history of sexuality in order to map the inextricability of race, gender and sexuality as they emerged in the context of the early American colonies. The salience of such an analysis lies in its ability to extend the terrain of Foucault's history, and brings new considerations to bear regarding the specific configurations of race, gender and sexual intersections in North American history. If, as Foucault insists, sexuality is a set of effects produced in bodies, behaviours and social relations, Ehlers reorients these claims to consider how these effects were racialized within the rubric of colonial anti-miscegenation rhetoric. Through such a tracing, it becomes evident that, from the early colonial context, sexuality was deployed to produce "ideal" sexuality as a bastion of whiteness: that is, to configure and maintain "ideal" sexuality as white.

T1  - Individuals' Beliefs about the Etiology of Same-Sex Sexual Orientation
AN  - 1023025411; 201223971
AB  - We examined the relationships between beliefs about the etiology of having a same-sex sexual orientation, sexual prejudice, and support for gay-relevant legislation using the justification-suppression model of prejudice as our theoretical foundation. Results indicated that more belief that a same-sex sexual orientation was due to nurture factors predicted less support for gay-relevant legislation, and that this relationship was mediated by levels of sexual prejudice. The opposite pattern was found for belief that a same-sex sexual orientation was due to nature factors. This suggests that beliefs about the etiology of sexual orientation may serve as justification (or suppression) factors in the expression of prejudice toward gay men and lesbians.

T1  - Continuity and change in anti-Jewish prejudice: the transmission of the anti-talmudic texts of Sixtus of Siena
AN  - 907925907; 201124635
AB  - One of the main elements common to both the mediaeval anti-Jewish tradition and modern antisemitism is the use of Jewish religious texts-particularly the Talmud-in order to 'prove' that Jews pose a threat to non-Jews. Bravo Lopez considers how a series of anti-talmudic texts written by Sixtus of Siena in the sixteenth century were disseminated and used, up to the beginning of the twentieth century, to legitimize a threatening image of Judaism and Jews. Despite the changing historical context, that image remained virtually intact throughout the centuries, allowing these same texts to be used time and time again to 'prove' that it was a faithful reflection of reality. Although historical changes can account for differences in the specific motives that drove each author to use the texts of Sixtus of Siena, those authors all shared the same image of Judaism and the Jews, and they considered these texts-cited as an authoritative source, legitimizing their point of view-to be effective in support of their cause.

T1  - Fertility and Intergroup Bias in Racial and Minimal-Group Contexts: Evidence for Shared Architecture
AN  - 1910822387
AB  - Recent research has shown that White women's bias against Black men increases with elevated fertility across the menstrual cycle. We demonstrate that the association between fertility and intergroup bias is not limited to groups defined by race, but extends to group categories that are minimally defined, and may depend on the extent to which women associate out-group men with physical formidability. In Study 1, Black and White women with strong associations between the racial out-group and physical formidability displayed greater bias against out-group men as conception risk increased. Study 2 replicated these results in a minimal-group paradigm. These findings are consistent with the notion that women may be endowed with a psychological system that generates intergroup bias via mechanisms that rely on categorization heuristics and perceptions of the physical formidability of out-group men, particularly when the costs of sexual coercion are high.

T1  - Measuring Everyday Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Health Surveys: How Best to Ask the Questions, in One or Two Stages, Across Multiple Racial/Ethnic Groups?
AN  - 887500755; 201118193
AB  - While it is clear that self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination is related to illness, there are challenges in measuring self-reported discrimination or unfair treatment. In the present study, we evaluate the psychometric properties of a self-reported instrument across racial/ethnic groups in a population-based sample, and we test and interpret findings from applying two different widely-used approaches to asking about discrimination and unfair treatment. Even though we found that the subset of items we tested tap into a single underlying concept, we also found that different groups are more likely to report on different aspects of discrimination whether race is mentioned in the survey question affects both frequency and mean scores of reports of racial/ethnic discrimination. Our findings suggest caution to researchers when comparing studies that have used different approaches to measure racial/ethnic discrimination and allow us to suggest practical empirical guidelines for measuring and analyzing racial/ethnic discrimination. No less important, we have developed a self-reported measure of recent racial/ethnic discrimination that functions well in a range of different racial/ethnic groups and makes it possible to compare how racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with health disparities among multiple racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - Family Structure, Mother-Daughter Relationship Quality, Race and Ethnicity, and Adolescent Girls' Health Risks
AN  - 867525287
AB  - Using a sample of 7,114 adolescent girls (4,269 White, 1,707 African American, and 1,138 Hispanic) and biological mothers from Wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examined how family structure, girls' perceptions of mother-daughter relationship quality, and race and ethnicity related to girls' health risks. In general, results indicate heightened risk for both precocious events and depressive symptoms for girls in mother-stepfather, single-mother, and nonresident mother families compared to mother-father families. However, significant two- and three- way interactions suggest that adolescent girls' health risks vary considerably based on the combination of family structure, mother-daughter relationship quality, and race and ethnicity.

T1  - The "Obama Effect" and White Racial Attitudes
AN  - 1928619159
AB  - To what extent did the presidential candidacy and election of Barack Obama affect whites' more general perceptions of African Americans? Responses to survey questions in which respondents were asked to place blacks on scales running from "stupid" to "intelligent" and from "lazy" to "hardworking" revealed that whites' views of blacks' intelligence and work ethic have become somewhat more positive, though whites continued to be rated higher on these attributes than were blacks. The fact that negative stereotypes of blacks were least pronounced among younger whites implies that these stereotypes will continue to fade in the future. These data do not constitute proof positive of an "Obama effect" on whites' racial attitudes, but they are largely consistent with that idea.

T1  - Reflections on a Sociological Career that Integrates Social Science with Social Policy
AN  - 919902915; 201203542
AB  - This autobiographical essay reflects on my sociological career, highlighting the integration of sociology with social policy. I discuss the personal, social, and intellectual experiences, ranging from childhood to adult life, that influenced my pursuit of studies in race and ethnic relations and urban poverty. I then focus on how the academic and public reaction to these studies increased my concerns about the relationship between social science and public policy, as well as my attempts to make my work more accessible to a general audience. In the process, I discuss how the academic awards and honors I received based on these studies enhanced my involvement in the national policy arena. I conclude this essay with some thoughts about public agenda research and productive controversy based on my own unique experiences. In short, this autobiographical essay shows how a scholar can engage academics, policy makers, and the media concerned with how sociological knowledge can inform a policy agenda on some of the nation's most important social problems.

T1  - Becoming black, becoming president
AN  - 902082845; 201122266
AB  - Speculation about the relationship between Barack Obama's election to the presidency and race in the United States was rife prior to, during and after his successful campaign. King looks at three aspects of this issue. First, as a kind of outsider, Obama had to prove himself black enough for African Americans of the traditional sort and not too dangerous for Whites. How did he achieve this? Second, Obama's election was made possible by changes in the voting behaviour of white Americans, particularly in the North, and the way that African Americans like Obama gained a foothold in, and at times control of, urban political machines, such as, in his case, Chicago. How have American historians treated this shift in white voting behaviour? Finally, the central question of how race still impinges on President Obama's performance as president. King concludes with a look at issues such as colour blindness and whiteness, the nature of black political identity and solidarity, and the variety of political roles from which a black leader such Obama can choose.

T1  - Barack Obama and the South: demography as electoral opportunity
AN  - 902082804; 201122211
AB  - Barack Obama was more successful in the South in the 2008 election than many previous Democratic presidential nominees had been. While John McCain continued Republican dominance in the conservative region, it was a major breakthrough for a northern liberal Democrat, especially an African American from Illinois, to win three southern states and secure 55 electoral votes. Florida, North Carolina and Virginia were good opportunities for Obama because, demographically, they had come to resemble other large states outside the South. In these 'converging' southern states, the Latino and Asian communities had grown substantially. The percentage of college-educated Whites had increased and there had been large-scale migration from other regions of the country. The states that Obama won in the South were not as 'southern' as they once were. In some southern states, those called the 'neo-Confederate South' in this article, white support for Obama was less than John Kerry had received in 2004. This decline in white voting for the Democratic presidential nominee occurred despite the difficult economic times that enveloped the country in the months preceding the election, and the general unpopularity of the incumbent Republican administration headed by George W. Bush. Some of these states, like Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, had been among the most intransigent states in resisting the claims of the civil rights movement for social and political equality for African Americans in the 1950s and 1960s. In the future it may be more accurate to speak of more than one South, rather than refer to the region as an undifferentiated whole. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Kuryla maps a metaphorical American island of the colour blind--in law, public rhetoric and culture--in the process locating the first black president of the United States on it, evaluating the claim that his presidency represents a colour-blind or post-racial politics. Barack Obama rejects colour blindness as a fact in the present yet gestures to its 'better history' (his modern transposing of Lincoln's 'better angels') while refusing any theoretical resolution of the idea. Obama, in public pronouncements and by sheer fact of his being and his biography, reveals the epistemic irony of the colour-blind idea, its persistence amid the conditions of its impossibility.

T1  - Multiculturalism: Sorting Identities, Rights, and Conflicts
AN  - 1373426533; 201328559
AB  - Multiculturalism studies in Canada evolved into three major visions and debates after World War II. In the early 1970s, the British and French peoples assumed monolingual-monocultural states, and expected that others would assimilate into their dominant cultures. In the 1970s, this was changed to official bilingual and multicultural visions where more diversity was accepted. By the 1980s, demographic diversity called for debates on equal rights for all, without discrimination and prejudice. Multiple identities, however, often clash, but slowly more diverse visions and structures emerged. Here is a brief summary of the historical and sociological changes that occurred in Canada.

T1  - Can friendships be bipartisan? The effects of political ideology on peer relationships
AN  - 1018356361; 201212750
AB  - Although political ideology has been examined extensively as a predictor of individual differences, it has been absent in the interpersonal relationships literature. Political ideology may have strong effects on friendship patterns because of its polarizing nature. Findings among actual friendship groups (Study 1) indicated a degree of similarity in peers' political ideology alignments, but also suggested that liberals and conservatives were comfortable with some level of bipartisanship among their friends. In an experimental condition with hypothetical peers (Study 2), individuals' political ideology predicted their reported friendship potential (perceived similarity and desire for friendship) with gay-affirming and gay-disapproving peers whose ideologies were not explicitly indicated. This effect of political ideology on friendship potential was significant over and above the effect predicted by individuals' similarity or dissimilarity on sexual minority attitudes with these peers. Findings highlight the overarching relevance of political ideology as a factor that contributes to friendship patterns. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Social Capital and the Experience of Prejudice, Aggression and Discrimination among Immigrants, US-Born Minorities and Whites in Greensboro, North Carolina
AN  - 1010632419; 201210488
AB  - This study examines the correlates of human relations experiences and social engagement practices of immigrants, U.S. minorities, and Whites in Greensboro, North Carolina. As part of a 2008 State of Human Relations study commissioned by the City of Greensboro, we examined residents' experiences with prejudice, (i.e., ignorance, fear, distrust, superiority), aggression (i.e., names, insults, threats, assault), and discrimination (i.e., blocked access to employment, education, housing, and law enforcement). Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and ordinal regression analyses were conducted using over 1400 surveys to describe and examine discrimination and prejudice experiences of each racial/ethnic group. Findings indicate that each group has experienced levels of discrimination, prejudice, and aggression in Greensboro. Of specific interest is that, though U.S. minorities are more socially engaged, they reported higher incidences of discrimination and prejudice than any group within the sample.

T1  - Understanding Immigrants' Experiences: Reflections on Ken Dion's Research Contributions
AN  - 835111520; 201100476
AB  - This article focuses on Ken Dion's contributions to a central issue for understanding the psychology of immigration: namely, intergroup relations and immigrants' experiences. Immigrants face many challenges, including the experience of prejudice and discrimination directed toward them by others already residing in the society to which they have immigrated. Ken's research focused on the perspective of those who are the targets of discrimination. After briefly describing his early seminal work on the social psychology of reported discrimination, his later contributions to this area are discussed, in particular, his involvement in interdisciplinary collaborative research pertaining to immigration which provided unique opportunities to further develop and test his ideas.

T1  - Teaching a Global Sociology: Suggestions for Globalizing the U.S. Curriculum
AN  - 1905297051
AB  - Increasingly, educators have called on colleges and universities to prepare their students for a more interdependent world. While sociology has begun to heed the message to globalize the curriculum, efforts to implement relevant teaching practices are hampered by lack of consensus on what "internationalizing" or "globalizing" the classroom actually means and the most effective ways to accomplish this goal. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to identify the multiple meanings of internationalizing or globalizing the classroom, and second, to suggest teaching strategies relevant to the specific pedagogical goals of teaching a more globalized version of the discipline. Three sociology courses--Race and Ethnic Relations, Classical Social Theory, and Migration in a Global Context--are used to illustrate how a more systematic understanding of globalizing the curriculum can improve course design.

T1  - Keeping the Doors to the Community Open
AN  - 1081869087; 201235313
AB  - Polls show that Americans of all races now believe that social class and national origin are more potent bases for discrimination than race. However, this assessment is rendered more complicated by (a) the high rate of exclusion of people on the basis of behavioral characteristics and (b) the strikingly disparate impact of such decisions on people of color. America's high rates of (a) incarceration in the criminal and juvenile justice system, (b) visa denials, detention, and removal in the immigration system, and (c) suspensions and expulsions in the schools all have the effect of excluding many Latinos and African Americans from ordinary life in the community. Although norms of inclusion are adaptive for communities, such an approach is intrinsically difficult to achieve. Attention should be given to (a) facilitation of the exercise of moral leadership and (b) design of settings that "demand" notice of, and care for, all participants.

T1  - Social Insertion and Racial Prejudice: Distance from Black People and Socio-Political Variables
AN  - 764425043; 201064801
AB  - This article analyses the relationships between racial prejudice (flagrant and symbolic) and university students' membership of socio-political groups, their adhesion to political ideologies, and their attitudes related to the developed and developing worlds. A total of 418 students participated in the study. The results show a negative correlation between adhesion to left-wing ideology and social distance from black people. They also show that favourable attitudes to the developed world are positively correlated to the distance from black people. Finally, group memberships in social movements and in affective-religious communities inhibit the expression of symbolic racial prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The ties that bind: Australia, Hungary and the case of Karoly Zentai
AN  - 754039233; 201049669
AB  - Balint examines the current case of Karoly Zentai, an Australian wanted for war crimes in Hungary, his country of origin. She explores the evidence for his extradition, the broader historical context of the Zentai case, from 1944 until the present day, and its implications for historical understanding in Hungary and Australia. In the former, the complicity of the state in the Holocaust remains subject to historical denial, drowned out by the dominant narrative of Hungarian victimhood in the war. In the latter, the migration of war criminals to the country via the mass immigration programme conducted in the Displaced Persons (DP) camps of post-war occupied Europe has been hidden by the more widely known story of rescue. Balint also explores the wider history of connection between these two countries, forged during the post-war voyages of immigrants from the DP camps in occupied Europe. She questions to what extent Zentai's extradition and possible trial would help to promote collective understanding of the 'lessons of history' in contemporary Australian or Hungarian society, and argues that, even in this 'twilight time' of Holocaust memory, such efforts are necessary, though risky, for the future as well as to do justice to the past.

T1  - Urban residents' subtle prejudice towards rural-to-urban migrants in China: The role of socioeconomic status and adaptation styles
AN  - 743067068; 201043404
AB  - The household registration system (Hukou) implemented by the Chinese government divides the Chinese society into two groups: urban residents and rural residents. Since the 1980s, millions of rural residents have migrated to cities without official permission. In this paper, we investigate urban residents' subtle prejudice towards rural-to-urban migrants. Specifically, the impacts of urban residents' socioeconomic status (SES) and their perception of migrants' adaptation styles are examined. A sample including 457 Chinese urban residents is taken from four cities in China. Educational and occupational levels are used to indicate urban residents' SES. Four adaptation styles (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization) are manipulated by using vignettes. The results show that SES has a negative impact on urban residents' subtle prejudice. This link is further moderated by urban residents' perceptions of migrants' adaptations: the negative effect of SES on subtle prejudice holds only under a perception of integration or assimilation and disappears under a perception of separation or marginalization.

T1  - American Indian Women Report on the Community Impact of a Tribal Casino
AN  - 868013651; 201112972
AB  - This qualitative study of the community impact of a Midwest American Indian casino examined semi-structured interview data (N = 20) from American Indian women. Results indicate that the opening of the tribal casino has provided opportunities for intergroup contact to occur resulting in improved relations between Indians on the reservation and those who are not Indian from surrounding communities. These improved relations are positively affecting the relationships that develop between the members of the communities. The findings highlight the need for social workers to examine the impact of intergroup contact that is naturally occurring in tribal casino communities and develop interventions that can assist in reducing stereotypes and prejudices.

T1  - The Changing Face of Racial Discrimination: Hispanics as the Dominant Minority in the USA - a New Application of Power-Threat Theory
AN  - 743055325; 201031722
AB  - According to Hubert Blalock's 1967 power-threat theory, the larger the minority group's size the greater the threat to the majority group. Most of Blalock's examples, and much of the subsequent empirical investigation into the power-threat thesis, focus on Anglo and African American relations. Changing demographics will likely alter existing majority-minority relations as Hispanics displace African Americans as the largest minority. This will change the face of racial discrimination in the country. Indeed, this paper suggests that the animosity toward Latinos by both the majority white and minority black populations may be more intense than those shaping contemporary white-black relations. Two key lifestyle features that have not contaminated black-white relations may exacerbate hostility toward Hispanics: their perceived illegal status in the country, and the perception that Hispanics resist learning English. The role of the media in perpetuating these stereotypes and inflaming hostility toward Latinos is also discussed. [Reprinted by permission; copyright Sage Publications Inc.]

T1  - Racial palestinianization and the Janus-faced nature of the Israeli state
AN  - 743065957; 201043238
AB  - Abu El-Haj focuses on David Theo Goldberg's analysis of 'racial palestinianization' in The Threat of Race. Most broadly, she argues that the specific contours of the Israeli state's racial rule over its Palestinian subjects and citizens do not fit easily into Goldberg's characterization of neoliberal racism. She thinks with and further elaborates Goldberg's many insights, especially his use of Michel Foucault's concept of 'race wars' and 'counter-history' to think about Zionism and the Israeli state, and then demonstrates the ways in which, at moments, Goldberg fails to exit fully the counter-historical narrative he sets out to critique and considers why that is so. Finally, she questions Goldberg's naming of racial palestinianization a 'born again racism', and complicates his characterization of Israel as a neoliberal state, insisting on recognizing and highlighting its dual nature: Israel is a neoliberal and a colonial state, overlapping, and yet each operating according to distinct tactics and modalities of rule.
