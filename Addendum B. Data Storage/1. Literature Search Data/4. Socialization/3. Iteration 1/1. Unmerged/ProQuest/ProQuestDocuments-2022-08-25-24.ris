T1  - Exploring indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms between the Awi and Gumuz ethnic communities in Zigem Woreda, Ethiopia
AN  - 2666814134
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this study is to explore indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms for resolving ethnic-based conflicts between the Awi and Gumuz communities in Ethiopia.Design/methodology/approach>This study followed a qualitative research approach and it has a case study design that is appropriate to collect in-depth information about indigenous mechanisms of resolving conflicts that arise between Awi and Gumuz ethnic groups. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and document review.Findings>The results revealed that the Awi and Gumuz ethnic groups resolve conflict through the elder council or shimigilina. This indigenous mechanism conflict resolution mechanism is well recognized, accepted and respected both by the Awi and Gumuz ethnic groups. Shimiglina has different phases and rituals which are finally concluded by kale-mehala (oath) or promising not to take revenge and harm. The Awi and Gumuz ethnic groups view shimigilina as a vital and effective conflict resolution mechanism.Practical implications>This study clearly indicated important implications for policy, practice and future research. The Awi and Gumuz communities have used the elders’ council (shimiglina) to solve ethnic-based conflicts for a long time. Therefore, there should be policy frameworks at different levels (national, regional and local) for the integration of the elders’ council with the formal justice system. Put in other words, this indigenous conflict resolution mechanism should be properly organized and institutionalized. However, a comprehensive study should be conducted to understand how to organize and institutionalize this indigenous conflict resolution mechanism.Originality/value>This is an original study that contributes to peacebuilding by discovering the role of indigenous knowledge in conflict resolution and peacebuilding.

T1  - Systems of Oppression: The Impact of Discrimination on Latinx Immigrant Adolescents’ Well‐Being and Development
AN  - 2672685294
AB  - With over 400 harmful immigration policy changes in the past 4 years, Latinx adolescents and families nationwide are developing within a context of extreme anti‐immigrant sentiment (Dismantling and reconstructing the U.S. immigration system: A catalog of changes under the Trump presidency, Migration Policy Institute, 2020). This paper introduces the Multitiered Model of Oppression and Discrimination (MMOD), a conceptual model for understanding the impacts of multiple levels of discrimination on the well‐being and development of Latinx immigrant adolescents. Interpersonal discrimination (Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences, 2010, 32, 259), community‐held stereotypes (Social Psychology of Education, 2001, 5, 201), institutional policies (Children and Youth Services Review, 2018, 87, 192), and structural practices (Journal of Criminal Justice, 2020, 66, 1) can negatively impact well‐being and development among these adolescents. Culturally sustaining interventions, civic engagement and mobilization, and policies targeting inequitable policies and practices will provide healing and an avenue for liberation.

T1  - Towards a United South African Agriculture: A Review of Social Networking Between Black Smallholder and White Commercial Farming Communities Through Farmer Organisations
AN  - 2705558644
AB  - This review study takes a first step towards understanding the extent of social cohesion in South Africa’s farming landscape to contribute to the scant literature in this area. A socially cohesive society is a society in which all forms of inequality, exclusion, and disparity based on ethnicity, race, gender, class, religion or any other divisive distinction that causes distrust and conflict are sustainably reduced with a view to eventual eradication. This ideal is examined through social networking among the different farming communities within South African agriculture. Farmer organisations are identified and reviewed through their websites and discussed together with other relevant literature, searched through traditional and snowball literature reviews. We found very little evidence to suggest that the social cohesion ideal has been achieved in South African agriculture. The implications of this are discussed in light of the transformation agenda of the agricultural sector through land reform.

T1  - Does Language Foster Reconciliation? Evidence From the Former Yugoslavia
AN  - 2660580714
AB  - Despite a surge in research on post-conflict reconciliation, the specific factors which promote reconciliation remain a subject of debate. In particular, the possible role of shared language in fostering reconciliation has received little scholarly attention. This paper examines two possible channels through which shared language may facilitate reconciliation, and tests these using a new survey dataset of 446 individuals from Serbia. As expected, the results indicated that shared language reduces the negative effect of conflict on intergroup trust and friendship, two crucial components of reconciliation. Furthermore, the results suggest that in the former Yugoslavia this effect is generated by the communication-enabling aspects of a shared language, rather than its other properties such as acting as a marker of ethnic or cultural identity.

T1  - Writing for digital news about HIV criminalization in canada
AN  - 2656210385
AB  - For years, HIV activists in Canada have expressed serious concerns about the stigmatizing and sensational way that HIV criminalization is portrayed in the mainstream press. Discourse analyses of the content of news stories about HIV criminalization confirm that news reports of HIV criminal cases rely on sensational language and reproduce negative stereotypes of people living with HIV. This paper contributes to social justice scholarship in the area by building upon studies of news content to uncover how news reports of HIV criminalization are produced in the first place. Through institutional ethnographic interviews with journalists who produce news stories about HIV criminalization, this study brings into view that conditions of convergence journalism make it exceedingly difficult for reporters to disrupt the genre of crime stories about HIV criminalization in which stigmatizing discourses proliferate.Alternate abstract:RÉSUMÉPendant des années, les activistes du VIH au Canada ont exprimé de sérieuses inquiétudes quant à la manière stigmatisante et sensationnelle dont la criminalisation du VIH est dépeinte dans la presse grand public. Les analyses de discours du contenu des reportages sur la criminalisation du VIH confirment que les reportages sur les affaires criminelles liées au VIH s'appuient sur un langage sensationnel et reproduisent les stéréotypes négatifs des personnes vivant avec le VIH. Cet article contribue à la recherche sur la justice sociale dans ce domaine en allant au‐delà des études du contenu des nouvelles pour découvrir comment les reportages sur la criminalisation du VIH sont produits en premier lieu. Grâce à des entretiens ethnographiques institutionnels avec des journalistes qui produisent des reportages sur la criminalisation du VIH, cette étude met en évidence que les conditions du journalisme de convergence rendent extrêmement difficile pour les reporters de perturber le genre de reportages sur la criminalisation du VIH dans lequel prolifèrent les discours stigmatisants.

T1  - Ethnic Identity, Chinese National Identity, and Intergroup Attitudes of Adolescents from an Ethnic Autonomous Region in China
AN  - 2651458322
AB  - We compared the differences and explored the associations between ethnic identity and Chinese national identity, and the intergroup attitudes of adolescents from the Yi, Han, and Mongolian ethnicities in a Yi ethnic autonomous region in China. The participants (N = 1830, 50% female) were middle school students (n = 910, Mage = 13.51) and high school students (n = 920, Mage = 17.71). We found (a) significant ethnic differences between the high school students in the subscales of behavior, self-identification, and achievement; (b) that the three ethnic groups exhibited nonsignificant differences in their perceptions of Chinese national identity; (c) a positive association between ethnic identity and Chinese national identity for the adolescents across ethnicities; (d) a positive association between ethnic identity and intergroup attitudes for the Yi adolescents only; and (e) that Chinese national identity was positively associated with intergroup attitudes for the Yi and Han adolescents and for the Mongolian middle school students, but not for the Mongolian high school students. This suggests that age and context play central roles in shaping the ethnic and national identities of adolescents in such regions, and those who grow up in an inclusive environment are more likely to develop positive intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Shifting attitudes towards native speaker and local English teachers: an elaborative replication
AN  - 2630414131
AB  - Students’ attitudes towards native English speaking teachers (NESTs) and local English teachers has been a fertile area of research for many years, but the commonly used surveys focusing on students’ explicit attitudes have been criticised because of the influence of prejudice. An alternative is to use social psychology instruments such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to investigate both explicit and implicit attitudes as in Watson Todd and Pojanapunya (2009. “Implicit Attitudes Towards Native and Non-native Speaker Teachers.” System 37: 23–33. doi:10.1016/j.system.2008.08.002). This article is a direct replication of Watson Todd and Pojanapunya (2009), but, because the sociolinguistic context in Thailand has changed with greater use of English as a lingua franca (ELF) since the original study, we aim to look for differences between the findings of the original study and those of the current study rather than confirm the original, a process we term elaborative replication. Using an IAT with 439 Thai university students, the results show that, in contrast to our expectations, students’ implicit and explicit attitudes towards NESTs have become more positive in the ten years since the original study, a finding that casts doubt on the wider social impact of the ELF movement.

T1  - Development of a Scale of Prejudice toward Bisexual and Transgender Individuals on the Basis of Ambiguity Intolerance
AN  - 2662236777
AB  - Prejudice toward bisexual and transgender individuals is motivated in part by unique (yet similar) negative stereotypes and cognitive rigidity (Huffaker & Kwon, 2016). The current research aimed to create a scale to measure bisexual and transgender prejudice on the basis of two aspects of cognitive rigidity—ambiguity intolerance and essentialist beliefs. In Study 1, scale items were generated from open-ended responses. Study two quantitively tested these items with exploratory factor analyses. In Study 3, we cross-validated our new scale with existing scales of bisexual and transgender prejudice. In Study 4, we cross-validated our scale with a measure of intolerance of ambiguity and a measure of essentialist beliefs. Future research will benefit by developing prejudice reduction strategies that specifically target those who have higher ambiguity intolerance and essentialist beliefs about bisexual and transgender individuals.

T1  - Urban Space and Social Cognition: The Effect of Urban Space on Intergroup Perceptions
AN  - 2614689595
AB  - Cities and neighborhoods are key sites of migration-related diversity. Differences in lifestyle, class, ethnicity, or religion become visible in urban spaces, such as neighborhood bars, shops, or cafes. This article applies a social cognitive approach to explore how urban spaces shape the relationship between ethnic encounters and intergroup perceptions. Theoretical work on urbanism suggests that public and private spaces have different effects on people’s perceptions of group interdependence and relative group status. This article contributes to the ongoing debate between conflict and contact schools of thought by defining how contextual conditions promote ethnic diversity’s positive or negative effects on intergroup perceptions.

T1  - Nationalism and the Representation of National Sport Heroes in 1990s South Korea *
AN  - 2602103765
AB  - This article analyses the changing representations of three South Korean sport celebrities and explores how this reflects a transition in the dominant form of nationalism in South Korea during the 1990s. Hwang Young-cho, who took gold in the marathon at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, was considered a "born" hero, and the South Korean media attributed his physical gifts, habits, and background to the excellence of the Korean ethnic nation. We consider this in relation to the concept of ethnic nationalism, which emphasizes shared lineage, language, and history. Representations of baseball player Chan Ho Park and golfer Pak Se-ri focussed on their levels of "effort." They were presented as exemplars of the virtues required in competitive international markets. We argue that the new manner in which these two national sport heroes were represented in the 1990s reflects the movement of South Korean nationalist discourse away from ethnic nationalism and towards market nationalism.

T1  - The effects of activating a “baby brain” stereotype on pregnant women’s cognitive functioning
AN  - 2559690626
AB  - Throughout pregnancy and into the immediate postpartum period, women are generally perceived to be incompetent, stressed, and forgetful. However, the neuropsychological “baby brain” literature remains unclear and contradictory. Across two studies, we provide the first experimental tests of whether perceived cognitive impairment in pregnancy can be explained by stereotype threat theory, which proposes that awareness of negative stereotypes about one’s ingroup can harm performance. In Study 1 (N = 364), we tested stereotype threat effects in a 2 (stereotype threat versus no threat) × 3 (pregnant women versus new mothers versus never‐pregnant female control) design. We observed a main effect of group on memory performance (pregnant women and new mothers performed worse than controls), but no other main or interactive effects. Study 2 (N = 409) aimed to extend these research questions with mathematics ability, memory, and attention as the dependent variables. Again, we found that a stereotype threat manipulation did not impair pregnant women and new mothers’ cognitive performance, nor was there any interactive effects. Groups also did not differ in their performance. We discuss these results in the context of stereotype threat mechanisms, calling into question whether a stereotype threat paradigm can be applied effectively to pregnancy‐related stereotypes. This work has implications for the advancement of stereotype threat as a theory and contributes to the reappraisal of the utility of stereotype threat as a way of understanding how stereotypes affect performance.

T1  - Good Housekeeping, Great Expectations: Gender and Housework Norms
AN  - 2555592985
AB  - Gender remains a key predictor of housework in modern society. However, previous studies have been relatively limited in their ability to adjudicate between possible mechanisms operating at the individual and social-interactional level that may cause this relationship. To address this gap, we employ a novel experimental design in which respondents view and evaluate photos of a relatively clean or messy room, which is ostensibly occupied by either a man or a woman. We find that men and women respondents do not differ in their perceptions of how messy a room is or how urgent it is to clean it up. In contrast, the gender of the room occupant has strong and significant effects on housework perceptions, moral judgments, perceived social consequences, and allocations of responsibility. Notably, when a relatively clean room is evaluated, female room occupants are held to higher standards of cleanliness, are believed to suffer more negative social consequences when they do not meet those standards, and are generally deemed more responsible for housework across a variety of work–family arrangements than their male counterparts. However, when a messy room is evaluated, gender effects are smaller and less systematic, in part because messiness activates negative stereotypes about men. Overall, findings underscore and refine the theory that gendered beliefs and accountability practices are a root cause of gendered behavior in the household.

T1  - “That’s Not What I Heard!”: Adolescent Internalizing, Negative Perceptions of Maternal Communication, and Felt Shame and Guilt
AN  - 2549834497
AB  - Adolescents with internalizing problems are more prone to feelings of guilt and shame, experience more guilt-induction, and report more negative parenting, but little is known about the way these processes are associated nor the extent to which they occur within real-time parent-adolescent interactions. The current study sought to clarify these links by investigating whether negatively biased perceptions of maternal communication mediate links between adolescent internalizing symptoms and their feelings of guilt, shame, and guilt-induction during real-time mother-adolescent discussions. One hundred twenty-three mother-adolescent dyads participated in the study. These dyads were moderately diverse in both race/ethnicity (53% White, 29% Black, 12% Hispanic) and family income (26% earned less than $30,000/year, 22% earned more than $100,000/year) and included adolescents who ranged in age from 12 to 17 (Mage = 13.99) and were approximately half female (54%). Mothers and adolescents engaged in lab discussions about issues of conflict and guilt and rated mothers’ positive and negative communication during the tasks; observers rated these same behaviors. Adolescents also reported on their general internalizing symptoms prior to the discussions and feelings of guilt, shame, and experienced guilt induction following each discussion task. Structural equation models, parceling out shared and unique perceptions of maternal communication behaviors, showed that adolescents with more internalizing symptoms reported greater feelings of shame and perceived maternal guilt-induction following the discussion, and that these associations were mediated by adolescents’ unique perceptions of more maternal negativity. These findings highlight the potential role of cognitive biases in perpetuating established associations among adolescent internalizing symptoms, shame, and parental guilt-induction.

T1  - The Precarious Project and the Wasted Opportunity: The Social and Cultural Dynamics of Conflict over Urban Development
AN  - 2539849295
AB  - Much of the research on residents’ responses to urban development projects focuses on their self-interests, specifically economic position or quality of life. We know comparatively little about how social and cultural factors help influence and explain these behaviors, especially under conditions of gentrification. Based on an analysis of people’s reactions toward a development project in Newburgh, New York, an impoverished small city experiencing gentrification, this article reveals the importance of framing for understanding how and why groups support and oppose controversial projects. Although residents largely vary in their stance along lines of social class and race/ethnicity, their perspectives are intertwined with their perceptions of the city either as a place of mistreatment and a collective memory of local injustices (supporters), or as a place of opportunity and a local identity as place entrepreneurs (opponents). This article reveals new explanations for the complex dynamics behind residents’ reactions to urban growth initiatives.

T1  - Behind the makeup: The effects of cosmetics on women's self‐objectification, and their objectification by others
AN  - 2610172415
AB  - Does wearing makeup benefit women by changing how they perceive themselves, and are the perceptions that others make of makeup wearers positive, or negative? In two pre‐registered experiments, we investigated the effects of makeup on women's self‐perceived traits, and others’ objectifying perceptions of them. In Experiment 1, 229 women imagined one of four scenarios (e.g., a romantic date). Half applied makeup for that scenario before rating their self‐perceived agency, humanness, romantic competitiveness towards other women and reactions to partner jealousy. Results showed little evidence that applying makeup affected women's self‐perceived traits. In Experiment 2, 844 participants rated images of women's faces from Experiment 1 on their mental capacity and moral status. Women wearing more makeup were attributed less mental capacity and moral status, with attributions mediated by perceptions that heavier makeup‐wearers have more sex and are more physically attractive. Findings suggest that although women experience cultural pressure to wear makeup, negative stereotypes of makeup‐wearers may lead to detrimental perceptions of women.

T1  - A process of healing for the Labrador Innu: Improving health and wellbeing in the context of historical and contemporary colonialism
AN  - 2569413054
AB  - In light of the negative effects of historical and contemporary colonialism on the Labrador Innu, healing initiatives grounded in self-determination, renewal of cultural practices, and non-reliance on Western bio-medicine, are known, taught and widely practiced among the Innu. The value of Indigenous healing practices in the treatment of Indigenous people is well-recognized in Indigenous wellness literature, yet non-Indigenous health practitioners know little about healing processes. Moreover, to our knowledge, no studies have examined any contemporary Labrador Innu healing process. The main aim of this paper is to describe the process of healing among the Innu. Although there may be multiple processes of healing, we shed light on a major process that emerged from interviews and focus groups with 39 participants. Five stages of healing were described: being "under the blanket"; finding spiritual strength; extending hands out; finding strength and power; and helping others. Findings highlighted enablement of healing through spiritualities, support from Elders, return to culture, and resistance to negative stereotypes. We provide health professionals with valuable information for considering Innu healing as a model that expands their views for the benefit of Innu seeking mental health services. Implications for non-Innu health and social service providers are about broadening their understanding of the significant role of self-determination among Innu, learning Innu ways-of-knowing and being, recognizing one's own biases, and acknowledging the power imbalances between themselves and Innu people.

T1  - The influence of in-group and out-group favouritism on the disciplinary practice of ethnic majority and minority preservice teachers
AN  - 2548900144
AB  - Teacher judgments and the disciplinary sanctioning of pupils can be understood as a function of the ethnic match, which means whether or not teachers and pupils have the same ethnic background. According to social identity theory, teachers should be motivated to protect positive self-esteem and therefore favour pupils of their ethnic in-group over pupils of their ethnic out-group. Following system justification theory however, it must be assumed that teachers also base their judgments and their disciplinary behaviour on the acceptance of social hierarchies. According to this theory, ethnic minority teachers should therefore favour ethnic majority pupils over ethnic minority pupils. We test these hypotheses by conducting an experimental study among 196 preservice teachers. The results suggest that ethnic majority participants do not discriminate against ethnic minority pupils. However, although ethnic minority participants seem to explicitly favour their in-group, they also implicitly tend to have more negative stereotypes about them. Moreover, the more negative explicit and implicit stereotypes ethnic minority participants have against pupils of their in-group, the more severely they punish pupils of their out-group. This could suggest that ethnic minority participants felt the desire to compensate for a negative view of their in-group by treating their out-group more harshly.

T1  - Race, police, and the pandemic: considering the role of race in public health policing
AN  - 2492799969
AB  - As cities and states implement social distancing guidelines to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, one concern is that the social construction of race, and the privileges inherent to those constructions, influence how and when to enforce social distancing. In this theoretical paper, we discuss why Black people may be at a greater risk for police intervention when not abiding by public health guidelines. We also describe the importance of considering how Whiteness, in addition to anti-Blackness, may influence how and when public health guidelines are enforced. Finally, we consider how disparate public health policing related to COVID-19 is situated in a broader historical and global context.

T1  - Presumed Mexican Until Proven Otherwise: Identity Work and Intersectional Typicality among Middle-Class Dominican and Mexican Immigrants
AN  - 2493525035
AB  - Non-Latino natives often conflate "Latino" with "Mexican," treating Mexican as a stigmatized group. Latinos often engage in "identity work" to neutralize this stigmatized identity. We link these micro processes of identity work with macro structures of stratification through "intersectional typicality." We argue that the selection of which positive traits immigrants highlight to avoid stigma is systematic and tied to intersecting dimensions of race and class stratification at the macro level. We argue that this process is context-specific. We use the case of middle-class Dominicans and Mexicans living in Atlanta. Our findings show that both groups perceive that the pervasive image of the typical Latino in Atlanta is that of a working-class Mexican. While both groups perceive this image to be low-status, they diverge in their strategies for countering this presumption. Mexicans emphasize their middle-class status and often try to change the typical image of Latinos. Dominicans emphasize that they are not Mexican and highlight their atypicality. Interview data show that Dominicans are concerned about the Mexican label because of embedded working-class assumptions. We argue that although many respondents successfully avoid negative stereotyping, their identity work actually reaffirms the low-status meaning of the typical Latino category.

T1  - Models of interethnic relations management in a multicultural society in the context of social consequences of globalization
TT  - Models of interethnic relations management
AN  - 2533974126
AB  - PurposeThe goal of this paper is associated with the study of global processes which change the world order and are accompanied with the aggravation of economic competition and geopolitical confrontation, which cause large-scale migration, radicalization of ethnicity and the rise of ethnic separatism. These processes contribute to the aggravation of interethnic antagonisms in multicultural countries and regions; therefore, it is necessary to search for adequate models of interethnic relations management in a multicultural society.Design/methodology/approachThe methodological foundation of this research consists in activity, civilization, and transformation approaches, which allow understanding the specificity of global processes, the causes of the actualization of ethnic factor in the modern world and the search for new methods of interethnic relations management.FindingsThis paper presents an overview of models of interethnic relations management established in the western countries in the second half of the 20th century. The authors identify specific features of the assimilation and multiculturalism models for managing ethnic differences, their methods of regulation of interethnic relations in a multicultural environment. Their potential in solving the issues of adaptation of migrants and their integration in political and cultural space of the host society in the face of new global challenges and threats is assessed.Originality/valueThe authors of the paper justify the need for a new model of interethnic relations management which is able to forecast the global development trends and adequately respond to negative consequences of global processes.

T1  - ‘Cartographies of struggle’: remapping the plight of Bengali women in/after the 1971 war in Kamila Shamsie’s <i>Kartography</i>
AN  - 2467548068
AB  - Ethnic conflict influences the lives of people beyond geopolitical boundaries. In the last two decades, literature from Bangladesh and India has produced narratives of the women who experienced the 1971 war of Bangladesh. Few works have portrayed the stories of Bengali women who migrated to Pakistan after partition to escape their economic struggles and social stigmas. Kamila Shamsie, in her novel Kartography, portrays the lives of people in Karachi amidst the 1971 ethnic struggle between Bengalis and Pakistanis as well as the 1980s ethnic struggle between Pathans and Muhajirs. The novel exemplifies how women become vulnerable targets in any ethnic conflict even if they do not have direct involvement in it. Shamsie’s novel shows that women form cartography contingent upon their narratives of struggle because mapping their existence might not correlate with the political map of a nation. This paper discusses Shamsie’s approach to elaborating on how the lives of women were affected by the 1971 war, connecting them in a single map beyond political lines.

T1  - COVID-19 and Ageism: How Positive and Negative Responses Impact Older Adults and Society
AN  - 2453785396
AB  - The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults' mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies.

T1  - Israeli and Polish Policies toward Returning Residents as a Reflection of Nationhood
AN  - 2447002263
AB  - This study focuses on Poland and Israel, both commonly classified as ethnic nation‐states, and aims to question the expression of ethnic–civic dichotomy in return‐migration policies. Policy documents in each country were analysed and complemented by interviews with policymakers and representatives from relevant organizations. Our analysis reveals that, although there are differences in their policies toward returning residents and in the related programmes in both countries, Israeli and Polish policies include both ethnic and civic components. Therefore, our study supports Joppke's (2005) argument that there is no purely civic or ethnic nationalism and there can be no purely civic or ethnic nation. We show that the proportion of ethnic and civic elements may change over time; thus, our findings contribute to the growing literature pointing to the dynamic nature of nationalism.

T1  - Stakeholders, Primary Health Care and Dispersed Rurality
AN  - 2476167537
AB  - Objective To characterize the existing tensions between actors which condition the implementation of the renewed primary healthcare (PHC), in the context of the most recent Colombian post-conflict years, in the territories of high rurality of the Pacific Coast. Methods We performed a qualitative study based on action research methodology with a critical and reflexive analysis of the social and institutional actors in the implementation of the Renewed PHC model in dispersed rural areas (Afro-Colombian and indigenous) the Pacific coast. We analyzed the different interested parties and the concordance between the community and institutional actors. Results The level of implementation of the Renewed PHC in high rurality territories of the Colombian Pacific Coast, intersects with tensions arising from the armed conflict, that affect sustainability and governance of the territory, and the intercultural tensions between the national health model in Colombia and the communities' social representations of their own health and development. Only 25% of the Renewed PHC elements are present, under low or medium conditions. Analysis of actors -Stakeholders-, according to their nature, level of presence, and power in the area indicates the absence of the Colombian government in these territories. Members of the community and their health resources constitute 48% of the Renewed PHC parties. Conclusions Limited understanding of the ethnic logics on health and development stands out as the main tension among actors to advance with the implementation of the Renewed PHC in post-conflict territories with high rurality. The national health model has a low capacity to accurately address health priorities from the Afro-descendant and Indigenous communities occupying such territories, with a differentiated, intercultural offer that would be able to act integrally on the dynamics of the illegal economy (illegal mining and illicit crops), which can seriously compromise their food security. Key messages    Only 25% of the components of the renewed PHC are present in the territories with high dispersed rurality.   In the post-conflict period, there are still tensions between community actors and stakeholders (Institutions).

T1  - TRENDS: Economic Interests Cause Elected Officials to Liberalize Their Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2435149687
AB  - Do attitudes of elected officials toward racial issues change when the issues are portrayed as economic? Traditionally, scholars have presented Confederate symbols as primarily a racial issue: elites supporting their eradication from public life tend to emphasize the association of Confederate symbols with slavery and institutionalized racism, while those elected officials who oppose the removal of Confederate symbols often cite the heritage of white southerners. In addition to these racial explanations, we argue that there is an economic component underlying support for removal of Confederate symbols among political elites. Racial issues can also be economic issues, and framing a racial issue as an economic issue can change elite attitudes. In the case of removal of Confederate symbols, the presence of such imagery is considered harmful to business. Two survey experiments of elected officials in eleven U.S. southern states show that framing the decision to remove Confederate symbols as good for business causes those elected officials to favor removing the Confederate flag from public spaces. Elected officials can be susceptible to framing, just like regular citizens.

T1  - Who is most influential? Adolescents’ intergroup attitudes and peer influence within a social network: GPIR
AN  - 2429520720
AB  - Research has shown that adolescents’ intergroup attitudes are subject to friends’ influence, but it remains unknown if certain friends are more influential than others. Popular adolescents may be especially influential of their friends’ intergroup attitudes because they can set peer norms. We examined several indicators of popularity in social networks as possible determinants of social influence: sociometric popularity, prestige popularity, being a clique leader, and frequency of contact with friends. Longitudinal analysis of adolescents’ friendship networks (12–13 years, N = 837) allowed estimating influence of friends on adolescents’ intergroup attitudes, while controlling for the tendency of adolescents to befriend peers with similar intergroup attitudes. Results showed that adolescents’ intergroup attitudes changed in the direction of friends’ intergroup attitudes. Only peers who are popular in terms of having many friends (sociometric popular) were especially influential of their friends’ intergroup attitudes. These findings may inform future interventions aiming to reduce prejudice.

T1  - Agenda Seeding: How 1960s Black Protests Moved Elites, Public Opinion and Voting
AN  - 2428029988
AB  - How do stigmatized minorities advance agendas when confronted with hostile majorities? Elite theories of influence posit marginal groups exert little power. I propose the concept of agenda seeding to describe how activists use methods like disruption to capture the attention of media and overcome political asymmetries. Further, I hypothesize protest tactics influence how news organizations frame demands. Evaluating black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, I find nonviolent activism, particularly when met with state or vigilante repression, drove media coverage, framing, congressional speech, and public opinion on civil rights. Counties proximate to nonviolent protests saw presidential Democratic vote share increase 1.6–2.5%. Protester-initiated violence, by contrast, helped move news agendas, frames, elite discourse, and public concern toward “social control.” In 1968, using rainfall as an instrument, I find violent protests likely caused a 1.5–7.9% shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election. Elites may dominate political communication but hold no monopoly.

T1  - Beyond Response and Representation: Muslim Australian Women Reimagining Anti-Islamophobia Politics
AN  - 2447582990
AB  - This article argues that Muslim Australian women are refusing the expectations of both state and religious leadership around how to respond to Islamophobia in Australia. In the wake of policies and rhetoric that disproportionately discriminate against Muslims, local government has partnered with Islamic Australian religious organizations to create initiatives that aim to both publicly show that Muslims are not threats to the social fabric and to reform attitudes within communities around gender equality and family life. Muslim women are seen as key to these emergent partnerships; they are often called upon to change public representations about Islam and to take a lead role in internally reforming their community's attitudes about gender and family. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Melbourne, I examine how one collective of Muslim Australian women has resisted these expectations, through enacting an anti-Islamophobia politics that refuses to replace negative stereotypes of Muslims with positive ones, or to speak for all Muslim Australians. Rather, they situate Islamophobia as a lens to understand how Australian assimilationist projects serve the settler colonial national imaginary. In the process, they reveal Islamophobia as not only a problem of the misrepresentation of Muslims, but as an ongoing legacy of Australian settler colonialism. Their work offers a political alternative for thinking about what an inclusive anti-Islamophobia politics could look like in contemporary Australia.

T1  - Stereotypes as Historical Accidents: Images of Social Class in Postcommunist Versus Capitalist Societies
AN  - 2401736036
AB  - Stereotypes are ideological and justify the existing social structure. Although stereotypes persist, they can change when the context changes. Communism’s rise in Eastern Europe and Asia in the 20th century provides a natural experiment examining social-structural effects on social class stereotypes. Nine samples from postcommunist countries (N = 2,241), compared with 38 capitalist countries (N = 4,344), support the historical, sociocultural rootedness of stereotypes. More positive stereotypes of the working class appear in postcommunist countries, both compared with other social groups in the country and compared with working-class stereotypes in capitalist countries; postcommunist countries also show more negative stereotypes of the upper class. We further explore whether communism’s ideological legacy reflects how societies infer groups’ stereotypic competence and warmth from structural status and competition. Postcommunist societies show weaker status–competence relations and stronger (negative) competition–warmth relations; respectively, the lower meritocratic beliefs and higher priority of embeddedness as ideological legacies may shape these relationships.

T1  - Mechanisms for hiring discrimination of immigrant applicants in the United States
TT  - Immigrant applicants in the United States
AN  - 2399060354
AB  - PurposeFew studies examine how hiring discrimination can be an antecedent to the labor exploitation of immigrant workers. The main purpose of this paper is to advance the theoretical understanding of how the intersectionality of race and immigrant status affects differential hiring treatment, and how it affects job offers, job acceptance and hiring decision outcomes for immigrant job seekers.Design/methodology/approachThe paper draws from theories on status and intersectionality, and literature on immigration labor and racial hierarchy, addressing the unequal power relations that underlie race and immigration status affecting the hiring process, to advance critical understandings of why immigrant job seekers accept positions where they may be exploited.FindingsThis paper provides a conceptual model to critically synthesize the complexity between race and immigrant status, and their effect on the experience of immigrant job seekers differently. Exploitation opportunism is introduced to better understand the mechanisms of hiring discrimination among immigrant job seekers to include the role of race, immigrant status, economic motivations and unequal power relations on the hiring process.Practical implicationsThe framework for exploitation opportunism will help employers improve the quality and fairness of their hiring methods, and empower immigrant job seekers to not allow themselves to accept subpar job offers which can lead to exploitation.Originality/valueThe paper provides an original analysis of immigrant job seekers' experience of the hiring process that reveals the intragroup differences among immigrants based on race and status, and the decision-making mechanisms that hiring managers and immigrant job seekers use to evaluate job offers and job acceptance.

T1  - Immigration and political distrust in Europe: a comparative longitudinal study
AN  - 2383465384
AB  - European countries have witnessed a steady rise of political distrust over the past decades, which coincides with the rise of mass immigration. Building on existing research regarding anti-immigration attitudes and political trust, this study presents two possible theoretical mechanisms through which actual immigration trends could generate political distrust in host societies: either through cultural change or through negative evaluations of institutional performance. To empirically test these, I employ a multi-level comparative longitudinal research design using micro-attitudinal data from the European Social Survey for 17 European countries (2002–16). The results do not find support for the cultural hypothesis, as there is no evidence of an overall relationship between growth in foreign populations and citizen distrust in political institutions. However, there is support for the institutional performance hypothesis, whereby growth in foreign populations is associated with higher political distrust amongst individuals who have anti-immigration attitudes. The implication of these findings is that mass immigration is not the central cause of the decline of political trust Europe, however, it may have been a factor in the growing distrust amongst a relatively small sub-group of citizens.

T1  - How Discrimination and Bias Shape Outcomes
AN  - 2434475919
AB  - In this article, economists Kevin Lang and Ariella Kahn-Lang Spitzer take up the expansive issue of discrimination, examining specifically how discrimination and bias shape people's outcomes. The authors focus primarily on discrimination by race, while acknowledging that discrimination exists along many other dimensions as well, including gender, sexual orientation, religion, and ethnicity. They describe evidence of substantial racial disparities in the labor market, education, criminal justice, health, and housing, and they show that in each of these domains, such disparities at least partially reflect discrimination.Lang and Kahn-Lang Spitzer note that the disparities we see are both causes and results of discrimination, and that they reinforce each other. For instance, harsher treatment from the criminal justice system makes it more difficult for black people to get good jobs, which makes it more likely they'll live in poor neighborhoods and that their children will attend inferior schools.The authors argue that simply prohibiting discrimination isn't effective, partly because it's hard to prevent discrimination along dimensions that are correlated with race. Rather, they write, policies are more likely to be successful if they aim to eliminate the statistical association between race and many other social and economic characteristics and to decrease the social distance between people of different races.

T1  - Hansuli Banker Upakatha in the context of literary geographic study
AN  - 2176096508
AB  - Bengali regional novelist Tarashankar Bandopadhyay is known as the artist of rural Bengal. In almost all the novels, he wanted to depict the spirit of place, the nature of landscape, the conflict between traditional and modern way of life and livelihood processes of people in the Rarh region. His works form an excellent resource base to provide an authentic and indispensable source of human experience of place for reconstructing the region in a specific time frame. The novel Hansuli Banker Upakatha not only provides the source of knowledge of a particular place and community to the geographers, but also reflects the underlying social structure, individual experience of the members of the community, cultural values, social stigma, ethnic identity crisis, landscape of a community based society genuinely and scientifically from the perspective of a writer. This article examines Hansuli Banker Upakatha-the river-based Bengali novel in order to explain a servile community’s sense of place, territorial consciousness and ethno-cultural particularities, the causes and ultimate consequences of radical change and perils of their community culture through the lens of a novelist. Besides, I have argued that it is essential for the geographers to explore further links between texts and geography to assess the real image of place, people, culture and landscape.

T1  - Polygynous Neighbors, Excess Men, and Intergroup Conflict in Rural Africa
AN  - 2351411539
AB  - We argue that polygyny creates a social imbalance where few, economically well-off men marry many wives and many poor men marry late or never. By definition, polygyny produces what we refer to as “excess men.” In order to gain material wealth, excess men are likely to raid, plunder, and rob neighboring ethnic groups. We test this hypothesis with georeferenced data on polygyny and intergroup conflict in rural Africa and find strong support. Drawing on Afrobarometer survey data, we explore the underlying mechanisms and find that young men who belong to polygynous groups feel that they are treated more unequally and are readier to use violence in comparison to those belonging to monogamous groups. Our article makes an important contribution to the peace, conflict, and development literature by emphasizing a fundamental aspect of human life: marriage and family.

T1  - Chapter 7: "I had to get tougher": An African Immigrant's (Counter)narrative of Language, Race, and Resistance
AN  - 2507952304
AB  - Background/Context: With the incessant wave of anti-Black and anti-immigrant sentiments, the extant political situation in the contemporary United States presents an ideal space, place, and time to investigate Black immigrant students' experiences and examine the ways in which dominant racial and linguistic ideologies shape their literate identities and position them in schools and society. While the Black immigrant population overall continues to increase, the Black immigrant student population in United States K–12 schools has experienced a steady upward trend. This student population shares some of the racialized experiences of Black American students but also reflects distinctive cultural, linguistic, and literate identities, and experiences that we, as educators, must acknowledge and embrace if we are to help them effectively navigate the educational and social terrain of the U.S. Purpose/Research Questions: The purpose of this article is to amplify (counter)narratives that highlight one adolescent African immigrant's (Noemi) identities and languages within and beyond school spaces, to exemplify the ways in which she utilizes alternative literacies to accommodate, and/or resist racial and immigration status-based microaggressions. The study was guided by the following questions: 1) What are Noemi's literacy, language, and identity practices in and beyond school spaces? 2) What are the ways in which she utilizes these practices to resist stereotypes and other forms of marginalization? Research Design: Utilizing a narrative case study approach, the article highlights the lived experiences of a single participant - Noemi. Narrative case study allowed me to intentionally give life to Noemi's stories regarding her home and school experiences, the ways in which she has been positioned due to her unique identity, language, and literacy practices, and her methods of resistance. Data Collection and Analysis: Data sources included two semistructured interviews and a Venn diagram that consisted of a comparison of the focal participant's home and school literacies. A relational content analysis was conducted using the information provided in the Venn diagram, and interview data were transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Critical race theory, a raciolinguistic perspective, and resistance theory were considered in the analysis and framing of the resulting counternarratives. Findings/Results: Noemi's counternarratives were characterized by three emergent themes: (a) being raised African in America, (b) racial literacies, music, and social media, and (c) race, language, and the sociopolitical climate. Each of the themes and their corresponding subthemes were supported by elements of critical race theory and a raciolinguistic perspective. In addition, Noemi's counternarratives consisted of numerous "clapbacks" (effective responses to criticisms, stereotypes, and dominant ideologies) that served as indicators of resistance. Conclusions/Recommendations: Noemi's counternarratives suggest three acknowledgments to be made. First, educators must acknowledge identity practices beyond those seen in academic spaces and tap into the vast metaknowledge of their immigrant populations. Second, we must not lose sight that dominant, hegemonic messages with regard to languages, literacies, and cultures are not only produced by the dominant group, but that they are also (re)produced by the media and nonwhite people to marginalize and maintain structural hierarchies. Therefore, critical conversations are needed with native nonwhite groups to prevent discriminatory practices and maltreatment of immigrant students. Finally, if we are to create equitable and socially just academic environments, educators must acknowledge manifestations of resistance (in its many forms) and use this knowledge to help transform schooling environments in which immigrants, like Noemi, are expected to thrive. They must also identify the ways in which they function as part of institutional norms, to create situations that require students to leverage "clapbacks" in schools.

T1  - <i>TRENDS:</i> Racial Resentment and Public Opinion across the Racial Divide
AN  - 2315489931
AB  - Research on racial resentment has been meticulously developed, tested, and analyzed with white Americans in mind—yet black Americans have also responded to this battery for the past three decades. To date, little to nothing is known about the implications of responses to the racial resentment battery among black Americans. A burgeoning literature on blacks’ intragroup attitudes suggests that over time, black Americans have increasingly attributed racial inequality to individual failings as opposed to structural forces. As such, unpacking blacks’ responses to the canonical racial resentment battery may provide further insight into the micro-foundations of black public opinion. Using survey data from 1986 to 2016, we engage in a systematic quantitative examination of the role of racial resentment in predicting black and white Americans’ opinions on racial policies, “race-coded” policies, and nonracialized policies. Along the way, we highlight the existence of wide heterogeneity among black respondents and call for further investigation that identifies similarities and differences in the foundations of white and black public opinion.

T1  - Imagining London: The role of the geographical imagination in migrant subjectivity and decision‐making
AN  - 2312167148
AB  - This article employs a qualitative, biographical approach, to explore the motivations and subjectivities behind migration of middle‐class Brazilians to London. It uses the concept of the geographical imagination to understand how migrants imagine not only their destinations and places of origin but also how their own identity is shaped by their imagined relationship to these places. The paper argues that for many middle‐class Brazilians, their motivation to migrate is couched in terms of “societal alienation”: a feeling of distance from the place of origin resulting from a lack of identification and trust in its institutions and the very culture of the place itself. This is in contrast to the more popularly understood concept of migrating due to “material alienation”: migrating to access a higher level of material consumption or to acquire financial capital to use “back home.” For those who migrate due to “societal alienation” what is “fetishised” is the cultural and less material aspects of the ‘quality of life’ of the migration destination, which become a kind of commodity in their own right. It argues that social class which often intersects with regional and racial divisions within Brazilian society, is a key marker of difference in these two types of imaginary.

T1  - Crossing of a different kind
AN  - 2338900616
AB  - This study of language crossing moves away from the scenes of multi-ethnic heteroglossia that have dominated the research, and turns instead to a setting affected by major conflict where the language of the traditional enemy has been introduced to secondary schools as part of a reconciliation initiative. This generates a radically different view of crossing and the environment in which it emerges: schooling counts more than popular culture; inter-generational links matter as much as peer relations; and ‘technical redoing’ is a more important key for crossing than ‘make believe’, ‘contests’, or ‘ceremonials’ (Goffman 1974). With a very different profile of this kind, crossing retains and extends its significance, pointing to a sociolinguistic practice that also occurs in official sites struggling with a legacy of violence and acute division.

T1  - Shifting power and changing practice to support locally led peace building
AN  - 2333641531
AB  - The majority of the world's refugees are driven from their homes by conflict, often finding that the dynamics and underlying tensions from the conflict they are fleeing are transplanted into their new surroundings. More than half of all refugees come from three countries (Syria, Afghanistan and South Sudan), and most of the world's refugees are consistently hosted by 15 countries, the majority of whom share borders with the countries refugees are fleeing. In addition to geographic proximity, these countries often share ethnic or religious ties, as well as broader political, economic and social links. In many instances, private or political interests in the host country also have a stake in the conflict next door. In this context, development and humanitarian assistance can have an instrumental role in either effectively addressing root causes or exacerbating tensions. The concepts of Do No Harm and conflict sensitivity are often reduced to rhetorical devices.

T1  - Constructing identity through commemoration: <i>Kwibuka</i> and the rise of survivor nationalism in post-conflict Rwanda
AN  - 2338502984
AB  - In the years following Rwanda's civil war, the country has remembered those killed in the 1994 genocide with 100 days of official commemoration, known as Kwibuka. The temporary commemoration period is characterised by an explicit acknowledgement and public discussion of ethnic identity, which stands in puzzling contrast to the state's policy of ethnic non-recognition, enforced during the rest of the year in hopes of achieving national homogeneity (Ndi Umunyarwanda). Thus, one observes seemingly diametrically opposed practices of legally erasing identity groups because of their link to conflict and a unique, three month-long saturation of reminders in the form of public speeches, memorial programming and burials, and commemorative signage. A blurring of ‘Tutsi’ with ‘survivor’ and the deliberate passing down of survivor identity to Tutsi youth have created, over time, conditions for a ‘survivor nationalism’, which exacerbates social tensions and risks sustainable peace in the long term.

T1  - Food Transition and Oral Health in Two Brazilian Indigenous Peoples: A Grounded Theory Model
AN  - 2283206283
AB  - As a result of colonialism and globalization, many Indigenous groups have transitioned towards a Westernized diet, with significant implications for food security and oral health. This study investigated the experiences of the Kaingang and Guarani Indigenous peoples from the South of Brazil regarding the effects of cultural changes on their food systems and oral status. Focus groups were conducted in each tribe and the methodological framework grounded theory was adopted. The development of categories occurred with reference to Pierre Bourdieu's work. Four themes emerged from the analysis: 1. Contemporary Indigenous identities; 2. Perceptions of food systems; 3. Shared knowledge in the orientation of differentiated assistance in oral health; and 4. Ethnic cultural capital in conflict. The food transition is represented as a form of cultural discontinuity, whereas the ability to redefine identity boundaries contributes to promote food security and oral health.

T1  - Beyond faith: social marginalisation and the prevention of radicalisation among young Muslim Australians
AN  - 2216051029
AB  - Counterterrorism responses in Australia have mirrored trends in other nations with a focus on pre-emption, including the criminalisation of activities defined as preparatory offences. Security-based transnational approaches to combat terrorist activity and propaganda alone are ineffective. Sometimes security measures can actually damage efforts to counter the appeal and take-up of violent extremism. While such measures should be used in domestic contexts where threats are critical or imminent, robust soft power initiatives are needed. Even though governments recognise the importance of soft power approaches, public discourse and commentary frequently reproduces negative stereotypes of young Muslim people linking them, through their religion, in negative ways to radicalisation and terrorism. This article describes empirical research investigating the impact of such discourses on the lives of young Muslim Australians. It demonstrates how dominant public discourse and counter-narratives add to feelings of marginalisation, even in those who are well integrated into Australian society. It argues that such social marginalisation contributes to the conditions of possibility for radicalisation and concludes by discussing some of the ways that young Muslim Australians maintain resilience in an environment that could easily be perceived as increasingly hostile and divisive.

T1  - Prime and prejudice: Brief stereotypical media representations can increase prejudicial attitudes and behaviour towards people with schizophrenia
AN  - 2229167850
AB  - Prejudice against people with mental illnesses remains a significant problem in the United Kingdom and in many other countries despite sustained efforts by governments and charities. This is particularly so for people with schizophrenia, who are seen as dangerous and unpredictable. The present study investigated the effect of brief, casual, stereotypical representations on prejudice and behavioural intentions towards people with schizophrenia. Participants viewed Halloween costumes in an online environment under the guise of product research. In the experimental condition, they were exposed to a “Psycho Ward” Halloween outfit identical to one sold online by a leading supermarket chain in the United Kingdom. Participants in the control condition saw a neutral “pumpkin” Halloween costume. Exposure to the Psycho Ward outfit resulted in more negative behavioural intentions towards people with schizophrenia, mediated by increased prejudice. These findings confirm and extend earlier research that implicates adverse media stereotypes in the persistence of prejudice against people with mental illness. More research is warranted on the relative effects of different influences on community attitudes to mental illness.

T1  - Are the Parents All Right? Parental Stress, Ethnic Culture and Intergenerational Relations in Aging Families
AN  - 2384331711
AB  - Rapid population aging and high rates of immigration from non-Western countries are contributing to an increasingly diverse ethnic mosaic of North American family life. Drawing upon a life course theoretical perspective synthesized with a sociocultural stress and coping model, this study examines stress among parents aged 50+ with at least one adult child aged 19–35. Data are drawn from a mixed-methods study conducted in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Interviews were conducted with 588 parents in 2015/16, and a smaller sub-set of face-to-face in-depth follow-up interviews (n = 32). Respondents self-identified with one of four ethnocultural groups: British-, Chinese-, Persian/Iranian- or South Asian-Canadian. Hierarchical OLS regression, in addition to qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze the data set. Higher parental stress was found among: Persians/Iranians, and Chinese parents (compared to British); those with greater intergenerational conflict; those with unemployed children; lower education of parents; fewer years lived in Canada; and those with lower income satisfaction. An interaction effect for Persian men compared to British females was also revealed. Overall, the findings demonstrate the salience of cultural dimensions, intergenerational relationship dynamics, and economic factors in furthering our understanding of parental stress in ethnically diverse aging families.Alternate abstract:
Le vieillissement rapide de la population et les taux élevés d’immigration en provenance de pays non occidentaux contribuent à une mosaïque ethnique de plus en plus diversifiée de la vie familiale nord-américaine. En s’appuyant sur une perspective théorique du parcours de vie synthétisée avec un modèle socioculturel de stress et d’adaptation, cette étude examine le stress parmi les parents de 50 ans et plus ayant au moins un enfant adulte âgé de 19 à 35 ans. Les données sont tirées d’une étude à méthodologie mixte menée dans la région métropolitaine de Vancouver en Colombie-Britannique au Canada. Des entretiens ont été réalisés avec 588 parents en 2015/16, en plus d’un sous-ensemble plus petit d’entrevues complémentaires approfondies en personne (n = 32). Les répondants s’identifiaient à l’un de quatre groupes ethnoculturels : Canadiens d’origine britannique, chinoise, perse/iranienne ou sud-asiatique. La régression MCO hiérarchique, en plus de l’analyse thématique qualitative, a été utilisée pour analyser l’ensemble de données. Un stress parental plus élevé a été observé parmi : les parents perses/iraniens et chinois (par rapport aux parents d’origine britannique); ceux ayant un plus grand conflit intergénérationnel; ceux ayant des enfants sans emploi; les parents moins scolarisés; ceux ayant vécu moins d’années au Canada; et ceux ayant une plus faible satisfaction par rapport au revenu. Un effet d’interaction pour les hommes perses par rapport aux femmes d’origine britannique a aussi été révélé. Dans l’ensemble, les résultats démontrent l’importance des dimensions culturelles, des dynamiques de relation intergénérationnelle et des facteurs économiques pour l’approfondissement de notre compréhension du stress parental dans les familles multiethniques vieillissantes.

T1  - Roma, Crime and Politics in Contemporary Bulgaria
AN  - 2355279298
AB  - This paper tackles the issue of "Roma crimes" in Bulgaria and, specifically, how these are used by the ethnic entrepreneurs. First, I examine trends and outline important problems related to the collection of data on these crimes. There is a lack of consensus among the experts in the field as to whether the data are reliable and credible enough to allow studying this phenomenon, particularly in a comparative perspective, and especially in the new millennium. There are significant negative stereotypes among the Bulgarians towards the Roma. Although the latter make up a small percentage of the population, they are the main recipients of social benefits, while their contribution to the state budget is negligible. In the second part of the paper, I explore several case studies. These demonstrate how and why the public's attention is focused on the criminal activities of Roma. This study also sheds light on how political parties and politicians are involved in the matter. Regardless of whether Roma "criminality" is diminishing or not, the protests that followed the events in Katunitsa in 2011 revealed that Bulgarian society is becoming less and less willing to put up with this ethnic minority's brushes with the law. In my view, the problem is not that the populist radical right-wing parties promote a zero tolerance policy toward criminals, but that these political formations are prepared to use the stain of "illegal activities" and place it as a stigma on the ethnic group as a whole. The dire conditions in the ghettoes create time bombs. In order not only to dismantle these "explosives" but to entirely prevent their (further) appearance, the Bulgarian government must urgently improve its integration strategies, policies, and measures.

T1  - Things Left Unwritten: Interview Accounts versus Institutional Texts in a Case of Detention Home Violence
AN  - 2300630942
AB  - To write about clients is an established routine in countless institutional settings, regardless of the fact that clients themselves seldom feel that the produced texts mirror or summarize their experiences. But what, more specifically, is left unwritten when staff starts typing on the keyboard to insert a piece of daily life into the computer? This article draws on data on violent events in Swedish detention homes, covering, on the one hand, interview accounts collected by ethnographic researchers and, on the other hand, formal journal reports on the “same” event written by staff. The analysis of one case exemplifies what written versions of a violent ward drama omit or transform: staff members’ “separation work” of the fighting actors and their local manufacturing of accountability, the involved actors’ conflict explanations in terms of ethnicity, gang culture, and “the first blow”, young people’s way of linking their self-control to the institution’s privilege system, and moral emotions as well as the significance of crucial details in the depicted course of events. The argument is not that staff should merely improve their routines of documenting events to really cover these or other facets of social life that are left behind at a detention home. Rather, the article attempts to explore why and in what sense institutional writing is incompatible with more informal, personal, and local accounting procedures.

T1  - Swipe Left on the Bi Guys: Examining Attitudes toward Dating and Being Sexual with Bisexual Individuals
AN  - 2190273937
AB  - Dating and maintaining romantic relationships can often be difficult for bisexual people due to binegativity and related negative stereotypes. The current study utilized an experimental design to investigate attitudes toward dating and being sexual with bisexual individuals. A convenience sample of 440 participants, including 224 heterosexual women, 120 heterosexual men, and 96 gay men was recruited to complete an online survey. Participants were shown seven cisgender male and seven cisgender female dating profiles with various sexual orientations. Participants rated each profile on measures of attractiveness and masculinity/femininity. Results indicated that heterosexual women rated bisexual men as less sexually and romantically attractive, less desirable to date and have sex with, and less masculine compared to straight men. No such differences were found for heterosexual and gay men's ratings of female and male profiles, respectively. These results support previous research findings that indicate more negative attitudes toward dating bisexual men than bisexual women. The current study also provides further understanding as to how negative attitudes influence sexual and romantic attraction to bisexual individuals. Areas for future research are discussed.

T1  - Towards an Explanation of Intercommunal Peace in Kabardino-Balkaria: Post-War Nationalities Policy and Late Soviet Society in the North Caucasus
AN  - 2081325221
AB  - This essay examines socio-economic processes during the Soviet period to help explain the causes of peace and conflict in the post-Soviet North Caucasus. It argues that the absence of an ethnically stratified social structure in Kabardino-Balkaria is one of the reasons why this republic enjoyed relative intercommunal peace and stability in the 1990s and early 2000s. By contrast, the surrounding national republics of the North Caucasus that came out of the Soviet era with socio-economic disparities along ethnic lines witnessed higher levels of intercommunal conflict. This essay looks to the understudied topic of post-World War II and late Soviet nationalities policies to explain Kabardino-Balkaria's divergent historical trajectory.

T1  - Two Countries in Crisis: Economic Inequality in the EU and Disidentification With Europe in Spain and Greece
AN  - 2058338130
AB  - European identity is currently facing important challenges. From the beginning, European identity has been related to the national identities of Member States with different economic strengths. The recent economic recession made these disparities salient across countries. In this research conducted in two countries with relative low status in the European Union (EU), we explored whether the perceived disparities in wealth between the countries of the EU—perceived economic inequality—predicted disidentification with Europe. We also examined the mediators of this relationship. Study 1, conducted in Spain, revealed that perceived economic inequality positively predicted disidentification with Europe; importantly, this effect remained when controlling for individuals’ subjective socioeconomic status and the perceived status of the country. The experience of fear of economic inequality in the EU mediated this relationship. The results of Study 1 were replicated comparing a Spanish sample (Study 2a) and a Greek sample (Study 2b). These studies delved deeper into the specific appraisals of fear that mediate the relationship between economic inequality and disidentification with Europe. Four categories of fear appraisals obtained in a preliminary qualitative study were measured as potential mediators: losing national sovereignty, worsening of living conditions, being negatively stereotyped, and Europe losing fundamental values. The relationship between economic inequality in the EU and disidentification with Europe was mediated by fear of losing national sovereignty and fear of Europe losing fundamental values.

T1  - Examining the Role of Demographics in Campus Crime Alerts
AN  - 2043537659
AB  - Colleges and universities are required by the Clery Act to issue crime alerts to members of the campus community. Issuing agencies have significant discretion in the timing and information included in crime alerts, including the perpetrator descriptors. The inclusion of perpetrator/suspect descriptions in the crime alert is intended to maximize public safety. Race descriptors may have negative consequences through the repetition of minority suspect information. To address the issue of demographic use in crime alerts, a mixed method approach was employed. A summary review of several years of crime alerts issued by a large urban university was conducted to assess the role of demographics. Qualitative data were collected through a series of focus groups and interviews addressing the balance of public safety and potential negative perceptions (perpetuated by crime alerts). Reviewed crime alerts indicate that they are largely posted for violent crimes, particularly robbery, armed robbery, and aggravated assault. Perpetrators are overwhelmingly male and largely Black. It is reasonable to question whether repeated descriptions of crime acts committed by Black males could raise, foster, or enhance negative stereotypes. Recommendations for model crime alerts and campus events are included. Consideration of stereotype impacts may influence crime alerts but circumstances and public risk may supersede these concerns.

T1  - What predicts anti‐Roma prejudice? Qualitative and quantitative analysis of everyday sentiments about the Roma
AN  - 2051119090
AB  - The present research focused on two primary goals: (a) identifying the content of sentiments about the Roma to which Hungarians are exposed during everyday family conversations, and (b) determining which types of everyday sentiments about the Roma most strongly predict Hungarian respondents’ anti‐Roma prejudice. Content analyzing open‐ended responses from a representative sample of Hungarians (N = 505), we found that more than 76% of the respondents reported being exposed to negative stereotypes about the Roma, 27% to threats posed by Roma, and 16% to overt dehumanization of Roma; additionally more than 20% reported hearing no positive sentiments about the Roma in everyday family conversations. We then examined which negative and positive sentiments most strongly predicted respondents’ anti‐Roma prejudice (using measures of social distance and modern racism). Higher social distance scores were predicted by a lack of positive sentiments, whereas lower social distance scores were most strongly predicted by unambiguously positive sentiments expressed during family conversations. Higher modern racism scores were further predicted by sentiments expressing dehumanization, threat, and violence against Roma. Together, these results attest to the extremity of anti‐Roma sentiments expressed regularly by Hungarians, and suggest how exposure to specific sentiments may foster anti‐Roma hostility. Moreover, these findings provide guidance regarding the specific negative anti‐Roma sentiments that should be combated to enhance the effectiveness of anti‐prejudice interventions.

T1  - The impact of implicitly and explicitly primed ingroup–outgroup categorization on the evaluation of others pain: The case of the Jewish–Arab conflict
AN  - 2009236222
AB  - Despite the automaticity of affective sharing, many studies have documented the role of top-down effects, such as social categorization, on people’s empathic responses. An important question, largely ignored in previous research, concerns empathy to ingroup and outgroup members’ pain in the contexts of ongoing intergroup conflict. In the present study we examined how implicit and explicit ethnic social categorization of others affects empathy to pain in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. To meet this aim, we assessed the evaluation of pain by Jewish and Arab participants who viewed a series of visual stimuli depicting painful and non-painful familiar situations. The stimuli were associated with explicitly or implicitly primed typical names depicting ingroup, neutral outgroup, and adversary outgroup members. Results demonstrate that pain ratings in the explicit priming condition provide support for the ingroup empathy hypothesis, positing that empathy is higher for ingroup than for outgroup members for both Jews and Palestinian Arabs. Conversely, when the targets’ categories are primed implicitly, results revealed difference in empathy by the two ethnic groups where an ingroup bias was detected only for Palestinian Arabs. This suggests that the activation of ingroup bias on the subliminal implicit level among Palestinian Arab participants might be mediated by the amount of conflict permeating in their daily lives and by deeply rooted cultural values and behavioural patterns.

T1  - Can identification as Muslim increase support for reconciliation? The case of the Kurdish conflict in Turkey
AN  - 2085137859
AB  - Ethnic and national identities, as ingroup and superordinate identities, are key predictors for reconciliation, yet less research considers religious identity a superordinate identity. Focusing on the reconciliation of the Kurdish conflict in Turkey, this study aims to test a mediation model in which the relations between ethnic (i.e., Kurdish) and religious identifications (i.e., Muslim) and reconciliation outcomes were mediated by positive intergroup emotions. Moreover, to understand the diffusion of the conflict in a transnational context, this model is tested both in Turkey and Belgium among Muslim Kurdish minorities (N = 141). Kurdish minorities’ levels of support for reconciliation and the ways they construe reconciliation were analyzed as two outcomes. For the latter, descriptions of reconciliation were first content-coded into seven themes. A latent class analysis of these themes led to two main construals: those endorsing a rights-based versus dialogue-based understanding of reconciliation; which was then used as a binary outcome. Results supported a similar mediation model in Turkey and Belgium. Accordingly, stronger religious identification as Muslim was associated with positive intergroup emotions and in turn more support for reconciliation, whereas stronger ethnic identification as Kurdish had the opposite effect. However, having Muslim identity as a superordinate identity was double-edged for the Kurdish minorities: while high Muslim identifiers were more supportive of reconciliation in general; they were also less likely to endorse a rights-based understanding of reconciliation (versus a dialogue-based reconciliation).

T1  - Conjuring Aesthetic Blackness: Abjection and Trauma in Toni Morrison's God Help the Child
AN  - 2010312193
AB  - This paper explores the poetic of the quality or state of being a Black person in God Help the Child in order to show how Toni Morrison conjures and exorcises the terror of being a Black person so as to permit her Black protagonists to come to terms with the stigma of their skin colour. Hence, not only does she weave an aesthetic fabric around the abject, but she also proffers a narrative of healing and redemption so that the characters can be redeemed and reach catharsis; and she taps into the "apostrophic imagination" and deconstruction practices in order to transform the bane of being a Black person into a balm of healing, redemption, and rebirth.

T1  - Solidarity through shared disadvantage: Highlighting shared experiences of discrimination improves relations between stigmatized groups
AN  - 1949634321
AB  - Intergroup relations research has largely focused on relations between members of dominant groups and members of disadvantaged groups. The small body of work examining intraminority intergroup relations, or relations between members of different disadvantaged groups, reveals that salient experiences of ingroup discrimination promote positive relations between groups that share a dimension of identity (e.g., 2 different racial minority groups) and negative relations between groups that do not share a dimension of identity (e.g., a racial minority group and a sexual minority group). In the present work, we propose that shared experiences of discrimination between groups that do not share an identity dimension can be used as a lever to facilitate positive intraminority intergroup relations. Five experiments examining relations among 4 different disadvantaged groups supported this hypothesis. Both blatant (Experiments 1 and 3) and subtle (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) connections to shared experiences of discrimination, or inducing a similarity-seeking mindset in the context of discrimination faced by one's ingroup (Experiment 5), increased support for policies benefiting the outgroup (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) and reduced intergroup bias (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Taken together, these experiments provide converging evidence that highlighting shared experiences of discrimination can improve intergroup outcomes between stigmatized groups across dimensions of social identity. Implications of these findings for intraminority intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - Ethnic Minorities in Northern Mountains of Vietnam: Employment, Poverty and Income
AN  - 1938627072
AB  - This study provides estimates of key socio-economic indicators reflecting employment, poverty, and welfare of ethnic minorities in Northern Mountains of Vietnam. The ethnic minorities in Northern Mountains have much lower assets and income than ethnic minorities in other regions. Their income is mainly from crops and livestock. Compared with Kinh/Hoa (ethnic majorities) and ethnic minorities in other regions, ethnic minorities in the study area have substantially lower income from wage and non-farm employment. By decomposing the income gap between the ethnic minorities in Northern Mountains and those in other region, this study provides the first evidence that the income gap between the two groups is mainly explained by the gap in wage and nonfarm incomes. Northern Mountain ethnic minorities spend less time on wage and nonfarm employment. Their non-farm income per working hours and farm income per working hours are substantially lower than those of other households.

T1  - Extracurricular Activities in Multiethnic Middle Schools: Ideal Context for Positive Intergroup Attitudes?
AN  - 2296041766
AB  - This study examined processes by which extracurricular participation is linked with positive ethnic intergroup attitudes in multiethnic middle schools in California. Specifically, the mediating roles of activity‐related cross‐ethnic friendships and social identities including alliances with multiple groups were examined in a sample including African American or Black, East or South‐East Asian, White, and Latino youth (N = 1,446; Mage = 11.60 in sixth grade). Results of multilevel modeling suggested that in addition to activity‐related cross‐ethnic friendships, complex social identities mediated the association between availability of cross‐ethnic peers in activities and ethnic intergroup attitudes. Results are discussed in terms of how activities can be structured to promote cross‐ethnic relationships and complex social identities, as well as positive ethnic intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Marriage-Market Constraints and Mate-Selection Behavior: Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Differences in Intermarriage
AN  - 2061492976
AB  - Despite theoretical consensus that marriage markets constrain mate-selection behavior, few studies directly evaluate how local marriagemarket conditions influence intermarriage patterns. Using data from the American Community Survey, the authors examine what aspects of marriage markets influence mate selection, assess whether the associations between marriage-market conditions and intermarriage are uniform by gender and across pan-ethnic groups, and investigate the extent to which marriage-market conditions account for group differences in intermarriage patterns. Relative group size is the most salient and consistent determinant of intermarriage patterns across pan-ethnic groups and by gender. Marriage-market constraints typically explain a larger share of pan-ethnic differences in intermarriage rates than individual traits, suggesting that scarcity of co-ethnic partners is a key reason behind decisions to intermarry. When faced with market constraints, men are more willing or more successful than women in crossing racial and ethnic boundaries in marriage.

T1  - 'If I go with him, I can't talk with other women': Understanding women's resistance to, and acceptance of, men's involvement in maternal and child healthcare in northern Ghana
AN  - 1841712891
AB  - Men's involvement in maternal and child healthcare especially in patriarchal societies such as Ghana is increasingly being advocated. While a number of studies have been conducted to explore men's views on their involvement, few studies have examined the perspectives of childbearing women. Based on qualitative focus group discussions that were conducted between January and August 2014 with a total of 125 adult women in seven communities in the Upper West Region of Ghana, this paper examines women's perspectives on men's involvement in maternal and child healthcare. Findings suggest that although many women recognised the benefits of men's involvement, few actually supported greater male involvement. The majority of women expressed negative attitudes and opinions on the involvement of men. These negative attitudes and opinions were framed by three broad factors: perceptions that pregnancy and child care should be a female role while men should be bread winners; women's desire to avoid negative stereotyping; and fears that men's involvement may turn hitherto secure social spaces for women into insecure ones. These narrative accounts largely challenge current programmatic efforts that seek to promote men's involvement in maternal and child healthcare, and suggest that such male involvement programmes are less likely to succeed if the views and concerns of childbearing women are not taken into account.

T1  - Being smart or getting smarter: Implicit theory of intelligence moderates stereotype threat and stereotype lift effects
AN  - 1816558902
AB  - This research explores implicit theory of intelligence (TOI) as a moderator of stereotype activation effects on test performance for members of negatively stereotyped and of favourably stereotyped groups. In Germany, Turkish-origin migrants are stereotyped as low in verbal ability. We predicted that on a test diagnostic of verbal intelligence, endorsement of an entity TOI predicts stereotype threat effects for Turkish-origin students and stereotype lift effects for German students. This effect could account for some of the performance gap between immigrants and host society members after stereotype activation. Study 1 (N = 107) established structural equivalence of implicit theories across the ethnic groups. In two experimental studies (Study 2: N = 182, Study 3: N = 190), we tested the moderating effect of TOI in a 2 (stereotype activation: diagnostic vs. non-diagnostic test) × 2 (ethnicity: German vs. Turkish migration background) experimental design. The results showed that when the test was described as diagnostic of verbal intelligence, higher entity theory endorsement predicted stereotype threat effects for Turkish-origin students (Study 2 and Study 3) and stereotype lift effects for German students (Study 3). The results are discussed in terms of practical implications for educational settings and theoretical implications for processes underlying stereotype activation effects.

T1  - A Dual Process Model of attitudes toward immigration: Predicting intergroup and international relations with China
AN  - 1799875519
AB  - We integrate the Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice to examine the motivations associated with attitudes toward intergroup relations with Chinese people in New Zealand. We conducted a Structural Equation Model using data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (N = 15,608) to predict (a) warmth toward Chinese people, (b) support for policies promoting increased immigration from China, and (c) support for policies promoting greater trade ties between China and New Zealand. Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) were uniquely negatively associated with warmth toward Chinese and support for Chinese immigration. However, and as predicted, SDO was positively associated with support for increased trade, whereas RWA was negatively associated. Overall, SDO was most strongly related with low warmth, while RWA was most strongly associated with anti-immigration attitudes. Our model identifies key motives of group-based dominance (SDO) and threat-driven social cohesion (RWA) that inform prejudicial attitudes toward Chinese people in New Zealand. More generally, our model identifies nuances within the DPM framework, revealing subtle differences in the ways SDO and RWA are associated with closely related yet distinct aspects of New Zealanders' attitudes toward intergroup relations with China and Chinese peoples.

T1  - The Emancipatory and Transformative Potentials of American Multiethnic Women Writing
AN  - 2188118364
AB  - This paper explores the emancipatory potentials of American women writers of color for victims of gender, class, and the ethnocentric ideologies of racism, colonialism and nationalism. Their struggle against multiple oppressors, on one hand, drive them to form alliances with different oppressed groups such as laborers, homosexuals, the colonized people, immigrants and various ethnic minorities. On the other hand, cultural and ethnic identities are redefined on the basis of heterogeneity rather than homogeneity to cultivate tolerance, interdependence and mutual respect; gender roles are reconsidered in the light of an androgynous ideology, which views men and women as equal partners who should live in harmony but not in conflict; social classes are deconstructed to redress the injustices women and laborers have endured because of their gender, ethnic or racial differences. The plurality and heterogeneity of cultural, ethnic and gendered identities which women writers of color develop are extended to their writing whose language, content, and style are innovated and used as effective strategies to empower and emancipate subaltern groups. Their writing, therefore, assumes an inclusive character in which sexual, cultural and ethnic boundaries disappear, and interracial, intercultural, interethnic and intersexual dialogue is promoted.

T1  - Special Issue Editors' Introduction: New Frontiers in the Comparative Study of Ethnic Politics and Nationalism
AN  - 1705245608
AB  - This special issue grew out of a roundtable at the annual conference of the Association for the Study of Nationalities (ASN) in 2014 dedicated to the topic of “Research Methods in the Study of Nationalism and Ethnic Politics.” Despite the yawn-worthy title, the response was overwhelming. The comparative study of ethnic politics and nationalism has long been dominated by conceptual discussion and empirical observation, while the actual task of conducting research on the subject frequently gets shoved aside. The roundtable revealed that there is, in fact, a real thirst for sustained discussions of research methods and their intersection with both theoretical traditions and empirical focus. This special issue of Social Science Quarterly represents an attempt to address this need for methodological reﬂection. It presents overview articles that address the ﬁeld from a studied distance as well as empirical articles that illustrate the pressing issues and methodological stakes involved in the ways that we research ethnic politics and nationalism today. This special issue makes no pretense of providing a representative sample of all approaches or areas, opting for depth rather than breadth. The result is a selection of articles that are at once focused and eclectic. The ﬁrst few articles raise broad concerns about the use of existing data sets, ethnographic observation, and archival material. Each article addresses the relationship between theory and method. Of particular concern for each author is the identiﬁcation of limitations, gaps, and blind spots in existing approaches, but also the proposal of ways to address the methodological challenges emerging from contemporary studies. The concerns raised in the ﬁrst articles echo throughout the empirical contributions, creating a dialog throughout the issue and (hopefully) a foundation for ongoing methodological and theoretical reﬂection.

T1  - Letter From the Guest Editors: Elder Abuse as a Gendered Issue
AN  - 1765394168
AB  - Given the longer life expectancy of women, the aging population is predominately a female one. Living longer, however, does not necessarily mean living well. Compared to older men, older women are more likely to outlive their spouses, live in poverty and rely on social welfare, and suffer chronic health conditions, disabilities, and limitations in activities of daily living. All of these factors marginalize older women in society, increase their risk of abuse and neglect, and limit their access to services and support. Cumulative disadvantages acquired throughout a lifetime of gender discrimination, combined with ageism, which diminishes and renders older women invisible or subject to negative stereotyping, can lead to the abrogation of their right to live free of abuse (U.N. General Assembly, 1991). This was recognized as a gap in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) by the United Nations General Assembly, which ratified General Recommendation No. 27 on older women and protection of their human rights in December 2010. In this document, states parties are charged with the obligation to recognize and prohibit violence against older women in legislation on domestic violence, sexual violence, and violence in institutional settings and resulting from traditional practices and beliefs (Martin, Rodrigues-Pinzón, & Brown, 2015). Despite older women being the likely victims of abuse, violence against older women has not been adequately represented in the literature.

T1  - Young Moroccan-Dutch: Thinking in Dutch, Feeling Moroccan
AN  - 1695772237
AB  - We examined to what extent Moroccan-Dutch (N = 25) between 15 and 32 years of age are oriented towards the Dutch and Moroccan community when describing their identities. We used the Twenty Statements Test (developed by Kuhn and McPartland (1954). See, M. H. Kuhn and T. S. McPartland, "An Empirical Investigation of Self-attitudes", American Sociological Review, Vol. 19, No. 1, 1954, p. 69. In this study, participants were asked to complete the sentence with 'I am..' 20 times to assess how they described themselves.) and in-depth interviews to understand their challenges on the acculturation path since many face disadvantage and exclusion in the Dutch community. Moroccan-Dutch were, compared to the reference groups of mainstream Dutch (N = 20) and Moroccans (N = 25), more proud of their ethnic identity and attached to Islam. Though their Dutch language was dominant, they felt more Moroccan. They praised the Dutch openness, but suffered from negative stereotyping. Their participation in the Dutch community was low. To enhance their position, social professionals working with Moroccan-Dutch could draw on the rich ethnic and faith traditions of this group to encourage their deeper engagement with the Dutch society.

T1  - Neighborhood Stereotypes and Interpersonal Trust in Social Exchange: An Experimental Study
AN  - 1690171499
AB  - Recent research indicates that segregation is, in addition to many other undesirable consequences, negatively associated with social capital, in particular, generalized trust within a community. This study investigates whether an individual's residential neighborhood and the stereotypes associated with this neighborhood affect others' trusting behavior as a specific form of social exchange. Using an anonymous trust game experiment in the context of five districts of the German capital, Berlin, we show that trusting is contingent on others' residential neighborhood rather than on deliberate assessments of trustworthiness. Participants show significantly greater trust toward individuals from positively stereotyped neighborhoods with favorable sociodemographic characteristics than to persons from negatively stereotyped neighborhoods with unfavorable sociodemographics. Importantly, when stereotypes and sociodemographic factors point in opposite directions, participants' trust decisions reflect stereotype content.

T1  - Using implicit measures to explore children's intergroup attitudes: methodological and practical considerations for researchers
AN  - 2008958315
AB  - In recent years, implicit measures of attitude have emerged as increasingly important methods in research with adults; however, they have been used less often in research with children or adolescents. The present article seeks to initiate wider discussion on the potential for using implicit measures with young people by providing readers with an introduction to their use in child and adolescent research on intergroup attitudes and offering some guidance to researchers who are considering their use. The article initially explains the nature of implicit measures and then discusses in greater depth three measures that have been used with children. Psychometric and ethical issues (e.g. reliability, validity and use of deception) relevant to utilising implicit measures are then discussed and this is followed by a section detailing some practical considerations when using implicit measures. The final section of the article considers the current standing of implicit measures in work with children and makes suggestions for future research directions.

T1  - Friendships and outgroup attitudes among ethnic minority youth: The mediating role of ethnic and host society identification
AN  - 1735657216; 201537003
AB  - This study investigates among ethnic minority adolescents how friendships with ethnic minority and majority group peers are related to their attitudes towards the majority outgroup. Friendships with majority group peers are proposed to be indirectly related to outgroup attitudes through host society identification. Friendships with ethnic ingroup peers are proposed to be indirectly related to outgroup attitudes through ethnic ingroup identification. Hypotheses were tested longitudinally among ethnic minority adolescents (n = 244) who recently entered middle schools in the Netherlands. Lagged structural equation models showed that friendships with majority group peers were related to stronger identification with the host society which was in turn related to improved attitudes toward the majority outgroup. Ingroup friendships and ingroup identification was not related to outgroup attitudes. Additional analyses indicated that the relation between host society identification and majority group friendships was bidirectional. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Exploring implicit ingroup and outgroup bias toward Hispanics
AN  - 1700674207; 201524897
AB  - Racial and ethnic biases often manifest without awareness. The underlying causes of these attitudes are not fully understood. While outgroup bias is well studied, ingroup bias has received far less attention. We examined ingroup biases among Hispanic women and outgroup biases toward Hispanics among White (Caucasian non-Hispanic) females using the startle eyeblink paradigm, the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and an explicit self-report measure. Hispanic and White male faces were used as exemplars during both the startle task and the IAT. A similar pattern of results were observed for indirect measures: both groups displayed startle and IAT responses indicative of negative attitudes toward Hispanic male faces relative to White male faces, although less so for Hispanic participants. Combined groups correlational analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between startle eyeblink amplitude and subtle subscale bias scores. However, no relationships were found between any measures when groups were examined separately. The comparable pattern of startle and IAT results suggests that in spite of the likelihood that these measures index different aspects of attitudes and tap into different processes, inter and intragroup biases are manifested similarly. The finding of negative ingroup biases among Hispanic females is consistent with system justification theory, which posits that members of devalued groups internalize negative stereotypes about their ingroup. This study extends startle eyeblink research of intergroup racial biases, while also expanding this line of research to intragroup biases. In doing so, these results add to our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the persistent nature of stereotypes. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Balance Without Equality: Just World Beliefs, the Gay Affluence Myth, and Support for Gay Rights
AN  - 1626926085
AB  - The harmfulness of negative stereotypes toward gay and lesbian people has been established, but the effect of positive stereotypes has not been thoroughly examined. Gay and lesbian Americans continue to struggle against interpersonal and institutionalized discrimination, yet many people do not see them as a politically disadvantaged group, and voter support for gay rights has been inconsistent and somewhat unpredictable. Drawing on previous research regarding reactions to disadvantaged and advantaged targets, we examined the social cognitive underpinnings of support for gay rights. After accounting for general anti-gay attitudes and degree of religious affiliation, we found that global endorsement of just world beliefs negatively predicted support for gay rights, and that this effect was mediated by an inclination to perceive discrimination against gay and lesbian people as less of an issue in American society. Additionally, we found that endorsement of the 'gay affluence' stereotype also negatively predicted support of gay rights, particularly among non-student adults, and that this effect was moderated by character beliefs about gay and lesbian people pertaining to wealth-deservingness.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The New Majority: How Will Latino Youth Succeed in the Context of Low Educational Expectations and Assumptions of Sexual Irresponsibility?
AN  - 1619442714
AB  - Latino youth are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the USA and will soon comprise a significant portion of our future leadership and workforce. Prejudicial stereotypes about Latino youth--such as the assumption that teen pregnancy will inevitably lead to lower educational attainment--ignore significant advancements in educational and sexual health outcomes and contribute to inequities in health and education policies. A total of 332 Latino-identified youth living in California gave voice to their educational aspirations, challenges, and sexual and reproductive health needs through an exploratory mixed-methods research study. Youth participated in interviews and focus groups (n=105) and in a statewide survey (n=227) to explore assets that help youth overcome discriminatory low expectations and improve sexual decision making and educational aspirations. Results indicated most Latino youth desire to attend college. Likelihood of attending college was associated with individual and environmental assets. Lower likelihood of attending college was associated with perceived discrimination from teachers. Sexually active youth reported high levels of contraceptive use. Many youth want to defy the negative stereotypes and are seeking successful futures despite the structural challenges and social bias. There is an urgent need to reframe the negative public discourse about Latino youth, to acknowledge their resilience and to address underlying structural factors creating inequities. Specific policy recommendations are provided to promote positive sexual health and educational outcomes among Latino youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Psychological asymmetry in minority-majority relations at different stages of ethnic conflict
AN  - 1767328872; 201606257
AB  - This study investigated the psychological asymmetry of majority and minority intergroup attitudes at different conflict stages: high versus low intensity conflict. Cross-sectional surveys using the same outcome measures were conducted at two time points with representative Kurdish and Turkish community samples in selected neighborhoods in the city of Izmir in Turkey. The first survey was conducted during a period of low intensity conflict (LIC), whereas the second survey was conducted 6 months later during a period of high intensity conflict (HIC). The results revealed seemingly paradoxical outcomes among minority Kurds, such that during HIC they exhibited higher social distance and less support for (Turkish) nationalistic leaders, but also higher endorsement of assimilative nationalism, less out-group negativity, and lower support for minority Kurdish rights. By contrast, Turks exhibited lower social tolerance, more support for nationalistic leaders, higher out-group negativity, lower support for minority rights, and higher endorsement of assimilative nationalism during HIC than LIC. Turks' and Kurds' images of each other were also assessed, revealing patterns consistent with image theory predictions: Turks viewed Kurds as rogue, whereas Kurds viewed Turks as barbarian. While Turks' out-group images did not change over time, Kurds' images of Turks were slightly more variable at HIC than LIC. The findings are interpreted in light of distinct challenges that conflict and violence at the national level poses to ethnic minorities and majorities. The results highlight the importance of considering the role of dynamic inter-group contexts on understanding micro-level intergroup outcomes. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Stigmatised Identity and Service Usage in Disadvantaged Communities: Residents', Community Workers' and Service Providers' Perspectives
AN  - 1728660305; 201533988
AB  - The impact of community stigmatisation upon service usage has been largely overlooked from a social identity perspective. Specifically, the social identity-mediated mechanisms by which stigmatisation hinders service use remain unspecified. The present study examines how service providers, community workers and residents recount their experience of the stigmatisation of local community identity and how this shapes residents' uptake of welfare, education and community support services. Twenty individual and group interviews with 10 residents, 16 community workers and six statutory service providers in economically disadvantaged communities in Limerick, Ireland, were thematically analysed. Analysis indicates that statutory service providers endorsed negative stereotypes of disadvantaged areas as separate and anti-social. The awareness of this perceived division and the experience of 'stigma consciousness' was reported by residents and community workers to undermine trust, leading to under-utilisation of community and government services. We argue that stigmatisation acts as a 'social curse' by undermining shared identity between service users and providers and so turning a potentially cooperative intragroup relationship into a fraught intergroup one. We suggest that tackling stigma in order to foster a sense of shared identity is important in creating positive and cooperative service interactions for both service users and providers.

T1  - Only connect? Older lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) adults and social capital
AN  - 1531932467; 201425399
AB  - The concept of social capital is widely used in the social sciences and has, to an extent, been applied to the lives and social networks of older lesbian, gay and bisexual (hereafter LGB) adults. Developing existing research, this paper argues that while not without its problems, the concept of social capital enriches our understanding of these networks, whilst simultaneously deconstructing the negative stereotypes surrounding homosexuality in later life. However, little attention has been paid to the social factors that mediate access and participation in lesbian and gay communities and the implications of this on the quality and experience of later life. Drawing on qualitative research conducted in the United Kingdom, this paper illustrates how biography, gender and socio-economic status are significant mediators in the development and maintenance of social capital by older LGB adults. It concludes with a set of recommendations aimed at improving the social capital of older LGB adults, together with the importance of 'queering' the concept itself. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How can a stereotype inconsistency bias be encouraged in communication
AN  - 1373428040; 201328459
AB  - This study aimed to investigate what conditions can lead to a bias for communicating stereotype inconsistent (SI) information, relative to stereotype consistent (SC) information. Sixty-three undergraduate university students (22 males, 41 females; Mage = 21.25) read a story about an Arab man who exhibited characteristics consistent and inconsistent with the stereotype of Arab men. The story was transmitted through 21 three-person communication chains; each participant rewrote the story from memory for the next person in the chain to read, with only the first participant in each chain reading the original story. As hypothesized, when a surprising category conjunction was formed by pairing the primary stereotype (Arab men) with a secondary stereotype of a contradictory nature (kindergarten teachers), SC information was circulated less than SI information. This was also the case when a causal explanation was provided that accounted for the unexpected SI information. Findings indicate the potential of techniques that elicit cognitive elaboration of SI information to encourage an SI bias in communication, and show promise for exploring ways to reduce the impact of negative stereotypical information in the long term.

T1  - Dementia in Documentary Film: Mum by Adelheid Roosen
AN  - 1429630306; 201338656
AB  - This article draws attention to the fact that documentaries do not simply reproduce the reality that film and audience share but always present a particular view of this reality. This implies that organizations in Alzheimer care, education, and research that often recommend documentaries to inform people about dementia should take into account that these films might reinforce negative stereotypes inducing fear of dementia. An in-depth analysis of the Dutch short documentary Mum (2009), directed by feminist artist Adelheid Roosen, illustrates that the reasoning of the personhood movement in dementia research can be translated into an artistic form. By highlighting instead of veiling its means of production, Mum stimulates viewers to imagine people with dementia as other than lost selves. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Women's rights are older women's rights too: Narratives of grandmothers in home-based care
AN  - 1559006049; 201434495
AB  - The HIV and AIDS pandemic has resulted in a large number of people relying on home-based care, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, due to lack of access to the public health care system. Older women shoulder the greatest burden in the care and support of people living with HIV and AIDS, orphans and vulnerable children, yet their labour remains invisible in both policy and practice. This Briefing examines narratives of grandmothers from South Africa and Nigeria in order to highlight the fundamental assumptions related to older women's readiness to provide unpaid care work. Drawing on empirical evidence from a total of 80 women caregivers, the Briefing demonstrates that grandmothers have become jacks-of-all-trades caring for orphans and terminally ill adults in communities affected by HIV and AIDS. However, their care-giving role is often devalued and unrecognised. Such attitudes reinforce negative stereotypes of old age as characterised by passive, incompetent and senile individuals, who are less productive than their younger counterparts. This Briefing concludes that unless older women's oppression becomes central to the feminist agenda, the notion of women's rights will remain elusive. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Older consumers and celebrity advertising
AN  - 1551000476; 201430961
AB  - Older consumers have long been the 'invisible majority' in advertising despite the rapid increase in an ageing population. A significant proportion of this population have high levels of disposable income, even in times of recession, but advertisers are not encouraging them to part with it. This paper intends to find out why advertisers have been slow or struggle to target older consumers effectively. The aims of this study are two-fold. First, it explores the portrayal and representation of older consumers in Tesco's 'Dotty' campaign and Marks & Spencer's (M&S) 'Twiggy' campaign, with special reference to the use of celebrities. The second aim is to demonstrate how the focus has shifted from the more traditional, negative stereotyping (Tesco campaign) to a more progressive approach, presenting aspirational images that older consumers can identify with (M&S campaign). Although both campaigns were effective in terms of increasing profits, this paper suggests that the ongoing M&S example of using older celebrities in advertising campaigns demonstrates a more effective creative strategy that is in tune not only with a growing population of older consumers but is also especially applicable in times of economic uncertainty.

T1  - When different means bad or merely worse. How minimal and maximal goals affect ingroup projection and outgroup attitudes
AN  - 1315600170; 201307355
AB  - Group members tend to perceive their ingroup relative to an outgroup as more prototypical for a common superordinate group because they project features of their ingroup onto the superordinate group. As a consequence, the ingroup is perceived as more positive than the outgroup (Mummendey & Wenzel, 1999). We extend the ingroup projection model by examining different types of ingroup goals: minimal and maximal goals as well as actual and ideal goals. Minimal goals should engender either-or thinking and lead to more ingroup projection compared with maximal goals that should involve more nuanced thinking. Ingroup prototypicality in terms of ideal goals (e.g., what we ideally should strive for) was expected to show a stronger relation to outgroup attitudes than ingroup prototypicality in terms of actual goals (e.g., what we are actually striving for). We manipulated minimal and maximal goal orientation and assessed actual and ideal goals. Across two studies, relative ingroup prototypicality was higher in the minimal compared with the maximal goal condition. Moreover, ingroup prototypicality referring to ideal goals showed a stronger relation to outgroup evaluation than ingroup prototypicality referring to actual goals.

T1  - Effects of contact with treatment users on mental illness stigma: Evidence from university roommate assignments
AN  - 1266143628; 201302028
AB  - Mental illness stigma refers to negative stereotypes and prejudices about people with mental illness, and is a widespread phenomenon with damaging social, psychological, and economic consequences. Despite considerable policy attention, mental illness stigma does not appear to have declined significantly in recent years. Interpersonal contact with persons with mental illness has been identified as a promising approach to reducing mental illness stigma. This study investigates the effect of contact with mental health treatment users on stigma using an observational research design that is free of self-selection bias. The research design is based on the quasi-experiment in which university students are assigned to live together as roommates. Survey data were collected from first-year undergraduates at two large universities in the United States (N = 1605). Multivariable regressions were used to estimate the effect of assignment to a roommate with a history of mental health treatment on a brief measure of stigmatizing attitudes. Contact with a treatment user caused a modest increase in stigma (standardized effect size = 0.15, p = 0.03). This effect was present among students without a prior treatment history of their own, but not among those with a prior history. The findings indicate that naturalistic contact alone does not necessarily yield a reduction in mental illness stigma. This may help explain why stigma has not declined in societies such as the United States even as treatment use has risen substantially. The findings also highlight the importance of isolating the specific components, beyond contact per se, that are necessary to reduce stigma in contact-based interventions. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Residual stigma: Psychological distress among the formerly overweight
AN  - 1023031365; 201226397
AB  - Little is known about the psychological state of those who leave a stigmatized group. We examined individuals who previously belonged to a stigmatized group, the overweight, and then became normal weight. Negative stereotypes, including those relating to obesity, are internalized from the time of childhood onward; therefore, it was assumed they would become lingering self-stereotypes among individuals who were no longer externally targeted. Drawing on a nationally representative sample, we examined for the first time whether formerly overweight individuals are susceptible to any anxiety disorder, any depressive disorder, and suicide attempts. As predicted, the likelihood of any anxiety disorder and any depressive disorder for the formerly overweight group was significantly greater than for the consistently normal-weight group, and not significantly different from the consistently overweight group. Further, the formerly overweight group was significantly more likely to attempt suicide than the other groups. Also as predicted, perceived weight discrimination partially mediated the relationship between weight status and these outcomes. The cohort consisted of 33,604 participants in the United States. The results suggest that losing a self-image shaped by stigma is a more protracted process than losing weight. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Distinguishing between the effects of stereotype priming and stereotype threat on math performance
AN  - 1023027140; 201223686
AB  - Stereotype threat and stereotype priming have both been shown to impair test performance. Although research suggests threat-based concerns distinguish the experience of threat from priming (Marx & Stapel, 2006), it is not clear whether these psychological phenomena impact performance via similar or distinct mechanisms. The current work demonstrates that priming and threat produce distinctive patterns of performance via different mechanisms. Motivation was found to play a proximal role in the effect of stereotype threat on females' math performance. Threatened females were motivated to disconfirm the negative stereotype, but performed more poorly because they were more likely than controls to use the incorrect, but prepotent conventional solution approach. Gender-math stereotypes do not incorporate the notion that females are motivated to disconfirm stereotypes. Instead the results are consistent with the argument that participants primed with female gender constructs performed poorly because they withdrew effort.

T1  - Only Here for the Day: The Social Integration of Minority Students at a Majority White High School
AN  - 1364702604; 201325670
AB  - This study uses qualitative data to investigate the process of social integration for minority students at a majority white high school and identifies significant gender differences in this process. At this school, integration is the result of processes that occur at two different levels of interaction. On the interpersonal level, African American and Latino/a males and females engage in very different integration strategies. Males are able to gain social status at the school through their participation in athletics and their physical embodiment of the urban "hip-hop star" and also by engaging in strategies to play down negative stereotypes. In contrast, females do not have access to similar avenues for social status and do not engage in such strategies. The organization of the school contributes to these gender differences by facilitating interracial contact for the males under ideal conditions, while providing the females with less opportunity for contact. This study has implications for future work on integrated schools and points to the understudied importance of gender and its relation to organizational context in studies of race relations.

T1  - Secondary Transfer Effect of Intergroup Contact: The Role of Intergroup Attitudes, Intergroup Anxiety and Perspective Taking
AN  - 964187222; 201207318
AB  - We conducted a field study to investigate the secondary transfer effect of intergroup contact, consisting in the generalisation of the positive effects of intergroup contact to outgroups uninvolved in the contact situation. Italian secondary school students (N=175) filled out a questionnaire; the effects of prior contact were statistically controlled. Results showed that contact with immigrants improved attitudes toward them. In turn, these attitudes generalised to attitudes toward two dissimilar outgroups not directly involved in contact: disabled and homosexuals. Notably, we found evidence for a secondary transfer effect of intergroup anxiety and perspective taking, which generalised from immigrants to the disabled and homosexuals. Evidence was found for the mediating role of intergroup attitudes, intergroup anxiety and perspective taking. The theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - Reducing stereotype threat in order to facilitate learning
AN  - 1030866848; 201227621
AB  - Recent stereotype threat research has demonstrated that negative stereotypes about women's math ability can impair their mathematical learning. This experiment extends this research by examining whether presenting "gender fair" information can reduce learning decrements (on a focal and transfer task) and if the timing of this information matters. Women (N = 140) and men (N = 60) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: control, stereotype threat only, stereotype threat removed before learning, and stereotype threat removed after learning. Compared with women in the control condition and women who had stereotype threat removed before learning, learning and transfer were poorer for women in the stereotype threat only condition and women who had stereotype threat removed after learning but before learning assessment. Men's learning and transfer were unaffected by condition. These findings suggest that a manipulation that can reduce performance deficits can also reduce learning decrements if it is presented before learning occurs. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Managing the Socially Marginalized: Attitudes Toward Welfare, Punishment, and Race
AN  - 1221406568; 201246553
AB  - Welfare and incarceration policies have converged to form a system of governance over socially marginalized groups, particularly racial minorities. In both of these policy areas, rehabilitative and social support objectives have been replaced with a more punitive and restrictive system. The authors examine the convergence in individual-level attitudes concerning welfare and criminal punishment, using national survey data. The authors' analysis indicates a statistically significant relationship between punitive attitudes toward welfare and punishment. Furthermore, accounting for the respondents' racial attitudes explains the bivariate relationship between welfare and punishment. Thus, racial attitudes seemingly link support for punitive approaches to opposition to welfare expenditures. The authors discuss the implications of this study for welfare and crime control policies by way of the conclusion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Improving implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes using imagined contact: An experimental intervention with elementary school children
AN  - 1023028882; 201223708
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) on elementary school children's explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. Italian 5th-graders participated in a 3-week intervention involving imagining meeting an unknown immigrant peer in various situations. Approximately 1 week after the last session, they completed measures of self-disclosure and behavioral intentions toward immigrants. Furthermore, they were administered a measure of implicit prejudice. Results showed that those taking part in the intervention, compared to participants in a control condition, revealed more positive behavioral intentions and implicit attitudes toward immigrants. Moreover, self-disclosure mediated the effect of imagined contact on outgroup behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - Urban encounters with difference: the contact hypothesis and immigrant integration projects in eastern Berlin
AN  - 1023029673; 201226987
AB  - Recent urban scholarship celebrates the increased cultural and ethnic diversity of contemporary cities as promoting conviviality and intercultural sensibilities. The contact hypothesis and immigrant integration policies drawing on it similarly stress the importance of increased face-to-face contact for reducing inter-group prejudice and conflict. Drawing on ethnographic research in eastern Berlin, this paper examines spaces of encounters between local residents and recent immigrants and their potential for decreasing negative stereotypes, prejudice, and conflict. We find that contact between Russian Aussiedler and local German residents in public and quasi-public spaces remains fleeting, often reinforcing pre-existing stereotypes. Local immigrant integration projects, despite their intentions of increasing contact between migrant and non-migrant residents, often fail to provide opportunities for deeper contact. On the other hand, sustained and close encounters are enabled in spaces of neighborhood community centers, where immigrants and native residents work side-by-side on common projects. These sustained encounters engender more empathy and positive attitudes toward individual immigrants but these are not scaled up to the group, contradicting claims of recent contact theorists. We suggest that scholars and integration practitioners be cautious of overoptimistic assumptions about how encounters across difference can contribute to decreasing resentment and interethnic conflict, as these are underwritten by much broader processes of marginalization and deeply entrenched unequal power relations.

T1  - MONEY CAN'T BUY ME HYGGE: Danish Middle-Class Consumption, Egalitarianism, and the Sanctity of Inner Spacer
AN  - 892574100
AB  - In this article, the style of social interaction known as hygge is analyzed as being related to cultural values that idealize the notion of 'inner space' and to other egalitarian norms of everyday life in Scandinavian societies. While commonly experienced as a pleasurable involvement in a social and spatial interior, hygge is also examined as a mode of withdrawal from alienating conditions of modernity. In spite of its egalitarian features, hygge acts as a vehicle for social control, establishes its own hierarchy of attitudes, and implies a negative stereotyping of social groups who are perceived as unable to create hygge. The idea of hygge as a trait of Scandinavian culture is developed in the course of the interpretation, and its limitations are also discussed against ethnographic evidence that comparable spatial and social dynamics unfold in other cultural contexts.

T1  - Missing in Action: The Portrayal of Women in Sport in the Print Media
AN  - 1037881241; 201232029
AB  - Women have made great strides in sport in recent years in South Africa. The way in which the media portrays these sporting achievements is critically important to dislodging negative stereotypes and overcoming discrimination of women in sport. The unfair coverage of women's sport displays gender-based attitudes which systematically disadvantage women's position in society. Women's participation in sport has grown dramatically but, despite this growth, coverage of women in sport remains inferior to that given to male sport across all media. Newspaper reports are seldom challenged for not being accurate or truthful. But readers have a right to truthful information and reporting, and being trustworthy to the reader is the basis of good journalism. The media need to collectively reflect a diversity of content to ensure public access to a variety of viewpoints and they should expect societal intervention if the media fail to meet professional standards. The print media has a fundamental role to play in shaping public opinion and undoubtedly has an influence in portraying women in sport in South Africa. Based on this role, this study sets out to explore the influence of the print media in portraying women in sport. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intersectional Dignities: Latino Immigrant Street Vendor Youth in Los Angeles
AN  - 852898608; 201103628
AB  - In Los Angeles many Latino immigrants earn income through street vending, as do some of their teenagers and younger children. Members of their community and external authorities view these economic activities as deviant, low status, and illegal, and young people who engage in them are sometimes chased by the police and teased by their peers. Why do they consent to do this work, and how do they respond to the threats and taunts? Based on participant observation and in-depth interviews with street vending children and teens, the authors argue that an intersectionalities perspective can help explain both why the youth engage in this work and how they construct narratives of intersectional dignities to counter experiences of shame, stigma, and humiliation with street vending. Intersectional dignities refers to moral constructions based on inversions of widely held negative stereotypes of racial ethnic minorities, the poor, immigrants, and in this case, children and girls who earn money in the streets. By analyzing how they counter stigma, one learns something about the structure of the broader society and the processes through which disparaged street vendor youth build affirming identities.

T1  - How Ideological Attitudes Predict Host Society Members' Attitudes toward Immigrants: Exploring Cross-National Differences
AN  - 835112758; 201101204
AB  - Recent theoretical frameworks assume that the ideological attitudes of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) predict individuals' attitudes toward immigrant groups, and that these predictive relations are affected by contextual factors. Based on these assumptions, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relations between ideological attitudes and anti-immigrant attitudes in 155 samples from 17 countries (total N= 38,522 participants). As potential correlates of cross-national differences in these relations, socioeconomic indices, cultural worldviews, and collective perceptions of immigrants were considered. RWA was a particularly strong predictor of anti-immigrant attitudes in countries where immigrants were perceived as increasing the crime rate and as not being beneficial to the economy (e.g., Germany, Italy); and SDO was a particularly strong predictor in countries with a higher relative unemployment rate of immigrants (e.g., Belgium, Sweden). We discuss the interplay of individual and sociocultural factors and offer directions for future research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Promised Land? Immigration, Religiosity, and Space in Southern California
AN  - 1928307944
AB  - This article looks at how immigrants and their supporters appropriate and use religious space and other public spaces for religious and socio-political purposes in Southern California. While the everyday living conditions of many immigrants, particularly the unauthorized Latino immigrants, force unto them an embodied disciplinarity that maintains spatialities of restricted citizenship, the public appropriations of space for and through religious practices allow for them -even if only momentarily -to express an embodied transgression. This practice in public space helps realize spaces of freedom and hope, however ephemerally. Potentially, these rehearsing exercises can help revert internalized disempowering subjectivities and create social empowerment. Negative stereotypes about immigrants held by the larger public can also be challenged through these spatial practices, as the public demonstrations make visible the invisible. We focus on "Posadas Without Borders" and "the New Sanctuary Movement," considering both the role of progressive civic and religious institutions in supporting immigrants and the agency of the immigrants themselves. The theoretical analysis builds on concepts drawn from a conversation between geography and religious and theological studies. We use a triangulated methodological approach that includes observation and participant observation, content-analysis of multimedia, interviews, and intellectual advocacy for the immigrant movement. The cases discussed here show that progressive religious groups and coalitions can be important allies to progressive planners, geographers, and policy makers in advancing social and environmental justice for the disenfranchised. They also show that the theological underpinnings of such groups share a lot in common with planning epistemologies for the just city.

T1  - Structural forces and the production of TB-related stigma among Haitians in two contexts
AN  - 758122482; 201059142
AB  - In recent years renewed interest in health-related stigma has underscored the importance of better understanding the structural underpinnings of stigma processes. This study investigated the influence of sociocultural context on perceived components of tuberculosis-related stigma in non-affected persons by comparing Haitians living in South Florida, USA, with Haitians residing in Leogane Commune, Haiti. Using the methods of cultural epidemiology, a two-phase study based on fieldwork between 2004 and 2007 collected ethnographic data on the cultural context and components of tuberculosis (TB) stigma, and administered a stigma scale developed specifically for these populations. Thematic analysis of stigma components expressed in interviews, focus groups and observation revealed commonalities as well as distinctive emphases of TB stigma in the two comparison groups. Factor analyses of stigma scale scores confirmed the thematic differences revealed in ethnographic findings and highlight the influence of political and economic factors in shaping the meaning and experience of illness. Perceived components of TB stigma among Haitians in South Florida incorporated aspects of Haitian identity as a negatively stereotyped minority community within the larger society, while in Haiti, stigma was associated primarily with poverty, malnutrition, and HIV co-infection. Discussion of findings focuses on the social production of perceived and anticipated stigma as it is influenced by structural forces including the influences of politics, economics, institutional policies, and health service delivery structures. The findings also demonstrate the value of a transnational framework encompassing both sending and receiving countries for understanding TB-related stigma in immigrant communities.

T1  - Effects of Intergroup Dialogue: Public School Teachers and Sexual Orientation Prejudice
AN  - 1928211752
AB  - Prejudice and hate crimes against lesbians and gay men are prevalent throughout the United States. Prejudice in public school settings is particularly problematic for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students and LGB parents. Efforts to reduce prejudice for LGB groups have met with limited success. Creating safer and more inclusive school environments is essential. An experimental mixed methods field design tested outcomes of an intergroup dialogue intervention on public school teacher attitudes, feelings, and behaviors toward LGB students and parents. Quantitative results indicate dialogue participation resulted in statistically significant positive changes in attitudes, feelings, and behaviors. Qualitative data analysis confirmed positive changes as a result of dialogue participation.

T1  - Constructing adolescent fatherhood: responsibilities and intergenerational repair
AN  - 862042999
AB  - The parenthood literature has, until recently, paid scant attention to adolescent fathers. Negative stereotypes portray these young men as delinquents, unwilling to participate in the lives of their children. Recent research has challenged negative views by examining the impact of fatherhood on these young men and concluding that they are far from uninvolved and disinterested in their children. The current study extends this line of research by charting the ways young fathers talk about their responsibilities and hopes for their children's futures. Young fathers were interviewed and the data analysed discursively in order to further explore the meaning of fatherhood. The analysis focuses on the ways paternal responsibilities were constructed and the notion of intergenerational repair is introduced as one of the features of this talk. The implications for practitioners are discussed in the context of a more critical approach whereby taken-for-granted assumptions are questioned in this highly politicised area.

T1  - The State in Transition: Power Bloc and Point of Bifurcation
AN  - 1928870680
AB  - The Bolivian state, viewed as a correlation of political forces, a mechanism for institutionalization, and a shared idea that guarantees moral consensus between governors and governed, is undergoing structural change. The coalition that achieved power with the 2005 elections differs in class and ethnicity from the previous power bloc, and as a result there is a gap in communication and a high level of societal conflict. To stabilize its power, the new power bloc has incorporated the armed forces into its project, nationalized the country's natural resources and invested the new revenues in public works, and developed the nucleus of a new symbolic discourse. It is the political system--its hierarchies, leadership, alliances, and procedures--that is still contested. The bifurcation point of the process--the moment when disorder becomes order--has not yet been reached but may be closer than it appears.

T1  - Anatomy of a Regional Conflict: Tarija and Resource Grievances in Morales's Bolivia
AN  - 1928868523
AB  - In 2008, the Department of Tarija became the epicenter of national political struggles over political autonomy for lowland regions at odds with the Morales administration. In September, following a series of regional referenda on autonomy and a national recall election, citizen committees in Tarija mobilized urban-based sectors and organized a general strike against the central government. It is unhelpful to understand the strike as simply an act of political sabotage orchestrated by racist regional elites. The factors driving protest and interest in autonomy are varied and deeply related to patterns of hydrocarbons extraction in the department that have allowed for the mobilization of grievances and the cultivation of resource regionalism at departmental and intradepartmental scales. Alongside class and ethnicity, identities of place and region can be equally important in processes of mobilization, and the resonance of these spatialized identities is particularly important in resource-extraction peripheries.

T1  - Blurred Borders for Some but not "Others": Racialization, "Flexible Ethnicity," Gender, and Third-Generation Mexican American Identity
AN  - 213990661
AB  - How are the lives of middle-class third-generation Mexican Americans both racialized and gendered? Third-generation Mexican Americans in California experience a racialization process continuum that extends from "flexible ethnicity," the ability to be considered an "insider" in different racial/ethnic communities, to racialization as nonwhite that is enforced through the deployment of negative stereotypes. Using interview data, the author finds that women are afforded more "flexible ethnicity" than men. Accordingly, men are more rigorously racialized than women. Women are racialized through exoticization, whereas men are racialized as threats to safety. Lighterskinned individuals escaped consistent racialization. These findings have consequences for the incorporation possibilities of later-generation Mexican Americans, as women and light-skinned (often multiracial) individuals are more frequently granted "flexible ethnicity" and less strongly racialized than men and dark-skinned (often monoracial) individuals. Even among the structurally assimilated, contemporary racial and gender hierarchies limit the voluntary quality of ethnicity among third-generation Mexican Americans. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
