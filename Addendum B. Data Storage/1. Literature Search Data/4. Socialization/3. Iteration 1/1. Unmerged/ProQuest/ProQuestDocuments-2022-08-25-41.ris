T1  - "WE DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SOCIETY AND THAT WE SHOULD BE HEARD": Agency and Strategies of Empowerment of Community Media Producers in Germany in Light of Experiences of Racism
AN  - 2704052401
AB  - Media practices are often dominated by hegemonic discourses, and members of marginalised groups tend to struggle to get access to professional media production opportunities. In this paper, we present a study on agency and strategies of migrant media producers in Germany with a specific focus on experiences with racism, visibility of marginalised voices and negotiations of belonging in alternative spaces. Community media are media that are independent, non-commercial, organised from the community, and directed to the community. Their aim is to enable citizens to take control over their own representation, produce media content that is representative of a diverse society, and raise issues often overlooked by commercial and large-scale public-service media. Racism is understood in this study as a practice based on hierarchical oppositional distinction and connected to the practical effects of this distinction. Discriminatory practices denote the exclusion of individuals or groups because of prevailing prejudices linked to certain discrimination categories like age, sex, origin, appearance, language, sexual or religious orientation. Eight media producers living in Germany with refugee/migration backgrounds participated in two group discussions and an interview. The focus of the conversations were experiences of racism, individual experiences in Germany regarding acceptance, experiences with community media, perception of the public or mainstream media, structures within the radios and media projects, possible wishes, and strategies for dealing with racism in media, the topic of multilingualism and feedback of listeners. All recordings were transcribed, and the analysis focused on individual agency and strategies, (lack of) institutional support and social evaluations. The explorative, qualitative approach enabled deeper insights into the complex ways how discrimination is at play in society at large but also how these practices are encountered in 'alternative' spaces. On the one hand, the analysis reveals the effects of intersectional positions that media producers navigate when attempting to reach representation for themselves and for topics they find important. The results underline the importance of informal networks to access resources. On the other hand, forms of recognition for education and competencies (particularly those acquired outside of Europe) need to be in place for media producers to realise their potential.

T1  - Discourse, Difference, and Divergence: Exploring Media Representations and Online Public Sentiments toward Marginalized Urban Communities in Jamaica during the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2679830273
AB  - Despite lacking the resources to adequately adhere to public health protocols, urban residents belonging to impoverished communities in Kingston, Jamaica were prominently featured in local news reports that highlighted their breaches of social distancing. These reports generated an overwhelmingly prejudiced online social discourse, characterized by derogatory and dehumanizing remarks. This research aims to explore the ways media representations of calls for social distancing have unearthed latent social cleavages and contributed to the othering of Kingston’s poor. A thematic analysis was used to understand the nature of the public response to these news reports. The comments were manually coded, and emergent themes were classified based on the sentiments expressed. The comments generated evoked class, place, race, and political tensions, potentially perpetuating the public perception of vulnerable groups as the ‘threatening other’. These comments possibly represent deeper problems associated with the social divergence of Jamaican society. The lack of sensitivity exhibited shows a general disregard for the stark social realities commonly experienced by subaltern groups. These findings suggest media coverage promoting public safety, while important, may inadvertently lead to heightened social tensions and perpetuate social stigmas against marginalized groups, potentially stirring social divergence and countering efforts toward inclusiveness and integration.

T1  - The Combined Role of Independence in Self-Concept and a Collectivistic Value Orientation in Group-Focused Enmity in Korea
AN  - 2660147058
AB  - Previous research (Zick et al. 2008) suggested that animosity toward social minorities in Europe is intertwined, forming a syndrome of Croup-Focused Enmity (CFE). In the current research, we extended the notion of CFE by identifying the CFE structure in a non-European context (South Korea). We also tested a novel hypothesis that stipulates an interplay between individuals' self-concept and their value orientation in predicting the overall level of CFE. Two nation-wide surveys in South Korea showed that antagonism toward social minorities that have typically been marginalized and devalued in that country forms CFE while reflecting the unique intergroup context of Korean society. Further, we found as expected that independence in self-concept and a collectivistic value orientation jointly predict lower levels of CFE (Study 1). When political orientation and national identification were taken into account, the predicted interaction was observed only on antagonism toward ingroup minorities but not toward outgroup minorities by race or ethnicity (Study 2). Implications of these findings and directions for research on CFE are discussed.

T1  - The plight of racialised minorities during a pandemic: migrants and refugees in Italy and Australia
AN  - 2625203347
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to draw on data from interviews with six Italian migrant service providers and media stories in Italy and Australia to weave a comparative snapshot of the plight of precarious migrant and refugee communities in these two countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe article draws attention to prejudicial shortcomings towards vulnerable migrant communities enacted by the states of Italy and Australia in response to COVID-19.FindingsWhile the unequal ecology of the pandemic has flared up the need for the State to strengthen participation and inclusion policies, it has also provided opportunities to foreground the disadvantages vulnerable communities face that also demand policy attention and sustained funding. Governments in migrant-receiving countries like Australia and Italy need to articulate culturally sensitive and inclusive responses that foreground agencies give vulnerable migrants, asylum seekers and refugees clear, supportive messages of solidarity leading to practical solutions.Originality/valueThis paper relays preliminary data from the coalface (migrant service providers) and media as the pandemic evolved in the two countries, whose support mechanisms had never before been critically compared and evaluated through the lens of racial inequality in the face of a health and social crisis.

T1  - Race, Gender, and the U.S. Presidency: A Comparison of Implicit and Explicit Biases in the Electorate
AN  - 2621271238
AB  - Recent U.S. elections have witnessed the Democrats nominating both black and female presidential candidates, as well as a black and female vice president. The increasing diversity of the U.S. political elite heightens the importance of understanding the psychological factors influencing voter support for, or opposition to, candidates of different races and genders. In this study, we investigated the relative strength of the implicit biases for and against hypothetical presidential candidates that varied by gender and race, using an evaluative priming paradigm on a broadly representative sample of U.S. citizens (n = 1076). Our main research question is: Do measures of implicit racial and gender biases predict political attitudes and voting better than measures of explicit prejudice? We find that measures of implicit bias are less strongly associated with political attitudes and voting than are explicit measures of sexist attitudes and modern racism. Moreover, once demographic characteristics and explicit prejudice are controlled statistically, measures of implicit bias provide little incremental predictive validity. Overall, explicit prejudice has a far stronger association with political preferences than does implicit bias.

T1  - Sociodemographic and COVID-Related Predictors for Mental Health Condition of Mainland Chinese in Canada Amidst the Pandemic
AN  - 2618239309
AB  - The current study investigates the mental health condition of Mainland Chinese in Canada and identifies the associated sociodemographic and COVID-19-related predictors. A sample of 471 Mainland Chinese aged 18 or older completed an online survey that collected information on demographics, experience, cognition, and behaviours related to the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health condition. Mental health condition was assessed with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) for the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of Mainland Chinese during the pandemic. Moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress levels were respectively reported by 11.30%, 10.83%, and 5.10% of respondents. Univariate analysis of variance models (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess mental health condition variance as stratified by independent sociodemographic- or COVID-19-related explanatory variables, to identify possible predictors to be entered into the subsequent regression models. The regression models identified age, income level, health status, and perceived discrimination as significant sociodemographic predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.19–7.11, ps < 0.05), whereas self-infection worry, attitude towards Canadian measures, information confusion, food/goods stocking, and room cleaning/sanitizing were identified as significant COVID-19-reltaed predictors (absolute value of βs = 1.33–3.45, ps < 0.05) for mental health outcomes. The results shed light on our understanding of the major factors associated with the mental health condition of Mainland Chinese in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - <i>Be more human</i>. Is Reebok breaking women’s boundaries in sports?
AN  - 2613097134
AB  - Modern sports have increasingly acquired more social relevance, amplified as it is by the media and, especially, advertising, thereby making sports closer than ever to the average citizen. In 2015 the sports brand Reebok initiated a campaign to promote fitness by highlighting and valuing the human side of sports. The objective of this study is to analyze this campaign, assessing the existence of sexist prejudices, if any. Content analysis has been chosen as the method of study. A total of 439 images uploaded by Instagram users between January 2015 and May 2016 that were employed in Reebok’s campaign have been evaluated. The results indicate that photos of single, thin, and white women predominate. We can conclude that although the photos in Reebok’s campaign portray women in attitudes contrary to what sexist prejudices dictate – e.g. sweaty, tired – there is a clear adjustment to the canons of beauty that have traditionally been projected onto women.

T1  - Islam and Muslims in “non-religious” Japan: caught in between prejudice against Islam and performative tolerance
AN  - 2608426066
AB  - This paper examines how Islam in Japan tends to be tolerated as (foreign) “culture,” especially within the framework of tabunka kyōsei, multicultural coexistence, and cosmetic multiculturalism to circumvent religious apathy, phobia of religion, and prejudice against Islam. In doing so, this paper will: first provide a history of Muslim–Japanese relations and Muslim communities in Japan as well as an overview of the total estimate of the Muslim population in Japan as of 2018; historicize and denaturalize religious apathy, phobia of religion, and prejudice against Islam among the general Japanese public; analyze the rhetoric of tabunka kyōsei and its relation to cosmetic multiculturalism as well as its problematics; investigate the cases of local oppositions to the building projects of mosques and my observations made at events organized by Muslim groups; and conclude with a critical remark on the cosmetic multiculturalist understanding of “Islamic culture” and its approach to tabunka kyōsei.

T1  - Explaining the American crisis of policing: Media, malfeasance, and racial prejudice
AN  - 2637499058
AB  - ObjectiveTo include the factor of police malfeasance in the crisis of confidence in American police. Further, to explain the role of race, media, and contextual factors on individual perception of police performance. We argue that while the BLM movement was amplified by the deaths of Black people at the hands of police, it originates from the reality that police are continuously engaged in nefarious activities that wear down communities of color extensively.MethodsUsing the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post‐Election Survey (CMPS) and data on media reported police malfeasance in 2016 collected from the CATO institute, we explore the relationship between police malfeasance, race, and evaluations of police performance. We create two sets of logit regressions, one for all CMPS respondents and second, disaggregated by race to show the effects of media reported police malfeasance on respondent’s evaluations of police performance.ResultsIn the pooled model, we find a positive and significant correlation between poor police performance evaluations and incidences of police malfeasance. Further, substantive increases in the probability of rating police performance as poor are correlated with all respondents when disaggregated by race. We find a significant correlation among Black and White respondents, who are more likely to rate police performance as poor.ConclusionConventional narratives around the Black Lives Matter movement seem to show that deaths at the hands of local law enforcement “created” the BLM movement. We argue that the current delegitimating of police in terms of public support is related directly to police behavior themselves. Police malfeasance increases the likelihood of negative performance evaluations, thus undermining community trust in the police.

T1  - At the margins of personhood: Rethinking law and life beyond the impasses of biopolitics
AN  - 2615526497
AB  - "Human" and "person" are terms taken to be synonymous in everyday language, but "person," as John Locke memorably argued, is also a "forensic term" that "belongs only to intelligent agents, capable of a law, and happiness, and misery" (Locke 1689/1959, p. 467). As a designation reserved for subjects recognized by law as rights- and duty -bearing entities, personhood does not always overlap with humanness. In fact, various categories of human beings have historically been excluded from the status of personhood: Slavery, in its ancient and modern versions, is perhaps the most paradigmatic example of such exclusions. One could also add women, children, the colonized, and individuals with disabilities, among others, to this history. It is tempting to see such exclusions as regrettable prejudices of a bygone era and read the modern history of personhood as one of gradual expansion. The rise of a universalistic discourse of human rights seems to support that impression, with its promise that every human being shall be recognized as a person before the law. The enigmatic formula of "the human person," conjoining two terms that have remained separate for most of history and grounding rights in a dignity that is now assumed to be inherent in each human being, appears to herald an era that finally closes the gap between "the human" and "the person."

T1  - Impact of racism and sexism in the 2008–2020 US presidential elections
AN  - 2614034687
AB  - This 12‐year study examined racism and sexism in the 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 US presidential elections. Data were collected in the weeks surrounding each election, and participants completed measures of racism, sexism, and support for candidates. The hypotheses were that liberal participants would endorse less racism and sexism than conservative participants, and that racism and sexism would predict support for the presidential candidates differently in different election cycles. There was mixed support for the hypotheses; overall liberal participants did endorse racism and sexism less than conservative participants. Racism was a significant predictor during both the 2008 and 2016 elections. Although benevolent sexism was a significant predictor in 2008 and 2012, hostile sexism was a significant predictor in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Taken together these results suggest that political affiliation predicts levels of racism and sexism, and that these voter prejudices do predict support for political candidates.

T1  - Assessing Issues of Caste and Selfhood in Rural Society: Some Reflections
AN  - 2606095682
AB  - Based on a field study of Tandawa village located in east Uttar Pradesh, the article examines the pattern of caste cohesion in a rural society and studies how divisions and hierarchy still surface and remain a reality. This ethnographic study shows that though many socio-cultural traditions are practiced in northern India, some are undergoing subtle changes. The younger generation, especially its leaders, the yuva neta, have been taking initiatives over the last two decades to bring about a change in thinking. This study examines these new changes and challenges, and also tries to explore how these yuva neta have taken some initiatives to resolve internal caste-based hierarchical divisions and social contradictions. Using interviews, oral history, narratives and participant observation techniques, an ethnographic account of a small village has been put together. The research article also revisits a few significant studies to understand the debate on the caste system and how deeply it is entrenched in the day-to-day life of rural India.

T1  - Hermeneutics, Pragmatism and Sociology: Pragmatism’s Advantage
AN  - 2602332128
AB  - According to French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, intellectuals are prone to substitute a scholastic relation to the social world for the practical relation people have to it: they replace the practical relation to objects by the relation an observer has to them and by their way of looking at them. When he/she replaces the active agent by the reflecting subject, and the logic of practice by a scholastic reason, the researcher doesn’t realize that he/she performs an essential alteration of experience. The logic of practice can’t be grasped from such a point of view. In order to seize it, Bourdieu said, we have to return to the world of everyday experience. But there are many ways for doing that. In this paper I examine two of them, through a comparison of two philosophers (Gadamer and Dewey) belonging to two different traditions (philosophical hermeneutics and pragmatism). Only Dewey seems to avoid what Bourdieu calls the “scholastic epistemocentrism”.

T1  - Gender Differences in Anti-Gay Prejudice: Evidence for Stability and Change
AN  - 2596813892
AB  - In recent years, there has been remarkable change in societal acceptance of lesbians and gay men. This meta-analysis explored whether this positive shift has reduced the gender difference in these attitudes. We tested Kite and Whitley’s (1996) gender belief system model and replicated their finding that heterosexual men held more negative attitudes toward gay people (g. = 0.37, k = 245, N = 98,295), gay behavior (g. = 0.22, k = 68, N = 98,734), and gay civil rights (g. = 0.16, k = 80, N = 89,187). We also found that heterosexual men were more likely to report engaging in anti-gay behavior (g. = 0.53, k = 7, N = 2,509), endorsing gay stereotypes (g. = 0.17, k = 17, N = 6,936), and wanting to avoid contact with gay men (g. = 0.49, k = 7, N = 2,178). However, heterosexual women reported a stronger desire to avoid contact with lesbians than did heterosexual men (g. = -0.36, k = 5, N = 1,339). For the most part, gender differences remained stable over time; the exceptions were attitudes toward same-gender sexual behavior and attitudes toward lesbian and gay civil rights, which showed small increases. Gender differences in anti-gay prejudice were mediated by gender differences in traditional gender-role beliefs. Moderator variables included participant group, type of measure, and target group.

T1  - Conversational Epistemic Injustice: Extending the Insight from Testimonial Injustice to Speech Acts beyond Assertion
AN  - 2580196736
AB  - Testimonial injustice occurs when hearers attribute speakers a credibility deficit because of an identity prejudice and consequently dismiss speakers’ testimonial assertions. Various philosophers explain testimonial injustice by appealing to interpersonal norms arising within testimonial exchanges. When conversational participants violate these interpersonal norms, they generate second-personal epistemic harms, harming speakers as epistemic agents. This focus on testimony, however, neglects how systematically misevaluating speakers’ knowledge affects conversational participants more generally. When hearers systematically misevaluate speakers’ conversational competence because of entrenched assumptions about what speakers know, I call these conversational epistemic injustices. I argue the same epistemic harm in testimonial injustice arises for non-assertoric speech acts, generating conversational epistemic injustices. For across speech acts, deflated knowledge attributions create second-personal harms that prevent speakers from using their knowledge in linguistic exchanges, limiting their epistemic agency. These harms however are not reducible to linguistic harms, (e.g.,) silencing or discursive injustice. This article applies insight from how second-personal epistemic harm arises in testimonial exchanges to conversational exchanges more generally, demonstrating that epistemic injustices arise beyond testimonial exchanges and contexts of inquiry because deflated knowledge attributions undermine general conversational norms requiring participants assume each other’s conversational competence, generating conversational epistemic injustices.

T1  - Bisexual Stereotypes Apply Differently by Body Size: An Assessment of Bisexual Prototypicality, Trait Application, and Body Size
AN  - 2638855867
AB  - We blend person perception work with queer appearance psychology to examine the relationship between body size and bisexuality. In an online survey (N = 472, Mage = 25.15, 63.8% women), we examined the specific traits associated with a range of computer-modeled bodies identified as bisexual. We found that average body sizes were perceived as most prototypical of both bisexual men and bisexual women, skinny, and fat bodies were more associated with clusters of traits that contrast with common stereotypes about bisexuality. Additionally, we found that bisexual men were associated with increased masculinity and decreased femininity relative to bisexual women, and found a general, though nonsignificant trend such that bisexual men were perceived as having heightened androcentric desire relative to women. Finally, we found evidence for the role of typicality as a mediator of perceived prejudice; less prototypical bodies tended to be perceived as experiencing greater prejudice based on body size.

T1  - Beyond bias: response bias and interpersonal (in)sensitivity as a contributors to race disparities
AN  - 2582665855
AB  - In the present work, we review a growing programme of research identifying deficits in race-based interpersonal sensitivity, specifically emotion detection, as a route to creating pitfalls in interracial interactions and generating race-based disparities. Most existing research examining race disparities takes a bias perspective – focusing on how stereotypes and prejudice can make judgements more positive or negative as a mechanism underlying race-based inequality. We review this literature, while also providing evidence that differential sensitivity – more accurately reading cues and signals of ingroup and majority group members than outgroup and minority group members – can also serve as a mechanism underlying race-based discrimination. We propose that an integrated perspective encompassing sensitivity and response bias as routes to intergroup inequality may offer researchers a novel approach to existing intergroup questions as well as a generative perspective on intergroup research programmes.

T1  - North American Attitudes toward Immigrants and Immigration in the Time of COVID-19: The Role of National Attachment and Threat
AN  - 2614690274
AB  - Using a cross-national representative survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine predictors of attitudes toward immigrants and immigration in Canada and the United States, including general and COVID-related nationalism, patriotism, and perceived personal and national economic and health threats. In both countries, nationalism, particularly COVID-related nationalism, predicted perceptions that immigration levels were too high and negative attitudes toward immigrants. Patriotism predicted negative immigration attitudes in the United States but not in Canada, where support for immigration and multiculturalism are part of national identity. Conversely, personal and national economic threat predicted negative immigration attitudes in Canada more than in the United States. In both countries, national health threat predicted more favorable views of immigration levels and attitudes toward immigrants, perhaps because many immigrants have provided frontline health care during the pandemic. Country-level cognition in context drives immigration attitudes and informs strategies for supporting more positive views of immigrants and immigration.

T1  - Tolerance towards difference: Adaptation and psychometric properties of the Spanish version of a new measure of tolerance and sex-moderated relations with prejudice
AN  - 2592349157
AB  - The present research aims at adapting to the Spanish context and language a measure of tolerance toward diversity recently developed, at analyzing its psychometric properties, and at examining the moderating effect of participants' sex on the relations between tolerance and prejudice. We conducted two studies considering two Spanish samples taken from the general population. In Study 1 (N = 586; 70.5 % females; Mage = 37.77, SD = 12.34) we confirmed the three-factorial structure of the questionnaire (i.e., acceptance of diversity, respect for diversity and appreciation of diversity) and their invariance across sex groups. In Study 2 (N = 333; 60.4 % females; Mage = 36.20, SD = 13.36) evidence of validity based on the relations of tolerance with prejudice (modern racism, hostile sexism, and benevolent sexism) are presented. Additional findings reveal the role of the appreciation of diversity dimension to reduce prejudice, as well as differences between men and women in this relation: when participants express low appreciation of diversity, men show more hostile sexism and modern racism than women. Such differences did not emerge for those who highly appreciate diversity. The implications of using this multidimensional questionnaire to measure tolerance are discussed.

AB  - Este artículo presenta resultados de una medición de color de piel realizada en Argentina en 2017. Se combinaron indicadores atri-buidos y autoperceptivos para dar cuenta de la cantidad de personas no asimilables al estereotipo por el cual históricamente se ha intentado des-cribir a la población argentina como 'blanca' y descendiente de europeos. Se presentan resultados (n=5 729) que muestran que, lejos de tratarse de un país compuesto exclusivamente por personas de origen 'europeo-blanco', 40% de la población urbana no se clasifica en ese grupo. Estos resultados permiten realizar una aproximación a la cantidad de personas potencialmente objeto de prejuicios raciales, las cuales no se reconocen a sí mismas –ni fueron clasificadas– bajo la categoría fenotípica de 'blanco'.Alternate abstract:This article presents the results of a skin color measurement undertaken in Argentina in 2017. Attributed and self-perceptive indicators were combined to measure the number of people who do not match the stereotype according to which the Argentine population has historically been described as "white" and descended from Europeans. The results (n=5729) show that, far from being a country comprised exclusively of people of 'white-European' origin, 40% of the urban population are not considered part of that group. These results make it pos-sible to estimate the number of people potentially subject to racial prejudice, since they do not recognize themselves -nor were they classified- under the phenotypic category of "white".

T1  - Explaining Unfavorable Attitudes Toward Religious Out‐Groups Among Three Major Religions
AN  - 2574660234
AB  - Considering intensifying sectarian conflicts in recent years and increasing interreligious violence around the globe, there is a need to further our understanding of negative attitudes toward religious out‐groups. To investigate the driving factors behind these negative attitudes among members of the three major Abrahamic religions, I employ original data derived from a survey fielded among 10,046 respondents in eight countries (Cyprus, Germany, Israel, Kenya, Lebanon, Palestine, Turkey, and the USA). A rich body of literature documents the relationship between religious fundamentalism and prejudice. Other scholars have investigated out‐group hostility using an intergroup relations perspective, focusing on contact theory, and more recently, on discrimination. While controlling for other relevant factors such as demographic and socioeconomic variables, I investigate the role of religiosity and intergroup relations in explaining unfavorable interreligious attitudes. The results suggest that unfavorable attitudes toward religious out‐groups are most strongly associated with religious fundamentalism. This finding is robust across religious groups.

T1  - Believing in the American Dream Sustains Negative Attitudes toward Those in Poverty
AN  - 2570005224
AB  - A critical lever in the fight against poverty is to improve attitudes toward those living in poverty. Attempting to understand the factors that impact these attitudes, we ask: Does believing that meritocracy exists (descriptive meritocracy) sustain negative attitudes? Using cross-sectional (N = 301) and experimental (N = 439) methods, we found that belief in the United States as a meritocracy is associated with blaming people living in poverty and predicts negative attitudes toward them. Replicating and extending these findings, we experimentally manipulated beliefs in meritocracy and blame. Weakening American Dream beliefs predicted improved attitudes toward those in poverty. Understanding the nuanced role of belief systems in attitudes toward those in poverty provides strategies for promoting more positive thoughts and feelings.

T1  - The Role of Perceived Support and Perceived Prejudice in the Health of LGBT Soldiers
AN  - 2564698681
AB  - IntroductionVery little is known about factors that underlie the behavioral health status of LBGT compared with heterosexual soldiers. To address this knowledge gap, the current study explored the potential mechanistic roles of perceived prejudice and support for the LGBT community as they related to observed differences in behavioral health symptoms between LGBT and heterosexual soldiers.MethodsBetween May 10 and 12, 2016, a sample of active-duty soldiers (N = 759) completed a battery of study measures while attending an academic training institute. Latent variable models using diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) estimation were used to test for the direct and indirect effects of LGBT identity on behavioral health symptoms when treating perceived prejudice and support as simultaneous mediators.ResultsThere is no evidence for a direct effect of LGBT identity on behavioral health symptoms after accounting for the role of perceived prejudice and support. There are indirect effects of LGBT status on these behavioral health outcomes manifested through shared associations with perceived support for and prejudice against the LBGT community.ConclusionsEven though “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is no longer an explicit guideline, there are critical differences in the experience of LGBT and heterosexual soldiers, which may explain differences in mental and behavioral health. Specifically, perceived prejudice and perceived support appear to play a mechanistic role in those differences.Policy ImplicationsThe culture of the military following the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell continues to impact both heterosexual and LGBT Soldiers. Understanding the mechanistic role culture plays in the behavioral health of LGBT Soldiers may be one means of addressing their behavioral health needs.

T1  - Sex Differences in the Attitudes of Australian and Indian Heterosexual Individuals toward Gay Men, Lesbians, Bisexual Men and Bisexual Women
AN  - 2601155972
AB  - In the present study, the attitudes of heterosexual individuals toward same-sex attracted individuals were investigated. Heterosexual Indian and Australian participants (n = 472; 254 males) completed a series of measures indexing participants’ attitudes toward lesbians, gay men and bisexual individuals. Overall, compared to Australians, Indians held attitudes that were more negative and less favorable toward same-sex attracted individuals. Australians held more negative attitudes toward bisexual than toward lesbian/gay individuals, a difference that did not occur for Indian participants. Additionally, male participants from Australia and India reported attitudes that were more negative and less favorable toward men who were gay or bisexual in comparison to women of either sexual orientation. These results suggest that cultural context may shape heterosexual attitudes toward lesbian/gay and bisexual individuals and highlight the importance of examining cross-cultural differences in sexual prejudice. Keywords: attitudes, sex differences, sexual orientation, cross-cultural differences.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15299716.2021.1992328 .

T1  - From “Oh, you’re Chinese . . . ” to “No bats, thx!”: Racialized Experiences of Australian-Based Chinese Queer Women in the Mobile Dating Context
AN  - 2583827949
AB  - This article explores racial exclusion, bias, and prejudice in the context of same-sex mobile dating, focusing on the experiences of a group of Australian-based Chinese queer women. Semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant observation were used to examine participants’ racialized experiences. The findings indicate that Western dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, and HER, served as crucial channels of these women’s interracial and intercultural encounters while living in Australia. However, they largely perceived these apps, and HER in particular, as White-dominated and ill-suited to their dating practices, thus reinforcing their sense of exclusion and ostracism. Although the participants frequently encountered subtle prejudice on dating apps, they experienced more blatant and aggressive forms of racism triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple factors, including their language capability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and their racial, ethnic, and diasporic identities, played an intersectional role in these women’s racialized experiences. Correspondingly, the participants developed diverse interpretations of and responses to their racialized experiences. This study reveals how the anti-Asian racism in the global West permeates the realm of queer women in the context of mobile dating. It contributes to understanding the digital dating practices and racialized experiences of queer women and the broader Chinese diaspora.

T1  - Unmasking the American death penalty debate: Race, context, and citizens’ willingness to execute
AN  - 2579363138
AB  - Research on public attitudes toward the death penalty has yet to systematically examine the role of race in the context of offense‐related attributes. This study uses a conjoint experiment randomly exposing a sample of 500 U.S. adults to different pairings of capital offenders to test the role of both offender and offense‐related attributes on beliefs about death penalty deservingness. The results show offense‐related factors play a significant role in who the public deems deserving of the death penalty, while the offender's race matters only for citizens holding prejudicial opinions towards Blacks or Latinos. Instrumental considerations typically outweigh racial considerations in death penalty judgments, although perceptions of those factors might be racialized as well. The results point to a potential disjuncture between the desires of citizens and the implementation of the death penalty.

T1  - Racial prejudice, education, and views of climate change
AN  - 2579357740
AB  - ObjectiveWe examine the role of education in shaping attitudes about climate change and how it interacts with racial prejudice.MethodsWe analyze data from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Study (ANES) and 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES).ResultsWe identify a paradoxical relationship in which education is associated with both lower levels of racial prejudice and increased support for climate policies, but also strengthens the negative effects of prejudices that persist at higher levels of educational attainment. For individuals with racially prejudiced views, we find that educational attainment decreases both agreement with the scientific consensus and support for climate policies. Our results hold up in evaluating Democrats and Republicans and using alternative measures of racial bias.ConclusionOur results contribute to our understanding of the barriers to action on climate change and the continued salience of racial prejudice in the United States.

T1  - MISSING THE MISJOINDER MARK: IMPROVING CRIMINAL JOINDER OF OFFENSES IN CAPITAL-SENTENCING JURISDICTIONS
AN  - 2566535048
AB  - In all state and federal jurisdictions in the United States, joinder allows prosecutors to join multiple offenses against a criminal defendant. Joinder pervades the American criminal justice system, and some jurisdictions see joinder in more than half of their cases. Most states and the federal courts use a liberal joinder system where courts may join offenses regardless of their severity or punishment. These systems derive from judicial efficiency arguments, seeking to avoid unnecessary trials and striving to conserve time, money, and other resources. In a liberal joinder regime, the court may force a defendant to prepare for a trial in which she must simultaneously defend against a misdemeanor offense, like possession of marijuana, and a capital felony offense with a potential death sentence-even though the two charges may require completely different defense strategies. Jurisdictions should no longer broadly protect the joinder of all types of offenses in the name ofjudicial efficiency or juridical discretion. Instead, jurisdictions should categorically protect defendants charged with capital offenses from the potentially prejudicial nature of joinder, as Louisiana has for nearly a century. Born from the state 's unique judicial history, Louisiana's joinder regime restricts joinder to those offenses which are triable by the same "mode of trial," a phrase that has undergone statutory interpretation, constitutional examination, and judicial scrutiny. Louisiana offers its criminal defendants a structural, procedural protection by prohibiting the joinder of capital offenses with noncapital offenses. Although other scholars have published articles and studies criticizing joinder regimes, pointing out the ways in which offenses' joinder may prejudice defendants, or presenting data to show prejudice 's existence in practice, none have yet suggested-as this Article does-that jurisdictions revise their joinder regimes to prohibit the joinder of capital and noncapital offenses. If jurisdictions revised their joinder schemes in this way, they could maintain liberal joinder regimes for the most common criminal cases, where joinder is most efficient, without continuing to hinder those defendants who face the most serious consequences and the highest stakes during their trials. This Article first discusses the history and current status of joinder in most jurisdictions, followed by the history and current status of joinder in Louisiana. It then explains capital-offense joinder in Louisiana and how it differs from other jurisdictions in the United States. The Article further analyzes the arguments for liberal joinder and critiques them by presenting research in the field, practical considerations, and historical arguments. The Article concludes by urging other jurisdictions, particularly those with capital sentencing capabilities or capital offense punishments, to amend their joinder provisions to prevent the joinder of capital offenses with noncapital offenses. If jurisdictions revised their joinder schemes in this way, they could maintain liberal joinder regimes for the most common criminal cases, where joinder is most efficient, without continuing to hinder those defendants who face the most serious consequences and the highest stakes during their trials.

T1  - COVID-19 and prejudice against migrants: the mediating roles of need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations. A comparative study
AN  - 2556552495
AB  - What mitigates prejudice against migrants in situations of uncertainty? Addressing this question, we explored how individuals with greater COVID-19 concern perceive migrants as a greater threat and show prejudice against them, indirectly through the mechanism of need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations.This study was conducted in two European countries: Malta and Italy. Six hundred and seventy-six individuals participated in this quantitative study (Malta: N = 204; Italy N = 472). Results from this study showed that the need for cognitive closure and binding moral foundations mediate the relationship between COVID-19 concern and prejudice against migrants in both countries. When testing the three binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity), the authority foundation seems to be the most consistent predictor.The implications of the findings contribute to theories about how situational uncertainty caused by COVID-19, together with the need for epistemic certainty and binding morality, contribute to increased prejudiced attitudes against migrants.

T1  - Mind the Job: The Role of Occupational Characteristics in Explaining Gender Discrimination
AN  - 2542530343
AB  - Using correspondence testing, we investigate how job characteristics affect gender discrimination in hiring. In particular, we analyse whether discrimination against women is moderated by the occupation’s sex composition, required level of decision-making and expected educational level. To do so, we carried out a correspondence study in 2016, in which we sent two pairs of matched male–female applications to 1371 job postings for a heterogeneous selection of occupations in two large cities in Spain. Differences in response rates and response order by gender were then used as a tool to assess discrimination. The results show that job characteristics matter for gender discrimination and that their effects are complementary. Women were particularly discriminated against in connection with jobs that involved decision-making, in male-dominated and mixed occupations, and in jobs requiring both high and low education levels. This discrimination is likely to stem from the activation of both stereotypes and prejudices.

T1  - Being a Woman in the Turkish Criminal Justice System
AN  - 2509919297
AB  - In Turkey, discrimination against women has cultural, sociological, and legal causes. Education, health, employment, and social life carry traces of gender discrimination. Gender inequality also occurs in the legal field. Especially in the criminal justice system, women experience disadvantages compared to men. Despite the gender-neutral laws, discrimination is widespread and affects law enforcement, which is dominated by patriarchal social codes and prejudices. This study aims to focus on women as victims and offenders in the Turkish criminal justice system, with examples and assessments from investigation of the corrections system.

T1  - When racism and sexism benefit Black and female politicians: Politicians' ideology moderates prejudice's effect more than politicians' demographic background.
AN  - 2553020873
AB  - Using large samples that are nationally diverse or nationally representative (total N = 44,836), this article presents evidence that citizens' prejudice does not usually benefit or undermine politicians who are from a particular demographic group, as many past studies assumed; instead, citizens' prejudice is associated with support for conservative politicians and opposition to liberal politicians, regardless of politicians' demographic background. Study 1a and Study 1b show that, regardless of the race and gender of real politicians, racism and sexism negatively predict support for liberal politicians, and positively predict support for conservative politicians. This overall pattern is experimentally confirmed in Study 2 where participants evaluate a hypothetical politician. Using data collected between 1972 and 2016, Study 3 shows that, historically, the predictive effect of racism and sexism on support for politicians in general is moderated by politicians' perceived ideology. Study 4 addresses a limitation of Study 1–3, and Study 5 extends the results for prejudice to the religious domain (i.e., prejudice toward Muslims). Together, these studies suggest that the way prejudice is related to support for a politician is primarily moderated by the politician's political ideology, not the politician's demographic background. Thus, this article highlights the often-overlooked role of politicians' ideology, clarifying theories that explain how citizens' prejudice is translated into their political preferences.

T1  - Cross-Cultural Comparisons in Implicit and Explicit Age Bias
AN  - 2524148244
AB  - Most research documenting bias against older adults has been conducted in individualistic and industrialized cultures. In the current study, we examined cultural variation in attitudes toward older adults and subjective age in a large sample of 911,982 participants (Mage = 27.42, SD = 12.23; 67.6% women) from 68 different countries (Msize = 12,077; Mdnsize = 425.5). We hypothesized that age bias would be lower among those living in highly collectivistic countries. We found that living in collectivistic countries was associated with less implicit and explicit age bias, and greater feelings of warmth toward older adults compared with highly individualistic countries. Given the impact of age bias and prejudice on both the targets and perpetrators of bias, further research is needed to examine the causes of and interventions for bias against older adults.

T1  - Whiteness, Anti-Blackness, and Trauma: A Grounded Theory of White Racial Meaning Making
AN  - 2547567729
AB  - This constructivist grounded theory study reveals nine interrelated components that describe white undergraduates' processes for making meaning of issues of race and racism in their environments. Findings also reveal how these processes perpetuate whiteness and anti-blackness. I present the theory as a composite counternarrative that draws upon data from 31 white undergraduate students and foregrounds Black students' experiences with racism on campus. The resulting juxtaposition highlights how whiteness and anti-blackness, on a spiritual level, function as pathologies that perpetuate trauma.

AB  - La Escala de Amenaza Grupal Internalizada, es un instrumento que mide el prejuicio percibido por inmigrantes latinoamericanos desde la teoría de la amenaza. El objetivo de la investigación fue evaluar las propiedades psicométricas de esta escala en inmigrantes latinoamericanos que viven en Chile. A través de una metodología no-experimental, que tuvo un muestro no probabilístico, se realizaron dos estudios de corte transversal, en donde participaron un total de 722 inmigrantes. Los hallazgos del primer estudio, a partir de un análisis factorial exploratorio, evidencian una estructura unifactorial de la Escala de Amenaza Grupal Internalizada y un coeficiente omega de .87. Por su parte, los resultados del segundo estudio, a partir de un análisis factorial confirmatorio, corroboran la estructura factorial de la escala para un modelo de 7 ítems con adecuados índices de ajuste y cargas factoriales mayores a .50. Así también, se encontraron correlaciones estadísticamente significativas, inversas y moderadas con la Escala de Autoestima y la Escala de Identidad Étnica Multigrupo. Finalmente, se halló un coeficiente omega de .89. Se concluye, que la Escala de Amenaza Grupal Internalizada cuenta con adecuadas propiedades psicométricas para su uso con inmigrantes latinoamericanos que residen en Chile.Alternate abstract:The Internalized Group Threat Scale is an instrument that measures the prejudice perceived by Latin American immigrants from the threat theory.

T1  - To be or not to be tolerant? A Terror Management perspective exploring the ideological dilemma of tolerance and prejudice
AN  - 2509222933
AB  - Tolerance has been identified as a way to reduce prejudice. However, tolerance has also been posited as an ideological dilemma and may have its limits. The present research explores this idea, utilizing insights from Terror Management Theory. Three studies were conducted using online samples. Study 1 found that a tolerance prime led to less discrimination towards Muslims after being reminded of death, but increased discrimination when reminded of terrorism. Additionally, tolerance did not affect levels of affective prejudice. Study 2 found that reading an essay that threatened the norm of tolerance led to increased levels of death‐thought accessibility and worldview defence, particularly amongst liberal participants. Study 3 found that a tolerance prime attenuated mortality salience decreasing support for author rights, but not if the worldview critic was intolerant. Taken together, the present findings suggest that using tolerance to reduce prejudice and foster more positive intergroup relations has its boundaries. If others are perceived to not be tolerant themselves, then people may be more motivated to defend, rather than uphold the norm of tolerance.

T1  - Envisioning Equal Opportunities in the Civil Claims, Voluntary Associations, and Citizen Science of the Modern United States
AN  - 2507713267
AB  - This issue considers the fragile alliances that have nourished reform efforts across the modern United States. Over the past two hundred years, an array of institutions and associations provided the mechanisms through which individuals might challenge inequalities rooted in sex or gender biases alongside those steeped in racial or class prejudices. But time and again, these movements' supporters leveraged one identity over another, required individuals to amplify gender over race, or race over class, and left legacies of injustice in their wake. In government offices dedicated to protecting equal employment opportunities and in civil courtrooms, in labor union auxiliaries and brigades, in voluntary associations that provided for migrants' needs, and in citizen science projects, women found tools to demand greater equity for themselves or resources for their families, but often deployed these at the expense of their neighbors or coworkers.

T1  - The Color of Electoral Success: Estimating the Effect of Skin Tone on Winning Elections in Mexico
AN  - 2509228430
AB  - ObjectiveEvidence suggests that voters’ prejudices may lead them to take information shortcuts in choosing political leaders. This study analyzes whether the skin tone of 12,798 candidates influenced the outcome of their electoral campaigns.MethodsTo determine the probability of winning an election, we estimate a linear regression where skin tone is used as an explanatory variable, with controls such as sex and political party. Based on the number of votes obtained by each candidate, we estimate an ordered logit model.ResultsCandidates with dark brown skin tones face a probability of winning that is 20–38 percent less than those with intermediate skin color. A one standard deviation increase in skin tone is associated with an 8 percent decrease in the probability of finishing in first place.ConclusionSkin color influences electoral outcomes. Public policies should therefore ensure equal access and true representativeness.

T1  - Avoiding information about one’s romantic partner
AN  - 2625220807
AB  - Research links open communication and self-disclosure to a host of beneficial outcomes in romantic relationships, including better relationship quality, relationship satisfaction, feelings of closeness and commitment, and relationship longevity. However, learning some information about a partner may evoke negative consequences. In two studies, we examined the types of information people may wish to avoid learning about their past or current romantic partners (Study 1), and individual differences in avoidance of information about a current romantic partner (Study 2). Content-coding of data from Study 1 revealed that a majority (51%) of respondents wished to avoid information related to their partner’s history of sexual behavior and/or infidelity. In Study 2, participants who were older and who scored higher on measures of anxious and avoidant attachment were more likely to want to avoid information about their partner. Furthermore, replicating and extending Study 1, participants most wished to avoid information about their partners’ prior sexual behavior and/or infidelity, as well as their partners’ prejudices. We interpret our findings in terms of a threat-management framework for information avoidance, suggesting that threats to the self and relationship may influence the decision to avoid information about a romantic partner.

T1  - ‘Crocodiles in the Corridors’: Security Vetting, Race and Whitehall, 1945–1968
AN  - 2495192861
AB  - In July 2018, the UK’s Intelligence & Security Committee issued a report into diversity and inclusion across the intelligence and security community. The picture the report painted was far from satisfactory; in short, Britain’s intelligence agencies did not ‘fully reflect the ethnic make-up of modern Britain’. The report argued that Britain’s spy agencies – MI5, SIS (or MI6) and GCHQ – should improve black, Asian and ethnic minority recruitment, highlighting areas for improvement, especially around the vetting of recruits. This problem stems from the post-war Cold War ‘security state’ and the development of security-vetting programmes from the 1940s, aiming to protect Whitehall from Soviet spies and ‘fellow travellers’ to those with so-called ‘character defects’– drink, drugs and homosexuality. But this ‘security state’ also saw the newly emerging multicultural Britain as a major threat. The so-called ‘Windrush Generation’ of migrants from the Caribbean, and migration from the Indian subcontinent and Africa, forever changed the social complexion of Britain, but posed significant questions for security officials. What was Britishness? With first or second generation migrants entering the civil service, who was a ‘UK eye’ and what access to secret information should they have? To what extent was discrimination justifiable to protect state secrets, and how should officials respond to new legislation such as the Race Discrimination Act? As this article shows, new entrants to the civil service faced deeply engrained prejudices, and questions over their loyalty to Britain. As late as the 1960s (and beyond), ‘coloured’ members of the civil service were rejected from secret posts across government, including the Ministry of Defence and intelligence and security services, especially MI5 and GCHQ, with discrimination on ‘security’ grounds justified by the landmark 1968 Race Relations Act, which barred race discrimination for housing and employment elsewhere.

T1  - Why Black‐Majority Neighbourhoods Are The Epicentre Of Population Shrinkage In The American Rust Belt
AN  - 2484667878
AB  - Despite a clear association between the most African‐American neighbourhoods and overall population shrinkage in Rust Belt cities, few have explored the theoretical challenges that this poses. First, if racial prejudice is the key ingredient for this relationship, why would this result in overall population loss and not simply a reduction of White residents? Second, why if stigmatisation generates the pre‐conditions for in‐migration and investment – as the gentrification and urban ecologies literatures suggest – why would Black neighbourhoods not be the epicentre of population growth? This paper explores these questions through a theoretical synthesis of the residential choice, shrinking cities, and racial prejudice literatures. I rely on an intra‐city examination of neighbourhood change in Cleveland, Detroit and Pittsburgh. I argue that three factors in shrinking Rust Belt cities limit the application of more general neighbourhood change paradigms: (i) the persistence of racial prejudice; (ii) abundant housing supply; and (iii) housing stock characteristics.

T1  - Be careful what you say! – Evaluative change based on instructional learning generalizes to other similar stimuli and to the wider category
AN  - 2483610951
AB  - In evaluative conditioning, a conditional stimulus (CS; e.g. a neutral picture) acquires positive/negative valence if it is paired with a pleasant/unpleasant unconditional stimulus (US; e.g. a positive/negative picture). This valence generalises to other stimuli similar to the CS and to the wider CS category. Being informed that the CS will be paired with the US induces a similar change in valence (instructional learning), but it is not clear whether instructional learning would also generalise. In Experiment 1, participants were informed that one shape would be paired with pleasant and another with unpleasant images. These instructions instilled conditional valence to the CSs which generalised to different shapes from the same category (generalisation stimuli). In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding in an implicit measure using stimuli varying in perceptual features. Participants were informed that three CSs from one category (e.g. vegetables) would be paired with pleasant images and three CSs from a second category (e.g. office supplies) would be paired with unpleasant images. This instruction instilled conditional valence to the CSs which generalised to novel exemplars from the same categories. This suggests that conditional valence instilled via instructions generalises to other stimuli – a finding with implications for prejudice and racism.

T1  - Ethical Considerations for Humanizing Refugee Research Trajectories
AN  - 2604876265
AB  - This paper argues that ethical responsibilities in refugee studies have focused on fieldwork, yet ethics ought to be applied to the research problematic-the aims, questions, and concepts-as potentially implicated in the production of harm. Using an example from Tanzania, I argue that policy has largely shaped the language, categories investigated, and interpretive frames of refugee research, and this article advocates greater attention to historical and contemporary processes underpinning humanitarian principles and practices, and how they might contribute to exclusion and ontological anxieties among refugees in the Global South. By expanding our conceptualization of ethical responsibilities, researchers can better explore the suitability, and the implications for the refugee communities, of the approach that they have adopted and whether they contribute or challenge the and dehumanization of people seeking refuge.Alternate abstract:Cet article soutient que les responsabilités éthiques dans les études sur les réfugiés se sont concentrées sur le terrain de recherche alors que l'éthique devrait également s'appliquer à la problématique de recherche - les objectifs, les questions et les concepts pouvant potentiellement causer préjudice. À partir d'un exemple issu de la Tanzanie, cet article soutient que les politiques publiques ont largement façonné le langage, les catégories étudiées ainsi que les cadres interprétatifs de la recherche sur les réfugiés, et préconise de porter une plus grande attention aux processus de racialisation historiques et contemporains qui sous-tendent les principes et pratiques humanitaires, ainsi qu'à la manière dont ils peuvent contribuer à l'exclusion et aux anxiétés ontologiques chez les réfugiés du Sud global. En élargissant la conceptualisation des responsabilités éthiques, les chercheurs sont mieux à même d'explorer la pertinence et les implications de l'approche qu'ils ont adoptée pour les communautés de réfugiés, et dans quelle mesure ils contribuent àla racialisation et la déshumanisation des personnes cherchant refuge ou la remettent en cause.

TT  - Supporting her family in the context of forced migration as a Syrian woman living in Quebec and Lebanon: between vulnerabilities and ambivalent responsibilities
AN  - 2604875852
AB  - Although the vulnerability of refugee women is a cornerstone of access to protection, it is rarely defined beyond its common-sense meaning - the risk of suffering harm. This article presents the results of an empirical research where 12 life histories were collected from Syrian refugee women responsible for supporting their families in Lebanon (7) and Québec (5). The analysis mobilized the concept of ambivalent vulnerability (Oliviero, 2016) and showed that women and their relatives were certainly exposed to forms of adversity, but also to transformative opportunities and to elements of continuity with their life trajectories.Alternate abstract:Même si la vulnérabilité constitue une des pierres angulaires de l'accès à la protection et aux services d'aide humanitaire pour les personnes réfugiées, elle fait rarement l'objet d'une définition en dehors du sens commun - le risque de subir un préjudice - et de son usage comme outil de mesure de la précarité socioéconomique. Cet article propose d'élargir les contours de cette notion en s'appuyant sur une recherche empirique ancrée dans l'approche théorique féministe transnationale (Mohanty, 2003; McLaren, 2017; Zeweri, 2017) qui visait à documenter les expériences d'un groupe de femmes réfugiées considérées comme particulièrement vulnérables puisque détenant la responsabilité du soutien financier et des soins du quotidien de leur famille (HCR, 2014). Des entrevues de type récits de vie ont ainsi été effectuées avec 12 femmes réfugiées en provenance de Syrie détenant la responsabilité principale du soutien leur famille au Liban (7 femmes) et au Québec (5 femmes). Le cadre conceptuel de la vulnérabilité ambivalente (Oliviero, 2016) est mobilisé afin de faire ressortir la complexité des sources de difficultés, d'opportunités, de continuités qui caractérisent les expériences des femmes en contexte de migration forcée. L'article conclut avec la nécessité d'ancrer les pratiques de recherche et d'intervention auprès des personnes réfugiées dans des cadres conceptuels et méthodologiques dynamiques, inclusifs et solidaires qui permettent de placer au centre la voix des premières concernées et une prise en compte élargie de leurs expériences en contexte de migration forcée.

T1  - Positioning Religion in International Relations: The Performative, Discursive, and Relational Dimension of Religious Soft Power
AN  - 2602171788
AB  - Amidst the global religious resurgence in the post-secular world, the field of international relations finds itself unwilling or unable to situate religion back to theoretical paradigms subject to the Westphalian–Enlightenment prejudice. Advocates of religion’s theoretical and empirical significance often turn to religious soft power, a burgeoning theory that gradually becomes the anchorage of discussion but still suffers from conceptual ambiguity and limited explanatory capacity. This essay endeavors to fill in this lacuna by presenting the interdisciplinary attempt to integrate soft power in IR with the three dimensions of power in sociology, which results in a typology of performative, discursive, and relational dimensions of religious soft power. The explanatory and predictive capacity of this model is tested in the empirical case of the evangelical group’s influence on US foreign policy of the post 9/11 Global War on Terror. A process-level historical account based on archival sources furthers scholars’ knowledge of transnational religious actors’ ability to seize both systematic transformations at the international level and contentious dynamics in the domestic environment, which generates a reorientation in norms, identities, and values that contributes to the outcome of foreign policy, thereby answering the un-addressed question of how religion influences domestic and international politics. The bridging of IR, sociology, and historical sociology, three fields often intertwined, suggests a future direction for not only the religious return to IR but also the overcoming of the “intellectual autism” of this discipline, which needs to be better prepared for continuous challenges of soaring populism, nationalism, and clash of civilizations in the twenty-first century.

T1  - An Action Research Framework for Religion and the Stigma of Suicide
AN  - 2584477068
AB  - Religious beliefs and practices have historically been intertwined with stigmatizing attitudes and responses to suicide, including stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. Understanding the relationship between religion and suicide stigma requires identifying specific religious beliefs and practices about suicide and how these are informed by broader worldviews, such as ethics, anthropology, and afterlife beliefs. Yet, research in this area has been complicated by the complex multidimensional nature of stigma and the diversity of religious beliefs and practices, even within religious traditions. Moreover, contrary arguments about the role of religious views of suicide in suicide prevention, specifically whether religious stigma is protective or instead contributes to risk, have obscured the interpretation of findings. This paper aims to advance research on this topic by first summarizing pertinent empirical findings and theoretical perspectives on public and personal stigma towards people with suicidal ideation (PWSI), people with suicidal behavior (PWSB), and suicide loss survivors (SLS). Secondly, a culturally nuanced action research framework (ARF) of religious stigma towards suicide is provided to guide future research. According to this ARF, research should advance strategically by investigating associations of religious beliefs and practices with stigmatization, identifying empowering resources within particular religious traditions, supporting suicide prevention efforts, and developing effective interventions to support PWSI, PWSB, and SLS. Moreover, such research efforts ought to equip religious leaders, and healthcare professionals working with religious individuals, to reduce stigma towards suicide and further the goal of suicide prevention.

T1  - IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATION PREVENTING DISCRIMINATION IN A SOUTH AFRICAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT
AN  - 2578202694
AB  - The average South African workplace is a melting pot for race, ethnicity, gender, and culture. This diverse workplace needs to be managed so that none of the employees feels discriminated against or prejudiced in any way. For this reason, the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (hereafter referred to as the Constitution, 1996) and subordinate legislation outlaws all forms of discrimination in and outside the workplace. The promulgation of legislation alone is no guarantee that there will not be discrimination; hence, this article assesses the effectiveness of legislation implementation.The results show that the department needs to intensify its efforts to ensure that discrimination of any kind is prevented and that employees are aware of legislation meant to protect them and procedures which need to be followed.

T1  - Whose lives mattered? How White and Black Americans felt about Black Lives Matter in 2016
AN  - 2533412241
AB  - White Americans, on average, do not support Black Lives Matter, while Black Americans generally express strong support. The lack of support among white Americans is striking, and we argue that it matters why this racial gap exists. Using a nationally representative survey collected during the crest of the first wave of widespread attention to the movement, we explore four potential explanations for interracial differences in feelings toward Black Lives Matter. These explanations reflect competing claims made by advocates and opponents of the movement and have distinct implications for understanding the meaning of these racial differences. Two explanations focus on attitudes toward the police, and two focus on racial prejudice. The results suggest that interracial differences in contact with the police mattered to views of the movement, though in opposite ways for white and Black Americans. Support for the movement among Black Americans was not motivated by an animosity toward the police. Ultimately, the lack of white support for Black Lives Matter was best explained by anti-Black animus and racial resentment, reflecting a concern about the threat this contemporary civil rights movement presents to the racial status quo.

T1  - An institutional perspective on workplace incivility: case studies from academia
TT  - Institutional perspective on workplace incivility
AN  - 2533050069
AB  - PurposeThis research study looks at issues such as why does incivility occur, dynamics responsible for incivility with an emphasis on causes stimulated by the general context and its influence on the behavior of individuals, groups and organizations.Design/methodology/approachThis paper provides a fresh perspective on workplace incivility by integrating institutional theory with empirical data from two case studies from academic institutions located in different continents to understand incivility in organizations. A comparative case analysis across two different geographical regions is used to validate the argument that institutional antecedents can influence micro-level organizational events such as employee incivility despite variance in geographical locations and cultural dimensions.FindingsThe findings of the study reveal that academic institutions are subject to uncivil behaviors, which could be a direct offshoot of the historical and cultural beliefs of the society. The general context of the studied cases led to workplace incivility mainly in the form of racial prejudices and sectarianism transferred to the organizational day-to-day practice. The paper suggests a pragmatic view for possible interventions to humanize workplaces where it is better not to adopt a “one size fits all” recipe to deal with such a complex phenomenon.Originality/valueThis paper provides a macro-level analysis of workplace incivility by assuming an institutional perspective to explore the relationships if any between incivility experienced by employees within an organization and the wider political and historical structuration of the society.

T1  - Why public health framing matters: An experimental study of the effects of COVID-19 framing on prejudice and xenophobia in the United States
AN  - 2510602542
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus. However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.

T1  - Cui Bono? Partisanship and Attitudes Toward Refugees
AN  - 2480196150
AB  - ObjectiveThis paper tests the hypothesis that the expected partisan affiliation of refugee populations partially explains why white conservatives and white liberals have different attitudes toward refugee resettlement in the United States.MethodThis was tested with a preregistered survey experiment that examined how attitudes toward refugee resettlement changed depending on the racial and political characteristics of a theoretical refugee population.ResultsConservative opposition to refugee resettlement can be weakened if conservatives are given reasons to believe those refugees will support the Republican Party. At the same time, liberal support for refugees drops when they receive the same information.ConclusionAlthough white conservatives and white liberals exhibit different levels of racial prejudice, and this has consequences for their immigration and refugee policy preferences, their beliefs about how newcomers influence domestic partisan politics are also consequential.

T1  - Discrete Events and Hate Crimes: The Causal Role of the Brexit Referendum
AN  - 2480195812
AB  - ObjectiveThe article contributes to the literature on discrete events and behavioral change among the public by studying the link between the United Kingdom's 2016 “Brexit”referendum and racial and religious hate crime.MethodsTime series intervention models on daily and monthly hate crime numbers from the UK Home Office and police forces, controlling for other events such as terror attacks. A range of robustness tests including additional vector auto‐regression.ResultsThe Brexit referendum led to a 19–23 percent increase in hate crimes, but did not lead to a longer‐term increase. The results are robust to a range of alternative specifications, and there is no evidence of a relationship between media coverage of hate crime or immigration salience and hate crimes. The results also show the consistent, large effect of terror attacks on increasing the number of hate crimes.ConclusionThe Brexit referendum caused an increase in hate crimes on par with terror attacks. Discrete political events, like referendums and elections, can play a sizeable role in prejudicial behavioral change.

T1  - Can success deflect racism? Clothing and perceptions of African American men
AN  - 2474797047
AB  - We examined the effect of different clothing styles on the perceptions of African American men. Using a between-group design, we tested whether participants perception of African American models wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts (“swagger”), clothing showing they won an event, or formal clothing, would vary. Participants (N = 143) viewed four African American models in one of three conditions. Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) with Symbolic Racism Scale scores as a covariate revealed that participants rated models in Formal clothing significantly higher than models in winning clothing in intelligence, p <.001, trustworthiness, p <.001, and warmth p =.005. Models wearing formal clothing or winning clothing were also rated significantly higher than models wearing swagger clothing on several traits. Participant’s Symbolic Racism Score significantly affected their ratings of models. Results suggest that the clothing that an African American wears, as well as viewer prejudice, affects the impression that the viewer makes.

T1  - Gender Bias in Student Evaluations of Teaching: Students’ Self-Affirmation Reduces the Bias by Lowering Evaluations of Male Professors
AN  - 2474583607
AB  - Students evaluate male professors higher than female professors. In a study that we presented to participants as a test of a new form for student evaluations of teaching (SETs), we examined if self-affirmation (contemplating elements that positively contribute to one’s self-image) reduced the gender bias. Belgian students (n = 568), who were randomly assigned to self-affirm (through either a value-affirmation task or self-superiority priming) or not, read a vignette prompting them to imagine that they had received a good or a bad grade from a male or a female professor. They evaluated the course, the professor, and the form. Non-self-affirmed participants showed a gender bias after a bad grade, disadvantaging the female professor. Self-affirmation eradicated the gender bias by lowering evaluations for the male professor, suggesting that the gender bias involves overvaluing male rather than derogating female professors. Without self-affirmation, the positivity of the SETs was correlated with participants’ evaluation of the SET form itself. Self-affirmation inflated the correlation for the male professor and eradicated it for the female professor. Having students self-affirm before SETs may be useful when SETs are obligatory only. An even better approach is asking SETs before students learn their grades or simply abolish SETs as a factor in hiring and promotion decisions.

T1  - ‘calling‐out’ vs. ‘calling‐in’ prejudice: Confrontation style affects inferred motive and expected outcomes
AN  - 2474519753
AB  - Laypersons differentiate between two confrontations styles, varying in communication style, perceived motive, and typical context: call‐outs (typically public, non‐accommodating language, and self‐promoting confronter) and call‐ins (typically private, accommodating language, and education‐focused confronter). Popular press espouses a general preference for call‐ins relative to call‐outs, but no empirical work has addressed perceptions of these confrontation styles. To investigate the presumed efficacy of these styles, we modelled communicative differences with Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT), which explores the strategies individuals use to modulate communicative differences with interaction partners. The present studies examined third‐party perceptions of confronter motive and likely outcomes between call‐in and call‐out styles (Study 1) and between typical private and atypical public styles (Study 2) about an anti‐Black comment. We examined responses of participants who imagined themselves taking part in public vs. private call‐in and call‐out confrontations (Study 3). Results showed that these styles are seen as similarly effective in terms of target compliance and internalization, but as operating through different mechanisms. Specifically, call‐in styles facilitated positive inferences of motive, which fostered expectations of positive confrontation outcomes. Additionally, the effects of communication style superseded the impact of context. Results have implications for strategies allies can use to facilitate effective, educational confrontations of prejudice.

T1  - Brexit: The influence of motivation to respond without prejudice, willingness to disagree, and attitudes to immigration
AN  - 2474519452
AB  - Britain’s unexpected vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) in June 2016 has proved divisive and damaging both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Across two correlational studies, the current research proposed a model to explain the Brexit vote, with attitudes to immigration and willingness to disagree (WD) as direct predictors of the referendum result, and internal (IMS) and external (EMS) motivation to respond without prejudice as indirect predictors. Study 1 (N = 353) and Study 2 (N = 363) both showed good fit with the model and, respectively, explained 48% and 46% of the referendum result. More positive attitudes to immigration predicted a vote to remain. Higher IMS and lower EMS predicted a vote to remain, fully mediated by attitudes to immigration. In Study 1, lower WD also predicted a vote to remain, both directly and indirectly via attitudes to immigration, although this was not replicated in Study 2. These results are discussed both in relation to the Brexit result, and the implications for motivation to respond without prejudice, WD, and political correctness more generally.

T1  - Race, Entitlement, and Belonging: A Discursive Analysis of the Political Economy of Land in Zimbabwe
AN  - 2461414366
AB  - The access, control, and ownership of land and the means of production is an enduring frontier of conflict in post colonial settler states. Whilst racially tinged, colonialism created “structures of feeling” that sanctioned epistemic violence and created an economy of entitlement and belonging that sustained imperial designs. Zimbabwe’s independence meant the redistribution and proprietorship of land became a central leitmotif of cadastral politics. The article explores the interplay of the contested tropes of race, entitlement, and indigeneity as they informed the highly polarized land redistribution discourse. The discussion takes stock of the dominant narratives of post-colonial state predations, patronage, populism, and megalomania in contradistinction to the various ways in which whiteness and its prejudices and stereotypes nurtured some hubris of entitlement and belonging that retrogressively not only perpetuated colonial settler values and identities but also entrenched racial distance and indifference. The polarized contestations on land redistribution discourse coalesce around concepts such as restitution, indigeneity, nativity, patriotism, race, and class. Therefore while critiquing state excesses that have masked the honorable intentions of land redistribution, the article underscores the complex ways in which white Zimbabweans contributed to the enduring crisis by obdurately fixating their energies on colonial settler entitlements, values, and identities.

T1  - A Study on Affective Barriers in Intercultural Communication and Related Strategies
AN  - 2476869240
AB  - Intercultural communication acts a pivotal part in international activities and there are many barriers involved in it. If the communicators are short of the understanding of the barriers in the process of intercultural communication, especially the affective barriers, the whole interaction will be affected; even worse, there will be some serious conflicts. Thus, this paper will study the affective barriers in intercultural communication, analyze the possible causes of the barriers, and put forward some effective strategies to help communicators enhance their cross-cultural competence.

T1  - Changing prejudiced attitudes, promoting egalitarianism, and enhancing diversity through fundamental processes of persuasion
AN  - 2468556061
AB  - We review work from persuasion science relevant to reducing prejudiced attitudes. We begin by introducing the idea that the thoughts people generate – their number and valence – are critical for understanding when responding to persuasive attempts will result in egalitarian attitudes. A focus on thinking highlights the importance of understanding short and long-term attitude change in promoting diversity. How much people think is also consequential for spreading of initial change to more distal attitudes and generalization of change to other judgments. The second section describes a process of thought validation that emphasizes the importance of considering what people think and feel about their own thoughts. This meta-cognitive process is shown to make a difference in producing consequential changes in reducing prejudiced attitudes toward African Americans, immigrants, refugees, individuals with disabilities, and beyond. The conditions under which variables such as minority status and stigmatized sources affect elaboration and validation are also specified. The fourth section explores how these two processes are relevant for understanding explicit and implicit ambivalence and change in the domain of prejudiced attitudes. We highlight the utility of a process-oriented approach for designing future research and promoting more inclusive attitudes and actions.

T1  - Overlooked, forgotten, avoided: The LGBT community and public art
AN  - 2465814028
AB  - The LGBT public art that does exist can be sorted into four categories: memorials to notable LGBT individuals; 'pink triangle' memorials to gay victims of Nazi persecution during the 1930s and World War II; public art which commemorates events in LGBT communities' struggles for justice and equal rights; and alternative forms of LGBT public artworks which embed elements of previously overlooked LGBT history into public memory.

[...]provocation cannot always be the key objective of public art, especially if the work is to enjoy a permanent public existence.

In its attempts to be publicly palatable, the little public art that does exist to celebrate LGBT identity or memorialise LGBT trauma falls short in commemorating diverse communities, who are, instead, often left to fill this gap in public recognition with spontaneous decorations and alternate forms of commemoration.

Rumours of this unorthodox investigative method flew across the city, as did the ruinous rumour that there had been no rape victim at all; Wood had carried out the examination for his own pleasure.

T1  - Humility and Bridging Differences: A Systematic Literature Review of Humility in Relation to Diversity
AN  - 2499393062
AB  - Psychologists' interest in humility has increased in recent years. This paper provides the first review on the role of humility in the context of diversity. The results of the nine studies reviewed here, which were identified through a systematic literature search, show a lack of agreement among researchers on the conceptualisation of humility and how it can be measured. Additionally, humility has been found to be associated with less prejudice towards Syrian refuges, sexual minorities and religious groups. It also seems to play a positive role in the context of religious conflicts, disagreements and conflicting views. These promising findings on humility in relation to various domains of diversity are discussed, and the limitations of this review and recommendations for future research are provided.

T1  - Internal motivation to respond without prejudice fosters respectful responses in interracial interactions
AN  - 2459434949
AB  - As society becomes increasingly racially diverse, fostering positive interracial interactions is more important than ever. Unfortunately, previous work suggests that there are barriers to positive interracial interactions including White people's concerns about being liked and being seen as nonprejudiced and Black people's concerns about being respected and being seen as competent (Bergsieker, Shelton, & Richeson, 2010). The current work tested the hypothesis that these seemingly divergent impression management concerns do not always lead White people to have an approach to interracial interactions that is "incompatible" with Black interaction partner's concerns about being respected. We argue that White people who are internally motivated to respond without prejudice (Plant & Devine, 1998) are aware that Black interaction partners want to be respected, are concerned about showing this respect, and demonstrate this respect by focusing on getting to know and engaging with Black interaction partners during interracial interactions. On the other hand, White people who are externally motivated to respond without prejudice are focused on their own concerns about appearing prejudiced and focus on themselves and their own experience rather the needs of Black interaction partners. The results of six studies supported our predictions. Overall, the current work provides an important link between research on impression management concerns and motivations to respond without prejudice and suggests that the key to cultivating positive interracial interactions may be to increase White people's internal motivation and knowledge that Black people want to be respected.

T1  - Ally confrontations as identity‐safety cues for marginalized individuals
AN  - 2464647495
AB  - Three studies and an integrative data analysis (N = 1,017) demonstrated that confrontations (speaking up against a stereotypical or prejudiced statement), when affirmed by bystanders, serve as an effective safety cue for targets of bias. In Studies 1 and 2, Chinese‐American and White women witnessed anti‐Asian and sexist remarks, respectively. Results revealed that a lone confronter (i.e., a confronter not affirmed by others) was unable to boost identity‐safety (e.g., belonging, safety) compared to when the bias was not confronted, regardless of confronter identity (i.e., ally vs. ingroup confronter). Study 2 demonstrated that other people in the interaction group (i.e., bystanders) must affirm the confrontation for it to serve as an effective safety cue. Study 3 replicated and extended these results among White women for confrontation of sexism and Black women for confrontation of racism. Overall, these studies suggest that confrontations, when affirmed, can serve as a safety cue.

T1  - Middle-Class German Migrants in the United States: Migrants, Immigrants, Expatriates, Transmigrants, Mobile Citizens, or German Americans?
AN  - 2456263699
AB  - Drawing on data from interviews with twenty-five German citizens, this paper aims to shed some light on the migration experience of contemporary middle-class Germans who migrated to the United States. The interview data suggest that while these individuals have achieved successful socioeconomic integration and do not encounter discrimination or negative prejudices, they exhibit a strong sense of their German identity, rejecting such common labels such as “immigrant,” “expatriate,” or “German American.” Instead, they continue to negotiate their identity as “Germans living in America.” Like most immigrants, they engage in “transnational activities”; however, in contrast to the transnational activities sought out by unskilled migrants and global elites, these migrants tend to favor personal, social, or cultural activities over economic or political activities.

T1  - Men’s Hostile Sexism and Biased Perceptions of Partners’ Support: Underestimating Dependability Rather Than Overestimating Challenges to Dominance
AN  - 2442589013
AB  - Hostile sexism expresses derogation of women’s competence and emphasizes that women will exploit men’s relational dependence. Men who endorse hostile sexism perceive their female partners more negatively, but do these negative perceptions stem from motives for dominance or insecurities about dependence? We tested both perspectives by assessing bias in perceptions of partners’ behaviors that challenge dominance (criticism, instruction, taking over) versus affirm partners are dependable (love, care, availability). Both members of 100 heterosexual couples reported how much they received and enacted these behaviors in (a) a lab-based discussion and (b) six monthly retrospective reports about an ongoing important goal. In both support contexts, men’s hostile sexism was associated with underestimating dependability-relevant support, particularly when partners reported providing low support. This pattern did not emerge for dominance-relevant behaviors. These results indicate that men’s hostile sexism involves insecurities about dependence, producing perceptions that female partners are less dependable than they actually are.

T1  - Unfavourable representations of touristic places: the cautionary tale of late twentieth century travel writing on Portugal
AN  - 2441232019
AB  - Travel writing, an important influence on tourism, is often criticized as hegemonic/colonial by postcolonial studies. This study notes that postcolonial studies invariably solely search for such intentions in representations of societies. A critique of such approach is made by analysing travel writing texts where a postcolonial approach would find hegemonic/colonial intentions, while such intentions are likely absent. This is done by showing that travel writing representations of Portugal (an important tourist destination for tourism which tourism is very significant) are similar to social science representations of the country. These are to a great extent produced by Southern European and Portuguese scientists, making underlying hegemonic/colonial intentions unlikely. It is concluded that the attribution of such intentions to travel writing and other discourses by postcolonial studies should be rethought. One should therefore be careful in using postcolonial studies findings. An alternative mechanism underlying the production of unfavourable representations is proposed that may generate unfavourable representations even when producers of representations do not hold prejudiced views, with crucial implications on tourism and cultural identity.

T1  - Moral Foundations, Sexual Prejudice, and Outness Among Sexual Minorities
AN  - 2434147377
AB  - Recent decades have seen greater acceptance of sexual minorities and greater legal recognition of same-sex couples in the U.S. However, sexual minorities still experience sexual prejudice in their everyday lives and often internalize these negative attitudes. Among heterosexuals, sexual prejudice has been linked with moral foundations, which are individual differences in moral decision-making. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether, among college students identifying as a sexual minority (N = 176), individualizing and binding moral foundations were associated with sexual prejudice, internalized sexual prejudice, and outness. Sexual prejudice and internalized sexual prejudice were associated with greater emphasis on the binding moral foundations and less emphasis on the individualizing moral foundations. Outness was not associated with moral foundations. These results suggest that sexual minorities’ moral decision-making may play a role in their feelings about their own sexual orientation and the LGB community, but not in the disclosure of their sexual orientation. Efforts to reduce internalized sexual prejudice may need to consider individuals’ deeper underlying moral decision-making framework.

T1  - National Socialist Black Metal: a case study in the longevity of far-right ideologies in heavy metal subcultures
AN  - 2495814116
AB  - National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) emerged in the early 1990s as a subsidiary genre of the broader black metal movement. NSBM is distinguished by thematic content that promotes Aryan superiority, pagan spirituality and opposes globalization. Buesnel’s article explores the history of the early NSBM movement through an analysis of the bands Graveland (Poland) and Absurd (Germany), which have both played vital roles in the establishment of the NSBM genre. Buesnel highlights the current state of National Socialist ideology within metal subcultures and concludes with observations about the future of far-right extremism in heavy metal.

T1  - On the relevance of ‘Muslim’ as a social category in pre-unification Germany
AN  - 2495808127
AB  - Sterphone’s article engages with the relevance and consequentiality of ‘Muslim’ as a social category for everyday Germans during the 1970s and 1980s. Specifically, it examines commonsense knowledge about the characteristics and actions bound to the category ‘Muslim’ and (re)produced in newspapers and speeches. It demonstrates that the German essentialization of ‘Turks’ following the end of the guest worker programme in 1973 deployed and (re)produced their simultaneous categorizability as ‘Muslims’. Thus Germans employed ‘Muslim’ as a resource for (re)producing category-tied knowledge about irreconcilable civilizational difference. Sterphone’s analysis combines discourse analysis with an ethnomethodological approach to studying categories and categorization practices. Since categories are ‘inference rich’ and act as storehouses for commonsense knowledge about the social world, they constitute resources for a variety of social actions. This paper demonstrates that not only did politicians and news journalists demonstrably orient themselves to the relevance of ‘Muslim’ as a means for (re)constructing and emphasizing incommensurable social difference, they also called on readers to participate in seeing these traits and behaviours as the kind of thing done or embodied by Muslims. Such practices produced the category ‘Muslim’ as mutually exclusive with ‘German’ long before the influx of refugees in the 1990s or the post-9/11 securitization. Thus Sterphone’s paper contributes to studies of German nationhood and its intersections with race, ethnicity and religion. Specifically, it highlights Germany’s post-war movement towards alignment with ‘the West’ and, consequently, the Muslim Turk’s position as a salient Other in Germany’s westernizing project. It therefore contributes to both theoretical and empirical discussions of anti-Muslim racism that demonstrate how Germans employ and (re)produce ‘Germanness’ (Deutsch-Sein) and ‘Muslimness’ (Muslimisch-Sein) so that they preclude one another.

T1  - Politics, violence and transgression in Finnish Rock Against Communism music: a cross-genre case study
AN  - 2495785353
AB  - The Finnish far-right music scene has grown and become more ideological during the past ten years. Today there are more Rock Against Communism (RAC) bands whose messages are more political and ideological than those of old-school bands. One peculiarity of the Finnish white power music scene is that bands representing different genres, such as RAC, black metal and power electronics, often perform at the same events. Ideas and forms of expression spread between genres and, as this case analysis of the lyrics of the Finnish RAC band Vapaudenristi shows, genre crossing may result in novel but also paradoxical ideological combinations. In order to contextualize the reading of RAC lyrics, Kotonen’s article traces changes in Finnish white power music culture, and highlights the most important ideological sources of inspiration, among them the growing interest in the writings of Julius Evola.

T1  - An Initial Test of the Cosmetics Dehumanization Hypothesis: Heavy Makeup Diminishes Attributions of Humanness-Related Traits to Women
AN  - 2430245186
AB  - Objectification theory suggests that sexualization has significant dehumanizing consequences for how perceivers see women. To date, research has mostly documented how sexualized bodies in the mass media are objectified and dehumanized. The purpose of the present work was to test the novel cosmetics dehumanization hypothesis (CDH), that is, that subtler manifestations of sexualization, such as heavy makeup, might influence the way people attribute humanness-related traits to women. Across four experiments, 1000 participants (mostly from the United Kingdom and United States) were asked to evaluate women’s faces with or without heavy makeup. Consistent with the CDH, results showed that faces with makeup were rated as less human while using complementary indicators of dehumanization: They were perceived as possessing less humanness, less agency, less experience (Experiment 1), less competence, less warmth, and less morality (Experiments 2–4) than faces without makeup. This pattern of results was observed for faces of both models (Experiments 1–2) and ordinary women (Experiments 3–4). In Experiment 4, we manipulated the part of the face that wore makeup (eye makeup vs. lipstick) and found that faces with eye makeup were attributed the least amount of warmth and competence. A meta-analysis based on Experiments 2–4 confirmed the robustness of the findings, which were not moderated by either participant gender or sexual orientation. Whereas prior studies suggested that a focus on faces may serve as an antidote for objectification and related dehumanization, the present set of experiments indicates that this strategy might not always be effective.

T1  - Good Cop, Bad Cop: Race-Based Differences in Mental Representations of Police
AN  - 2429413282
AB  - The current work investigates race-based biases in conceptualization of the facial appearance of police. We employ a reverse correlation procedure to demonstrate that Black Americans, relative to White Americans, conceptualize police officers’ faces as more negative, less positive, and more dominant. We further find that these differential representations have implications for interactions with police. When naïve participants (of various races) viewed images of police officers generated by Black Americans (relative to those generated by White Americans), they responded with greater anticipated anxiety and reported more fight-or-flight behavioral intentions. Across four studies, findings suggest Black and White Americans conceptualize police and police–citizen interactions fundamentally differently. These findings have important theoretical (e.g., using reverse correlation to document the mental representations held by minority group members) and practical implications (e.g., identifying race-based differences in representations of police that may affect community–police relations).

T1  - The Perils and Penalties of Meritocracy: Sanctioning Inequalities and Legitimating Prejudice
AN  - 2509307928
AB  - This article deploys insights from Michael Young’s 1958 satire The Rise of the Meritocracy to challenge the dominant ideology of meritocracy in contemporary British society. It draws on ethnographic research in schools over a twenty‐five year period to illustrate the damage the illusion of meritocracy inflicts on children and young people, but particularly those from working class backgrounds. It argues that the consequences of the pretence of meritocracy are to be found in everyday practices of testing, hyper‐competition and setting, and beyond the classroom in the designation of predominantly working class schools as ‘rubbish schools for rubbish learners’. It concludes that, beyond the negative consequences for working class learners, there are wider consequences for British society, exacerbating social divisions and encouraging the growth of distrust, prejudice, envy, resentment, and contempt between different social groups.

T1  - Cross-cultural and Interracial Fostering in South Africa: Challenges Faced By Non-relative Foster Parents
AN  - 2583617482
AB  - In South Africa, racial prejudices and cultural insensitivity affect and define relationships. These social forces constitute enormous challenges and present immense barriers to non-relative child fostering and protection. This paper reports findings of a doctoral study that adopted a qualitative approach to explore the experiences offoster parents caring for non-relative foster children in De Deur, Gauteng Province, South Africa. A sample of 20 non-relative foster parents who fostered children from another cultural or racial group was purposively selectedfrom the caseload of Vereeniging Child and Family Welfare Society, De Deur satellite office. Data was collected using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The findings indicated that the foster parents experienced stigmatisation and discrimination; undue external interference; rejection and isolation and care scrutiny and suspicion. The study concluded that negative public perceptions and attitudes towards non-relative foster parents are pervasive. They have not been properly dealt with in the South African context and undermine the concept of'Ubuntu'. These could result in resentment and hamper relationship building between foster parents and foster children. Deliberate positive government policy intervention and social engineering is recommended for attitude and behaviour change in this regard.

T1  - Social inclusion and exclusion in same-race and interracial peer encounters
AN  - 2309797587
AB  - This study investigated children's and adolescents' predictions of inclusion and evaluations of exclusion in interracial and same-race peer contexts. The sample (N = 246) consisted of African American (n = 115) and European American (n = 131) children and adolescents who judged the likelihood of including a new peer, evaluated the group's decision to exclude the new peer, and provided reasons for their judgments. European American participants, particularly adolescents, viewed same-race inclusion as more likely than interracial inclusion. In contrast, African American participants viewed interracial and same-race inclusion to be just as likely, and evaluated all forms of exclusion to be more wrong than did their European American counterparts. The findings are discussed with respect to peer messages about interracial peer encounters and the conditions that are necessary for prejudice reduction.

T1  - The silver lining between perceived similarity and intergroup differences: Increasing confidence in intergroup contact: Postdisciplinary Humanities & Social Sciences Quarterly
AN  - 2181632211
AB  - Positive intergroup contact and cross-group friendships are known to have numerous benefits for intergroup relations in diverse schools. However, children do not always spontaneously engage in cross-group friendships, choosing rather to spend time with their ingroup peers. Several factors have previously been identified that influence children’s confidence in contact and subsequent development of cross-group friendships, including perceived intergroup similarity and reconciliation of intergroup differences. However, inducing perceived similarity may pose a threat to the person’s social identity and increase the need for distinctiveness. Therefore, it remains unclear how one should manipulate perceived similarity and group boundaries when designing interventions that prepare school children for successful contact. Moreover, eliminating perceived group boundaries need not lead to the generalization of improved attitudes towards the outgroup. An optimal balance of inclusion and differentiation between the groups should be determined so as to make way for beneficial cross-group friendships. Based on a literature review, we provide recommendations for designing prejudice reduction interventions in schools from the perspective of intergroup similarity.

T1  - Culturally aware but not yet ready to teach the “others”
AN  - 2151179051
AB  - PurposeIn this paper, the authors focus on a professional development programme in Cyprus aiming to enhance teachers’ intercultural understanding, awareness and competencies. This paper aims to focus on trainers’ and teacher trainees’ reflections upon a teacher professional development programme in the primary school in Cyprus with the largest number of Roma children.Design/methodology/approachThe training was provided by a small team of six trainers. Immediately after each training session, each trainer participated in an interview, while three of the trainers participated also in a focus-group interview at the end of the training. The trainers’ data were complemented by semi-structured interviews with a number of trainees either before or after the training. All interviews were transcribed, while interview questions comprised the framework for the qualitative analysis. The findings are presented by means of content analysis which formed the basis for emerging themes.FindingsThe authors claim that trainee teachers appeared culturally aware and sensitive, as well as knowledgeable about intercultural education; furthermore, they seemed to implement different teaching methodologies and curriculum interventions to support Roma children’s inclusion in the local school community. At the same time, they seemed to adopt instrumental approaches towards the content and purpose of the programme, seeking explicit instructional guidelines, plans and heuristics to deal with Roma inclusion. Considering the mis-recognition of teachers’ efforts by stakeholders outside the school and the expectations of the educational authorities – voiced via their school inspectors – teachers desperately asserted the need for tangible strategies to help them cope with difference in their classrooms.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors argue that such professional development programmes should aim at facing, deconstructing and bringing to the fore prejudices and discrimination against the Other/s by valuing teachers, first, as reflective individuals and, second, as professionals with their own cultural backgrounds and identities, on which any training programme, of the kind presented in this paper, could start from and build on.Practical implicationsEven though there is no tailored magic recipe to make teachers’ daily professional enterprise in multicultural settings easy, to help teachers master the necessary knowledge, skills and confidence, the authors suggest that training should be directly linked to classroom practice and acknowledge stress and helplessness that accompany work in multicultural school settings.Social implicationsThe inclusion strategy in many educational systems needs to become more comprehensive to cope with varying sources of social exclusion, faced by vulnerable groups of a different cultural background, such as Roma. Teacher training thus needs to meet the challenges of working in a diverse and multicultural environment in general and with Roma children in particular. In view of the multicultural character of local societies, a more critically oriented humanistic education is needed based on tolerance and understanding.Originality/valueThe limited participation of Roma in the school system could be related to teachers’ (mis)conceptions about the Roma culture and that the widely different ways in which Roma relate to schooling are often disregarded by the school.

T1  - 'You are labelled by your children's disability' - A community-based, participatory study of stigma among Somali parents of children with autism living in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2077176604
AB  - Objectives: Social stigma is commonly experienced by parents of children with autism. Our aim was to understand the nature of stigma experienced by Somali parents of children with autism in the United Kingdom (UK), and to consider how they coped with or resisted such stigma.Design: We used a community-based participatory research approach, collaborating with a community organisation of Somali parents. In-depth interviews with simultaneous translation were conducted with 15 Somali parents of children with autism living in Bristol, UK, in 2015. Parents were sampled purposively to capture diversity in children's age, severity of autism and time since diagnosis. Directed thematic analysis used Link and Phelan's model of stigma.Results: Of the 15 participants, 12 were mothers (mean age 36). The 17 children with autism they cared for were 4-13 years' old, and five were girls. Two main themes with sub-themes were identified: the nature of stigma (labelling and stereotyping; separation; emotional reactions, discrimination and power), and coping and resistance (the power of language; faith as a resource; learning, peer support and community relationships). Children with autism were labelled and stereotyped (e.g. as 'sick', 'naughty', 'different') and parents blamed for not controlling them, leading to social rejection and isolation. Stigma was associated with a poor understanding of autism, a lack of vocabulary related to autism in the Somali community, and prejudice against mental illness and disability. There was evidence of enacted and felt stigma and examples of discrimination. Finding their own language to describe their child's condition and drawing on faith, learning and peer support were important resources in resisting stigma.Conclusions: Findings inform support for this community, highlighting the need to raise awareness of autism, enable parents to speak openly, and ensure appropriate professional services and interventions are available.

T1  - The experience of ethnic prejudice of Turkish ethnic minorities in Flanders: Does it affect parental preferences about partner selection?
AN  - 2098784061
AB  - The aim of the present study is twofold. First, we evaluate to what extent Turkish ethnic minority members experience ethnic prejudice in the Flemish society. Experiencing ethnic prejudice could affect the orientation of minority members towards the majority group, their own (migrant) community and towards the country of origin (of their parents). Therefore, in the second part we assess the effect ethnic prejudice has on a specific type of interethnic social contact: partner selection. To what extent Turkish parents prefer a Turkish partner (living in Turkey) for their children, or do they show openness towards Belgian partners? We apply linear and multinomial logistic regression models on data retrieved form a representative survey in the Turkish ethnic minority in Flanders (n = 430). First, we find that ethnic prejudice is very common in the lives of Turkish minorities in Flanders. Men, respondents with a lower socioeconomic status, and partner migrants are especially at risk of experiencing prejudice. Second, we conclude that although the majority of the parents prefers ethnically homogeneous partnerships, openness towards mixed is found among more than 25% of the parents. Experiencing ethnic prejudice and having a lower educational attainment lowers that likelihood of being open towards mixed partnerships with Belgian partners.

T1  - Adolescents’ Engagement in Ethnic Harassment: Prejudiced Beliefs in Social Networks and Classroom Ethnic Diversity
AN  - 1983492946
AB  - Research on ethnic victimization to date has done little to identify the reasons why adolescents victimize their peers due to their ethnic background. To address this limitation, we examined: (1) the extent to which prejudiced attitudes within adolescents’ close and larger social networks determine their engagement in ethnic harassment, and (2) the extent to which classroom ethnic diversity plays a role in any such link. Our sample included 902 Swedish adolescents (Mage = 14.40, SD = .95; 50.3% girls). We found that Swedish adolescents who held negative attitudes toward immigrants or who were surrounded by prejudiced peers were more likely to be involved in ethnic harassment, particularly in classrooms with high ethnic diversity. Adolescents in classrooms with a high anti-immigrant climate were more likely to harass their immigrant peers. These findings suggest that prejudiced beliefs in youth social networks put young people at risk of engaging in ethnic harassment, particularly in ethnically diverse classrooms.

T1  - Do We Think Children Need a Mom and Dad?: Understanding How Gender Ideology Impact Attitudes Toward Same-Gender Parent Family Rights
AN  - 2057211174
AB  - Research and opinion polls demonstrate that attitudes toward same-gender parent families have been improving in recent years among Western countries; however, the history of oppression toward, and misconceptions about, same-gender parent families continue to be demonstrated in Australian family rights policies. Common misconceptions include the belief that children need both male and female role models, and this could be influencing peoples' support for same-gender family rights and having a wider impact on legislation change. Yet a dearth of research exists exploring a connection between gender role beliefs and support for same-gender family rights using a broad international sample, including Australia. To investigate this connection, a sample (N = 615) from 18 English-speaking countries responded to a series of questions to determine the importance of gender norm beliefs on same-gender family prejudice. Regression analysis demonstrated that people with traditional beliefs about gender norms were more likely to endorse a negative attitude toward same-gender marriage and same-gender parenting. Findings suggest a link between socially prescribed gender norms and prejudice toward same-gender parent families that may be fueling arguments against same-gender family rights policies. The implications of these findings on same-gender parent families and their rights require future investigation.

T1  - Power, privilege and justice: intersectionality as human rights?
AN  - 1972464008
AB  - How can we best connect and understand issues of power, privilege and justice in a human rights framework? One approach is to explicitly position intersectionality as a theoretical lens that can assist a critical understanding of the connections between these concepts and realities. The paper does this through an examination of the situation in Scotland via Show Racism the Red Card, an anti-racist non-governmental organisation that works with school-age children to raise awareness on the power of prejudice and discrimination in everyday, interrelated lives. It is shown that despite its complexities, intersectionality can work both conceptually and methodologically in complex environments such as classrooms. The realisation of rights is foregrounded and an appreciation of context, politics, social divisions and outcomes vis-à-vis inclusive equalities needs to be fully grasped. The case study of Show Racism the Red Card situates the nuances of intersectionality as both theory and method, illustrating the need for human rights to be mindful of past, present and future. Overall, it is argued that the example of Scotland offers opportunities to witness a critique of how power, privilege and justice are connected and challenged in a human rights context and how rights can be realised in everyday settings.

T1  - The Perils of Integration: Conflicting Northern Black Responses to the Coleman Report in the Black Power Era, 1966-1974
AN  - 2010883606
AB  - After a period of robust support for school integration that erupted throughout the North during World War II, black northerners began to question whether school integration would deliver the objectives that civil rights activists imagined, including equal educational opportunities, improved academic achievement, higher self-esteem for black students, and a reduction in antiblack prejudice by whites.1Drawing on a range of published sources, including newspaper and magazine articles, government reports, and academic scholarship, I contend that the Coleman Report helped fuel a backlash against school integration by black northerners frustrated by the mediocre results of school integration by 1966.Required by a provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the purpose of the study was to ascertain whether racial minorities had equal educational opportunities in the public schools.4While no one was surprised by Coleman's findings that black, Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and Native American children suffered educational inequality and intense racial segregation, the report nevertheless stunned social scientists and the public with its finding that the key factor in students' academic success was the background of pupils and teachers--not the school and its material resources.Information Age Publishing , 2015 ); Andrew R.

T1  - "The Minor Would Hinder the Mother in Finding Employment:" Child Protection and Women's Paid Work in Early State Socialist Hungary
AN  - 1955240189
AB  - This article discusses the role of child protection and residential care institutions in mediating the tension between women's productive and reproductive responsibilities in early state socialist Hungary. At a time when increasing numbers of women entered paid work in the framework of catch-up industrialization but the socialization of care work was inadequate, these institutions substituted for missing public child care services. Relying on not only policy documents but more than six hundred children's case files, including Romani children's files, from three different locations in Hungary as well as interviews with former children's home residents and personnel, the article examines the regulatory framework in which child protection institutions and caseworkers operated. It points to the differentiated forms of pressure these institutions exercised on Romani and non-Romani mothers to enter paid work between the late 1940s and the early 1950s from the intersectional perspective of gender and ethnicity. Showing that prejudice against "Gypsies" as work-shy persisted in child protection work across the systemic divide of the late 1940s, the article contributes to scholarship on state socialism and Stalinism that emphasizes the role of historical continuities. At the same time, reflecting on parental invention in using child protection as a form of child care, the article also complicates a simplistic social control approach to residential care institutions in Stalinist Hungary.

T1  - To Have or Not to Have Children? That Is the Question. Factors Influencing Parental Decisions Among Lesbians and Gay Men
AN  - 1926843453
AB  - Few studies have examined lesbians' and gay men's parental decision-making processes. Our goal in this work was to review what literature says about this understudied area of research. We first looked at transformations that have made it possible for lesbian- and gay-parented families to gain visibility. We then described how parental aspirations of lesbians and gay men have been operationalized. Factors shaping parental decisions were categorized as sociodemographic (gender, age and cohort, and race/ethnicity), personal (internalization of anti-homosexual prejudice and openness about one's non-heterosexual orientation), relational (one's partner's parental motivation and social support), and contextual (work conditions, access to LGBT support networks, information and resources, and social, legal, and medical barriers). Research findings were discussed and implications for future research and social policies regarding the issue of prospective lesbian and gay parenthood were drawn.

T1  - Interethnic dating preferences of Roma and non-Roma secondary school students
AN  - 2076973767
AB  - Integrated schooling is known to induce interethnic friendship relations; however, it also creates the opportunity of interethnic dating. Interethnic personal relationships or long-term exposure decreases ethnic prejudice, thus it is proposed that willingness to date between ethnic groups may also increase. The question arises, whether in the school context exposure is enough for this mechanism to emerge, or personal contact is necessary. It must also be taken into account that romantic relationships are embedded in status relations within schools. Based on a 'social exchange' mechanism, it is assumed that the less popular members of the majority groups are those who are more willing to form interethnic dating relations. To address the above questions empirically, the data of 1213 Hungarian 9th grade students in 43 classes were analysed. Preferences of Roma and non-Roma students were measured by dyadic attribution of physical attractiveness and nominations of willingness to date. Results of multilevel p2 models suggest that mixed groups are not sufficient, but personal contacts are necessary to decrease same-ethnicity preferences in dating. An additional tendency is salient: among majority students, those who are isolated from the friendship networks are the ones who are more willing to date members of the minority group.

T1  - Homophobic Prejudice in Czech Youth: a Sociodemographic Analysis of Young People's Opinions on Homosexuality
AN  - 1802421355
AB  - The aims of this study are to provide momentum to research on homophobic prejudice in Czechia and to identify the significant factors influencing or mediating homophobic attitudes in Czech youth. The paper first contextualizes homophobia within the context of the Central and Eastern European countries and then refers to the role of schools and education tools in the prevention of homophobia. Results of a quantitative analysis based on original data collected during a research survey from 9th graders (N=1082) in 35 selected Czech elementary schools are presented in the empirical part of the paper. We identify demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and environmental factors that are significantly linked with homophobic attitudes in youth. Gender differences as well as relationship satisfaction with parents or peers, psychological status, and perception of quality of the environment one lives in were found to be among the most significant factors influencing prejudicial opinions in youth. Metropolitan youth were found to be significantly less prejudiced against nonheterosexuals. By taking lessons from abroad, we propose a number of possible policy interventions mainly in the realm of curricular documents and teacher training.

T1  - Amaya: Dialogic Literary Gatherings Evoking Passion for Learning and a Transformation of the Relationships of a Roma Girl With Her Classmates
AN  - 1751005687
AB  - Roma girls are one of the most invisible social groups within the educational system. Beliefs derived from social prejudice and from nonscientific perspectives suggest that they have little motivation and willingness to learn. However, successful educational actions based on scientific evidence developed in many schools demonstrate a very different reality. This is the case of Amaya, a 12-year-old Roma girl who lives in the poorest neighborhood of Tarragona (Spain) and who has suffered bullying perpetrated by her classmates. However, in the Dialogic Literary Gatherings (DLGs), Amaya found a place to enjoy reading books such as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or Twain's Tom Sawyer. This pleasure led to a radical transformation in her classmates' perceptions of her as well as in her own perception of her abilities. Through Amaya's biography, the author explore how the DLGs become a space where children's desire to continue their studies are strengthened and future dreams, such as Amaya's aspiration to become a doctor, are shaped.

T1  - Making Fun out of Difference: Ethnicity–Race and Humour in a London School
AN  - 2426561096
AB  - This article highlights the importance of humour and laughter in analyses of ethnicity and race in everyday life, and contributes to the growing anthropological engagement with the role of the ludic in social life. Focusing on pupil interaction in an ethnically and racially diverse London school, it argues that while peer classification practices can lead to reification of ethnic and racial differences, ludic interactions have cross-cutting, counter-balancing or liquefying effects. In interactions of humour, ethnic and racial differences can become the very material from which banter and laughter are created, constituting a convivial sociality that manifests closeness at the same time as difference. Such interactions enable peers to address their racial and ethnic differences, and a wider context of prejudice and racism, lightly, ‘making fun out of’ what could potentially divide and distance them.

T1  - Thinking About the Poor: A Bibliographical Essay
AN  - 1684424746; 201518707
AB  - The lower classes smell,' Eric Blair's parents taught him as a child. The lesson stuck: By the time he recounted it in The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), the writer who became known to the world as George Orwell had lived as a tramp in metropolitan London and worked as a dishwasher in Paris. (In fact, he wrote under that pen name to save his family the embarrassment of being related to someone who had gone slumming.) Yet Orwell still discerned within himself and his fellow socialists the workings of that prejudice. To the better off, Orwell knew, poverty was not only the lack of money; it also signified something repugnant, even a moral failing. So while he spent the first half of The Road to Wigan Pier exposing the shocking conditions of the working poor, he spent the second half exposing the prejudices of his fellow socialists.

T1  - Prejudice-reduction in Culturally Mixed Classrooms: The Development and Assessment of a Theory-driven Intervention Among Majority and Minority Youth in Finland
AN  - 1559006453; 201431839
AB  - The aim of this field experiment was to develop and assess an intervention promoting positive intergroup relations in culturally diverse schools. The intervention was based on extended contact and social learning and utilized behavioural journalism as its method. Intervention effects were assessed on out-group attitudes, perceived importance of future contact, perceived peer norms and intergroup anxiety among ethnic majority (N = 583) and minority (N = 214) youth in grades 7-9 in Finnish secondary schools (total N experimental = 388; total N control = 409). As a result of the intervention, both groups showed a tendency to perceive future intergroup contact as more important, and this effect was most notable for younger participants and girls. Prototypicality of in-group and out-group peer models contributed positively to intervention effects. However, unexpectedly, the intervention also increased experiences of intergroup anxiety among the oldest participants. The results are discussed taking into account the developmental stage of the youth studied. Besides critically assessing the effectiveness of the intervention, recommendations for improving theory-driven prejudice-reduction and for the development of future interventions in culturally diverse contexts are given.

T1  - Effects of Sanskrit Schooling on Cognitive and Social Processes
AN  - 1520336764; 201417684
AB  - The article discusses effects of Sanskrit schooling, a traditional system of education in India, which has continued for several thousand years. Sanskrit schooling continues to be in operation in India, but has been pushed out to the margins after the introduction of formal Western-type schooling by the British. A set of studies demonstrating the influence of traditional Sanskrit and formal Western forms of schooling on children's cognitive and social processes is discussed. These specifically include studies of learning and memory, psychological differentiation, spatial language and encoding, dead reckoning, meta-cognition, social identity and prejudice, intergroup relationships and daily activities, practices and values. The article also discusses potential areas for cross-cultural collaborative research relating to psychological development of children.

T1  - Should educators and parents encourage other-gender interactions? Gender segregation and sexism
AN  - 1542000360; 201428640
AB  - We investigated gender differences in the association between gender-segregated peer preferences and sexism in adolescents (15-17 years, 60 boys and 85 girls). To assess gender-segregated peer preferences, adolescents nominated peers for interaction in two contexts: 'hanging out' at home and working on a school project. The Modern Sexism Scale [Swim, J. K., K. J. Aikin, W. S. Hall, and B. A. Hunter. 1995. 'Sexism and Racism: Old-Fashioned and Modern Prejudices.' Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 68(2): 199-214] measured two dimensions of sexism: Antagonism towards Women's Demands (believing feminist issues are unimportant) and denial of continuing discrimination (believing gender discrimination no longer exists). For boys, Antagonism towards Women's Demands was associated with gender-segregated peer preferences in the school and home context. For girls, Denial of Continuing Discrimination was associated with gender-segregated peer preferences in the home context. Results are informative for educators and for other professionals interested in reducing inequality and sexism among adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Predicting Homophobic Behavior Among Heterosexual Youth: Domain General and Sexual Orientation-Specific Factors at the Individual and Contextual Level
AN  - 1417520884; 201333994
AB  - As a form of bias-based harassment, homophobic behavior remains prominent in schools. Yet, little attention has been given to factors that underlie it, aside from bullying and sexual prejudice. Thus, we examined multiple domain general (empathy, perspective-taking, classroom respect norms) and sexual orientation-specific factors (sexual orientation identity importance, number of sexual minority friends, parents' sexual minority attitudes, media messages). We documented support for a model in which these sets of factors converged to predict homophobic behavior, mediated through bullying and prejudice, among 581 students in grades 9-12 (55 % female). The structural equation model indicated that, with the exception of media messages, these additional factors predicted levels of prejudice and bullying, which in turn predicted the likelihood of students to engage in homophobic behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interrelated factors in efforts to reduce bullying, prejudice, and discrimination among youth. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The impacts of friendship groups' racial composition when perceptions of prejudice threaten students' academic self-concept
AN  - 1417522448; 201333530
AB  - Literature on racially prejudiced stereotypes suggests that students' academic self-concepts (ASC) can be damaged when a stereotype demeans the intelligence of their racial or ethnic group. There is little research on how students overcome this burden, but there is some evidence that the racial composition of friendship groups play a role. One argument suggests having racially diverse friends could help students see the inaccuracy of stereotypes and another points out that racially homogenous friends could collectively resist the stereotypes as a support group. In this study I analyze a nationally representative and racially diverse sample of United States adolescents to examine these hypotheses. After estimating multivariate regression models for four separate racial/ethnic groups (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, white), results show that although perceptions of prejudice do predict decreases in ASC for African-American students, racially homogenous friendship groups have the opposite effect which lends credibility to the support group hypothesis. In addition, racial diversity of friendship groups predicts decreased ASC for African-American students, suggesting diverse groups could make prejudice more salient. The implications for these findings include the reminder that prejudice is still a valid concern in American schools and that peers can be a significant source of racial tension and/or support. In terms of students' ASC, it is important for educators to be aware of these social conditions and to continue to seek a better understanding of race relations in schools so that more students are not psychologically burdened by racial tension.

T1  - Prejudice in Childhood: Validation of Two Social Distance Scales
AN  - 1015334475
AB  - The aim of this research was to study children's prejudice. We administered children's social distance scales to 311 fifth graders from 6 elementary schools in Zagreb. One of the scales measured willingness to engage in more or less distanced forms of contact (from living in the same town to forming close friendships), while the other measured willingness to spend leisure time through doing various activities with peers who had some specific characteristic. Target groups were blind children, children who use a wheelchair, obese children and Romani children. Factor analysis on both measures for every group produced meaningful one factor solutions. On both instruments children expressed the highest prejudice toward Romani children, while social distances toward the other three groups were similar. Boys constantly showed higher social distances than girls. There were also relatively high correlations between social distances toward the same groups on different instruments. The results generally indicate children's tendency to reject members of different groups and accentuate the necessity for interventions during preadolescence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racial Discrimination, Interpretation, and Legitimation at Work
AN  - 1928619460
AB  - Research on race stratification and employment usually implies discrimination as a key mechanism in race stratification, although few if any analyses bring attitudes, employee-employer interpretations, and established discriminatory behavior into a singular analysis. In this article, the authors do so and offer a relational account of how discrimination operates, drawing on a large sample of verified racial discrimination cases. Building on racial stratification literature and theory on "color-blind" racism, the analyses focus on employee and employer interpretations and then use dyadic analyses coupled with qualitative case immersion to shed light on the relational nature of discrimination and how employers justify such conduct. Findings highlight significant interpersonal disjunctures in descriptions of common events as well as the ways in which employers evoke broad organizational and societal ideals of meritocracy-- ideals that often fall by the wayside in concrete decision-making pertaining to and in evaluation of minority employees.

T1  - A regulatory fit perspective in majority versus minority support to attitudes toward homosexuals: GPIR
AN  - 1928215855
AB  - Three studies examined the attitude toward homosexuals as a function of regulatory focus and social support for non-discrimination. Regulatory orientation toward non-discrimination was measured by differentiating promotion and prevention emotions when anticipating a non-discriminatory (studies 1 and 2) and a discriminatory interaction with homosexuals (study 2). Study 3 assessed attitude toward non-discrimination through a social dominance orientation (SDO) scale and manipulated experimentally regulatory focus. Across the three studies, social support was manipulated by informing participants that either a majority or a minority of the Swiss population supported non-discrimination in general (study 1), or specifically toward homosexuals (studies 2 and 3). Results showed more positive attitudes toward homosexuals when non-discriminatory participants were regulated in terms of prevention focus and non-discrimination was supported by a majority, and when non-discriminatory participants were regulated in terms of promotion focus and non-discrimination was supported by a minority. These findings are consistent with a regulatory fit perspective on the interplay between regulatory focus and social support.

T1  - Being treated differently: Stigma experiences with family, peers, and school staff among adolescents with mental health disorders
AN  - 743043624; 201029562
AB  - Stigma directed at adolescents diagnosed with emotional and behavioral disorders by individuals in their interpersonal network likely undermines their wellbeing, yet little is known about their subjective stigma experiences. In particular, the prospect of diagnosed youth experiencing prejudice and discrimination by family members has not previously been examined. This study examines adolescents' perceptions of being treated 'differently' because of mental health problems by family members, peers, and school staff. Qualitative analysis of narratives from mixed method interviews with 56 adolescents in a mid-western US city demonstrated variation in the perceived extent and nature of stigma and in contextual factors perceived as promoting or protecting from stigmatization, depending on the interpersonal domain. The greatest number of participants experienced stigmatization in relationships with peers (62%); this often led to friendship losses and transitions. Participants reporting no peer stigmatization often reported socializing with others "in the same boat" or concealing problems - methods of avoiding potentially stigmatizing interactions. Close to half (46%) described experiencing stigmatization by family members, which often took the form of unwarranted assumptions, distrust, avoidance, pity, and gossip. About one third (35%) of participants reported stigma perpetrated by school staff, who expressed fear, dislike, avoidance, and under-estimation of their abilities. Fortunately, 22% reported "different" treatment by school staff, but this treatment was interpreted as positive and supportive. Results showed that perceived stigmatization in one domain was associated with perceived stigma in other domains. The results suggest that efforts to combat stigmatization of youth with mental health disorders must help family members, peers, and school staff overcome their inclinations to make negative assumptions and discriminate against these youth.

T1  - The "Childhood Obesity Epidemic": Health Crisis or Social Construction?
AN  - 848720310; 20420299
AB  - There has been a meteoric rise over the past two decades in the medical research and media coverage of the so-called global childhood obesity epidemic. Recently, in response to this phenomenon, there has been a spate of books and articles in the fields of critical sociology and cultural studies that have argued that this "epidemic" is socially constructed, what Natalie Boero (2007) dubs a "postmodern epidemic." As an anthropologist who has studied child nutrition and obesity in relation to poverty and the school environment, I am concerned about both the lack of reflexivity among medical researchers as well as critical scholars' treatment of the problem as entirely socially constructed. In this article I present both sides of this debate and then discuss how we can attempt to navigate a middle course that recognizes this health issue but also offers alternative approaches to those set by the biomedical agenda.
