T1  - The Role of Contact Richness in Mediated Intergroup Contact: A Test of the Contact Space Framework
AN  - 2662236750
AB  - Intergroup contact varies in richness of the experience, yet the effect of contact richness has not been systematically examined. This paper experimentally tested whether and how different levels of mediated contact richness—afforded by different forms of media—affect attitudes toward marginalized outgroups (e.g., refugees, migrant workers). Data collected online from an adult sample (N = 510) found that richness of the mediated contact experience increased feelings of psychological closeness of the depicted outgroup member, which then reduced intergroup anxiety and perceived threat of the outgroup. This, in turn, increased support for policies that promote more humane and equitable conditions for the two outgroups. Theoretical implications for intergroup contact theory and practical implications for utilizing media programs to reduce intergroup bias are discussed.

T1  - Extreme party animals: Effects of political identification and ideological extremity
AN  - 2661293158
AB  - Many Americans’ political identity is more relevant, salient, and central than their American identity. Political parties provide party members with an identity and belief system. Political identities influence identity‐based ideologies which increase affective polarization and potential anti‐social intergroup conflict between political parties. The purpose of the current research is to determine how political party identification and ideological extremity influences affective polarization for Republicans and Democrats across two studies. Participants in both studies completed a survey which measured political identification, ideological extremity, and uniquely operationalized measures of affective polarization, including support for co‐partisans, attitudes about political rivals, emotions towards political rivals, action tendencies towards political rivals, and perceived threat from political rivals. Study 1 (N = 530) used responses to the survey from a convenience sample crowdsourced by Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) in 2018. Study 1 showed that higher political party identification is associated with significantly higher affective polarization for members of both parties and that ideological extremity partially mediates this effect. Study 2 (N = 260) used a 2020 AMT sample to replicate Study 1’s results. Findings extend our understanding of identity‐based ideological extremity and suggest that affective polarization could be driven by political party identification and partisans’ ideological extremity.

T1  - Backlash against the #MeToo movement: How women’s voice causes men to feel victimized: GPIR
AN  - 2652813930
AB  - Three studies examined whether perceived increase in women’s “voice” (i.e., being heard and taken seriously about sexual assault) contributes to perceptions of bias against men. In Study 1, both men and women who perceived women to have a greater voice related to sexual assault, perceived greater victimization of men. This relationship was stronger for relatively conservative participants. In Study 2, relatively conservative (but not relatively liberal) participants who read about #MeToo perceived greater men’s victimization than those in the control condition. Study 3 examined responses to perceiving that men are victimized by #MeToo. For relatively conservative (but not liberal) men, perceptions of men’s victimhood led to less willingness to work alone with a woman and less willingness to combat sexual assault (relative to a control condition). Thus, while the #MeToo movement brings awareness of issues of sexual assault, it also generates a backlash among the more conservative, and may accentuate gender disparities.

T1  - DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE AND PERCEPTIONS OF RACISM
AN  - 2597482176
AB  - Various research has demonstrated that rapid racial demographic change may aid in triggering various forms of backlash under certain conditions. This has led scholars to speak of Whites “defending” their local environment in the face of eroding racial dominance. However, little research has addressed how perceptions of racism among minorities may be triggered under conditions of demographic change. This study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by examining the relationship between racial demographic change for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians and perceptions of racial problems among these groups in the United States. Using standard OLS regressions, ordered logistic regressions, multinomial logistic regressions, and techniques accounting for selection into treatment, I find that Blacks and Hispanics living in counties undergoing rapid growth of Black and Hispanic populations, respectively, have higher perceptions of racial problems. Asians show no evidence of increased perceptions of racial problems in counties undergoing rapid Asian growth. For Blacks, this relationship is concentrated among those without at least a four-year degree and residents of counties with lower initial White populations (and higher initial Black populations). For Hispanics, it is similarly concentrated among those without at least a four-year degree, but also is likely stronger among residents of counties with higher initial White populations (and lower initial Hispanic populations), highlighting unique racial dynamics. This research adds to a growing body of work showing the importance of examining demographic change at the local level in order to understand some of today’s most pressing political and social issues.

T1  - South Korean Evangelical Narratives on North Koreans and Homosexuals
AN  - 2568177243
AB  - This paper analyzes how South Korean (SK), evangelical media discuss two outgroup categories: North Korea and homosexuality. Analysis of SK media over two decades—mainly longitudinal analysis of evangelical newspaper Kidok Sinmun (1998-2019)–generates several findings. First, homosexuality is catching up to North Korea as the leading outgroup in SK Christian discourse. Second, both outgroups are subjects of dual, competing narratives: one (threat) frames outgroups, and their supporters, as threats to the liberties and/or values of Christians; another (outreach), as subjects of Christian love and personal relationship. The threat and outreach narratives, in turn, are, respectively, associated with right-wing and non-right politics on the outgroup. We argue that the dual narratives are shaped by American evangelical culture; cross-national communications (e.g., South Korea and USA); and cross-national events (e.g., presidential elections) that influence the perceived threats posed by, or opportunities to outreach to, outgroup members.

T1  - Structural Equation Model Predicting LGB Ally Behaviors in Heterosexuals
AN  - 2513076456
AB  - IntroductionWhile numerous studies have focused on heterosexuals’ attitudes toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals, few studies have examined ally behaviors and their predictors. The present study aimed to model the connections between LGB interpersonal contact and heterosexism in relation to ally behaviors among heterosexuals.MethodsHeterosexual adults (n = 333) completed an online survey assessing interpersonal contact with LGB individuals, heterosexism, and ally behaviors.ResultsA good-fitting structural equation model showed significant direct effects (all ps < 0.001) from LGB contact to heterosexism (β = − 450), from heterosexism to ally behaviors (β = − 0.280), and from LGB contact to ally behaviors (β = 0.594). There was a significant indirect (mediational) effect from LGB contact to ally behaviors through heterosexism (β = 0.126, p = .001).ConclusionThe results inform targets for interventions with heterosexuals, such as the facilitation of interpersonal contact between LGB and heterosexuals to reduce prejudice and increase ally behaviors.

T1  - Prosperous But Fearful of Falling: The Wealth Paradox, Collective Angst, and Opposition to Immigration
AN  - 2507923452
AB  - Building on growing evidence that relative economic gratification may be associated with prejudice toward minorities, such as immigrants, the question remains when and why prosperity and wealth may enhance opposition to immigration. In a correlational study (Study 1, N = 498), we show that increased fear of falling in the future (individually or collectively) is associated with greater opposition to immigration. We then experimentally studied the effects of potential (Study 2, N = 294) and actual (Study 3, N = 166) downward mobility among the relatively wealthy, as well as of relatively stagnating wealthy in the context where an initially poorer group is quickly gaining wealth over time (Study 4, N = 151). We find that fear of falling among the wealthy is associated with more opposition to immigration, mediated by collective angst. We conclude that the anticipation that the economic future looks less rosy than the present evokes collective angst, which, in turn, fuels prejudice toward immigrants.

T1  - Justice: The Racial Motive We All Have and Need
AN  - 2492207568
AB  - This essay posits that justice is the core value epitomizing our moment. Justice is violated when positive outcomes are undeserved, and the felt sense of injustice motivates a need for retribution. Because politics involves allocation (distribution and redistribution), deservingness is a core appraisal of “who gets what” and therefore justice is fundamental for politics. This is especially germane to race, ethnicity, and politics scholars. I present a few core tenets of justice theory, and argue that political science can take advantage of the moment to engage the concept of justice; especially as it relates to the study of racial attitudes and the identification of racial enablers—those ostensible non-racists who facilitate the status quo. Summarily, I propose that justice can unify debates over prejudice and politics, and advance our scholarly understanding of how well-intentioned people—regardless of their identities, or ideological or partisan labels—can facilitate racism, racial inequality, and injustice.

T1  - Intimacy Beyond Sex: Korean Television Dramas, Nonsexual Masculinities, and Transnational Erotic Desires
AN  - 2474491039
AB  - In the twenty-first century, Korean television dramas have gained transnational popularity in a phenomenon called Hallyu. Believing that these Korean television dramas accurately portray how Korean men are in real life, some white women from North America and Europe travel to Korea as Hallyu tourists to form intimate relations with Korean men. This essay is based on the data I gathered through ethnographic field research in 2017–18, during which I interviewed and observed these Hallyu tourists. Some of my Hallyu tourist informants claimed that they traveled to Korea because they were motivated by the nonsexual depictions of Korean men in the television dramas. They viewed Korean men as the racial, ethnic, and nonsexual others who would provide them with alternatives to sex-based intimacy. I examine my Hallyu tourist informants' desires for Korean men through the theoretical frameworks of nonsexuality and racialized erotics. I argue that some of my informants' erotic desires for nonsexual Korean men reinforce Orientalist stereotypes about Korean men's sexuality. By examining the racial and sexual politics of some white female tourists' erotic desires for nonsexual Korean men, I demonstrate the indivisibility of nonsexuality from race.

T1  - Sexual Risk Among African Americans in Substance Use Treatment: Secondary Analysis of Two Clinical Trials
AN  - 2471558540
AB  - African Americans who use substances experience a particular risk for HIV. Negative attitudes towards condoms are a strong predictor of risk and can serve as barriers to safe sex. They also vary by gender. In a secondary analysis of data from two National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network trials collecting data from 2004 to 2006, the relationship between gender, unprotected sex, and condom barriers among 203 African Americans in substance use treatment was examined. Results indicated that no gender differences were present in unprotected sex. Men reported more motivational barriers to condom use and were more likely to believe that condoms would impede sexual experience (the latter not statistically significant). For both genders, the perception that condoms might negatively impact sexual experience was associated with unprotected sex. Gender did not moderate the relationship between condom barriers and unprotected sex. These findings suggest the need for gender and race-specific prevention strategies that focus on motivation and address pleasure-based concerns regarding condoms. Substance use treatment facilities are well-positioned to support interventions to target these issues.

T1  - Geographic patterns of implicit age bias and associations with state‐level health outcomes across the United States
AN  - 2464641544
AB  - Negative attitudes toward aging are pervasive in society and may be detrimental to people's health as they become older. Older people tend to report feeling significantly younger than their chronological age, often as a way of psychologically distancing themselves from the stigma of old age. However, attitudes and behaviors toward aging may differ across regional contexts. We examined associations among state‐level patterns of bias against older adults and state‐level health outcomes across the United States. Data from 803,009 respondents (ages: 15–94) across 50 U.S. states (and the District of Columbia) revealed geographic variation in implicit age bias. Higher state‐level implicit age bias was associated with poorer state‐level health outcomes among adults ages 65+. Older adults living in states high in implicit age bias showed greater age‐group dissociation compared to older adults living in states low in implicit age bias. Findings highlight potential consequences of implicit age bias and invite further research on the long‐term health implications of individual age‐group dissociation in response to regional age bias.

T1  - The Value of Social Control: Racial Resentment, Punitiveness, and White Support for Spending on Law Enforcement
AN  - 2439852868
AB  - A well-established body of research finds that racial resentment predicts support for punitive criminal justice policy. This article links racial resentment with punitiveness, expanding the existing research—a body of work that largely treats punitivity as a response to threat. Data for this study come from three nationally representative samples and incorporate individual and contextual factors. Key variables include Racial Resentment, Political Ideology, Punitiveness, Crime—both objective crime (i.e., county-level crime rates) and subjective crime (i.e., fear of crime), racial population characteristics, and theoretically relevant controls. Contextual factors help to clarify whether support for spending is a “rational” response to crime or a “nonrational” response to perceived racial threat as expressed through punitiveness. Findings indicate that, net of a host of factors, a punitive value orientation as well as racial resentment predicts support for increased spending on law enforcement. Our analysis also suggests that racial resentment and punitivity are more consistent and stronger predictors of support even when controlling for Crime. The article closes with a discussion of opportunity cost vis-à-vis law enforcement and other community needs. Implications for further study of race and criminal justice policy get discussed with suggestions for dealing with the future of identity-based politics.

T1  - The contingent effects of environmental concern and ideology: institutional context and people’s willingness to pay environmental taxes
AN  - 2404689649
AB  - Environmental taxes are often argued to be key to more effective environmental protection. People’s willingness to pay such taxes in contexts with varying levels of quality of government (QoG) is investigated. Applying multilevel analyses on data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and the QoG Institute, links between environmental concern, ideology, and QoG are explored. The results show that people who state that they are concerned about environmental issues and live in high QoG countries are more willing than people in low QoG countries to pay environmental taxes. Moreover, people in low QoG countries holding leftist political value orientations are less willing to pay environmental taxes than rightists and other value groups. Environmental concern and leftist political ideology are more important drivers of public support for environmental taxes in high QoG countries than in low QoG countries.

T1  - Implicit Evaluative Biases Toward Targets Varying in Race and Socioeconomic Status
AN  - 2285655847
AB  - Generally, White (vs. Black) and high-status (vs. low-status) individuals are rated positively. However, implicit evaluations of simultaneously perceived race and socioeconomic status (SES) remain to be considered. Across four experiments, participants completed an evaluative priming task with face primes orthogonally varying in race (Black vs. White) and SES (low vs. high). Following initial evidence of a positive implicit bias for high-SES (vs. low-SES) primes, subsequent experiments revealed that this bias is sensitive to target race, particularly when race and SES antecedents are presented in an integrated fashion. Specifically, high-SES positive bias was more reliable for White than for Black targets. Additional analyses examining how implicit biases may be sensitive to perceiver characteristics such as race, SES, and beliefs about socioeconomic mobility are also discussed. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of examining evaluations based on race and SES when antecedents of both categories are simultaneously available.

T1  - Constructing the Norm-critical awareness scale: A scale for use in educational contexts promoting awareness of prejudice, discrimination, and marginalisation
TT  - Constructing the NCAS
AN  - 2269860569
AB  - PurposeHealthcare professionals’ conscious or unconscious norms, values and attitudes have been identified as partial explanations of healthcare inequity. Norm criticism is an approach that questions what is generally accepted as “normal” in society, and it enables professionals to identify norms that might cause prejudice, discrimination and marginalisation. In order to assess norm-critical awareness, a measurement scale is needed. The purpose of this paper is to develop a scale for measuring norm-critical awareness.Design/methodology/approachThe scale-development process comprised a qualitative item-generating phase and a statistical reduction phase. The item pool was generated from key literature on norm criticism and was revised according to an expert panel, pilot studies and one “think aloud” session. To investigate the dimensionality and to reduce the number of items of the scale, confirmatory factor analysis was performed.FindingsThe item-generation phase resulted in a 46-item scale comprising five theoretically derived dimensions revolving around function, consequences, identity, resistance and learning related to norms. The item-reduction phase resulted in an instrument consisting of five dimensions and 20 items. The analyses indicated that a summary score on the scale could be used to reflect the broad dimension of norm-critical awareness.Originality/valueThe Norm-critical awareness scale comprises five theoretically derived dimensions and can be used as a summary score to indicate the level of norm-critical awareness in educational contexts. This knowledge is valuable for identifying areas in greater need of attention.

T1  - The strength of memory and the weakness of recognition: Italian associations in Germany
AN  - 2232408847
AB  - From a sociological perspective, the interplay between time and migration processes has long been overlooked. Yet time and temporalities represent a strategic dimension when it comes to investigating multicultural societies and the complexity of intercultural relations. This article has two aims: in terms of theory, it sets out to explore the link between memory and recognition as a strategic nexus for investigating multicultural contexts, while the empirical component analyses whether and in what ways the social and collective memory of Italian associations in Germany hinders their attempts to gain recognition. Most of the existing associations now appear to be converging towards a collective memory based on a hyper-idealized image of the homeland, combined with nostalgic sentiment, reinforcing an ethnicity-based identity which gives rise to a process of "folklorization" of cultural differences. This scenario affects processes of self- and hetero-recognition.

T1  - Support for Tough Immigration Policy: Identity Defense or Concern for Law and Order?
AN  - 2151163682
AB  - Across two studies, U.S. participants read a fictional transcript of a law enforcement officer who observed a speeding infraction and made a discretionary traffic stop. The car carried occupants who displayed either high or low fit with Anglocentric constructions of U.S. identity and were of presumptive Mexican (Studies 1 and 2), Canadian (Study 1), or Irish (Study 2) origin. The officer decided over the course of the traffic stop that the occupants’ behavior aroused “reasonable suspicion” about documentation status, so he asked them to produce identification documents and detained them when they failed to do so. Participants indicated their suspicion about occupants’ documentation status and rated the appropriateness of law enforcement actions. Results indicate effects of origin across both studies for all outcomes: participants considered occupants of Mexican origin (vs. Canadian or Irish) as more suspicious, and rated law enforcement actions related to traffic and immigration violations as more appropriate when the interaction involved occupants of Mexican origin (vs. Canadian or Irish). Results indicate effects of fit across both studies for all outcomes: participants considered occupants who showed low‐fit (vs. high‐fit) as more suspicious, and rated law enforcement actions related to traffic and immigration violations as more appropriate when occupants showed low‐fit (vs. high‐fit). Discussion focuses on how participant support for punitive anti‐immigration measures is less about neutral enforcement of law than about racialized exclusion to defend an Anglocentric construction of U.S. identity.

T1  - Intergroup Threat and the Linguistic Intergroup Bias: A Stress Biomarker Study
AN  - 2127083072
AB  - This study investigates the physiological consequences of derogation. In the face of an ingroup threat, an opportunity to derogate the outgroup is associated with increases in salivary cortisol, a stress biomarker. These findings support the intergroup anxiety model, which suggests that following an anxiety-inducing threatening experience, outgroup evaluations can amplify emotional reactions and stress. In this study, we investigated whether threatened participants who derogated would show higher cortisol levels. Canadian undergraduates (N = 169) read either a threatening or favourable passage about Canadians. They then engaged in either a linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) or control task. Salivary samples were collected prethreat, postthreat, and posttask. The results suggest that ingroup threat was associated with increases in cortisol levels. Threatened participants who displayed LIB showed higher cortisol levels than those who were threatened and did not show LIB. These findings illustrate the importance of incorporating a neuroscientific approach.

T1  - Think beyond contact: Reformulating imagined intergroup contact theory by adding friendship potential: GPIR
AN  - 2109034083
AB  - Three experiments were conducted to test whether an imagined contact scenario with friendship potential would be more effective than the standard imagined contact scenario in changing Turkish participants’ attitudes and behaviors towards Syrian refugees. Experiment 1 (N = 99) showed that adding a specific friendship indicator to the contact scenario (intimacy or interaction) increased the effectiveness of the typical positive contact strategy on outgroup trust. Experiment 2 (N = 145) demonstrated that imagining a positive contact scenario which included both intimacy and interaction elements simultaneously was more effective than the standard imagined contact scenario in increasing outgroup trust and behavioral intentions. Experiment 3 (N = 79) demonstrated that simply adding an explicit statement about the potential of forming a cross-group friendship improved the effectiveness of the imagined contact paradigm on attitudes, trust, behavioral intentions, and perceived threat. Theoretical and practical implications of findings for the development of imagined contact interventions are discussed.

T1  - Ethnic identification and New York City’s intra-Latina/o hierarchy
AN  - 2064566638
AB  - Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in New York City, I argue that the negotiation of ethnic identifications among Latina/os is informed by shared understandings of the relative status of Latina/o subgroups, in what is, essentially, a hierarchy of relative privilege and prestige. The statuses of distinct Latina/o groups, and the shared understandings that people have about these statuses, set incentives and disincentives that influence which ethnic identifications individuals choose. I present a framework for understanding the intersections of status and ethnic self-identification and how these factors serve to resist, maintain, or improve one’s standing in relation to intra-Latina/o hierarchies. Ethnic choices include distancing from putative in-groups or adopting identifications or ethnic markers of Latina/o out-groups. The ethnoracial status hierarchies that influence Latina/o ethnic choices point to the challenges and possibilities in forging a cohesive Latina/o collectivity.

T1  - The First Time I Heard the Word: The “N‐Word” as a Present and Persistent Racial Epithet
AN  - 2017688239
AB  - The main point of this paper is to interrogate the process of interpellation and to point to the prevalence of the process of “re‐production” of particular social formations in the contemporary United States where the racial epithet “nigger” continues to work as a mechanism of a persistent racial ideology. While several scholars have discussed the ways in which the Black body is hailed into being, a strict focus on the production of the racialized Black body overlooks the ways that whiteness depends upon this production and is therefore similarly (re)produced through the reproduction of the other (i.e. blackness). It is argued that first encounters with the “n‐word” have the power to discipline racial bodies by simultaneously hailing multiple racialized subjects into being and that this process is most productive during the early stages of youth. By drawing upon ethnographic data from a variety of ethnically and racially identified individuals, the author argues that this process may be common to all people within the United States, regardless of racial origin, and that the “n‐word,” as a racial epithet, continues to be used to situate racialized subjects on opposing sides of the “color line.”

T1  - Black Muse 4 U: Liminality, Self-Determination, and Racial Uplift in the Music of Prince
AN  - 1945565732
AB  - Prince’s unparalleled, innovative musical style remains widely revered by his worldwide audience in the wake of his death less than two years ago. Since the late twentieth century, many scholars have used European critical theory to examine Prince’s musical multidimensionality. These important analyses help us understand Prince’s music and performativity in new ways but repeatedly ignore the cultural roots of his music. Indeed, many critical discussions focus on his performance of ambiguous sexualities and sartorial strategies without addressing how Prince’s understanding of his Blackness played a crucial role in his creative practice and theatricality. I contend that exploring Prince’s dynamic oeuvre through interpretive lenses of radical black theory is a productive space for understanding his performance of lyrical and musical liminality, his self-determination in the music business, and his commitment to using his music for racial uplift. Prince’s creative practices were linked to his covert, but avid, support of social justice initiatives that support black humanity. Framing my analysis through Prince’s composition “Black Muse” from his final studio album, I explain how “Black Muse” provides lyrical and musical evidence of Prince’s political thought and deployment of counter narratives. I put “Black Muse” in conversation with “Baltimore,” “Resolution,” and “Planet Earth,” unapologetically activist songs written by Prince that discuss police brutality, warmongering, and climate change. I discuss how Prince’s strategic use of musical liminality in “Lady Cabdriver” obscures his political diatribes through a layer of sonic salacity. Combining close musical analysis with Black theoretical thought that explores Prince’s definitions of Black Muse, I explore Prince’s performances of blues hybridity, his tireless effort in repositioning his relationship with the music industry, and his mission to uplift his people. While Prince had muses, who were both Black and white, Prince’s ultimate creative muse was the Black community and the black experience itself. Prince scholars can benefit from exploring and utilizing various black performance theories to better understand and explain his contribution to global music culture.

T1  - Autonomy Support Fosters Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Disclosure and Wellness, Especially for Those with Internalized Homophobia
AN  - 1910720675
AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals experience disparities in psychological well-being, including greater symptoms of depression and anxiety, relative to their heterosexual peers. One group of LGB individuals is particularly vulnerable--those with high levels of internalized homophobia, or sexual prejudice directed toward the self. The current research explored whether a supportive social environment might be especially beneficial for this group. Specifically, we tested whether autonomy support within a given social environment (e.g., with family, friends, and peers or coworkers) is associated with greater identity disclosure and well-being in that environment, especially for those high in internalized homophobia. Using within-person analyses, we found support for this: perceptions of autonomy support predicted greater disclosure (outness) and well-being, and this relation was particularly strong for those high in internalized homophobia. Implications of these findings for promoting well-being among LGB individuals, a critical social issue, are discussed.

T1  - Prejudice in interreligious context: The role of metaprejudice and majority-minority status
AN  - 1945134961
AB  - Samples of two hundred forty-five majority Sunny Muslims, 87 Ahmadiyya Muslims, and 145 Christians were used to investigate the determinants and mediators of prejudice in interreligious context in Indonesia. First, the study extends the idea of in-group and out-group metaprejudice; both of which were found to mediate the relationship between perceived quality of intergroup relationship and personal prejudice. Second, we expected that majority members are more likely to reject a minority and that a minority is more likely to more strongly reject another minority than the majority for self-serving reasons. Additionally, the Sunni majority will prejudice and reject the Ahmadiyya minority more than the Christian minority due to the strained religious relation between the two Muslim groups. The hypotheses were confirmed. The findings are discussed in the context of stereotyping, and prejudice dynamics in other intergroup conflicts and ways of coping with such conflict are suggested.

T1  - Mirrored boundaries: how ongoing homeland-hostland contexts shape Bangladeshi immigrant collective identity formation
AN  - 1864677578
AB  - Largely overlooked in the international migration literature, migration from the Muslim world can reveal how the combination of globalization and ongoing homeland tensions shapes immigrants' collective identity formation in the hostland. Using the case of Bangladeshi Muslims in Los Angeles, this article ethnographically traces how ongoing and historic homeland, hostland, and global political-religious contexts shape immigrants' everyday struggles over identity categories through two distinct but overlapping processes: (1) the immigrants' exposure to a more expanded, diverse range of people in the hostland; (2) their import of homeland cleavages to the receiving society. It argues that through international migration, migrants both produce and experience globalization, consequently both reiterating and reconstructing their identity categories in the hostland. It also shows how the immigrants' cross-border ties to not only their homeland and hostland but also to nation-states beyond shape their identity-work, thus revealing conceptual ambiguities about transnationalism and diaspora.

T1  - African American Personal Presentation
AN  - 1830031114
AB  - A great amount of literature is dedicated to racial identity and self-perception, but very little addresses how hair may play a critical role in how African American women view themselves and others. African American women choose to wear their hair in a variety of styles, including weaves, wigs, dreads, chemically processed, or non-chemically processed (often referred to as "natural hair"). Researchers conducted a study that explored 282 African American females from urban and rural communities, varying in age, socio-economic status, and education levels and discussed the reporting of the hairstyles they currently wear, what styles they believe are more attractive/unattractive, what styles they believe are more professional/unprofessional, and what influenced the style they currently wear. In addition, these women completed the Rotter's Locus of Control and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scales. Regression analyses indicated there was a slight but significant positive correlation between a higher internal locus of control and those who choose to wear their hair in a natural state; however, the regression showed no statistically significant predictive value for hair selection. A discussion of the psychological implications for the findings, thoughts of self-perception, and how these findings can be used for future practice is addressed.

T1  - Internalized Oppression and Its Varied Moral Harms: Self-Perceptions of Reduced Agency and Criminality
AN  - 1968181048
AB  - The dominant view in the philosophical literature contends that internalized oppression, especially that experienced in virtue of one's womanhood, reduces one's sense of agency. Here, I extend these arguments and suggest a more nuanced account. In particular, I argue that internalized oppression can cause a person to conceive of herself as a deviant agent as well as a reduced one. This self-conception is also damaging to one's moral identity and creates challenges that are not captured by merely analyzing a reduced sense of agency. To help illustrate this claim, I consider experiences of people of color who internalize stereotypes regarding criminality and moral deviance. With these examples in mind, I show that internalized prejudices regarding criminality can cause people of color (men and women) to view themselves as outlaws in the moral community, that is, as wrongdoers. This conclusion helps give voice to some of the challenges that women of color who experience multiple sorts of internalized prejudices often face. To conclude, I discuss one strategy for empowerment that women of color have used when confronted with multiple forms of internalized oppression.

T1  - The effect of the belief in free market ideology on redressing corporate injustice
AN  - 1844847989
AB  - Many people in the major Western economies (e.g., United States, UK, and Germany) subscribe to free market ideology (FMI), which claims that institutional oversight of the market is unnecessary for public reaction can force corporations to regulate their own behavior. The question then becomes how people's belief in FMI affects their reactions to corporate transgressions. Given its ingroup-centered values, we hypothesized that FMI beliefs would bias reactions to corporate transgressions. We report results of a pilot study showing that FMI beliefs are predicted by selfishness, tradition, conformity, and lack of universalism. We then report three experiments, which showed that stronger FMI beliefs predict weaker demands to redress corporate injustices committed by ingroup (but not outgroup) corporations (Studies 1-3), especially when victims of corporate wrongdoings belong to an outgroup (rather than the ingroup; Study 3). The findings inform our conceptual understanding of FMI and give insights about its implications for market justice.

T1  - What's the Score?: A Content Analysis of Mature Adults in Super Bowl Commercials
AN  - 1827659972
AB  - Based on the rising mature adult population (those aged 65+), the importance of advertisers recognizing this consumer group is imperative to businesses and consumers alike. Thus, this content analysis of 272 Super Bowl commercials, from the last 5 years (2010-2014), applied framing theory to examine how mature audiences are represented in one of the most expensive and highly viewed advertising venues. Previous research suggests that older adults are typically underrepresented in all media and often stereotyped. This study shows the opposite is true for recent Super Bowl commercials. Mature adults are prominently featured in nearly one-third (31.99%) of all ads analyzed-more than double their proportion in the general population and Super Bowl audience-and are framed most often in a positive light (80.49%). This indicates a promising shift from depictions that alienate to a more inclusive culture where mature adults are part of the media landscape and recognized as a key consumer base. Results do show, however, that women and minorities (especially Hispanics/Latinos) continue to be significantly under-represented.

T1  - The effects of racial attitudes on affect and engagement in racially discordant medical interactions between non-Black physicians and Black patients: GPIR
AN  - 1800151388
AB  - The association between physicians' and patients' racial attitudes and poorer patient-physician communication in racially discordant medical interactions is well-documented. However, it is unclear how physicians' and patients' racial attitudes independently and jointly affect their behaviors during these interactions. In a secondary analysis of video-recorded medical interactions between non-Black physicians and Black patients, we examined how physicians' explicit and implicit racial bias and patients' perceived past discrimination influenced their own as well as one another's affect and level of engagement. Affect and engagement were assessed with a "thin slice" method. For physicians, the major findings were significant three-way interactions: physicians' affect and engagement were influenced by their implicit and explicit racial bias (i.e., aversive racism), but only when they interacted with patients who reported any incidence of prior discrimination. In contrast, patients' affect was influenced only by perceived discrimination. Theoretical and clinical implications of current findings are discussed.

T1  - The Impact of African American Parents' Racial Discrimination Experiences and Perceived Neighborhood Cohesion on their Racial Socialization Practices
AN  - 1795436269
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Understanding Diversity and Inequality: Dimensions Ranging from Race, Ethnicity, Immigration and Sexual Identity to Social Class 
Parental racial socialization is a parenting tool used to prepare African American adolescents for managing racial stressors. While it is known that parents' racial discrimination experiences affect the racial socialization messages they provide, little is known about the influence of factors that promote supportive and communal parenting, such as perceived neighborhood cohesion. In cohesive neighborhoods, neighbors may help parents address racial discrimination by monitoring youth and conveying racial socialization messages; additionally, the effect of neighborhood cohesion on parents' racial socialization may differ for boys and girls because parents socialize adolescents about race differently based on expected encounters with racial discrimination. Therefore, the current study examines how parents' perception of neighborhood cohesion and adolescents' gender moderate associations between parents' racial discrimination experiences and the racial socialization messages they deliver to their adolescents. Participants were a community sample of 608 African American adolescents (54 % girls; mean age = 15.5) and their primary caregivers (86 % biological mothers; mean age = 42.0). Structural equation modeling indicated that parental racial discrimination was associated with more promotion of mistrust messages for boys and girls in communities with low neighborhood cohesion. In addition, parental racial discrimination was associated with more cultural socialization messages about racial pride and history for boys in neighborhoods with low neighborhood cohesion. The findings suggest that parents' racial socialization messages are influenced by their own racial discrimination experiences and the cohesiveness of the neighborhood; furthermore, the content of parental messages delivered varies based on adolescents' gender.

T1  - Identity constructions among breakdancers
AN  - 1790889907
AB  - The hip-hop culture has evolved from the ghettos of The Bronx, New York in the 1970s, into a global phenomenon. Despite such prominence there is an absence of academic research on the hip-hop culture element: breakdance. Through eight months of participant observations and 17 qualitative interviews, this study investigates the identity construction process among breakdancers with diverse ethnic backgrounds in Norway. The aim is to provide an insight into the lives of young people and their impression management in constructing a breaker identity. The analysis highlights the complex and contested nature of breakdance as it is experienced and viewed by young people performing breakdance in Norway. Through deliberate impression management the breakdancers construct an alternative identity detached from other social categories. As a result, breakdance seems to counter social oppression and to have an empowering and liberating potential different from the common stigmatization and stereotypical prejudices regarding gender and ethnicity that many have experienced.

T1  - Disposable subjects: The racial normativity of neoliberalism and Latino immigrants
AN  - 1776458622
AB  - This essay argues that a defining feature of the rise of the particular form of neoliberalism in the United States has been the adoption of "technologies" of racialization that leads to the framing of Latino immigrants as disposable and vulnerable subjects. These practices emerged as a way of mediating the contradictions between neoliberalism's ostensible commitment to the normative foundation of liberal democracy, the necessity of securing sources of cheap labor, and the need to contain the perceived threat of those "unruly" subjects who are necessary, but suspicious and assumed to be unassimilable. What results is a state of "precariousness" and "indeterminateness" that characterize both the objective and subjective dimensions of the quotidian reality of Latino immigrants. These are not accidental or natural outcomes of their immigrant status, but rather the result of deliberate policies adopted by neoliberal economic and political elites who have used the "technologies" of racialization to create and control this liminal societal space. After providing a description of what it is about neoliberalism that has led to these conditions, I explain the neoliberal deployment of racial technologies by delineating the relationship between the context of Latino racialization, and how conditions of structural vulnerability produce disposability as both an objective and subjective characteristic of the lived experience of a specific sector of Latino immigrants.

T1  - An Outside View: What Observers Say About Others' Races and Hispanic Origins: PROD
AN  - 1773540152
AB  - Outsiders' views of a person's race or Hispanic origin can affect how she sees herself, how she reports her race/ethnicity, and her social and economic experiences. Social processes of constructing race are complicated for people whose identity is not reflected back to them in interactions, and mismatched identification gives insight into social assumptions. Using unique linked data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses, we find that in 90% of our 3.7 million cases, proxy reports (e.g., neighbors) of a person's race/ethnicity match responses given by the household. Match rates are high for non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, and Asians and for Hispanic ethnicity. Matches are much less common for other groups (American Indian/Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, Some Other Race, multiracial, and the race(s) of Hispanics). Proxies often report biracial Black-Whites as Black, but tend to report biracial American Indian-Whites, Asian-Whites, and Pacific Islander-Whites as non-Hispanic White rather than as people of color. Proxies frequently report children as multiple race and elders as single race, whether they are or not, potentially lowering the average age of the multiracial population. Proxies tend to report the person's race and Hispanic origin as consistent with others in the tract, potentially increasing measured residential segregation.

T1  - Why Border Enforcement Backfired
AN  - 1778392902
AB  - In this article the authors undertake a systematic analysis of why border enforcement backfired as a strategy of immigration control in the United States. They argue theoretically that border enforcement emerged as a policy response to a moral panic about the perceived threat of Latino immigration to the United States propounded by self-interested bureaucrats, politicians, and pundits who sought to mobilize political and material resources for their own benefit. The end result was a self-perpetuating cycle of rising enforcement and increased apprehensions that resulted in the militarization of the border in a way that was disconnected from the actual size of the undocumented flow. Using an instrumental variable approach, the authors show how border militarization affected the behavior of unauthorized migrants and border outcomes to transform undocumented Mexican migration from a circular flow of male workers going to three states into an 11 million person population of settled families living in 50 states.

T1  - Do we know what we are asking? Individual and group cognitive interviews<sup>1</sup>: Postdisciplinary Humanities & Social Sciences Quarterly
AN  - 2583763215
AB  - The paper deals with cognitive interview, a method for pre-testing survey questions that is used in pilot testing to develop new measures and/or adapt ones in foreign languages. The aim is to explore the usefulness of the method by looking at two questionnaires measuring anti-Roma prejudice. The first, the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), contains questions that are dominantly used to test two dimensions of social perceptions of various groups: warmth and competence. The second, Interventions for Reducing Prejudice against Stigmatized Minorities (INTERMIN) consists of the items most frequently used in contact research to measure attitudes, social distance, anxiety, trust and behavioural intentions towards outgroups. Two rounds of cognitive interviews were held on both questionnaires to verbally evaluate participants’ understanding and/or interpretation of the draft questions. The first round was attended by university students, while the second round (with improved versions of the questionnaires) was done with high school students, as they are the target group for planned interventions based on the contact paradigm. The paper explains the problems/difficulties the participants had answering some of the questions and our attempts at improving the questionnaires. The problems can be grouped around six issues: The first two deal with the strategies participants used to answer our questions – whom exactly did they have in mind when answering the questionnaires and whose viewpoint did they represent in their answers. The next four problems are around nuances in the formulations of our questions and generally have to do with how the participants interpreted our questions – they concern assumptions that distinct items were logically interconnected, the period of time and locality referred to in our questions, translation and transferability of meanings from one language to another and double negation.

T1  - THE POLITICS OF HIP-HOP CULTURE IN THE CLASSROOM
AN  - 1867156496
AB  - Education is both an ideological and political enterprise where dominant expressions of racial, gendered, classed, and generational forms are borne out in the classroom on a daily basis in avariety of ways. These ways of thinking, knowing, and being have become not just commonplace, but normal. Anything existing outside these so-called normal standards and practices is marginalized, ostracized, and in some cases criminalized in the public school classroom leaving many of our students under-represented and under-served. Therefore critical and democratic educators must seek to disrupt these notions of "common sense" that serve to reproduce oppressive societal norms in education. To this end critically minded educators must ask several questions: 1. How are relationships between curriculum and culture created and maintained? 2. Who is "invisible" in our schools and classrooms? Why are they so? 3. What counts as intellectual work and who says that this is so? 4. How do educators begin to make arguments that contradict "common sense"? 5. What and where are the possibilities for the formation of strategic alliances? 6. What are the implications, intended and otherwise? I wish to examine each of these questions so that students and educators can begin to buildcounter-narratives around how public education in the United States "should work" and what can be done to "fix it." In particular, I wish to look at the ways that hip-hop culture can be employed as meaningful strategy for educators and students to explore their collective vision of what it means to be human. How does the intersection of education and hip-hop culture allow students to create a shared understanding of identity, agency for themselves, and change in their communities.

T1  - SABOTAGING SUCCESS: EXAMINING ACADEMIC DIS-IDENTIFICATION AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE ADOLESCENTS
AN  - 1867156494
AB  - Academic underachievement among African American male adolescents is regarded as a national dilemma (Lewis, Simon, Uzzell, Horwitz, & Casserly, 2010). Explanations related to such may stem from the attitudes of adolescents who may be deterred in pursuing academic achievement due to potential reactions of their peers. The purpose of this study is to examine the attitudes of minority youth in relation to academic achievement. Specifically, this study attempts to identify the extent to which racial identity is associated with negative views towards academic achievement. In addition, the existence of protective factors in relation to students being accused of abandoning their racial identity are identified. Through the use of questionnaires, male African American adolescents within a middle school setting in southeast Texas revealed that the pursuit of academic achievement is correlated with their racial identity. Additional findings and areas of further research, such as the impact of parent/teacher expectations and alternative forms of instruction (i.e., technology integrated, etc.) are identified.

T1  - On the Use of Race and Ethnicity as Variables in Violence Research
AN  - 1728660882; 201533335
AB  - Race and ethnicity are important social constructs. However, they are also complex constructs, and handling them appropriately and without bias in scientific research remains a challenge. This editorial identifies some limitations of common approaches to using race and ethnicity merely as 'social address' markers. The need to consider ways that race, ethnicity, and related constructs such as national origin might vary outside the United States is also addressed. Fourteen specific suggestions are offered for ways to improve the handling of race and ethnicity in psychology research, with a specific focus on the topic of violence research. These include fairly simple steps, such as using racial and ethnic designations as adjectives, not nouns, and providing detailed racial and ethnic membership for your entire sample without collapsing across dissimilar groups just because they are few in number. Others are more resource-intensive steps, such as adopting sampling frames that will lead to more diverse samples or greater inclusion of understudied groups. With specific regard to violence research, we need more research on topics such as hate crimes, cultural adaptations of prevention and intervention programs, and evaluations of whether prevention and intervention work equally well across racial and ethnic groups.

T1  - Building social resilience in soldiers: A double dissociative randomized controlled study
AN  - 1767329104; 201605412
AB  - Can social resilience be trained? We report results of a double-dissociative randomized controlled study in which 48 Army platoons were randomly assigned to social resilience training (intervention condition) or cultural awareness training (active control group). The same surveys were administered to all platoons at baseline and after the completion of training to determine the short-term training effects, generalization effects beyond training, and possible adverse effects. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that social resilience, compared with cultural awareness, training produced small but significant improvements in social cognition (e.g., increased empathy, perspective taking, & military hardiness) and decreased loneliness, but no evidence was found for social resilience training to generalize beyond these training foci nor to have adverse effects. Moreover, as predicted, cultural awareness, compared with social resilience, training produced increases in knowledge about and decreases in prejudice toward Afghans. Additional research is warranted to determine the long-term durability, safety, and generalizability of social resilience training. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Tapping generalized essentialism to predict outgroup prejudices
AN  - 1728660162; 201533943
AB  - Psychological essentialism, the perception that groups possess inherent properties binding them and differentiating them from others, is theoretically relevant to predicting prejudice. Recent developments isolate two key dimensions: essentialistic entitativity (EE; groups as unitary, whole, entity-like) and essentialistic naturalness (EN; groups as fixed and immutable). We introduce a novel question: does tapping the covariance between EE and EN, rather than pitting them against each other, boost prejudice prediction? In Study 1 (re-analysis of Roets & Van Hiel, 2011b, Samples 1-3, in Belgium) and Study 2 (new Canadian data) their common/shared variance, modelled as generalized essentialism, doubles the predictive power relative to regression-based approaches with regard to racism (but not anti-gay or -schizophrenic prejudices). Theoretical implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - In the Convergence of Ethnicity and Immigration: The Status and Socio-ecological Predictors of the Self-Concept of Recent Chinese Immigrant School-Age Children in Canada
AN  - 1680154357; 201513936
AB  - With the convergence of recent immigration and an ethnic minority, Chinese children residing in a Western country such as Canada may be doubly disadvantaged for the development of self-concept. This study investigated the status and the socio-ecological predictors of the self-concept of recent Chinese immigrant children of school age who were living in Canada. Socio-ecological predictors were hypothesized to be the current classroom environment and the family's heritage cultural beliefs. Child scales measuring self-concept and classroom environment were administered to 202 children, aged 8-13 years, who comprised Chinese immigrants (n = 112) and Caucasian non-immigrants (n = 90). Their parents completed a measure of cultural beliefs. The results showed that the immigrant children scored lower in all domains of self-concept than did the non-immigrants and all but one of the domains of self-concept were differentially predicted by the classroom climate and the cultural beliefs in both groups. Implications for practice and research are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Construction of Migrant Work and Workers by Alberta Legislators, 2000-2011
AN  - 1665530584
AB  - By conceptualizing temporary international migrant workers as "foreigners labouring within a 'foreign labour market' instead of being an integral component of Canadian society" ([Sharma] 2006, 7), policy-makers can avoid difficult questions about whether partial citizenship is socially just. By casting international migrants as "others", state-imposed limits on their rights can be seen as an effort to "protect" the jobs of Canadian workers from the threat posed by international migrant workers. It uncritically accepts the well-established but contestable position that citizens should have preferential access to jobs. As Vosko (2010) notes, this "othering" effect may also be intensified by ethnic and racial prejudices. International migrants are likely to be viewed differently than inter-provincial migrants, who are both citizens and more likely members of the dominant ethnic group. Similarly, by casting international migrants as "workers" (rather than human beings), the state can legitimize its immigration and labour practices ([Bauder] 2006), including international migrant workers' partial citizenship. Framing international migrants narrowly as workers implies they are here to perform solely an economic role. Canadians are encouraged to see only the functional utility of international migrants and not the full scope of their humanity.              The boom of the 2000s was different in a number of ways. First, while there was still significant interprovincial migration, net interprovincial migration began declining in 2006 and was effectively zero by 2009 (Alberta 2011a). This decline occurred despite relatively high unemployment (between 7.9% and 14.7%) in Atlantic Canada (a traditional "sending" region) during this time (HRSDC 2012). High unemployment in other provinces has historically been an important "push" factor for interprovincial migration (Hiller 2009). A net decline in such migration during a period of high unemployment suggests that deteriorating "pull" factors reduced Alberta's ability or desire to attract interprovincial migrants. For example, wage growth slowed in 2006 and inflation rose, significantly eroding the potential wage gains interprovincial migrants could realize by moving to Alberta (Alberta 2008a). Alberta also experienced a severe housing shortage at this time, with some workers in the province's major cities living in tents in campgrounds and squatting in the river valley. Indeed, as the economy improved, net interprovincial migration picked up again in 2011 (Alberta 2013).              As international migrant labour becomes a permanent feature of Alberta's and Canada's labour market, the political pressures surrounding it require governments to justify its use. As part of that political process, Alberta government MLAs constructed narratives about the necessity of international migrant labour as well as the undesirability of international migrant workers. Specifically MLAs asserted that migrant work (1) was economically necessary and (2) posed no threat to Canadian workers. MLAs also asserted that international migrant workers (3) had questionable occupational, linguistic or cultural skills and (4) caused negative social and economic impacts in Canada. This seeming contradiction can be reconciled as an effort to justify international migrant work (despite the political tensions and problems inherent with it) by "othering" international migrant workers. Specifically, international migrant workers are dehumanized by discussing them in solely economic terms and by characterizing them as undesirable workers who pose a threat to Canadian communities (although not jobs). These framings justify their partial citizenship and poor treatment.

T1  - The Intergenerational Transmission of Intermarriage Attitudes and Intergroup Friendships: The Role of Turkish Migrant Parents
AN  - 1667951057; 201509446
AB  - Most studies on social integration of ethnic minorities focus on the role of segregation, intergroup threat and hostility. The role of parents and the values they try to convey has received much less attention. These may include ideas about the appropriate choice of friends and spouses. Previous studies have shown an impact of parental attitudes and contacts on the interethnic contacts of their school-aged children. But do adult children also reflect parental attitudes in their attitudes and social networking? Parental influence may begin to wane when children become older. This article investigates the influence of parents on their adult children's attitudes and interethnic social contacts. Based on a unique data-set with parent-child dyads from a random sample of Turkish minorities in France, Germany and the Netherlands, I test first, whether parents influence their adult children's attitudes and second, the extent to which the ethnic composition of the social circle of parents affects that of their children. Third, I study how parents' and children's attitudes relate to children's interethnic social contacts. I find that parental attitudes do not have a direct impact on the interethnic social contacts of their children, but that they affect them indirectly through children's attitudes towards intermarriage.

T1  - A RACIAL CASTE IN CLASS: RACE AND CLASS DISTINCTIONS WITHIN BLACK COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND UNITED KINGDOM
AN  - 1751968634
AB  - Since the 1960s, there have been four similar schools of thought on the origins and nature of black practical consciousness in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK): the adaptive-vitality school and the pathological-pathogenic school in the US; and the anti-essentialist and anti-anti-essentialist schools in the UK. In the US, the pathological-pathogenic position argues that in its divergences from white American norms and values black American consciousness is nothing more than a pathological form of, and reaction to, American consciousness rather than a dual (both African and American) hegemonic opposing "identity-in-differential" (the term is Gayatri Spivak's) to the American one. Proponents of the adaptive-vitality school argue that the divergences are not pathologies but African "institutional transformations" preserved on the American landscape. Just the same in the UK, the two main opposing schools of thought are the anti-essentialist and the anti-anti-essentialist. Anti-essentialists argue against any ideas of a black phenomenon that unites all black people, and contends that diasporic identities and cultures cannot place African origin at the center of any attempt to understand the nature of black practical consciousness in the UK. The anti-anti-essentialist position posits the idea that African memory retentions exist in diasporic cultures to some degree. The purpose of the present work is to understand black practical consciousnesses in the US and UK by working out the theoretical and methodological problems from which these four divergent positions are constructed in order to arrive at a more sociohistorical, rather than racial, understanding of black practical consciousnesses in the US and UK.

T1  - 'It's the Demography, Stupid': Ethnic Change and Opposition to Immigration
AN  - 1667953508; 201509544
AB  - It is often forgotten that, regardless of time or place, periods of high immigration are almost always periods of high anti-immigration sentiment. When ethnic change is rapid, driven by immigration or differences in ethnic natural increase, the ethnic majority often responds with a politics of immigration. This was true, for instance, in Britain in the 1960s, in the US during 1890-1925 and in interwar Scotland. I show that White British people in locales experiencing rapid ethnic change are more likely to call for lower immigration and to vote BNP. On the other hand, where there is already a high level of ethnic minorities, white opinion is less hostile to immigration: UKIP does poorly among whites in diverse areas. Habituation to change, typically within a decade, and assimilation-especially of Europeans-over a generation reduces hostility to immigration. If the rate of ethnic change slows, we should therefore expect a reduction in the salience of immigration. Ironically, because the children of European migrants are more readily accepted into the ethnic majority than is the case for non-Europeans, a shift from EU free movement to non-European skilled migrants, as is advocated by UKIP, could run counter to the wishes of its own supporters.

AN  - 1692288629; 201521324
AB  - This article describes the socio-demographic characteristics of a sample of gay men in three cities in Chile, as well as experience with homophobia and subjective well-being. Snowball sampling was used to interview 325 gay men. The main findings included high levels of perceived discrimination and victimization, but interviewees reported higher levels of social well-being compared to studies elsewhere in the country. Age was related to differences in levels of social well-being, but not other variables. Individuals with university education reported higher levels of victimization and greater impact of discrimination on their lives. Gay men in Santiago reported a higher relative impact from incidents of aggression, but better levels of social well-being and happiness compared to those in other regions of Chile.

T1  - Neighbourhood Ethnic Composition and Employment Effects on Immigrant Incomes
AN  - 1541997839; 201426837
AB  - Currently, in many Western countries there are concerns that clustering of ethnic minorities in certain parts of cities will negatively affect integration processes. However, scholarly theory and evidence on this point is mixed. We use Swedish data and conduct a panel analysis quantifying the degree to which the ethnic composition of the neighbourhood affects the subsequent labour income of individuals for the 1991 to 2006 period. We employ a fixed effects model to reduce the potential bias arising from unmeasured individual characteristics leading to neighbourhood selection. We also control for a range of individual demographic and socioeconomic attributes. Based on gender-stratified analyses of eight immigrant categories (N = 110,000) in three Swedish metropolitan areas, we find that male immigrants (females less so) gain if they reside in neighbourhoods with higher shares of co-ethnics and (under most circumstances) other immigrants, though the impact depends on neighbourhood level of employment and trajectory of ethnic share. This, we argue, should not be seen as an argument for ethnic residential segregation, but it tells us that the high degree of exclusion from the labour market experienced by many immigrants in Sweden is not directly caused by the level of immigrant residential segregation.

T1  - Gender and cultural citizenship among non-Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union in Israel
AN  - 1559007198; 201432004
AB  - About 330,000 of partial Jews and gentiles have moved to Israel after 1990 under the Law of Return. The article is based on interviews with middle-aged gentile spouses of Jewish immigrants, aiming to capture their perspective on integration and citizenship in the new homeland where they are ethnic minority. Slavic wives of Jewish men manifested greater malleability and adopted new lifestyles more readily than did Slavic husbands of Jewish women, particularly in relation to Israeli holidays and domestic customs. Most women considered formal conversion as a way to symbolically join the Jewish people, while no men pondered over this path to full Israeli citizenship. Women's perceptions of the IDF and military service of their children were idealistic and patriotic, while men's perceptions were more critical and pragmatic. We conclude that women have a higher stake at joining the mainstream due to their family commitments and matrilineal transmission of Jewishness to children. Men's hegemony in the family and in the social hierarchy of citizenship attenuates their drive for cultural adaptation and enables rather critical stance toward Israeli society. Cultural politics of belonging, therefore, reflect the gendered norms of inclusion in the nation-state. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Structure liberates?': mixing for mobility and the cultural transformation of 'urban children' in a London academy
AN  - 1551000494; 201429026
AB  - This paper explores how the creation of a socially and ethnically mixed student body relates to mobility within the context of Beaumont Academy. This authoritarian school opened in 2004 under the ethos 'structure liberates'. Based in a predominantly deprived, ethnic minority area of London, Beaumont seeks to culturally transform its students. With its outstanding GCSE results, the school has been championed as a blueprint for reform, yet the cultural implications underlying this approach remain unexamined. The ethos pathologizes the surrounding area while essentializing itself as an 'oasis in the desert' liberating students through discipline. The paper explores how mobility is embodied by students and the alterations or eliminations necessary to achieve it. These alterations produce raced and classed positions and bring them into focus, highlighting who needs to 'adjust' themselves to accrue value. Uncritical celebrations of mixed-ness conceal structural inequalities lingering beneath the rhetoric of happy multiculturalism and aspirational citizenship. These inequalities are exacerbated by a marketized education system. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The European backlash against immigration and multiculturalism
AN  - 1531931000; 201423309
AB  - Europe forms an interesting laboratory for studying political reactions to mass immigration and integration of ethnic minorities during times of political turbulence and economic crisis. Political leaders of mainstream parties, under pressure from critics of intensified immigration and now from the social effects of the Great Recession, act reactively and defensively. They respond to a political backlash against immigration and to concerns about unemployment and job security by criticizing (mainly illegal) immigrants for welfare parasitism, reluctance to integrate and even criminality. Such criticism generates a climate of suspicion and hostility towards immigrants and legitimizes policies that restrict immigration and immigrant rights. The leaders also describe 'multiculturalism' -- portrayed as uncritical acceptance of cultural diversity -- as a failure, and suggest more 'realistic' (read: less tolerant, more assimilationist) policy strategies.

T1  - Black-White Biracial Children's Social Development from Kindergarten to Fifth Grade: Links with Racial Identification, Gender, and Socioeconomic Status
AN  - 1494750140; 201402018
AB  - In this study, we investigated trajectories of Black-White biracial children's social development during middle childhood, their associations with parents' racial identification of children, and the moderating effects of child gender and family socioeconomic status (SES). The study utilized data from parent and teacher reports on 293 US Black-White biracial children enrolled in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). Growth curve models suggested increasing trajectories of teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors between kindergarten and fifth grade. Parents' racial identification of children predicted child externalizing behavior trajectories such that teachers rated biracially identified children's externalizing behaviors lower relative to those of Black- and White-identified children. Additionally, for White-identified biracial children, the effect of family SES on internalizing behavior trajectories was especially pronounced. These findings suggest that in the USA, how parents racially identify their Black-White biracial children early on has important implications for children's problem behaviors throughout the elementary school years.

T1  - Transnational Diaspora Lobbying: Europeanization and the Kurdish Question
AN  - 1531932413; 201423234
AB  - Turkey's European Union (EU) negotiations are generally believed to positively affect the rights of ethnic minorities in Turkey. Through a detailed case study, this article examines how members of the Kurdish diaspora in Europe aim to influence this process through lobbying, and to what extent 'Europeanization' is channelling the organisation and strategies of the Kurdish lobby. We focus on three facets of transnational diaspora lobbying: political opportunity structures (understood as formal institutions), discursive opportunity structures and the organisational flexibility of activists to adapt to new opportunities. Drawing on interviews, EU documents and documentation from Brussels-based Kurdish organisations, we find the growing importance of European institutions to be both a boon and a bane for transnational diaspora lobbying on all three counts.

T1  - Perceived Discrimination in LGBTIQ Discourse from Australia: A Typology of Verbal Discrimination
AN  - 1718069789; 201530769
AB  - New within the field of discourse analysis, perceived discrimination (PD) is the study of discourse that focuses on the perspectives of the victims of discrimination. This article explores the experiences of verbal discrimination as reported by eighteen LGBTIQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Queer/Questioning) participants during semi-structured, co-constructed interviews. Data was classified in order to develop a taxonomy of discrimination based on Mellor (2003; 2004) who foregrounds two types of discrimination: verbal and behavioural. In this paper, I identify the forms of verbal discrimination encountered by the participants and offer an analysis of the discourse used in the construction of the experiences and effects reported. The results show that verbal discrimination is mainly triggered by a perceived transgression of the normalised standards of people's behaviour, movements and appearance in a heterosexist society.

T1  - Cognitive Components of Ingroup Projection: Prototype Projection Contributes to Biased Prototypicality Judgments in Group Perception
AN  - 1650146189; 201502038
AB  - This research investigated whether relative ingroup prototypicality (i.e., the tendency to perceive one's own ingroup as more prototypical of a superordinate category than the outgroup) can result from a prototype-based versus exemplar-based mental representation of social categories, rather than from ingroup membership per se as previously suggested by the ingroup projection model. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that a prototype-based group was perceived as more prototypical of a superordinate category than an exemplar-based group supporting the hypothesis that an intergroup context is not necessary for biased prototypicality judgments. Experiment 3 introduced an intergroup context in a minimal-group-like paradigm. The findings demonstrated that both the kind of cognitive representation and motivational processes contribute to biased prototypicality judgments in intergroup settings.

T1  - Kurdish migrant mothers in London enacting citizenship
AN  - 1512220988; 201408791
AB  - The article explores the mothering work of a group of Kurdish women in London as enactments of citizenship. Rather than focusing on their integration, it foregrounds the migrant mothers' ability to disrupt hegemonic citizenship narratives and bring into being new political subjects. They co-construct diasporic citizenship, through their mothering work, producing their children's cultural identifications as both British and Kurdish. These identifications are contingent, involving intra-ethnic contestations of legitimate Kurdish culture. Kurdish migrant mothers' cultural work is not simply about making nation state citizens. By giving meaning to cultural continuity and change, the mothers reference multiple levels of belonging (local, national and diasporic) which challenge state boundaries. The article shows that although mothers play a key role in constructing their children's cultural identities and their articulation in ethnic and national terms, they also contest the meaning of ethnic minority cultural practices and group boundaries, potentially disrupting hegemonic narratives of good citizenship as ethno-national.

T1  - Acculturation Attitudes and Social Adjustment in British South Asian Children: A Longitudinal Study
AN  - 1494749280; 201400159
AB  - A 1-year longitudinal study with three testing points was conducted with 215 British Asian children aged 5 to 11 years to test hypotheses from Berry's acculturation framework. Using age-appropriate measures of acculturation attitudes and psychosocial outcomes, it was found that (a) children generally favored an 'integrationist' attitude, and this was more pronounced among older (8-10 years) than in younger (5-7 years) children and (b) temporal changes in social self-esteem and peer acceptance were associated with different acculturation attitudes held initially, as shown by latent growth curve analyses. However, a supplementary time-lagged regression analysis revealed that children's earlier 'integrationist' attitudes may be associated with more emotional symptoms (based on teachers' ratings) 6 months later. The implications of these different outcomes of children's acculturation attitudes are discussed.

T1  - African American and Black Caribbean Mutual Feelings of Closeness: Findings From a National Probability Survey
AN  - 1550999634; 201429120
AB  - African American and Black Caribbean relations are described as strained. Standard portrayals of Black Caribbeans as a 'model minority' that has effectively assimilated into the American landscape often make explicit their distinctiveness from and enmity toward African Americans. Analysis using National Survey of American Life data (N = 6,082), exploring the nature and correlates of intergroup perceptions, reveals that both groups characterize their mutual relationships as being close. Gender and region of residence influence African American feelings of closeness toward Black Caribbeans, while for Black Caribbeans, perceived discrimination was significantly associated with feelings of closeness to African Americans. Black Caribbean immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries and Haiti felt closer to African Americans than did Jamaicans. In addition, foreign-born Black Caribbeans (first generation) felt closer to Black people from the Caribbean than second-generation Black Caribbeans. These and other findings are discussed in relation to research on intergroup closeness among African Americans and Black Caribbeans.

T1  - Voices from Vietnam: experiences of children and youth with disabilities, and their families, from an Agent Orange affected rural region
AN  - 1520343087; 201413346
AB  - This study examines the experiences of young people with disabilities from ethnic minorities, and their families, in central Vietnam. The study is set in an area contaminated by Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Data were gathered from interviews with youth with disabilities and interviews and focus groups with mothers who had children with disabilities. Respondents expressed confronting multiple barriers to inclusion, education, health and well-being similar to other persons with disabilities and their families from around the world. Participants sought broad-ranging human rights as they described experiencing stigmatization and marginalization from negative social reaction toward disabilities and by residing in a location known for dioxin contamination. The participants' voices are not only important in informing program responses to support implementation of Vietnam's new National Law on Persons with Disabilities, but also timely as the US government considers proposed legislation providing material support for Vietnamese nationals affected by Agent Orange.

T1  - 'We are not criminals, we are just victims of circumstances': An exploration of experiences of Nigerian immigrants' men that married South African women in Johannesburg
AN  - 1448992706; 201343698
AB  - The world is full of ethnic, racial and religious divisions and intermarriage between members of different groups can be seen as an indication that divisions are overcome. Marriage is a union between individuals that imply family ties and social sanctioning. Similarly, intermarriage is considered to be a major pointer of overcoming social distance among groups and cohesion of societies. In other words, intermarriage has been argued to be a channel through which members of different groups relate and interact with one another in a more positive way and see each group as being socially equal without any form of prejudice or discrimination. However, intermarriages between Nigerian men and South African women exist in South Africa amongst the institutionalised xenophobia and anti-Nigerian sentiments. It is on this note that this study examines how Nigerian-South African couples negotiate and adapt to the discriminations directed towards Nigerian husbands by their friends and families, and how this changed the perception of their friends and families over time. The study is based on data gathered from a four-month ethnographic fieldwork in Johannesburg and the data were collected through participant observations and in-depth interviews of 15 Nigerian-South African couples, friends and families. This study also uses Alba and Nee's 'intermarriage and assimilation theory' in order to show how marriages between Nigerian men and South African women led to breakdown in xenophobic attitudes of wives' families and friends.

T1  - Ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics and knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about HIV among Yunnanese Chinese, Hmong, Lahu and Northern Thai in a north-western Thailand border district
AN  - 1700675390; 201525249
AB  - Data from ethnically diverse north-western Thailand with recent migrants from Myanmar (Burma) and China allow testing of hypotheses concerning between- and within-community differences in predominantly Yunnanese Chinese, Hmong and Lahu ethnic minority villages versus ethnic majority Thai villages. Topics include knowledge of HIV transmission, prevention and treatment, avoidance of people infected with HIV and constraints to use of health services. Respondents include women with one or more children under age five and their husbands/partners. Ethnicity is consistently associated with socioeconomic characteristics, knowledge of HIV transmission, prevention and treatment, avoidance of people living with HIV and AIDS, and constraints to use of services. Chinese community residents had the lowest levels of knowledge of HIV, especially with regard to mother-to-child transmission, the most intent to avoid contact with people living with HIV and AIDS, and the highest levels of constraints to using services, including ineligibility for government healthcare and limited Thai language ability. Associations of counselling with Thai language ability, and more knowledge and less avoidance of people living with HIV and AIDS, suggest that language-appropriate health education may help overcome disparities.

T1  - Counter-prejudicial training reduces activation of biased associations and enhances response monitoring
AN  - 1448995286; 201342662
AB  - Although implicitly measured bias was once assumed to be highly stable, subsequent research has shown that it is, in fact, malleable. One technique for altering implicit bias is through counter-prejudicial training. At least two broad mechanisms may drive this effect. First, training people to respond in counter-prejudicial ways may diminish the extent to which biased associations are activated in memory. Second, training may strengthen processes that reduce the influence of biased associations on responses. Participants received either counter-prejudicial, pro-prejudicial, or no training and then completed an implicit measure of bias. Application of the quadruple process model revealed support for both mechanisms: Counter-prejudicial training produced less activation of biased associations as well as enhanced detection of appropriate responses compared with pro-prejudicial or no training. Implications for the development of bias-reduction training are discussed. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - God Bless Our Children? The Role of Generation, Discrimination and Religious Context for Migrants in Europe
AN  - 1417520394; 201332085
AB  - This article deals with individual and contextual effects on the religiosity of first and second generation migrants in Europe. Noticing that little attention has been directed towards intergenerational transmission of religion in processes of integration, we argue for an intergenerational perspective on immigrant religiosity. Social integration theory is used to derive the hypothesis that second generation immigrants are less religious than the first generation. Perceived discrimination is introduced in the immigrant-religion research to account for the stress buffering capacities of religion. On the contextual level we expect a positive effect of native religiosity and religious diversity. Three aspects of religiosity are examined: (1) religious affiliation, (2) inner religiosity and (3) praying. We use four waves (2002-2008) of the European Social Survey (ESS) in a 3-level random intercept multilevel model with 19,567 individuals, 235 regions and 26 countries. Among others, the most interesting results are that (1) second generation immigrants are less religious than their first generation counterparts, (2) perceived discrimination has a positive effect on immigrant religiosity and the effect is greater for the second generation, (3) native religiosity has a positive effect on immigrant religiosity with a greater effect on the second generation as well and (4) the influence on migrant religiosity is more salient at the regional than at the national level.

T1  - Managing Integration: German and British Policy Responses to the "Threat from Within" Post-2001
AN  - 1364705024; 201323431
AB  - The involvement of European Muslims in violent events since 2001 has confronted European states with their alleged failure to adequately integrate migrant and ethnic minority populations. More specifically, these events increased cultural and security concerns associated with growing diversity and created a climate in which the issues of breaking up parallel societies, and, more explicitly, integrating Muslim minority populations have become particularly pressing. As previous approaches aimed at incorporating migrants have been branded as a failure, many European governments have begun re-developing their policies on migrant incorporation, not least to mitigate the potential "threat" posed by a lack of integration. This article focuses on German and British policy developments in the area of integration post-2001 and compares how the two states have responded to the alleged "threat from within".

T1  - Demographic group differences in adolescents' time attitudes
AN  - 1364702938; 201326312
AB  - In the present study, we examined demographic differences in time attitudes in a sample of 293 adolescents. Time attitudes were measured using the Adolescent Time Attitude Scale (Mello & Worrell, 2007; Worrell, Mello, & Buhl, 2011), which assesses positive and negative attitudes toward the past, the present, and the future. Generally, African Americans and Asian Americans reported higher scores for negative time attitudes and lower scores for positive time attitudes than European Americans and Latinos, with medium sizes. Adolescents in the low socioeconomic status group reported a less favorable evaluation of their past than middle and high SES peers, but there were no meaningful differences in time attitudes by gender. Findings indicate that middle SES adolescents, high school juniors and seniors, Latinos, and European Americans had higher representation in positive time attitude clusters (i.e., Positives and Balanced) than high SES adolescents, high school freshmen and sophomores, and African Americans.

T1  - Struggling Insecurity: Ahmadiyya Community in Bangladesh
AN  - 1448995700; 201342862
AB  - Human security is a fundamental approach, which focuses on ensuring security for the individual in respect of socio-economic status, creed and ethnic background. Religious difference serves as a source of potential conflict in every heterogeneous society that violates human security and human rights. The study examined how religious identity jeopardised human security and human rights in relation to the Ahmadiyya community in Bangladesh. A qualitative method was applied to collect data using in-depth interviews, case studies, informal group discussions and participant observations. The study revealed that Ahmadiyya could hardly escape from vicious attacks and harassments because of their religious identity. The study also found that the prevailing state of insecurity violated the human rights of the community with regard to different social aspects. Under harsh circumstances, many Ahmadiyya left their residences to save their lives from aggressive persecutions from anti-Ahmadiyya sections. Thus, the violent experiences of the Ahmadiyya discouraged them from contributing to socio-economic growth of the nation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Relationship of Jewish Community Contexts and Jewish Identity: A 22-Community Study
AN  - 1417527229; 201331930
AB  - This paper explores the manner in which Jewish community contexts relate to Jewish identity. We employ the Decade 2000 Data Set that contains almost 20,000 randomly selected Jewish households from 22 American Jewish communities interviewed from 2000 to 2010. Because of the large sample size, and its incorporation of community infrastructure data, this research also is able to examine various influences on Jewish identity that have not been definitively addressed in previous research, including the manner in which characteristics of Jewish community infrastructure are related to individuals' Jewish identity. The Decade 2000 Data Set used for the analysis is described and some of the methodological considerations involved in its use are presented. Jewish identity is conceptualized as multidimensional, and a factor analysis results in four Jewish identity factors: a communal religious factor, a private religious factor, a broader ethnic factor, and a local ethnic factor. Multiple regressions for each of the Jewish identity factors are related to Jewish community characteristics; more commonly researched individual-level variables (Jewish background and connections, family status, socioeconomic status, demographic/geographic characteristics); and survey-level variables (such as size of sample and year of study) are also controlled. Surprisingly, except for the local ethnic factor, Jewish community characteristics have little relationship to individual Jewish identity. The contributions to a "sociology of Jewish place" and suggestions for further research are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - School desegregation and the politics of 'forced integration'
AN  - 1315599288; 201307639
AB  - Using the programme for creating the controversial school academies, local governments in the UK have attempted to force an integration of schools with majority white and ethnic minority pupil cohorts via new mergers. This has largely been as a response to analysts' fears about self-segregation and insufficient community cohesion, following riots in northern towns in 2001 and the spectre of radicalisation among young Muslims following 9/11 and 7/7. An examination of school mergers in Burnley, Blackburn, Leeds and Oldham reveals how they have amplified racial attacks on Muslim pupils and their feelings of insecurity, while also fuelling a backlash against what is perceived by some members of the white working class as a form of social engineering that endangers white privilege.

T1  - Measure of Internalized Sexual Stigma for Lesbians and Gay Men: A New Scale
AN  - 1373427183; 201328656
AB  - The goal of this study is to propose a new Measure of Internalized Sexual Stigma for Lesbians and Gay Men (MISS-LG) that assesses three dimensions of internalized homonegativity: identity, social discomfort, and sexuality. A convenience sample of 735 Italian lesbians and gay male participants was used to demonstrate the psychometric validity of the scale. Results of confirmatory factor analysis supported three identifiable factors reflecting theoretically based constructs of the MISS-LG. The correlations with other instruments demonstrate the convergent validity: lesbian and gay participants with high internalized sexual stigma describe lower levels of self-disclosure and wellbeing. Implications for research and practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gender, Conflict and Subordination within the Household: Turkish Migrant Marriage and Divorce in Denmark
AN  - 1347783973; 201318801
AB  - The European-raised children of Turkish immigrants often marry spouses from their parents' home country. This article investigates the interplay between gender and residency when such transnational couples develop the culture of their newly formed households. While migration scholars state that such household culture is constructed as a 'bricolage' of elements from both the country of cultural origin and the present host country, they pay little attention to the influence of both gender and power on this process. Drawing on a body of life-story interviews, the article compares the narratives of one male and one female marriage migrant to Denmark, both of whose marriages ended in divorce. Life in these households, as well as their processes of dissolution, shows how Danish residency may empower the European spouse, regardless of gender. Although ethnic minority women raised in Europe may seek to use this power to shape their household culture into a more gender-equal 'bricolage', they may remain embedded within the broader patriarchal structures of the immigrant community.

T1  - Ethno-racial identification in urban Peru
AN  - 1567049036; 201435171
AB  - This study examines ethno-racial identification among urban Peruvians, with special attention to those who are at risk of 'de-Indianizing'. Specifically, we use a nationally representative survey to describe how city residents classify themselves and how self-classifications are associated with primordial and circumstantial characteristics. Consistent with official statistics, a large majority identifies as mestizo. However, the share that self-identifies as indigenous is much smaller than expected from official language-based criteria or from appearance alone. Moreover, identification is rooted in primordial characteristics associated with descent and the family-of-origin's linguistic environment, particularly for those with indigenous ancestries. Identification is also linked to socio-economic circumstances and perceived discrimination. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Multiracial Americans: Racial Identity Choices and Implications for the Collection of Race Data
AN  - 1037876404; 201231098
AB  - In 2010, approximately nine million Americans self-identified with more than one race on the U.S. Census -- a 32 percent increase since 2000. In this paper, I review the growing body of research on this population, with a particular focus on identifying and describing factors important in shaping their racial identities. Factors explored include: social norms regarding racial classification, socioeconomic status, racial composition of one's neighborhood and community, region, socialization by family, age, cohort, genealogical locus of multiracial ancestry, nativity, and phenotype. I discuss the broader implications of findings to-date, with a particular focus on the ongoing scholarly discourse regarding the collection of race data in the United States.

T1  - Settler Colonial Power and the American Indian Sovereignty Movement: Forms of Domination, Strategies of Transformation
AN  - 1030866380; 201227856
AB  - The article extends the multi-institutional model of power and change through an analysis of the American Indian Sovereignty Movement. Drawing upon cultural models of the state, and articulating institutionalist conceptions of political opportunities and resources, the analysis demonstrates that this framework can be applied to challenges addressing the state as well as nonstate fields. The rational-legal diminishment of tribal rights, bureaucratic paternalism, commonsense views of tribes as racial/ethnic minorities, and the binary construction of American and Indian as oppositional identities diminished the appeal of "contentious" political action. Instead, to establish tribes' status as sovereign nations, tribal leaders aggressively enacted infrastructural power, transposed favorable legal rulings across social fields to legitimize sovereignty discourses, and promoted a pragmatic coexistence with state and local governments. Identifying the United States as a settler colonial society, the study suggests that a decolonizing framework is more apt than racial/ethnicity approaches in conceptualizing the struggle of American Indians.

T1  - Investigating the Role of Denial of Cognition, Capacity for Morality and Perception of Child-likeness in Infrahumanization
AN  - 1030865511; 201227631
AB  - Secondary emotions (for example, guilt, shame, and tenderness) are uniquely human, indicate higher cognition, moral capacity, and develop with age, compared with primary emotions (for example, pain, fear, happiness), which humans also share with animals. According to Leyers and colleagues people designate outgroups as less human, that is, infrahumanize them through ascribing them less uniquely human emotions. This paper reports two studies that examined the role of denial of cognition, capacity for morality and perception of child-likeness in denial of secondary emotions to outgroups. In Study I, it was hypothesized that a sample of psychology students would deny secondary emotions to people with a learning disability, Down syndrome, as a function of denying them cognitive capacities, compared with people with physical disabilities and the ingroup. Study 2 tested denial of secondary emotions to the three target groups as a function of not only denial of cognition, but also of moral capacities, and a tendency to liken the mental capacities of adults to children's. Both studies showed that only people with Down syndrome are denied secondary emotions. In Study 1, denial of secondary emotions to people with Down syndrome was mediated by denial of cognitive capacities. In Study 2, denial of secondary emotions was mediated by an average index of denial of cognitive and moral capacities, and likening mental capacities of the target groups to children's. Both studies also showed greater denial of positive than negative secondary emotions to people with Down syndrome. Results are discussed in terms of infrahumanization theory and romanticization of learning disabilities. Implications of results to people with Down syndrome are also discussed.

T1  - Individual differences in prejudice and associative versus rule-based forms of transitive reasoning
AN  - 1018342777; 201212791
AB  - Two experiments examined whether individual differences in prejudice are associated with different reasoning styles when targets and nontargets of prejudice are processed in the same context. High-prejudice and low-prejudice participants studied pairwise relations between four persons (one a prejudice target, three nontargets). Stereotypes were made salient by using specific ethnic names and stereotypic traits to define relations between the targets. Relations between the persons were always stereotype congruent in Experiment 1, whereas they were sometimes stereotype incongruent in Experiment 2. We examined study time, relational memory, and transitive reasoning in both experiments. The results of both experiments indicated that the high-prejudice participants studied sets of relations presented to them faster than did the low-prejudice participants. The high-prejudice participants were also more likely to show impaired relational memory and reasoning about nontarget persons but no such limitations with respect to target persons. This novel evidence that prejudice might substantially impair memory and transitive reasoning processes about nontarget persons is discussed in the light of alternative theoretical frameworks in the social cognition and emotion domains.

T1  - Non-Hispanics with Latin American ancestry: Assimilation, race, and identity among Latin American descendants in the US
AN  - 964199620; 201207423
AB  - In the 2006 American Community Survey (ACS), 6% of respondents with Latin American ancestry answered 'no' when asked whether they were Hispanic themselves. Conventional definitions of the Hispanic population exclude such respondents as 'not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino' even though they are self-identified Latin American descendants. Since their exclusion may bias our assessments of Hispanic social mobility, it is important to know more about them. Non-Hispanic identification is most common among Latin American descendants who (1) list both Latin American and non-Latin American ancestries, (2) speak only English, and (3) identify as White, Black, or Asian when asked about their 'race.' Ancestry and racial identity are considerably more influential than respondents' education, income, place of birth, or place of residence. These findings support both traditional straight-line assimilation and a more recent 'racialized assimilation' theory in explaining discrepant responses to the ethnicity and ancestry questions among Latin American descendants.

T1  - Sexuality in Norwegian textbooks: constructing and controlling ethnic borders
AN  - 1037875356; 201231184
AB  - In this article we discuss how sexuality is linked to national identity, ethnicity and cultural diversity in Norwegian textbooks for 13-16-year-olds. We show how gender equality and gay rights are mobilized as markers of Norwegianness in pedagogic texts and discuss the significance this has for inclusion in Norwegian nationhood. We address how progressive policies concerning gender and sexuality in Norway have been utilized to define Norwegianness in ethnic terms and argue that the texts we have analysed may produce the effect that tolerance towards homosexuality and support for gender equality as political positions are considered necessary for ethnic minority subjects' acceptance as properly 'integrated' Norwegian citizens. In this way, these texts on sexuality may be seen to both construct and control ethnic borders in Norwegian society. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Perceived Racial Discrimination as a Predictor of Health Behaviors: the Moderating Role of Gender
AN  - 1081862923; 201235191
AB  - Perceived racial discrimination (PRD) has been implicated in undermining the mental and physical health of racial/ethnic minorities (e.g., Williams et al. in Am J Public Health 93:200-208, 2003; Wong et al. in J Pers 71:1197-1232, 2003). Researchers have begun to explore the indirect role of health behaviors as one factor in helping to explain this relationship. The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between PRD and a wide range of health behaviors using a prospective, longitudinal design and to explore the role of gender in moderating these relationships. Using data from the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study, we examined the relationship between adolescent PRD (accumulated across ages 14-21) and health behaviors (i.e., diet, substance use, exercise) at age 30 in a sample of middle-class black men and women. Using structural equation modeling, results revealed that more cumulative PRD during adolescence was associated with less healthy eating, more substance use (among men), and more exercise (among women) in young adulthood. Implications of these findings for understanding the role of health behaviors in explaining the link between PRD and health outcomes are considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diversity and the Imagined Community: Immigrant Diversity and Conceptions of National Identity
AN  - 1037880439; 201231260
AB  - As immigrant diversity increases across most developed democracies, there is an increasing concern that perceived threats to mainstream interests (both cultural and economic) will produce an ethnocentric response. This study approaches the question using survey measures that explicitly tap respondents' normative conception of membership in the national community. Based on cross-sectional and over-time analysis of the ISSP's "National Identity Module," it shows that more immigrant-exclusive definitions of the national ingroup are linked to both contextual and individual measures of cultural threat. Perceived economic threat at the individual level is also powerfully linked to this outcome, but contextual measures of economic prosperity are not. This finding lends weight to the argument that increasing levels of immigrant diversity are a threat to an inclusive sense of national identity that includes both natives and immigrants.

T1  - Chinese forbearance ethos disclosing selfing and othering in stereotyping modeling
AN  - 964195600; 201207319
AB  - The conceptual framework of this stereotyping modeling research is the methodological-relationalism-based social representations approach (SRA). The classic literary work of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) -- Xu Ming-kui's The 100 Exhortations to Forbearance (The 100EF) -- is employed for deriving the 10 dyads of parameters of selfing (the cultivating of a self's principles towards oneself) and othering (the cultivating of the self's principles towards others) in terms of observation of the forbearance metanorms. These dyads are taken as the dynamic devices, forming a hierarchy, for the self's forbearance development. The symmetricity and the reciprocity of selfing and othering are seen to be the attributes of the dyads and are interpreted for stereotyping in relation to transgressions of the forbearance metanorms. A hierarchy of the 10 levels of stereotyping is thereby eventually established. This stereotyping modeling as a theoretical framework, developed on the basis of the forbearance feature of the Chinese society and mentality, aims to analyze the development of stereotypes. In this way, this exploration of indigenous stereotyping in defense of the Chinese forbearance ethos is expected to expand and deepen Joffe and Staerkle's (2007, p. 395) proposition of 'the self-control ethos as the centrality in Western aspersions regarding outgroups.'.

T1  - Is the world a just place? Countering the negative consequences of pervasive discrimination by affirming the world as just
AN  - 925714299; 201204042
AB  - Two studies (a) explored the role of pervasiveness of discrimination (pervasive vs. rare) in determining targets' responses to discrimination, and (b) examined the extent to which threats to participants' worldview can account, in part, for detrimental effects of pervasive discrimination. As predicted, across both studies, pervasiveness of discrimination moderated the relationship between attributions to prejudice for failure to obtain a job and psychological well-being (depressed affect and state self-esteem). When discrimination was presented as pervasive, attributions to prejudice related to lower state self-esteem and greater depressed affect. When discrimination was portrayed as rare, attributions to prejudice were related to higher state self-esteem and unrelated to depressed affect. Study 2 further showed that being able to affirm the world as just countered the negative consequences of pervasive discrimination, whereas it did not influence responses to discrimination that was perceived as rare.

T1  - Profiles of Racial Socialization Among African American Parents: Correlates, Context, and Outcome
AN  - 1018368254; 201212832
AB  - Self report and observational data on racial socialization practices in a sample of 218 African American parents of young children were used to determine whether or not parents could be characterized in terms of their pattern of racial socialization practices. Parents fell into four groups: silence about race, emphasis on cultural socialization, emphasis on cultural socialization and coping strategies, or a balanced approach. Silence about race was more common among parents of boys, whereas an emphasis on cultural socialization was more common among parents of girls. Silence about race was less common in neighborhoods with high levels of negative social climate, and a combination of cultural socialization with coping strategies for discrimination was more common in neighborhoods with high neighborhood potential for community involvement with children. The coping emphasis/cultural socialization approach was associated with significantly lower child problem behavior, although some gender differences were evident. A cultural socialization emphasis was associated with higher cognitive scores among girls, and a combination of cultural socialization, coping with discrimination, and promotion of mistrust was associated with higher cognitive scores among boys. Implications of this profile approach for the study of racial socialization practices in ethnic minority families are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Ethical Self-Fashioning of Physicians and Health Care Systems in Culturally Appropriate Health Care
AN  - 869797351; 21553151
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Anthropologies of Clinical Training in the 21st Century              Diverse advocacy groups have pushed for the recognition of cultural differences in health care as a means to redress inequalities in the U.S., elaborating a form of biocitizenship that draws on evidence of racial and ethnic health disparities to make claims on both the state and health care providers. These efforts led to federal regulations developed by the U.S. Office of Minority Health requiring health care organizations to provide Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services. Based on ethnographic research at workshops and conferences, in-depth interviews with cultural competence trainers, and an analysis of postings to a moderated listserv with 2,000 members, we explore cultural competence trainings as a new type of social technology in which health care providers and institutions are urged to engage in ethical self-fashioning to eliminate prejudice and embody the values of cultural relativism. Health care providers are called on to re-orient their practice (such as habits of gaze, touch, and decision-making) and to act on their own subjectivities to develop an orientation toward Others that is "culturally competent." We explore the diverse methods that cultural competence trainings use to foster a health care provider's ability to be self-reflexive, including face-to-face workshops and classes and self-guided on-line modules. We argue that the hybrid formation of culturally appropriate health care is becoming detached from its social justice origins as it becomes rationalized by and more firmly embedded in the operations of the health care marketplace.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Balkan Diversity Under Two Contradictory Philosophies Of Ruling: Ottoman And Communist
AN  - 914766590; 201200584
AB  - The Balkan Peninsula is both, a mosaic of diverse nations, religious groups, cultures and ethnicities speaking different languages, and a puzzle of confusing complexity, depending on one's philosophic perspective. Due to the nationalistic behavior of their post communist politicians and the militant dictatorial communist regime that lasted fifty over years in the area, these nations, are in urgent need of a new epistemic approach, free of any prejudice, regarding multiculturalism, multiethnic frameworks and general diversity. As a person who was born and lived in a Balkan country for a long time, I made myself familiar with every social group in the Balkans. I believe that these nations are very much committed to freedom, peace and nonviolent reforms. I also believe that they can achieve this within short period of time. All they need is a context within which education, based on contemporary democratic standards is made possible. What I mean by democratic standards is that education ought to be on "cultural neutrality", meaning one takes on a value-free attitude about any culture, including one's own. They are in need of a philosophy of education that will make clear the importance and benefits of mutual respect, recognition and the value of living in a multicultural and multiethnic society. These are the problems that we are going to discuss in this paper within the context of an analysis of the fate of these nations under two contradictory philosophic rules: the Ottoman Empire and the Communist.

T1  - The Racist Critics of Ataturk and Kemalism, from the 1930s to the 1960s
AN  - 964199667; 201207382
AB  - This article examines racist attitudes toward Ataturk and Kemalism from the 1930s to the 1960s. Liberal, leftist and conservative-Islamist critics of republican Turkey's founder and his policies have contributed to a widely shared image that, even if Kemalism was not essentially racist, the Kemalist approach to religious and ethnic minorities could hardly be described as egalitarian. Thus one is taken by surprise to uncover a parallel layer of virulent racist criticism, hidden under the deposit of decades of anti-Kemalist discourse. The most important ideologue of racism in Turkey, Nihal Ats(dotless i)z, and his circle attacked Ataturk's leadership, condemned Turkey's foreign policy, and particularly the appeasement policy vis-a-vis the Soviet Union, and, most importantly, ridiculed Kemalist attempts at building a civic nation model in the early republican era. Turkish racists never considered Ataturk and the Kemalists as fellow nationalists; on the contrary, the research for this article shows that racists questioned their nationalist credentials and accused Kemalists of being cosmopolitans. The acrimonious relationship between the racists and the Kemalist establishment can be taken as an example of how the latter oscillated between a western, democratic orientation and an inward-looking, xenophobic worldview, providing us, therefore, with a more complicated and multi-faceted picture of Kemalism.

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary
AN  - 896195493; 201120578
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - The dog that hasn't barked: assimilation and resistance in Inner Mongolia, China
AN  - 862595447; 201109650
AB  - As one of China's five autonomous regions, Inner Mongolia has not been highlighted in the international news, and the Mongols have not demonstrated significant political will for greater autonomy in the way the Tibetans and the Uighurs have in recent decades. Why haven't the Mongols mobilized? This paper argues that the Mongols' lack of aspiration for greater autonomy is in part due to the relationship between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia as an independent kin state. The different trajectories of national identity construction in these two places and the perception of better living conditions in Inner Mongolia have made the Inner Mongols less anxious about their current incorporation within the Chinese state.

T1  - A multidimensional approach to identity: Religious and cultural identity in young Jewish Canadians: GPIR
AN  - 1928212596
AB  - This study used an online questionnaire to explore the relations among different dimensions of religious and cultural Jewish identity in young Canadian adults (N = 258). We investigated the extent to which three aspects of Jewish identity--religious identity, cultural identity, and identity salience-- predicted openness to interfaith relationships and sociopolitical attitudes related to Israel. Results showed that compared to participants who self-identified as cultural Jews, those who self-identified as religious Jews or as both religious and cultural Jews scored higher on measures of cultural and religious identification. Moreover, relative to culturally identified Jews, religious and religious/cultural Jews were less open to interfaith relationships, endorsed more right-wing political attitudes with respect to Israel's foreign policy, and reported that their Jewish identity was more salient than their Canadian identity in identity-relevant situations. Similarly, relative to Jews of other denominations, Orthodox Jews reported higher levels of Jewish identification, greater salience of their Jewish identity, and advocated more right-wing political views.

T1  - Migration, Social Exclusion and Identity Issues of Macedonian Roma
AN  - 1037878585; 201231229
AB  - The key aspects of issues related to Roma identity are inevitably linked to traditional migration on one hand and the long-term exposure of Roma to discrimination and social exclusion on the other. Therefore, the debate about identity issues, which are also disputable within the framework of the Roma community, would not be feasible without a brief review of the historical patterns of the movement of the Roma, processes of change during the migration waves and preservation of awareness of belonging to a group with specific ethnic and cultural features. The contemporary analysis of the identity issues of Roma in Macedonia has an ambitious goal: through the application of three approaches used in the research of Roma, to give an overview of the causes and effects of the socio-economic status of Roma, migration and issues related to identity.

T1  - Social Indicators by Race, Ethnicity, and Social Background: Brazil, India, the United States
AN  - 1010632354; 201210618
AB  - Few nations of the world collect national economic and social data broken down by race and ethnicity, and this absence is particularly striking in the vast statistical collections of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Nevertheless, three of the world's five most populous nations -- India (1.2 billion), the United States (311 million), and Brazil (192 million), make efforts in this area. The statistical record indicates that income and labor market conditions are significantly stratified by racial and ethnic backgrounds in these nations. While there are examples of racial and ethnic minorities who outperform the dominant majority or traditional power bloc in these democracies, the available statistics paint a grim picture, showing dramatically higher poverty and unemployment levels for those belonging to certain racial and ethnic classifications.

T1  - Passing as Black: Racial Identity Work among Biracial Americans
AN  - 1883033677
AB  - Drawing on interview data with black-white biracial adults, we examine the considerable agency most have in asserting their racial identities to others. Extending research on ''identity work'' (Snow and Anderson 1987), we explore the strategies biracial people use to conceal (i.e., pass), cover, and/or accent aspects of their racial ancestries, and the individual and structural-level factors that limit the accessibility and/or effectiveness of some strategies. We further find that how these biracial respondents identify is often contextual--most identify as biracial, but in some contexts, they pass as monoracial. Scholars argue that passing may be a relic of the past, yet we find that passing still occurs today. Most notably, we find a striking reverse pattern of passing today--while passing during the Jim Crow era involved passing as white, these respondents more often report passing as black today. Motivations for identity work are explored, with an emphasis on passing as black.

T1  - Exploring the importance of institutional contexts for the development of ethnic stereotypes: a comparison of schools in Belgium and England
AN  - 754045500; 201053410
AB  - This article suggests the usefulness of an ecological approach in studying the development of teachers' ethnic stereotypes in schools. It builds on existing research in this area by exploring the importance of nationally specific educational contexts and school characteristics on the development of teachers' stereotypes of Turkish minority students. Observation and interview data from case-study research involving one Flemish (Belgian) and one English secondary, multicultural inner-city school suggest differences between Flemish and English teachers' ethnic stereotypes. These differences can in part be explained by the influence of nationally specific regulations governing teachers' power to evaluate students, a nationally specific policy on ethnic minority cultures and needs, the ethnic and gender composition of the school's student and staff population, and the enforcement of an inclusive school policy by the school's senior management. The conclusions discuss implications for further research on ethnic stereotyping and discrimination in schools. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Membership Status and Subjective Group Dynamics: Who Triggers the Black Sheep Effect?
AN  - 754039706; 201049575
AB  - In 3 experiments, participants (Ns = 50, 95, and 75, respectively) judged 2 ingroup or outgroup members who occupied 1 of 3 statuses-new members, full members, or marginal members. In each case, 1 of these members adopted a normative position and another supported a deviant position regarding a relevant issue. Participants upgraded normative ingroup full members and derogated deviant ingroup full members compared with all other members. In addition, derogation of deviant ingroup members was associated with a socializing and a punishing intention toward new members and full members, respectively. These results are discussed in terms of the group socialization model (e.g., Levine & Moreland, 1994) and the subjective group dynamics model (e.g., Marques, Paez, & Abrams, 1998).

T1  - Socioeconomic Changes as Covariates of Overweight and Obesity among Tangkhul Naga Tribal Women of Manipur, North-East India
AN  - 743067005; 201043322
AB  - The prevalence of overweight/obesity is increasing worldwide. Although countries like India are typically thought of as having a high prevalence of undernutrition, significant proportions of overweight/obese now co-exist with the undernourished. This study aims to find the prevalence of overweight/obesity, & its association with socioeconomic change, among Tangkhul women in India. The cross-sectional study was carried out among 346 Tangkhul women aged 20-70 years, who were divided into five 10-year age groups. Mean BMI was found to be lowest among the youngest age group, & it increased with age until the age of 59 & then declined. The prevalence of overweight & obesity was found to be 27.1%, as assessed from the Asian cut-off point. Although the prevalence of obesity (2.0%) was low when compared with Indian non-tribal female populations, the prevalence of overweight (25.1%) was not far behind. Overweight & obesity were found to be associated with age, marital status, physical activity level, lifestyle & improvement in socioeconomic status, especially occupation & income. When compared with urban non-tribal Indian females, who have a higher socioeconomic status, the prevalence of overweight/obesity among Tangkhul females is lower, indicating its association with socioeconomic status. Tangkhul Naga is a population where the majority are believed to be thin traditionally owing to the difficult hilly terrain & their physically active lifestyle. With urbanization & economic development, nutritional transition, improved socioeconomic status & an increasingly sedentary lifestyle have been observed, which have contributed to the increasing prevalence of overweight/obesity among Tangkhul Naga women.

T1  - The changing configurations of self-(m)other dialogue in North Cyprus
AN  - 743043238; 201026561
AB  - This paper deals with issues of identity, nationalism, postcolonialism, and self-other relations with a focus on a period of transformative events in North Cyprus. It notes how nationalism has been the dominant means of identification for Cypriots in their modern history, and argues that unless weakened and supplanted by a radically pluralist democracy, nationalism imagines one's identity as an indivisible unity and has no place for different others within the nation. However, a pressing relationship with others and otherness is no stranger to Cypriots either, which makes it clear that the border that defines the 'we' of such nationalism is, at the same time, the line that divides the self intrinsically, indicating the otherness of the self or its alterity. Subjectivity involves subjection to the other. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Asians as the model minority: Implications for US Government's policies
AN  - 60361405; 201011858
AB  - Asian Americans are often perceived as a 'model minority'-- an ethnic minority that are high achieving, hardworking, self-reliant, law-abiding, as well as having few social and mental health problems. Although the impact of the model minority image on the US government's redistributive policies is a widely contested topic in public discourses, there has been little research on the association between the model minority image, people's worldviews, and attitudes towards the US government's redistributive policies. In an experiment that measured American participants' worldviews and manipulated the salience of the model minority image, we have demonstrated that those who believed in a malleable social reality were relatively unsupportive of government policies that help the Asian American (vs African American) communities. Theoretical and practical implications of this finding are discussed. Received 30 May 2008; accepted for publication 4 May 2009. Adapted from the source document.
