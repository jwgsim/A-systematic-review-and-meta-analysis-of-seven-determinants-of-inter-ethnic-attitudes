T1  - Language, Discrimination and Employability: Employers’ Othering and Racist Representations of Domestic Migrant Workers on Social Media
AN  - 2608408624
AB  - Discursive othering deals with the many ways in which language is used to express prejudice against minorities, and it outlines the processes and conditions that promote group-based inequality and marginalization. This article focuses on online othering, and it analyzes a corpus of 615 comments posted by Hong Kong employers of domestic migrant workers (DMWs) on social media. First, a quantitative analysis of the corpus outlines the content categories found in the posts, and second, a discourse analysis of representative excerpts illustrates the claims made about DMWs. Employers engage in othering of their helpers, and the analysis shows how demeaning racist comments function to publicly shame them and warn others not to employ them. The article uses Language and Social Psychology frameworks to analyze the posts, and it discusses the functions of using racist derogatory language. The paper concludes by discussing how research may be used to address pressing social issues.

T1  - A National Conversation About Race? Political Discussion Across Lines of Racial and Partisan Difference
AN  - 2492207424
AB  - Dialogue about race-based topics is essential to combat prejudice, foster mutual understanding, and improve race relations. This study describes the extent to which political conversations—especially those about race-related topics—are taking place within and across racial and political groups. This national survey with a Black oversample found racially diverse discussion networks to be more likely among Blacks than Whites, but politically diverse networks to be more likely among Whites than Blacks. Blacks were more likely than Whites to talk about race-related topics such as police treatment of Blacks (and less likely about several topics not explicitly tied to race), but by no means did Whites entirely avoid race-related topics, even in their same-race discussions. Moreover, there was evidence that discussion in cross-race dyads affected the mix of topics Whites and Blacks discussed, revealing the potential for cross-race interaction to alter political agendas. Rather than being less likely to talk about police treatment of Blacks with Blacks, Whites were more likely to discuss this topic when in mixed-race dyads, while Blacks talked about it less often with Whites than with other Blacks. Findings are discussed in the context of political disagreement and intergroup contact theory.

T1  - Sociopsychological correlates of militant extremist beliefs in a postconflict society: The importance of ethnocentrism and quality of interethnic contacts: GPIR
AN  - 2466740372
AB  - This study investigates the attitudinal and motivational bases of militant extremist beliefs in a postconflict society (N = 600; 51% female). Militant extremist mindset (MEM) measures of proviolence, divine power, utopianism, vile world, and West, together with the Ethos of Conflict- Grudge Scale (EOC-grudge), were used to assess militant-extremist beliefs. Data about the socioeconomic status (SES) of participants, ethnocentrism, intergroup contact, trust in the system, and the level of conflict in the sampled areas were also collected. The main hypotheses were that extremist beliefs are associated with a high level of ethnocentrism, low socioeconomic status, decreased intergroup contact, low trust in the system, and recent intergroup conflict. A structural model in which all relations between the measures were simultaneously tested showed that recent intergroup conflict was related to the most malignant aspect of MEM—proviolence—predominantly through negative experiences with members of other ethnicities. Ethnocentrism was strongly related to higher levels of grudge and excuse. Self-assessed socioeconomic status was related to grudge only but taking into account all other variables, positively. Finally, trust in the political and social system was not found to have a relationship with militant-extremist beliefs.

T1  - Racial boundaries, stigma, and the re-emergence of “always being foreigners”: Iranians and the refugee crisis in Germany
AN  - 2240385562
AB  - The 2015 refugee crisis is at the center of public and political discourse across Europe, especially among nations that have accepted refugees. Utilizing ethnographic fieldwork and 48 in-depth interviews conducted in 2011 and 2016 with Iranians in Hamburg, Germany, this paper considers how the refugee crisis impacts the racial boundaries between Germans and immigrant communities. It details how the crisis has made ethnic nationalism, Islamophobia, anti-foreigner prejudice and racism more pronounced and salient throughout Germany. The interviews demonstrate that this climate affects Iranians in several ways: they cite feeling more threat and stigma, as well as experiences of marginality, perpetual foreignness, and discrimination. This research contributes to sociological scholarship on migration and race by examining how critical international events influence and shape processes of racialization, identity and belonging, and social boundaries and hierarchies.

T1  - Threat Perceptions of Migrants in Britain and Support for Policy
AN  - 2067681832
AB  - Arguments that migrants represent a threat to the Britain are often cast in terms of impact on the economy and a criminal threat to Britain’s streets. We examine the impact of these attitudes on support for policies curtailing the rights of European Union (EU) and non-EU migrants in the United Kingdom separately, as well as their implications for support for punitive criminal sanctions. Using data on a nationally representative sample of Britons, results indicate that perceptions of migrants as a criminal threat have a greater effect on support for curtailing rights of EU migrants, more so than economic threat, suggesting that British citizens invoke deep rooted stereotypes about EU migrants as criminal when choosing their preferences. Criminal threat is also associated with support for more punitive criminal sanctions. Thus, threat narratives, especially narratives of immigrant crime, could be instrumental in public support for policy, but different narratives are associated with EU and non-EU migrants.

T1  - Will We Build A Wall? Fear of Mexican/Latino Immigration in U.S. History
AN  - 2283957214
AB  - A presidential election was won on the strength of a nativist philosophy which asserts that the U.S. must build a wall of separation with its closest neighbor to the South. The current president has voiced not only his frustration and prejudices but the nativist sentiments of the public. The emphasis on "building the wall" and the antagonism expressed towards Mexico have deepened the centuries-old sense of fear and separation felt by members of the Mexican/Latino immigrant group. Can we look at history in search of plausible explanations? This paper examines past and contemporary reasons that might explain the observable antagonism to the Mexican/Latino population in the U.S. today.

T1  - Latino Millennials—The New Diverse Workforce: Challenges and Opportunities
AN  - 2002365462
AB  - There are a variety of trends that are enabling and forcing organizational change. A crucial trend that has implications for a changing and growing demographic workforce includes Millennials and in particular Latinos/Hispanics as the world and particularly the U.S. workplace continues to have an increased aging workforce. Yet, while Latinos are members of the largest and also the fastest growing minority group in the United States, they are disproportionately underrepresented in more highly compensated professional and leadership roles across corporate America. The majority of existing career development and acculturation literature in the United States has focused narrowly on Anglo-oriented acculturation as a linear process. Unfortunately, as society has evolved so has the form of prejudices and biases. This is supported by the fact that well more than 50% of Hispanics experience discrimination through a variety of means including micro-aggressions. We believe that developing and maintaining an overlapping and compatible bicultural identity might not be enough and that we need to rethink what acculturation and biculturalism means for millennials and broaden our thinking to include cosmopolitanism as more encompassing of the millennials and their place in the world. We believe this article begins the dialogue for more research into this growing part of the U.S. workforce along with practical implications and applications.

T1  - Perceived threat and prejudice towards immigrants in Finland: A study among early, middle, and late Finnish adolescents
AN  - 2013187369
AB  - Using integrated threat theory, this study examined how perceived threat, or fear of immigrants, manifests among early, middle, and late Finnish adolescents, and the relationship between perceived threat and prejudice among early, middle, and late adolescents. The sample consisted of 795 Finnish adolescents between 11 and 19 years of age. Realistic and symbolic threats were the most perceived threats and were more prevalent among late adolescents. There was a positive relationship between prejudice and realistic threat, and between prejudice and symbolic threat, but a negative relationship between prejudice and negative stereotyping, and this relationship remained relatively stable from early to late adolescence. Implications on the fight against prejudice towards immigrants among early, middle, and late adolescents are also discussed.

T1  - The Association of Ethnic Pride With Health and Social Outcomes Among Young Black and Latino Men After Release From Jail
AN  - 1944027556
AB  - The goal of this study was to understand whether ethnic pride among young, incarcerated Black and Latino men was associated with successful community reentry. We interviewed 397 Black and Latino men 16 to 18 years old in a New York City jail and then again 1 year after their release to determine the relationship between participants' sense of ethnic pride during incarceration, and substance use, violence, recidivism, and education/employment after release from jail. Participants with higher ethnic pride scores were less likely to engage in illegal activities and be reincarcerated. Ethnic pride was also associated with feeling safe in gangs and positive attitudes toward avoiding violence in situations of conflict. Ethnic pride was not associated with substance use, education, or engagement in community-based organizations post release. This study demonstrated that ethnic pride might be a source of strength that young men of color can harness for successful community reentry after release from jail.

T1  - Collateral damage for ingroup members having outgroup friends: Effects of normative versus counternormative interactions with an outgroup: GPIR
AN  - 1928331903
AB  - When people are aware that an ingroup member has an outgroup friend, they tend to improve their intergroup attitudes, which is known as the extended contact hypothesis . Thus far, no research has tested how the perceived degree of normativity of the intergroup interaction affects the evaluation of the ingroup member through which extended contact is experienced. Results of three studies showed that when contact was normative (i.e., positive contact with a liked outgroup, or negative contact with a disliked outgroup), the ingroup member was evaluated positively, while when the contact was counternormative (i.e., negative contact with a liked outgroup or positive contact with a disliked outgroup) the ingroup member was evaluated negatively. This effect was mediated by perceived threat posed by the ingroup member who experiences the intergroup contact and perceived similarity of the participant with the ingroup member (Experiments 2-3). In summary, the perceived normativity of the extended contact affects the perception of the ingroup member who experiences the contact, turning him/her into a "white" or a "black" sheep in the eyes of the ingroup.

T1  - Warmth-Competence Tradeoffs in Impression Management across Race and Social-Class Divides
AN  - 1878226282
AB  - The Great Recession widened social-class divides, so social interactions across gaps in workplace status and in race generally may be more salient and more fraught. Different statuses and races both carry stereotypes that targets know (meta-perceptions, how they expect to be viewed by the outgroup). In both cross-status and cross-race interactions, targets may aim to manage the impressions they create. Reviewing literature and our own recent work invokes (a) the role of the Stereotype Content Model's two dimensions of social perception, namely warmth and competence; (b) the compensation effect, a tendency to tradeoff between them, especially downplaying one to convey the other; and (c) diverging warmth and competence concerns of people with lower and higher status and racial-group positions. Higher-status people and Whites, both stereotyped as competent but cold, seek to warm up their image. Lower-status people and Blacks, both stereotyped as warm but incompetent, seek respect for their competence. Overviews of two previously separate research programs and the background literature converge on shared findings that higher-status people, comparing down, display a competence downshift, consistent with communicating apparent warmth. Meanwhile, lower-status people, comparing up, often display less warmth, to communicate competence. Previous research and our diverse samples--online workplace scenarios, online cross-race interactions, and presidential candidates' speeches--suggest a novel, robust interpersonal mechanism that perpetuates race, status, and social-class divides.

T1  - Identifying With a Stereotype: The Divergent Effects of Exposure to Homosexual Television Characters
AN  - 1904238337
AB  - Scholars examining homosexual television characters have typically come to one of two conclusions: either exposure to homosexual characters can lead to increased acceptance, or homosexual characters serve to reaffirm negative stereotypes. We seek to bridge these two bodies of research by introducing the concept of stereotyped identification-the idea that cognitively and emotionally identifying with fictional characters can increase acceptance of minorities, while reinforcing implicit stereotypes about how they look, act, and talk. Results from our national survey (N = 972) offer support for this hypothesis.

T1  - From Affirmed Privilege to Experiences of Discrimination: Majority Anglophones' Perceptions of Linguistic Majority-Minority Dynamics in Canada
AN  - 1897665884
AB  - This paper explores the rarely addressed subject of linguistic majority in the context of Canadian society, through a qualitative analysis of 20 semi-directed interviews with majority Anglophone participants. It was found that while participants acknowledged a certain form of privilege related to their majority status within Canadian society, it was also common for them to experience situations in which they felt overlooked, marginalized and even discriminated against. "Linguistic privilege" has not been the subject of more studies because it is often seen as a "default", taken-for-granted status in Canadian society. However, studying this form of privilege and its intersections with other dimensions of identity such as gender, class and race could lead to new insights on language, power and group identity. Moreover, studies on "the majority" are especially pertinent in a context where "silent majorities" are becoming increasingly vocal in stating their dissatisfaction and feelings of discrimination. This article can provide pathways to a better understanding of this emergent issue. Alternate abstract:Le « privilège linguistique » est un concept peu exploité dans la littérature scientifique, puisqu'être anglophone en situation majoritaire constitue le statu quo de l'identité canadienne. Pourtant, l'étude de cette forme possible de privilège et de ses intersections avec d'autres catégories sociales telles que la classe, le genre et la race s'avère un terreau très fertile pour l'analyse des liens entre la langue, le pouvoir et l'identité de groupe. Cet article s'intéresse au sujet peu documenté de la majorité linguistique au Canada à l'aide d'une analyse qualitative de 20 entretiens semi-dirigés réalisés auprès d'individus anglophones en situation majoritaire. Nos résultats montrent que bien que les participants reconnaissaient leur statut privilégié au sein de la société canadienne, ces derniers pouvaient également vivre des situations dans lesquelles ils se sentaient invisibles et marginalisés, voire discriminés. De plus, les études « sur la majorité » sont particulièrement pertinentes dans le contexte sociopolitique actuel où les « majorités silencieuses » prennent parole pour dénoncer leur insatisfaction et leurs sentiments d'injustice.

T1  - Heterosexism, Depression, and Campus Engagement Among LGBTQ College Students: Intersectional Differences and Opportunities for Healing
AN  - 1892727792
AB  - LGBTQ people experience health disparities related to multilevel processes of sexual and gender marginalization, and intersections with racism can compound these challenges for LGBTQ people of color. Although community engagement may be protective for mental health broadly and for LGBTQ communities in buffering against heterosexism, little research has been conducted on the racialized dynamics of these processes among LGBTQ communities. This study analyzes cross-sectional survey data collected among a diverse sample of LGBTQ college students (n = 460), which was split by racial status. Linear regression models were used to test main effects of interpersonal heterosexism and engagement with campus organizations on depression, as well as moderating effects of campus engagement. For White LGBTQ students, engaging in student leadership appears to weaken the heterosexism-depression link-specifically, the experience of interpersonal microaggressions. For LGBTQ students of color, engaging in LGBTQ-specific spaces can strengthen the association between sexual orientation victimization and depression.

T1  - The Racial Turn in Ethnic History
AN  - 1864054713
AB  - Roediger argues for the positions that since the 1990s, ethnic history has taken a racial turn, that this has benefited immigration history, and that the Journal of American Ethnic History (JAEH) ought to applaud itself for helping to foster this development. Any such a turn certainly had plural dimensions. Historians have studied how whiteness has mattered in structuring experiences and consciousness among immigrants from Europe, and at times, all immigrants. More importantly, the study of immigrants racialized as not white has flowered. The editor's use of George Sanchez's important 1999 JAEH article, "Race, Nation, and Culture in Recent Immigration Studies," seems an apt point of departure for viewing both of these racial turns--toward studying the movement of some immigrants toward whiteness, and toward studying "non-white" immigrants--especially when combined with the companion pieces in the "Assessing the Field" section of the same 1999 issue of JAEH.

T1  - Racial/ethnic disparities in self-reported short sleep duration among US-born and foreign-born adults
AN  - 1818393452
AB  - Objective. Racial/ethnic health disparities are infrequently considered by nativity status in the United States, although the immigrant population has practically doubled since 1990. We investigated the modifying role of nativity status (US- vs. foreign-born) on racial/ethnic disparities in short sleep duration (<7 h), which has serious health consequences.
Design. Cross-sectional data from 23,505 US-born and 4,326 foreign-born adults aged [greater than or equal to] 18 years from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey and multivariable log-linear regression were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) for reporting short sleep duration and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results. After controlling for sociodemographic covariates, short sleep was more prevalent among blacks (PR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.21-1.37), Hispanics (PR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.29), and Asians (PR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.16-1.61) than whites among US-born adults. Short sleep was more prevalent among blacks (PR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.38, 2.13) and Asians (PR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.47) than whites among the foreign-born.
Conclusion. Among both US- and foreign-born adults, blacks and Asians had a higher likelihood of short sleep compared to whites. US-born Hispanics, but not foreign-born Hispanics, had a higher likelihood than their white counterparts. Future research should aim to uncover mechanisms underlying these disparities.

T1  - Race, prejudice and attitudes toward redistribution: A comparative experimental approach
AN  - 1910696930
AB  - Past work suggests that support for welfare in the United States is heavily influenced by citizens' racial attitudes. Indeed, the idea that many Americans think of welfare recipients as poor Blacks (and especially as poor Black women) has been a common explanation for Americans' lukewarm support for redistribution. This article draws on a new online survey experiment conducted with national samples in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, designed to extend research on how racialised portrayals of policy beneficiaries affect attitudes toward redistribution. A series of innovative survey vignettes has been designed that experimentally manipulate the ethno-racial background of beneficiaries for various redistributive programmes. The findings provide, for the first time, cross-national, cross-domain and cross-ethno-racial extensions of the American literature on the impact of racial cues on support for redistributive policy. The results also demonstrate that race clearly matters for policy support, although its impact varies by context and by the racial group under consideration.

T1  - Just like the USA? Critical notes on Alba and Foner's cross-Atlantic research agenda
AN  - 1818405378
AB  - A critical review of Alba and Foner's Strangers No More (2015) which focuses on questioning their comparative assimilation of European cases of immigrant integration to the North American, specifically U.S., experience. While this may work in terms of how national immigrant integration has mitigated over time racial discrimination for older, post-colonial migrants, it misrepresents the complex differentiations involved in the super-diversity of recent 'new' migrations within and to Europe. In particular, the variety of types and origins of recent migration is lost in their understanding of the U.K. case, with problems linked to their interpretation of data about minorities and foreigners in the country.

T1  - Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou's The Asian American Achievement Paradox
AN  - 1817595733
AB  - Why is an increasingly diverse American society simultaneously becoming more economically stratified? The dynamic and ever-shifting causes and consequences of rising income inequality demand that we move beyond facile and essentialist notions about who achieves and why. Race and ethnicity play critical roles in shaping opportunity structures and the distribution of resources, and immigration has long been understood in policy debates, scholarly inquiry, and American national narrative to be an important driver of the economic and social mobility of various racial and ethnic groups. Social science research is uniquely poised to explore these issues with textured nuance and analytical sophistication, offering much-needed interventions in a national conversation that can veer in directions that are hackneyed, inaccurate, and even irresponsible. We are therefore pleased to present this symposium on The Asian American Achievement Paradox, an important scholarly work with ‘real world’ utility that offers a fresh perspective on the dynamics of inequality by focusing on a group that has achieved a great deal of success over the last several decades: Asian Americans. Authored by sociologists Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou, the book leverages the fields of sociology, psychology, and Asian American Studies to weave together a detailed analysis at the structural, institutional, interpersonal, and individual levels. We have invited Patricia Fernández-Kelly, Amy Hsin, Tomás R. Jiménez, Philip Kasinitz, and Van C. Tran, five of today’s most prominent scholars of immigration, to offer commentary on how the book illuminates, challenges, and pushes the scholarship in important and useful new directions. They also offer thoughtful critiques as they engage with the core arguments of the book, and Lee and Zhou provide a Rejoinder to explore the questions raised and respond to the critiques.

T1  - Organisational legitimacy beyond ethnicity? Shifting organisational logics in the struggle for immigrant rights in Los Angeles
AN  - 1793307425
AB  - Immigrant political organisations in the United States have traditionally built political power by claiming to legitimately represent an ethnically defined group. However, the emergence of a number of multi-ethnic, class-based organisations over the last two decades has challenged this assumption, while raising questions about the ability of the institutional context to accommodate organisational change. Building on a neo-institutional theory of legitimacy, I examine the diverging legitimating strategies employed by two long-standing immigrant organisations based in Los Angeles (LA): the Korean Resource Center (KRC) and the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA). Through grant applications, organisational archival data and qualitative interviews, I show how KRC and KIWA, two groups embedded in the same sociopolitical context, have built unique yet equally successful legitimating accounts by adopting different organisational logics, one broadly based on ethnicity and one on class and multi-ethnicity. I suggest that KIWA and KRC's ideological differences, and their reliance on a different core of supporters - ethnic-oriented for KRC, labour-oriented for KIWA - drove the organisations towards distinct, yet partially overlapping subfields. By discursively mobilising those connections, and by actively shaping the surrounding organisational environment, both KRC and KIWA were able to incorporate in the broader non-profit advocacy sector in LA.

T1  - Ethnicity as political cleavage: the political agenda of the Polish national minority in Lithuania
AN  - 1805242626
AB  - This article examines the role of ethnicity in the formation of political cleavage and is based on the analysis of the political agenda of the Polish national minority in Lithuania after the re-establishment of the independent state in 1990. It analyzes the political performance of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (EAPL), an ethnic-based "niche" political party that tends to keep a monopoly over the representation of interests of the Polish minority in Lithuania and collects a vast majority of the votes of citizens of Polish origin. The article considers how specific in comparison to the titular nation the interests of the Polish national minority are, and how different in comparison to the political agendas of other political parties the political agenda of the EAPL is.

T1  - Capitalism Hasn't Failed Us: Star Parker, the Housing Crisis, and Moral Hazard
AN  - 1800515161
AB  - According to legal scholar Sumi Cho, an important role conservatives of color play in the larger conservative movement is functioning in the role of racial mascots. Racial mascotting is when conservative individuals of color are embraced by their white peers with the purpose of helping to deflect charges of racism from critics. Conservative social activist Star Parker contends that the practice of welfare capitalism, as illustrated by the Community Reinvestment Act's mandate to banks to provide services to underserved minority and low income communities, was one factor that contributed to the subsequent housing crisis. Parker also asserts that mortgage relief programs, similar to other domestic social programs like welfare, produce a form of moral hazard among its recipients because both programs appear to reward an individual's poor behavior instead of making them accountable for their actions. I argue that in addition to Parker's analysis of the housing crisis being empirically flawed, her idealized construction of an American society functioning under the rule of laissez-faire capitalism where racism's impact on the opportunity chances of African Americans is minimal ultimately allows for the maintenance of an American social structure where 'whiteness' and racial inequality reign supreme.

T1  - Social integration of Australian Muslims: A dramaturgical perspective
AN  - 1798776750
AB  - This article presents a dramaturgical view of the social integration of minorities. Based on 30 interviews with prominent Australian Muslim leaders, we argue that they explain and approach the problem of social integration largely in presentational terms. As a corollary, their chief collective and political strategy towards social integration is to put forward alternative discourses to counter the dominant anti-Islam discourses. We use Goffman's (1959, 1963) dramaturgical model to analyse their strategies. In a striking difference from dominant narratives that situate Islamic values and western values as incompatible, the analysis we provide shows that Muslim leaders do not see Islamic teachings or texts as a problem for social integration; rather they view the problem as negative media representations and the solution as putting forward alternative images.

T1  - Islamic Jurisprudence of Minorities (Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat): The Case of the Palestinian Muslim Minority in Israel
AN  - 1797943330
AB  - This article examines the doctrine of Jurisprudence of Muslim Minorities (Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat) in the context of the Palestinian Muslim community in Israel. The first part discusses the origins and goals of Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat. After outlining the particular historical and political context of the Palestinian minority in Israel, the article focuses on the ethno-religious political mobilization developed by the Muslim community vis-à-vis the state's strategies of control and domination, and points out the difficulties involved in the application of Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat, as used in "Western" states, for the reality that Muslims face in Israel. The article suggests a vigilant approach toward the Jurisprudence of Minorities, as we argue that, when applying it in this context of the Muslim community in Israel, this doctrine has two substantial limitations. The first is theoretical and it concerns the doctrine's current incapability to distinguish between different types of minorities, as well as failing to recognize a difference between various political regimes and societal lives that might be inherently less or more accommodating or even hostile to minorities, and Muslim minority communities in particular. The second limitation relates to the political dimension and the lack of consideration for the status of the Palestinian minority as an indigenous and national minority and not an immigrant minority. Their status as national minorities, at times also as indigenous peoples, who are perceived as entitled to group-based "self-government rights", poses a serious challenge to this doctrine's scope and viability.

T1  - Sources of Discrimination and Their Associations With Health in Sexual Minority Adults
AN  - 1788295328
AB  - Health disparities exist between sexual minorities and heterosexuals. These health disparities may be due to stressful social situations and environments that are created by discrimination. The current study recruited 277 sexual minorities to complete an online survey to examine the effects of discrimination on health. Discrimination from family and friends, compared to non-family and friends, was found to be more strongly associated with poorer health. This effect was partially statistically mediated by perceived stress reactivity. Findings from this study highlight the importance of distinguishing between different sources of discrimination when examining the effect of discrimination on health in sexual minority adults.

T1  - Body Control
AN  - 1793655851
AB  - This article genealogically explores the present dilemma of the queer migratory body with intersecting identities that carry a historical timeline of prejudice concerning body control based on foreign-born status, color, class, and sexual citizenship within a nation with a colonial history, the United States specifically. The social space effects of possessing multiple minority identities are expounded upon by charting past events, statutes, and prejudicial practices while correlating them to the social restrictions of free movement placed upon queer migratory bodies of color today. This article takes into consideration various forms of economic, social, and cultural capital-based inclusive entry fees into ethnically reflective urban space, queer urban space, and public urban space. This article also explores the social reactions of majority populations in situations that threaten the capitalist neocolonial power construct model and how this reaction impacts queer migratory bodies of color within urban spaces.

T1  - Politics of Land Grabbing: The Vested Property Act and the Exploitation of Hindu Communities in Bangladesh
AN  - 1855325787
AB  - The minority communities have been victimised in most of the countries of the sub-continent. Like other countries of the subcontinent, the minorities in Bangladesh have been subject to exploitation at times. This study explores the dynamics of the enactment of the Vested Properties Act 1974 from the historical perspective, identifying factors influencing the enactment of the Act in Bangladesh. The impact of the Act on the exploitation of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh is assessed. The study finds that as governments played political games with the Act, Hindu communities were systematically robbed of land using its provisions.

T1  - Minority Nations and Self-determination: A Proposal for the Regulation of Sovereignty Processes
AN  - 1855324743
AB  - Basque and Catalan demands for legitimising political accommodation, solely on the basis of the democratic will of their residents, poses a significant challenge to the Spanish constitutional system. The core of the debate in this kind of conflict revolves around the so-called "right to decide" which commonly finds its expression in the capacity to hold a referendum over sovereignty matters. The path opened by Quebec, Scotland and other minority nations are considered by some to constitute evidence of the democratic need to include this right as a new accommodation formula. Incorporating a "sovereigntist proceeding" into the legal system(s) may pave the way to a new framework aimed at solving the significant constitutional problems that exist in Spain and other countries. I suggest that such a procedure could be incorporated and regulated in the existing legal systems and provide some guidelines that could be adopted when drafting the aforementioned regulation.

T1  - Collective Victimization and Subjectivity in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Why Do Lasting Peace and Justice Remain Elusive?
AN  - 1855323454
AB  - The Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced patterns of mass victimization since the country's inception. As a private domain of King Leopold ii of Belgium, a Belgian colony or an independent state; the country has undergone numerous episodes of violence affecting not only individuals but also entire communities. Socio-political and economic crises have been accompanied by inter-ethnic violence, mostly in eastern provinces. Over the last decade, various mechanisms have been explored in attempts to address past atrocities. In addition to ongoing prosecutions before the International Criminal Court, a number of domestic initiatives have been or are still being explored. The present article examines the suitability of these mechanisms against the backdrop of the politically and ethnically fragmented landscape in the country. The inquiry examines whether domestic or international peace-building processes address not only individual forms of victimization but also subjective experiences and perceptions of collective victimhood.

T1  - Sexual Citizenship and Vulnerable Bodies in Makeda Silvera's The Heart Does Not Bend and Joan Riley's The Unbelonging: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1824184436
AB  - This article offers a literary and cultural studies approach to sexual citizenship and belonging through a reading of the coming-of-age genre. Coming-of-age narratives, a primary mode of a womanist Caribbean diaspora poetics, offer fruitful ground for an analysis of the relation of the individual and the state in their depictions of a protagonist's growing into sociocultural structures and internalizing normative frames of citizenship. The two novels investigated here, Makeda Silvera's The Heart Does Not Bend (2002) and Joan Riley's The Unbelonging (1985), reveal the interconnectedness of citizenship, sexuality, race, and bodily integrity in the Jamaican context, while also critically reflecting on those circumstances under which access to sexual rights is either granted or denied. I argue that a focus on women's sexual citizenship in literature expands formal notions of citizenship, taking into equal account racism, sexism, classism, and uneven capital distribution as intersecting categories affecting the practice of acting as and the status of being a citizen. Applying to contemporary Caribbean women's writing the analytical category of sexual citizenship thus engenders a feminist, politically engaged reading of these texts that not only recovers silenced stories of sexual violence and racialized oppression, but also foregrounds women's embodied subjectivity.

T1  - Keeping Up Appearances Within the Ethnic Community: A Disconnect between First and Second Generation South Asians' Educational Aspirations
AN  - 1815479247
AB  - Second generation South Asian youth are defined as part of the model minority based on their educational success in Canada and elsewhere. The literature explaining these successes highlight parental pressures as a determinant. Based on a qualitative study of South Asian second generation youth in Toronto, we examine their educational experiences, and their interpretations of these experiences. We find that there is a disconnect between the first and second generations' motivation for academic achievement, which causes significant intergenerational tensions. Our findings lend support to the arguments that immigrant parents often exert authoritative influence on their children's educational paths; however, our findings also shed light on why the second generation might interpret these pressures as problematic. We argue that among our participants, the tension is not simply about the educational pressures themselves but more so their origin: their parents' collectivist concerns about family status and prestige. The pressure to please their parents in order to impress the ethnic community is what these second generation youth feel is so problematic and contributes to intergenerational tension. The findings indicate the need to approach second generation experiences using new lenses, particularly by synthesizing understandings of their educational outcomes with their realities of being embedded in collective communities. By way of conclusion, the impact on migrant settlement processes across generations is discussed.Alternate abstract:Les jeunes sud-asiatiques de la deuxième génération sont définis comme un modèle de minorité basé sur leur réussite scolaire au Canada et ailleurs. Expliquant ces succès, la littérature met en exergue les pressions parentales comme facteurs déterminants. Basée sur une étude qualitative des jeunes sud-asiatiques de la deuxième génération dans la ville de Toronto, nous examinons leurs expériences éducatives et leurs interprétations de ces expériences. Nous trouvons qu'il y a un décalage entre la première et la seconde génération sur le plan de la motivation et des atteintes des objectifs éducatifs, ce qui engendre des tensions intergénérationnelles significatives. Nos résultats corroborent les arguments selon lesquels les parents immigrants exercent souvent une autorité évidente sur le parcours éducatif de leurs enfants. Cependant, nos résultats mettent également en lumière les raisons qui pousseraient la deuxième génération à interpréter ces pressions comme étant problématiques. Nous soutenons que parmi nos participants, les tensions ne surviennent pas seulement des pressions éducatives mais beaucoup plus de leurs origines : les préoccupations collectivistes de leurs parents au sujet de la situation familiale et du prestige. La pression de faire plaisir à leurs parents dans le but d'impressionner la communauté ethnique est ce que ressent les jeunes de la deuxième génération et qui par conséquent est si problématique et intensifie les tensions entre les générations. Les résultats indiquent ainsi la nécessité d'aborder l'expérience de la seconde génération avec un regard nouveau, notamment en synthétisant la compréhension de leurs résultats scolaires avec leurs réalités d'être intégrés dans les communautés collectives. En guise de conclusion, l'impact sur le processus d'intégration des immigrants est examiné.

T1  - RACE AS LIVED EXPERIENCE
AN  - 1733239649
AB  - A growing body of social science research has sought to conceptualize race as a multi-dimensional concept in which context, societal relations, and institutional dynamics are key components. Utilizing a specially-designed survey, we develop and use multiple measures of race (skin color, ascribed race, and discrimination experiences) to capture race as a "lived experience" and assess these measures' impact on Latinos' self-rated health status. We model these measures of race as lived experience to test the explanatory power of race, both independently and as an integrated scale, with categorical regression, scaling, and dimensional analyses. Our analyses show that our multiple measures of race have significant and negative effects on Latinos' self-reported health. Skin color is a dominant factor that impacts self-reported health both directly and indirectly. We then advocate for the utilization of multiple measures of race, adding to those used in our analysis, and their application to research regarding inequities in other health and social outcomes. Our analysis provides important contributions to research across a wide range of health, illness, social, and political disparities for communities of color.

AN  - 1722193790
AB  - Gypsies, Travellers and Roma are amongst the most marginalised and vulnerable groups in society presenting something of a bellwether, an indicator of the fairness of society. This article charts the development of One Nation Conservatism in the post-war period and relations between the Conservative Party and Gypsies, Travellers and Roma communities to gain insights into the philosophical and moral influences on the current party of government in the UK. It draws on a recent report monitoring UK progress in achieving equality and inclusion for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma groups and concludes that the potential dilution of social justice and human rights agendas will accentuate exclusion.

T1  - 'Smoke and Mirrors': Conditional Inclusion, Model Minorities, and the Pre-1965 Dismantling of Asian Exclusion
AN  - 1767327999; 201605985
AB  - DALIP SINGH SAUND (1899-1973) set several precedents in American history. Most famously, the Punjab native defeated five opponents to gain election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1956. Twice re-elected to represent California's 29th Congressional district, he earned the distinction of being the first Sikh, Indian American, and Asian American to hold national office. His three successful campaigns were startling accomplishments considering that these very groups had been widely regarded by Americans as the 'Hindu invasion,' 'brown hordes,' and 'aliens ineligible to citizenship' since the beginning of the twentieth century. What had been unthinkable until 1946, the year Indian nationals became eligible for naturalized citizenship, became a reality just a few short years later. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religious Claims during the War and Post-War Bosnia and Herzegovina
AN  - 1796341144
AB  - During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1991-1995), politicized and ethicized religion became a powerful tool for mobilization against ethnic enemies'. Yet many scholars who have worked on the armed conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina do not consider it a religious conflict. However, the collapse of religious and ethnic identities and the involvement of religious institutions and their leaders throughout the war turned various sites -- including religious ones -- into targets of actual and symbolic violence. In the post-conflict period, faith-based identities were nationalized in such a way that simply reduced them to ethnicities, thus (post-) conflict social reconstruction continues to depend on (non-) intervention of key actors, including clergy and religious leaders. Bosnia and Herzegovina is faced with a diverse set of issues, but the underlying paradox is that the institutional framework established through the Dayton Peace Accords favors the political options that are the least supportive of its implementation. The design of its political institutions does not encourage cross-ethnic cooperation; rather, it institutionalizes ethnic discrimination. In the face of failures, limits, and retrenchments of Bosnian political institutions (state), some sort of organised actors should fill the gap. In this paper, I examine these persisting tensions by focusing on the role of organized religion during the war and aftermath of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina

T1  - How contact shapes implicit and explicit preferences: attitudes toward Roma children in inclusive and non-inclusive environment
AN  - 1674422111
AB  - In two studies, the authors examined the effects of intergroup contact in inclusive and non-inclusive environments on children's explicit and implicit prejudices. In both studies, supervised contact with Roma peers, instructed by inclusive program, led to a more positive explicit evaluation of Roma and less social distance, while it had no significant impact on implicit attitudes. In contrast, implicit attitudes were related to mere exposure to Roma (Study 2). Intergroup anxiety and self-disclosure mediated the effect of inclusiveness level on explicit, but not on implicit attitudes. The results indicate that two types of attitudes might be formed via different routes, and that mere exposure and supervised contact influence them differently. This information could help tailor future prejudice reduction programs.

T1  - Uneven Citizenship: Minorities and Migrants in the Post-Yugoslav Space
AN  - 1667948481; 201509557
AB  - The special issue revolves around the relations between citizenship and various manifestations of diversity including, but going beyond, ethnicity. A number of interesting recent attempts to rethink citizenship are addressed by the addition of 'uneven citizenship' to the debate. While referring to uneven citizenship the special issue not only engages with exclusionary legal, political and social practices but also other unanticipated or unaccounted for results of citizenship policies. The individual papers address statuses, rights, and duties of refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, Roma, 'claimed co-ethnics' as well as various interactions between dominant and non-dominant groups in the post-Yugoslav space. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Ukrainian Canadian in London: Vladimir J. (Kaye) Kysilewsky and the Ukrainian Bureau, 1931-40
AN  - 1749279035
AB  - This paper examines a crucial and formative decade in the life of Vladimir J. (Kaye) Kysilewsky (1896–1976), a Ukrainian-Canadian newspaper editor, lobbyist, university professor, and historian, who is most familiar to Canadian researchers as the federal civil servant responsible for liaison with ethnic groups and the ethnic press during the early years of the Cold War. It argues that the attitudes and methods (Kaye) Kysilewsky brought to his job as a liaison officer were shaped by his experience as director of the Ukrainian Bureau in London. There, during the 1930s, he met and was counselled by a number of British parliamentarians, academics, and journalists, as he attempted to bring to public attention the murderous famine in Soviet Ukraine (which was denied by the Stalinist regime) and as he tried to contend with the Bureau’s obstreperous Ukrainian émigré rivals, in particular the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN).Alternate abstract:Cet article porte sur une décade cruciale et formative dans la vie de Vladimir J. (Kaye) Kysilewsky (1896–1976) qui fut rédacteur en chef de journal, lobbyiste, professeur d’université et historien, et que les chercheurs canadiens connaissent surtout en tant que fonctionnaire fédéral responsable de la liaison avec les groupes et la presse ethniques au cours des premières années de la guerre froide. L’article montre comment l’attitude et les méthodes que (Kaye) Kysilewsky a employées dans son travail d’officier de liaison ont été modelées par son expérience de directeur du Bureau ukrainien à Londres. Là-bas, dans les années 1930, il a rencontré un certain nombre de parlementaires britanniques, d’universitaires et de journalistes et a été conseillés par eux, alors qu’il s’efforçait d’attirer l’attention du public sur la famine meurtrière qui sévissait dans l’Ukraine soviétique (et qui était niée par le régime stalinien) et qu’il essayait de composer avec des rivaux du Bureau, émigrés ukrainiens turbulents, dont particulièrement l’Organisation des Ukrainiens nationalistes (OUN).

T1  - "Letters from the Old Country": Exploring and Defining Ukrainian Canadian Vernacular Letter Writing
AN  - 1749278926
AB  - Ukrainian Canadians have been exchanging letters with their overseas relatives for as long as they have been in Canada. Despite the fact that transatlantic family correspondence has continued since the days of early settlement of the Ukrainians in Canada, scholars have little understanding of how this vernacular practice of modernity has been lived out by the Ukrainian Canadians. Similarly, there is even less understanding of how transatlantic letter writing has affected individuals, families, and communities on both sides of the Atlantic. This article addresses the existing gap in the scholarship with respect to the study of the immigrant letter, and offers a general overview of the phenomenon of transnational family letter writing in the Ukrainian Canadian context as well as outlining the challenges in searching and studying the letters as cultural artifacts.Alternate abstract:Les Canadiens ukrainiens ont maintenu des échanges des lettres avec leurs membres de familles outre-mer depuis qu’ils sont au Canada. Malgré le fait que cette correspondance familiale transatlantique se soit maintenue depuis le temps des premiers colons ukrainiens au Canada, les chercheurs ne saisissent pas vraiment comment ces Canadiens ont vécu une telle tradition vernaculaire sur le long terme. De même, il y a encore une faible compréhension de la manière dont cette correspondance transatlantique a affecté les personnes, les familles et les communautés des deux côtés de l’Atlantique. Cet article porte sur les lacunes dont souffre la recherche concernant l’étude des lettres d’immigrants et offre un aperçu général du phénomène de la correspondance familiale transnationale dans le contexte canadien ukrainien, ainsi que des grandes lignes des défis posés à la recherche et à l’étude de ces lettres en tant qu’objets culturels.

T1  - Race, Self-Selection, and the Job Search Process
AN  - 1718065416; 201530755
AB  - While existing research has documented persistent barriers facing African-American job seekers, far less research has questioned how job seekers respond to this reality. Do minorities self-select into particular segments of the labor market to avoid discrimination? Such questions have remained unanswered due to the lack of data available on the positions to which job seekers apply. Drawing on two original data sets with application-specific information, we find little evidence that blacks target or avoid particular job types. Rather, blacks cast a wider net in their search than similarly situated whites, including a greater range of occupational categories and characteristics in their pool of job applications. Additionally, we show that perceptions of discrimination are associated with increased search breadth, suggesting that broad search among African-Americans represents an adaptation to labor market discrimination. Together these findings provide novel evidence on the role of race and self-selection in the job search process. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Methodological puzzles of surveying Roma/Gypsy populations
AN  - 1700674402; 201525264
AB  - European countries as well as the European Union are continually striving for comparable and reliable statistics about Roma, which is a precondition to efficiently support the design and implementation of national and European Union wide inclusion strategies and sectorial policies as well as monitoring their outcomes. This article aims to provide an overview of the theoretical and practical challenges researchers need to face in the course of designing and conducting survey among 'Roma' populations. A number of factors - such as dilemmas about the definition of the target population, methodology of sampling of a population with multiple and threatened identity, difficulties of constructing comparable indicators - have led to greatly diverging outcomes of various 'Roma' surveys in terms of the most essential statistics, such as the size of the population, geographical dispersion, level of poverty, level of education and employment rate. This article will summarize the various methodological decisions that research has to make by providing illustrative examples of recent research in Hungary, Romania and the European Union. It attempts to demonstrate the actual consequences of methodological decisions in terms of the varying outcomes of a crucial indicator - employment rate - produced by six independent surveys. The article's conclusions are further reaching: data on Roma minorities are a requirement for evidence-based, efficient policy making targeted at social inclusion of Roma in Europe, and therefore understanding methodological dilemmas in the collection of this data is essential.

T1  - Deliberation and Ethnicity
AN  - 1667949751; 201509621
AB  - Scholars typically suggest that deliberation, defined as communication guided by reason-giving and inclusion, works best behind a veil of ignorance or when personal differences are bracketed. In this article we explore deliberation within ethnically diverse groups. We operationalize ethnicity in three ways: as an aspect of individual identity, as an identity that is made salient through priming, and as an enactment relative to interactions in particular situations. In this way, we can explore the applicability of our previous experimental results to ethnically diverse groups. We find similar results: within ethnically diverse groups, deliberation matters; participants are more likely to reconsider their positions when deliberating than when simply talking about politics. Ethnicity has no adverse effects on the quality of deliberation, indicating that bracketing has no significant impact. On the contrary, when conceptualized as a relational enactment, ethnicity is correlated with increased levels of reason-giving and inclusion, and hence higher quality deliberation. This suggests deliberation works in multiethnic groups in much the same way as-if not better than-it does in homogeneous groups. Deliberation is a robust form of political communication that not only helps manage, but also embraces diverse subjective experiences as a part of the political process.

T1  - A decade of suspicion: Islam and Muslims in Denmark after 9/11
AN  - 1667949847; 201509613
AB  - In 2011, al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, was killed in Pakistan and the US president, Barack Obama, concluded a decade of global 'war against terror'. In light of this, it seems only sensible to explore what implications the post-9/11 international developments have had on a local basis in specific national contexts. With this in mind, this article focuses on Denmark and discusses how the critical event of 9/11 motivated a security/integration response, including various pre-emptive measures that have cast the Muslim population as the usual suspects. It will discuss how these changes have affected the everyday lives of ordinary Danish Muslims over the last ten years and changed the relationship between majorities and minorities. Finally, it will also examine how and why recent national and international events have created the potential for another shift in majority-minority relations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural Formation of Identity: Interweaving of Nationality and Ethnicity in Ben Di Chuang Zuo, a Chinese Malaysian Musical Movement
AN  - 1667947581; 201509454
AB  - This article discusses the cultural formation of identity reflected in a musical movement in Malaysia called Ben Di Chuang Zuo (meaning, 'locally composed') among young Malaysian Chinese. Analysis of the lyrics from this movement reveals evidence of an interweaving of 'Malaysian' national identity and 'Chinese' ethnic identity in these cultural productions. A local genre has been created: the young artists are keen to emphasise both their Malaysian and Chinese identities in their music, and the songs demonstrate that these two are not contradictory or binary but two aspects of the identity of these artists and their large audience. The development of these two identities is to a large extent the result of historical ethnic influences and the political history of Malaysia and official discourse of the Malaysian Government, such as the pro-Malay national cultural policy of the 1970s onwards. The discussion suggests the importance of situating our understanding of identity formation within multiple political, social, historical and cultural contexts, and the importance of cultural production in identity formation. This study has implications for the analysis of cultural identity formation within increasingly dynamic and complex global migration and cultural flows. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Anti-Immigrant Ordinances and Discrimination in New and Established Destinations
AN  - 1735658099; 201536850
AB  - Immigrants and their children come to the U.S. in search of upward mobility, but in many contexts they experience discrimination and restrictive political climates. Contexts vary widely, however, given the growing number of new immigrant destinations. Past studies tend to focus on what immigrants and their children are (or are not) doing to adapt to local contexts, a focus that strengthens the perception that immigrants are a 'problem' group. In this article, we move the debate away from more familiar economic analyses to assess how destination type and exclusionary ordinances, defined as laws that restrict the rights of and services accorded to immigrant groups, influence 'subjective' outcomes, including reports of discrimination among Mexican Americans. Our results reveal three main findings that illustrate the importance of local context. First, individuals living in a county with a greater share of co-ethnics report fewer experiences with discrimination. Second, in counties with an exclusionary ordinance, share of co-ethnics increases reports of discrimination. Finally, being born in the U.S. and speaking English do not provide protection from discrimination; rather, such characteristics shield Mexican Americans from discrimination only in contexts with larger shares of co-ethnics.

T1  - Conservative Rationales, Racial Boundaries: A Case Study of Restrictionist Mexican Americans
AN  - 1735654755; 201536930
AB  - The 2006 immigration marches have become emblematic of Latinos' united position on immigration. However, solidarity and collective action is only one group formation outcome of sociopolitical exclusion. By ignoring those Latinos who disrupt the tenet of ethnic solidarity against immigration restriction, research has failed to specify the mechanisms that lead some Latinos to depart from their own on a racially bifurcated debate. Drawing on interviews, I document the boundary-making strategies that Mexican-origin Latinos who are 'anti-illegal immigration' deploy to formulate us and them groupings vis-a-vis immigrants. I show that respondents are politically conservative, highly nationalistic, and express a sense of nostalgia for 'the past' in broad terms. They differentiate 'us' from 'them' in terms of national membership, distinguishing those who are deserving of the material and symbolic resources of the nation-state from those who are outsiders. Because they share racial/ethnic markers with immigrants, they engage in boundary-making strategies to split the Latino/Hispanic panethnic category from the Mexican national-origin category, thereby differentiating us (Americans) from them (foreigners). They deploy multicultural discourse that establishes the compatibility of national loyalties and ethnic affinities to reconcile their background with their political position.

T1  - WHEN ORGANIZATIONS MATTER
AN  - 1667951253; 201509486
AB  - Increasingly, scholars have argued that immigration politics are inseparable from racial politics, which implies that organizations and individuals who mobilize around racial group interests influence racial and immigration attitudes and behaviors. How does the racial-political context influence anti-immigration lawmaking? In what ways does this influence vary at different stages of lawmaking? To address these questions, we combine comprehensive datasets of racially conservative organizations and state immigrant legislation and use negative binomial regression to estimate the count of anti-immigrant bills and laws in the fifty states from 1991 to 2010. We find that the presence of racially conservative organizations encourages the introduction of exclusionary proposals, but only in contexts with a Republican-dominated government. At the approval stage, on the other hand, racially conservative organizations foster the passage of exclusionary laws, and this effect is heightened in contexts with a growing foreign-born population or where a majority of voters report anti-immigrant opinions or identify as conservative. This indicates that the institutionalization of the colorblind racial ideology (in the form of racially conservative organizations) resonates with lawmakers, but in a different manner when the stakes are higher. These findings have important implications and challenge previous research on the conditions under which advocacy organizations influence lawmaking and additional forms of group behavior.

T1  - Hong Kong Muslims on Hajj: Rhythms of the Pilgrimage 2.0 and Experiences of Spirituality Among Twenty-First Century Global Cities
AN  - 1667952294; 201509591
AB  - The pilgrimage to Mecca is an often-overlooked topic in the study of Muslim minorities. This work looks at the experiences of Muslims in Hong Kong who make up a multi-ethnic community situated in a densely populated urban metropolis in China. As a small community, these Muslims are free from the constraints of the hajj quota system that most countries are subjected to. The organisation and experiences of these pilgrims is contrasted with recent developments in Mecca, including urban development and communications infrastructure to serve the pilgrims. The twenty-first century hajj, as 'pilgrimage 2.0', characterises some of the contemporary challenges that modern hajj poses. These insights are contrasted with Lefebvre's concept of rhythm analysis to highlight themes of permanence and change. In addressing the similarities of both Mecca and Hong Kong as 'global cities', the experiences of Hong Kong Muslims are made distinct. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity and place in a 'disturbed city': ways of belonging in Imphal, Manipur
AN  - 1660023566; 201505719
AB  - This article explores the relationships between ethnicity, place and belonging in the city of Imphal, capital of the state of Manipur in India's Northeast border region. Manipur has experienced decades of conflict from ethno-nationalist separatism, inter-ethnic territorial disputes and counter-insurgency operations. These ethnic conflicts play out on the urban landscape of Imphal. Control of the city from above is diffused among the civilian government and the armed forces. Non-state actors such as insurgent groups and ethnic organizations exert their own control from below. On such unstable ground, struggles by residents seeking to create place and a sense of belonging affirm ethnic boundaries. These boundaries are not static and the lines between inclusion and exclusion are continually redrawn along existing and emerging fault-lines among the population. Yet these boundaries are also transcended in unusual ways that may seem trivial but in Imphal are essential to realizing alternative ways of belonging. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Measuring Nonverbal Bias Through Body Language Responses to Stereotypes
AN  - 1680152544; 201514009
AB  - Although research has demonstrated the manifestation of racial bias by measuring overt attitudes and behaviors, there has been little examination of the subtle nonverbal cues that may also characterize such bias. The present study investigates implicit racial bias by analyzing nonverbal behaviors of individuals shown video of a criminal suspect whose ethnic identity is manipulated to be Black or White. Participants appeared significantly more uncertain about what they were saying when describing the White suspect than when describing the Black suspect. Participants were also more likely to display 'open' posture when describing the Black suspect but 'closed' posture (e.g., crossed arms) when describing the White suspect. The results indicate that biases in attitudes and beliefs might be reliably detected and measured through body language. The findings are discussed in terms of how nonverbal behaviors may reveal more subtle forms of prejudice and miscommunication. Contextual correlations between specific nonverbal behaviors and affective states are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Black Mexicans, Conjunctural Ethnicity, and Operating Identities: Long-Term Ethnographic Analysis
AN  - 1650145187; 201502279
AB  - This article draws on more than 15 years of research to analyze 'Black Mexicans,' phenotypically 'Mexican-looking' youth who identified as Black during adolescence, used this identity to become upwardly mobile, and then abandoned it in early adulthood. Black Mexicans are potentially iconic cases among emerging varieties of U.S. ethnic and racial life, given Mexicans' status as a key, usually negative, case in assimilation theory. Most such theory posits that assimilation into Black, inner-city culture leads to downward mobility. To explain how and why this did not happen for Black Mexicans, I propose a sensitizing framework using the concepts of conjunctural ethnicity, emphasizing analysis of racial and ethnic identity in local, historical, and life course contexts; and operating identity, which analyzes identities in interactions and can accommodate slippage in informants' understanding or use of ethnic and racial categories. Some Mexicans used a Black culture of mobility to become upwardly mobile in the late-1990s and early-2000s in New York, adopting a socially advantaged operating identity that helped them in ways they felt Mexicanness could not in that historical conjuncture, especially given intra-ethnic competition between teen migrants and second-generation youth. This article uses case-based ethnographic analysis and net-effects analysis to explain why and how Blackness aided upward mobility among Black and non-Black Mexicans, but was left behind in early adulthood.

T1  - Diversity and the economy: a cross-country, comprehensive study
AN  - 1559007256; 201431944
AB  - Using Alesina et al.'s (2003) fractionalization indices that separately measure ethnic (E), linguistic (L) and religious (R) diversity for 180 countries, a cluster analysis is performed to group the countries into three distinct clusters based on their similarities in the three diversity measures. Given these country clusters, this study examines how these different clusters perform, on average, in regard to thirteen different economic and political indicators. The results presented for the economic indicators suggest that ethnic and linguistic diversity measures might be relatively more important in affecting economic outcomes compared to religious diversity. In terms of the political indicators considered in this analysis, the countries in the most ethnically, linguistically and religiously diverse cluster performed statistically lower on average relative to the other country clusters.

T1  - Ethnic statistics: Ringelheim, reification and the residuary method
AN  - 1551001642; 201428957
AB  - This response to Julie Ringelheim's (2011) article on methods of collecting ethnic statistics focuses on her use of Northern Ireland as a precedent for the rest of Europe. In Northern Ireland the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities, backed by Council of Europe experts, has sanctioned methods other than voluntary self-identification. Before drawing broader lessons from this derogation of self-identification, attention should be paid to the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland and to scholarly debate on the consequences of this derogation.

T1  - 'He is Armenian but he was born that way; there isn't much he can do about it': exploring identity and cultural assumptions in Turkey
AN  - 1559005848; 201431922
AB  - If Armenians have a core belief, it is that they are an endangered people. They live as if under constant threat. After the annihilation of the Armenian population living in their historical lands-the Armenian heartlands were in eastern Turkey-by the Young Turk government during 1915-16, a new Turkish republic emerged from the old Ottoman-Turkish state in 1923, including an oppressive nationalistic hegemony. The resulting identity politics only fuelled the sense of being Other among Armenians and other minorities. By assessing the consequences and social impact of anxiety on this minority population defined as the Other, Anahit's paper aims to explore identity and cultural assumptions in Turkey through the Armenian experience. Leaving behind conceptualizations of the shifting modes of cultural representation, it seeks to go beyond the existing sociopolitical constraints that have persisted since 1915. Based on field research conducted between 2005 and 2011, Anahit examines the ever-changing set of norms of cultural identity by exploring the politics of collective memory. She asks whether a dominant culture is dependant on counter-cultural movements to remain all-powerful. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What Does Difference Have to Do with Community? Derrida's Diacritic Difference
AN  - 1750223970
AB  - This essay explores the ways in which difference can be preserved within a community. It departs from Jacques Derrida's critique of the image of community as immediately present to itself, without difference and his criticism on the minorities which identify themselves with other oppressed minority communities in the name of the universal. Through Derrida, it discusses other strategies of difference which can no longer be related to a community identity. From this perspective, the essay attempts to portray difference as a diacritical mark in a selection of photographic and filmic works: Frédéric Brenner's Diaspora and Jo Sol's Fake Orgasm. Do Frédéric Brenner's Jewish visual archive and Jo Sol's film on sexuality seek to measure the stakes of the diacritic difference in common?

T1  - Claiming Rights to Workplace Safety: Latin American Immigrant Workers in Southwestern Ontario
AN  - 1728660867; 201534040
AB  - Drawing on the studies of citizenship practices and health and safety literature, this paper explores the reporting of workplace injuries and hazards among Latin American immigrants in Southwestern Ontario. The paper examines how (under-)reporting is shaped by three conditions: the knowledge of workers' rights, job (in)security, and ethnic identities. Recognizing knowledge as a significant factor which enables or constrains the capacity to claim one's citizenship rights, we demonstrate that even when Latin American immigrant workers develop a good understanding of their rights, many are still unable to assert them. We argue that this lack of rights access reflects the intersection of two relevant factors - workplace (in)security and ethnic and immigrant identities - which discourage their reporting. In particular, we demonstrate that since Latin American immigrants often find themselves in subordinate positions in the Canadian labour market, they choose not to report injuries and unsafe working environments for fear of discipline and reprisals. In addition, immigrant, regional, ethnic, and home country identities, all of which can limit or contradict a full sense of citizenship, appear to exert some influence on the way workers understand their workplace rights. The paper is based on 44 in-depth interviews conducted with Latin American immigrants in 2010. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - A difference between a framework protecting national minorities established by the Versailles treaties and a framework protecting minorities originating from migration was blurred in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which adopted an all-inclusive approach to human rights. The present article is an attempt to research (a) what exactly the differences between the instruments protecting national minorities and the instruments protecting migrants are in one specific area, education, and (b) to what extent the general inclusiveness of human rights instruments has influenced or should influence the specific instruments pertaining to the protection of educational rights of migrants and national minorities.

T1  - Europe against the Roma
AN  - 1512220834; 201408794
AB  - The ancient hatred of Roma minorities is now being compounded in Europe by a post-austerity fear of the destitute 'scrounger'. Romani communities, many consisting of those forced by market economics and far-right politics to flee westwards from former 'eastern bloc' countries, facilitated in the latter 2000s by the free movement enabled by accession to the EU, now find themselves the victims of open hostility to 'foreigners' and state-sponsored removal. The author examines the variations of anti-Roma prejudice and state strategies in southern, eastern and western Europe, which send the Roma from pillar to post.

T1  - The Origins of Generalized and Political Trust among Immigrant Minorities and the Majority Population in the Netherlands
AN  - 1551000941; 201428931
AB  - In this study, we investigate whether differences in generalized and political trust levels between immigrants and natives are related to immigrants' relatively disadvantaged socio-economic positions in society. We compare trust levels for native Dutch respondents and Turkish and Moroccan minorities, based on the NELLS population survey (2009, n = 4,222). The results demonstrate that there are significant differences between immigrants and natives in the levels of generalized and political trust. Regarding trust in political institutions, however, the initially observed differences could almost fully be attributed to differences in economic position and social resources. We conclude that the economic and social integration of immigrants in society is most clearly associated with native-immigrant differences in political trust, but objective living conditions are also related to immigrants' generalized trust. Therefore, policies aiming to improve immigrants' economic and social integration in society will generally be conducive to generalized and political trust levels. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Interest-divergence and the colour of cutbacks: race, recession and the undeclared war on Black children
AN  - 1520342875; 201413097
AB  - Drawing on Critical Race Theory (CRT) and illustrating with examples from the English system, the paper addresses the hidden racist dimension to contemporary education reforms and argues that this is a predictable and recurrent theme at times of economic crisis. Derrick Bell's concept of 'interest-convergence' argues that moments of racial progress are won when White power-holders perceive self-interest in accommodating the demands of minoritised groups; such moments are unusual and often short-lived. Presently, we are witnessing the reverse of this process; a period of pronounced interest-divergence, when White power-holders imagine that a direct advantage will accrue from the further exclusion and oppression of Black groups in society. Behind rhetoric that proclaims the need to improve educational standards for all and celebrates a commitment to closing the existing achievement gaps; in reality education reforms are being enacted that systematically disadvantage Black students and demonstrably widen educational inequalities.

T1  - Urban Conflicts and Immigrants' Engagement. A Comparative Pragmatic Analysis of Two Northern Italian Cities
AN  - 1504424252; 201405530
AB  - At the beginning of the 1990s, urban safety entered political and media debates in Italy. Since then, an anti-social behaviour discourse has diverted attention towards newcomers who have repeatedly appeared as the main cause of urban safety conflicts. Italian scholars have often described these actors as the passive target of safety policies. The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate that in fact some residents of immigrant origins have engaged in the game of urban conflicts. A comparative analysis will be carried out to discuss contentious dynamics in two Italian cities, by building on ethnographical data collected between 2009 and 2010. The two cities which are the object of the analysis are Verona and Modena. They are situated in the so-called Third Italy, in the north of the country, and are characterised by diverging political subcultures. A consistent part of studies on immigrants' collective action has drawn from the structural perspective and has insisted on political opportunities as a crucial explanatory variable. This contribution will show the added value of complementing this interpretation with a pragmatic sensitive one. Residents of immigrant origins will be observed while undertaking their thorny path of engagement characterised by the capacity to adapt, construct more or less lasting agreements with institutional and non-institutional actors and propose alternative solutions to influence a given context. Ultimately, this will also provide an example of how a pragmatic sensitive stance can help study politics in a continuum with policies, a preoccupation which lies at the core of urban theory.

AN  - 1433108370
AB  - The current studies explore situational and individual factors affecting non-target perceivers' reactions and behavior following a racist comment, focusing on verbal confronting behavior. Two studies were conducted in which participants reported about recent situations in which they witnessed a racist comment that was not directed specifically at their own racial group. Results indicated that only one third of participants directly confronted the commenter. Strength of verbal confrontation was predicted by affective reactions and judgments of the offensiveness of the prejudicial comment. Analyses also revealed that strength of confrontation for females was predicted by the experience of negative emotions, but that males confronted more with stronger ratings of the offensiveness of the racist remarks. Implications for theory and policy are discussed.

T1  - Identifying stylizations in ethnically salient talk among disc jockeys
AN  - 1429630035; 201335693
AB  - Before accepting claims of the function of linguistic stylization, it is imperative that we are certain of what we are examining. Mikhail Bakhtin's widely cited definition that stylization is an "artistic representation of another's linguistic style" (1986:362) leaves unclear what counts as "artistic," making identifying stylizations simultaneously intuitively obvious and empirically illusive. Drawing from 270 hours of data from a radio program, the current study uses interactional discourse and acoustic analyses to compare one disc jockey's exaggerations of ethnically salient accents (stylizations) with his mundane use of reported speech. The analyses demonstrate that in both types of talk he uses a similar bundle of interactional and acoustic resources to design his talk as belonging to someone else. The link between reported and stylized speech places stylizations in an analytical category distinct from that of crossing and its issues of language ownership. The pertinent questions are those of speaker responsibility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic mobilisation for decolonisation: colonial legacy (the case of the Zo people in Northeast India)
AN  - 1417525854; 201332030
AB  - This article attempts to communicate the methodological tension between subjectivity and objectivity by recording the aspiration of communities who are problematised both by colonialism and the modern nation-state. It highlights how colonial policy and practice contribute to the postcolonial imbroglio in Northeast India. It delineates how British colonial cartography always gave priority to 'administrative convenience' in the demarcation of boundaries, resulting in the division of ethnic community. It argues that Northeast India and the Indo-Burma borderland are not yet decolonised, as the government of India, without any rearrangement or alteration, adopts the colonial administrative boundaries, which divided ethnic communities. Neither the State Reorganisation Act (1956) nor the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act (1971) fulfilled the aspiration of the segmented communities in the northeast, as they did in the mainland. The article also argues that the responses of the government of India towards the problems in Northeast India react to the manifested symptoms of the deep-rooted political problem rather than getting to the crux of the problem to find a solution.

T1  - Muxeninity and the Institutionalization of a Third Gender Identity in Alejandra Islas's Muxes: autenticas, intrepidas, buscadoras de peligro
AN  - 1417521799; 201332075
AB  - This article focuses on Alejandra Islas's documentary Muxes: autenticas, intrepidas, buscadoras de peligro (Mexico, 2005) and the way it demonstrates that transgenderism has become an institutionalized gender practice within Zapotec culture. It argues for an understanding of female relations and how they are experienced in the Isthmus in order to include muxes (a term that works as an umbrella for gay and transgender individuals) as part of the socio-sexual dynamics of the region. The article proposes a classification of the different types of Muxeninity (regarded as a separate gender category to the traditional male/female) that are encountered in this part of the country based on the different types of muxes that Islas shows in her documentary. It also argues that Muxeninity, as an identity, is not fixed or static but is an ever-evolving entity that is (re)constructed by not only an amalgamation of both ethnic identity (Zapotec) and transgender identity, but also of gay/queer as identity (as experienced in Anglo-European communities). Finally, it argues that the Vela de las muxes is a celebration that permits the conflagration of a diversity of expressions of Muxeninity, whilst demonstrating that this gender identity is multiple and fluid.

T1  - Vigilance and Apprehension: Multiculturalism, Democracy, and the 'Kurdish Question' in Turkey
AN  - 1364702703; 201323517
AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss the 'Kurdish question' in Turkey within the framework of the current debates on the 'death of multiculturalism'. Contra what I would call 'multikulti-sceptics', I contend that it is too early to compose an epitaph for multiculturalism, both as practice and as ideology, that there is no binary opposition between a form of rights-based multiculturalism on the one hand, and universal human rights, democratic constitutionalism or social cohesion on the other. The paper also focuses on 'multicultural constitutional citizenship,' based on democratic deliberation and dialogue, as a solution to Kurdish demands for the public recognition of their identities. I juxtapose Kurdish claims with similar demands made by national minorities in other contexts, and conclude by delineating the normative contours of multicultural constitutional citizenship and outlining the practical measures that are required to sustain it.

T1  - Blinded to science: gender differences in the effects of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status on academic and science attitudes among sixth graders
AN  - 1520331375; 201420716
AB  - Little research has examined whether the effects of race or socioeconomic status (SES) on educational attitudes differ by gender, limiting knowledge of unique vulnerabilities occurring at the intersection of multiple social statuses. Using data from 182 sixth-graders, interactions between gender, race/ethnicity, and SES in predicting educational aspirations, persistence, views of science, and educational self-efficacy are examined. African American and Latino boys express more negative attitudes relative to (1) higher-SES boys, (2) White boys, and (3) girls of any race/ethnicity or level of SES. The intersection of multiple inequalities in education across the early life course is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Future Directions in Research Regarding Attitudes Toward Immigrants
AN  - 1347781826; 201322207
AB  - Immigration became a political concern after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Since then, states are implementing legislation that targets immigrant groups. In response, researchers have begun to investigate the consequences of immigration policies in the United States. For this special issue of Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, the editors compiled a series of articles that highlight how the new political dynamics are influencing the lives of immigrants, often in reaction to Arizona SB 1070. This commentary summarizes the key topics discussed in the series of articles and provides suggestions for new research. It is proposed that prejudice towards immigrants is now "allowed" by the new social norms and that such prejudice produces new questions rarely addressed in the literature. The realities that some immigrants bring to the country (like reduced homicide rates) contrast the political rhetoric, and those distinctions provide great opportunities for research. In addition, the change brought about by large immigrant populations can influence self-perceptions of what many Americans consider the national identity, which is also rarely studied. This special issue provides a great step in this research endeavor, and it is proposed that there are multiple possible paths to productive research regarding prejudice towards immigrants.

T1  - School co-ethnicity and Hispanic parental involvement
AN  - 1429629962; 201335763
AB  - Scholars of immigration disagree about the role ethnic communities play in immigrant families' engagement in educational institutions. While some researchers argue that the concentration of disadvantaged ethnic groups may prevent meaningful engagement with schools, others argue that ethnic communities can possess resources that help immigrant families be involved in their children's schooling. In this study we use a nationally representative dataset of Hispanic children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) to determine if the relative size of the Hispanic population in the school affects levels of their parents' involvement in their education, as well as parents' perceptions of barriers to their involvement. Our results suggest that a large Hispanic presence in a child's school can help increase immigrant Hispanic parents' involvement in their children's schooling, but there are no benefits for US-born Hispanic parents, indicating that ethnic communities help immigrant families acculturate to American institutions.

T1  - Immigrant and Native Romani Women in Spain: Building Alliances and Developing Shared Strategies
AN  - 1347780976; 201318910
AB  - Romani women, both immigrant and native, face a greater risk of social exclusion because of the prejudices that mainstream society has about the Roma, and especially because they are women and some of them immigrants as well. This paper analyses how Romani immigrant and native women are building pan-ethnic identities, sharing alliances and developing common strategies in Spain. Previous studies on Romani women have tended to see them as passive and not active agents. Thus, very few have focused on the specific case of Romani immigrant women and on their modes of incorporation in their new contexts of reception. Drawing on data from two qualitative studies of Roma immigrant women and Gitanas in Spain, the authors demonstrate how everyday-life interactions and shared interests at informal and formal encounters lead to building solidarity alliances and sharing transnational narratives, thus overcoming subgroup ethnic boundaries and stereotypes. The analysis is carried out from the 'other women' approach, taking into account the voices of all types of Romani women, illiterate and literate, in the whole research process.

AB  - This article investigates the problem of ethnic boundary making in a changing context. Our case is Boston's North End, a historically Italian neighborhood undergoing changes to its social and physical environment, making the ethnic definition of neighborhood identity and belonging more difficult though not less salient. Consequently, participants in the workings of the neighborhood-residents, business owners, politicians-face challenges of both boundary placement (who is Italian and who is not?), as well as cultural content (what does it mean to be "Italian"?). Rather than viewing Italian ethnicity as simply weakening over time, we argue that the North End shows ethnicity is in a stage of category divergence, where the still-dominant ethnic identity is juxtaposed not against another ethnic out-group, but at various times against boundaries of class and race, commercial and community values, even city political boundaries. Drawing on ethnographic research and in-depth interviews, we describe three group identity frames that illustrate these processes and reveal how Italian ethnicity continues to animate discourse and action in the neighborhood.

T1  - The limits of post-national citizenship: European Muslims, human rights and the hijab
AN  - 1567049504; 201435102
AB  - Innovative approaches to citizenship emerged in the 1990s. Post-national theory suggested that European minorities no longer needed national citizenship because supra-national political structures such as the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) offered them protections. Denationalized citizenship held that universal human rights were now available at the national level too as the Council of Europe's member countries had to incorporate human rights principles within their own jurisdictions. New forms of claims-making among European Muslims were cited as evidence of this trend as religious claims, especially relating to the hijab, began to be made through human rights litigation. This paper demonstrates the limits of post-nationalism through a discussion of the outcomes of such claims. While European Muslims are indeed mobilizing around human rights, there is no evidence -- at the level of litigation -- that this has helped them to win recognition of their religious or cultural rights. This paper explores the reasons for this. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cross-Cultural Family Structure among Muslim, Hindu, Santal, and Oraon Communities in Rasulpur, Bangladesh
AN  - 1551002017; 201429128
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare family structure patterns among Muslim, Hindu, Santal, and Oraon communities in rural Bangladesh. For this we hypothesized that family structure patterns-marriage, family type and size, residence, role sharing, authority, communication, and property distribution-were not only significantly different but that these patterns of the family structure were also significantly interrelated among the ethnic communities in rural Bangladesh. In so doing 585 males of the ethnic communities selected by cluster random sampling were intensively interviewed with a semi-structural questionnaire in Rasulpur of Bangladesh. Results of Pearson chi-square testing suggest that the family structure patterns were significantly varied. The results of Spearman bivariate correlation coefficients also suggest that the family structure patterns were significantly interrelated among the communities in rural Bangladesh. Further cross-cultural research should be conducted on why and how family structure patterns are significantly different among the communities in Bangladesh. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Quantitative Evidence of the Continuing Significance of Race: Tableside Racism in Full-Service Restaurants
AN  - 1081863362; 201235190
AB  - Despite popular claims that racism and discrimination are no longer salient issues in contemporary society, members of racially underrepresented groups continue to experience disparate treatment in everyday public interactions. The context of full-service restaurants is one such public setting wherein African Americans, in particular, encounter racial prejudices and discriminatory treatment. To further understand the pervasiveness of such anti-Black attitudes and actions within the restaurant context, this article analyzes primary survey data derived from a community sample of servers (N = 200). Participants were asked a series of questions ascertaining information about the racial climate of their workplaces. Findings reveal substantial server negativity toward African Americans' tipping and dining behaviors. Racialized discourse and discriminatory behaviors are also shown to be quite common in the restaurant context. The anti-Black attitudes and actions that the authors document in this research are illustrative of the continuing significance of race in contemporary society, and the authors encourage further research on this relatively neglected area of inquiry.

AN  - 1221409562; 201244114
AB  - A significant finding from the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation/Gauteng City-Region Observatory non-racialism focus group data is the prevalence of negative attitudes expressed toward Indian South Africans. Using the data as a valuable analytic window into the complex race, class, ethnicity and gender politics that characterise post-apartheid South Africa, this article reflects on the implications of strong anti-Indian sentiments in post-apartheid South Africa. The article critically reflects on the historically configured identity or identities of Indian South Africans in relation to the project of 'non-racialism'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup anxiety from the self and other: Evidence from self-report, physiological effects, and real interactions
AN  - 1030866826; 201227644
AB  - Intergroup anxiety has become important in understanding the success or failure of intergroup contact. In this paper, we suggest that intergroup anxiety is made up from two constructs: self-anxiety (anxiety over thinking or doing something that is prejudiced) and other-anxiety (anxiety that the other might do something to you). Over four studies, we show how these two dimensions have different correlates and independently predict psychophysiological reactivity to an intergroup interaction. Other-anxiety was associated with negative intergroup attitudes and negative affect. In contrast, self-anxiety had no simple relationship with conventional measures of intergroup attitudes but was associated with a flattening of responses that were indicative of freezing (Study 3) and simultaneous approach and avoidance (Study 4). We suggest that whereas other-anxiety is associated with negative affect and avoidance, self-anxiety is associated with 'freezing' responses to intergroup interaction. Thus, the distinction between these two constructs has important repercussions. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - East Indians as Familiars and Partial Others in New York
AN  - 1417526511; 201331927
AB  - This article provides accounts on Guyanese East Indians in New York to consider particular problems of migrant belonging. Prior to migration, these migrants did not generally understand America to be a site that would overemphasize their ethnic identities or position them as outsiders. In the Guyanese homeland, East Indians negotiate between distinctive and non-distinctive identities which allow them to be familiars beyond the group and to belong within a redefined West. However, in the migrant setting, these spaces shift through the ways different aspects of migrants' identities are newly privileged. This shift insufficiently considers the ways East Indians belonged through contrasting contexts in Guyana and overburdens women and young people to maintain a cultural boundary. East Indians draw on past practices of being critical of each other to engage with and/or overturn the ways they appear in fixed categories of authentic culture or decadence. In these unexpected forms of belonging, they re-position themselves as partial others to critique and/or to become "newly exotic". Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sexual Minority Youth Victimization and Social Support: The Intersection of Sexuality, Gender, Race, and Victimization
AN  - 1283641906; 201303265
AB  - In comparison to heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth are more likely to experience victimization. Multiple studies have connected anti-gay prejudice and anti-gay victimization to negative outcomes. Research shows that social support may protect sexual minorities from the harmful effects of anti-gay victimization. However, rates of victimization and the negative outcomes linked to sexual identity within the sexual minority community have been relatively unexplored. Using data from three years of statewide data from heterosexual and sexual minority adolescents in grades 9-12, this study examines victimization, substance use, suicidality, and access to social support by sexuality. Results indicate that sexual minority youth are at increased risk for victimization, substance use, suicidality, and social isolation compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Results also indicate that there is very little bivariate difference within the sexual minority community. Multivariate results indicate differences among sexual minorities' experiences with victimization and substance use. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Emergence of Public Spheres in Colonial Cameroon: Palm Wine Drinking Joints in Bamenda Township
AN  - 1283637568; 201304248
AB  - Habermas' concept of public sphere encompasses a variety of meanings, including social sites where meanings are articulated, distributed and negotiated, as well as the collective body constituted by -- i.e. 'the public' in this process. Thus, any area in social life where people congregate and freely discuss and identify societal problems and, through that discussion influence public and political action, constitutes the public sphere. This paper argues that Habermas' conception is relevant to Africa and sets out to examine the emergence, functioning, and consequences of palm wine drinking joints in 20th century colonial Bamenda Township as public spheres par excellence a la Habermas.

T1  - An Update and Reflections on Fear of and Discrimination Against Bisexuals, Homosexuals, and Individuals with AIDS
AN  - 1125224512; 201240532
AB  - This study explored the relationship between biphobia, homophobia, AIDS phobia, an individual's sexual opinions and the orientation of an individual's past sexual behaviors and fantasies. Participants (N = 224) completed five self-report measures designed to specifically assess these psychological constructs. There were statistically significant correlations between the participants' fear and discrimination of sexual minorities and individuals with AIDS. Additionally, the results suggest that more conservative views regarding sexuality are associated with higher levels of biphobia and homophobia. Finally, past sexual fantasies, which were more exclusively gay/lesbian in content, were associated with lower levels of erotophobia, biphobia and homophobia. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Economic activity in the South-Asian population in Britain: the impact of ethnicity, religion, and class
AN  - 919903709; 201201666
AB  - This paper expands the existing literature on ethnicity and economic activity in Britain by studying the impact of religion and class. It argues that while the class location of the different South-Asian groups is important in determining their labour market outcomes, it does not operate independently from ethnicity; rather it is highly influenced by ethnicity in the process of determining the labour market participation of these groups. We use data obtained from the 2001 UK Census on Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi men and women aged between twenty and twenty nine. Our findings confirm that class structure of the South-Asian groups is highly ethnicized, in that the ethno-religious background and class are interwoven to the extent that the separation between them is not easy, if not impossible.

T1  - Recursive Secession of Trapped Minorities: A Comparative Study of the Serb Krajina and Abkhazia
AN  - 919904195; 201201709
AB  - Recursive secessions are attempts at secession from a seceding state (or a state emerging from a secession). This article compares attempts at recursive secession of the Serb Krajina from Croatia and of Abkhazia from Georgia and the use of force and violence in these two attempts at recursive secession. While remarkable similarities are found in the political strategies of the secessionist leaders in these two cases, there are significant differences in the use of military force both by the secessionists and their host-state authorities. The difference may be explicable by the greater dependence of the Serb Krajina secessionist leadership on the military and logistic assistance of its protector state, Serbia.

T1  - The institutionalization of panethnicity from the grassroots standpoint in a European context: The case of Gitanos and Roma immigrants in Barcelona
AN  - 902085334; 201122307
AB  - This study aims to identify, from an ethnographic perspective, how panethnic boundaries are being created between Gitano people and Roma newcomers who have emigrated from eastern to western Europe. This migration has been driven mainly by discrimination and lack of opportunities in eastern Europe after the transition to a new economy. Although Roma immigrants try to keep connected to their regions of origin, changes in their ethnic identities can also be observed when they settle in their new environment. The fieldwork was conducted in a Spanish neighbourhood with a high percentage of Gitanos and Roma immigrants from eastern Europe. Evidence from this research shows how interactions between people from both groups can promote or diminish panethnic identities and the emergence of panethnic institutions. There is mutual identification between the subgroups even though some elements of dissent and rejection may appear. One of the key components to be taken into account in the shaping and institutionalization of a panethnic identity is the presence of dialogic interactions among the Roma people of different subgroups. These interactions give rise, in a hostile context, to a common identity and solidarity among subjects. Indeed, this has been the social and symbolic base that has promoted the incorporation of newcomers in Roma religious institutions.

T1  - Overview of Trends and Policies on International Migration to East Asia: Comparing Japan, Taiwan and South Korea
AN  - 1907235567
AB  - This overview article examines the major similarities and differences among the three countries in East Asia -- Japan, Taiwan and Korea -- in terms of their immigration policies and observed flows as an introduction to three country-specific papers and a contribution on the simulation of economic impacts of different migration scenarios in Asia. These papers are from a two-year project, "From Origin to Destination: Policy Alternatives for Managing Two-Way Migration Pathways in Asia," funded by the Korea Foundation. The papers demonstrate important common patterns, including the special treatment of ethnic return migrants, population aging and demands for low-skilled migrant workers in the industrial and service sectors, the strict policy on temporary migration for low-skilled migrant workers, and the concentration of women in marriage migration and as carers in labor migration.

T1  - Effects of legitimizing discrimination against homosexuals on gay bashing
AN  - 887501098; 201118006
AB  - We used a computer harassment paradigm to test the hypothesis that affirming the legitimacy of discrimination against homosexuals increases the likelihood that heterosexual men will engage in verbal gay bashing. Legitimacy of discrimination was varied among heterosexual males (N=167) by suggesting that denying homosexuals rights and benefits is either illegitimate or legitimate, and participants interacted online with either a gay or straight bogus discussion partner. Results show that (a) participants sent more offensive comments when the legitimacy of discrimination against homosexuals was affirmed and (b) legitimacy affected gay bashing through its effect on collective guilt. These findings suggest that challenging the legitimacy of discrimination can be an effective strategy for reducing outgroup derogation. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Burmese Indians in contemporary Burma: heritage, influence, and perceptions since 1988
AN  - 862595342; 201109623
AB  - This article seeks to explore the current role, significance and influence of Burmese Indian minorities in post-1988 Burma as well as the perceptions the Burmese indigenous society and elite have developed on them since the colonial era. British Burma (1826-1948) witnessed a massive immigration of Indian communities that disproportionately dominated Burma's colonial enterprise. A strong resentment thus arose among the Burman Buddhist majority, illustrated by the rise of a popular 'indophobia' phenomenon. Paroxysmal expressions of the colonial original trauma were observed through recurrent pre-independence anti-Indian riots as well as a specific and enduring linguistic patronizing classification of the 'Kalas' by the Burmese language. Nationalistic administrative laws, enacted by the Burmese post-independence parliamentarian and military governments, furthered the downgrading and discrimination of Burmese Indians who remain however a visible minority today, with a manifest economic weight and a strong socio-cultural presence throughout Burma. In this paper, it will, however, be argued that after years of 'Burmanization' processes, Burmese old-age 'indophobic' sentiments have turned towards more 'islamophobic' tendencies, now explicitly targeting the Muslim communities of Indian origin, but that it remains difficult to evaluate their impact on Burma's current policymaking.

T1  - The Impact of Group Entitativity on Linguistic Discrimination: Ingroup Favoritism and Outgroup Derogation in the Explanation of Negative Outcome Allocations
AN  - 964196716; 201207271
AB  - This study investigated the impact of minimal group entitativity on linguistic ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Group entitativity varied across three conditions: mere categorization, spatial separation of groups, and common fate. Participants described with spontaneous language negative outcome allocations performed either by ingroup or by outgroup members. Findings showed that linguistic discrimination was not elicited by mere categorization and occurred only in the common fate condition. Group entitativity mainly affected linguistic outgroup derogation. This study adds to the evidence of linguistic discrimination in minimal groups and shows the strength of a linguistic measure in disentangling the different components of intergroup bias.

T1  - Two Campaigns to Strengthen United Nations Mechanisms on Minority Rights
AN  - 896165429; 201120123
AB  - Over the last decade, the non-governmental organisation Minority Rights Group International ran two campaigns at the United Nations. The first sought to create a new special procedure of the Commission on Human Rights -- a position of an expert with a mandate to investigate and make recommendations to remedy specific situations of violations of minority rights. The second responded to a situation in which the UN's only forum for representatives of minorities was threatened with closure, and aimed to keep it or have it replaced with a more effective body. In this article, the authors -- who were both involved in these campaigns -- will try to identify some lessons learnt from the strategies used, and draw some conclusions about the role of an international nongovernmental organisation in strengthening the international minority rights regime, and how, in so doing, it links with minority communities around the world.

T1  - Language Rights in Relations with Public Administration: European Perspectives
AN  - 870433164; 201114320
AB  - The preservation of linguistic diversity has recently become a major concern to many researchers, politicians and leaders of linguistic communities in Europe. The issue of linguistic minorities has taken on a particular urgency because of the increasing recognition of the threat of extinction faced by many minority languages. The need for immediate action has become obvious. Europe has slowly but steadily started to come up with responses to how to keep the most vulnerable languages from extinction and guarantee rights to speakers of such languages at the same time. Today we can talk about the emergence of a European minimum standard of protection of language rights as it has developed since the 1990s in the European conventions and their monitoring activities. There is general understanding that three areas of the use of languages -- education, administrative affairs and the media -- are determinant for the survival of minority languages. The present article focuses on one of such areas, which has revealed to be particularly contentious and a source of ever-increasing concern. It investigates the guarantees provided in the Council of Europe's instruments pertaining to the use of minority languages before public authorities, the practical difficulties and ways of their overcoming in the implementation of the rights enshrined in European treaties.

T1  - From Diaspora to Diaspora: The Case of Transylvanian Saxons in Romania and Germany
AN  - 870432575; 201114283
AB  - This article investigates the relationship between Transylvanian Saxons (Siebenburger Sachsen) and their perceived "external homeland." The authors consider the history of German minorities in East-Central Europe and, more specifically, briefly outline the history of Transylvanian Saxons. Against this backdrop, this article examines the changing nature of minority policies promoted by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) until the present day, whilst juxtaposing this with Transylvanian Saxon discourses on identity and nationhood. In so doing, this article argues that the discrepancy between the mutual expectations of the FRG and Transylvanian Saxon emigres became very pronounced after 1989. This then has led to what appears to be the end of the Saxon community, as emigres have found themselves torn between assimilation and a longing for a return to Transylvania.

T1  - A comparison of minimal group induction procedures: GPIR
AN  - 1928215459
AB  - For 40 years researchers have studied minimal groups using a variety of induction procedures which, surprisingly, have never been formally evaluated. This article reports two experiments that compared minimal group induction procedures based on: (1) memorization of novel ingroup names; (2) an imagination instruction; (3) random assignment; and (4) false feedback from painting preferences. The memorization procedure produced the largest ingroup favoritism effects on implicit measures of attraction and identification, whereas all procedures produced comparable ingroup favoritism effects on explicit measures of attraction and identification and bonus money allocation. The memorization procedure is recommended as a practical and effective minimal group induction procedure, particularly in cases in which implicit assessments are of primary interest.

T1  - Acquisition of Cross-Ethnic Friends by Recent Immigrants in Canada: A Longitudinal Approach
AN  - 1221407566; 201244098
AB  - This paper examines the development of inter-ethnic friendships between immigrants and Canadians. It uses longitudinal data from three waves of the Canadian LSIC survey, in which newly arrived immigrants were followed during the first 4 years of settlement. It is found that pre-migration characteristics play an important role in the development of inter-ethnic friendships: immigrants who arrive at a younger age and for economic reasons, as well as those who are highly educated and have a cross-ethnic partner at the moment of arrival, establish more inter-ethnic friendships over time. In addition, post-migration characteristics affect the formation of inter-ethnic friendships. Such friendships are more common among immigrants who embrace Canadian traditions and acquire the host-country language, as well as among those who work in international settings and inhabit ethnically mixed neighborhoods. The effects of pre-migration characteristics are partially mediated by post-migration characteristics. Our findings point out that economic, cultural, and spatial integration are all conducive to inter-ethnic friendships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond Territory: Revisiting the Normative Justification of Self-Government in Theory and Practice
AN  - 1081864626; 201235222
AB  - The association of sovereignty with control over territory is being challenged both internally and externally in modern societies. Demands for political autonomy from sub-state minorities undermine the natural link between nation, state and territory from within, while the movement of capital, goods and information across borders contests the relationship between these concepts from without. Scholars of international relations, law, philosophy and political science have already suggested that the sovereignty of nation-states is under attack; however, scant attention has been paid to the way in which changes in the relation between nation, state, and territory affect the normative weight associated with each of these concepts in discussions about sovereignty and self-government. The objectives of this article is to examine the way in which nation, state, sovereignty, and territory are addressed in normative justifications of indigenous self-government and to better understand how these notions are being treated in its implementation.

T1  - Challenging the Public Denial of Racism for a Deeper Multiculturalism
AN  - 1081863772; 201235223
AB  - The further development of Australian multiculturalism must squarely address racism, and a primary step must be the acknowledgement of racism. The Challenging Racism Project (2001-2008) data provide a clear picture of the acknowledgement of racism and of Anglo cultural privilege among Australians. Encouragingly, most Australians recognise that racism is a problem in Australian society. A little under half, however, deny that there is Anglo cultural privilege. Perhaps surprisingly, respondents from non-Anglo-Australian backgrounds, including those born in the Middle East and South Asia, were significantly more likely than those from Anglo backgrounds and Australian-born respondents to deny that racial prejudice exists in Australia. Cultural hierarchies of citizenship regulate the acknowledgement of racism, encouraging denial and deflection, and punishing 'complaint' from those more exposed to racism. The broader social pathology identified by this paper is an unevenness in the sense of citizenship across ethnic groups, and addressing this social weakness must be a macro-level ambition for the further development of Australian multiculturalism.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Ingroup Reappraisal: Examining the Deprovincialization Thesis
AN  - 856403162; 201106822
AB  - According to the deprovincialization thesis, interethnic contact involves a reappraisal and distancing from the ingroup. Contact can broaden one's horizon by acknowledging and recognizing the value of other cultures and thereby putting the taken-for-granted own cultural standards into perspective. The current research uses data from three surveys to examine the relationship between quantity of outgroup contact and ingroup distance (ingroup identification and ingroup feelings) among native Dutch participants. More positive contact with ethnic outgroups was expected to lead to a higher endorsement of multiculturalism, that, in turn, is related to a stronger distancing from the ingroup. Findings in all three studies support the deprovincialization thesis. In addition, in Study 3, mediation is found independently of outgroup threat. Findings across the three studies confirm the stability of the results and cross-validate the deprovincialization thesis. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Constructions of Islam in the Context of Religious Arbitration: A Consideration of the 'Shari'ah Debate' in Ontario, Canada
AN  - 835111460; 201100455
AB  - In 2003 Ontarians engaged in a debate over the use and application of religious, and specifically Islamic, law in private dispute resolution. A province wide commission on the issue, summarized in a report by Marion Boyd, encapsulates many of the ideas and attitudes prevalent among Canadians, on the controversial issue of religious arbitration. Two distinct models of Islam emerge from the multiplicity of perspectives (re)presented in Boyd's report, in which 'Islam' signals both: (1) a religious and (2) a neo-ethnic identity. I submit that these dual constructions of Islam map onto familiar categories of 'religion' and 'multiculturalism' already present among the Canadian public. Thus, the constructions of Islam contained in Boyd's report work to strengthen the familiar conceptual categories already existing in Canadian public discourse during a time of political controversy and anxiety prevailing in the country.

T1  - "I am Maasai": Interpreting ethnic parody in Bongo Flava
AN  - 758124573; 201057091
AB  - In the Tanzanian Bongo Flava youth music scene, Abel Motika is a popular artist who uses both verbal and visual markers of Kisongo Maasai ethnicity to style himself as "the Maasai rapper" with the stage name "Mr. Ebbo." Through analysis of his 2002 song "Mi Mmasai" 'I am Maasai', this study investigates his ethnic stylizing in playful use of Maa pronunciation and an understudied Swahili language game known as kinyume 'backwards style'. The study finds that while Ebbo strategically disrupts the sociolinguistic order that privileges Standard Swahili, the Maasai persona he projects is humorously stylized as unable both to speak Standard Swahili and to engage with the urban lifestyle associated with Tanzania's de-ethnicized Swahili modernity, thereby leaving dominant ideologies of language and ethnicity intact. Moreover, in arguing that Motika's stylization of ethnicity has a contradictory effect, both affirming a local ethnic identity and preserving the logic of ethnolinguistic stereotyping, the study critiques approaches to hip hop that privilige authorial intent and assume linguistic subversiveness.

This paper uses data from a recent nationally representative survey of Americans to (re)assess white ethnicity in the twenty-first century. Three primary areas are explored: (1) the pervasiveness and salience of ethnic claims among white Americans; (2) the social and demographic characteristics of self-identified white ethnics; and (3) the impact of white ethnic identity on political opinions and racial attitudes. We find that a smaller but significant number of white Americans claim ethnicity today and that distinguishing social characteristics of white ethnics still remain. Contrary to current prevailing theoretical formulations, however, these markers of distinction do not appear to be related to political or racial attitudes in any systematic way.

T1  - The impact of exchange programs on the integration of the hostgroup into the self-concept
AN  - 60353451; 201017323
AB  - Two studies analyzed the impact of international exchange programs on students' identity development. More precisely, the authors predict that exchange students integrate the host society (hostgroup) into their self-concept during an exchange year. Study 1 found a stronger social identification with the hostgroup and higher commitment for former exchange students than for future exchange students. Study 2 replicated the difference between former and future exchange students and found in addition that both former and future exchange students had a stronger identification and commitment in comparison to a control group that did neither take part in nor apply for an exchange program. Moreover, in this study the inclusion of the hostgroup into the self-concept was assessed via a response time paradigm. The results indicate that former and future exchange students have a stronger association between the self and the hostgroup than the control sample, but no difference between former and future exchange students was found. The results provide evidence for the impact of interest in and actual intensive intergroup contact on students' self-concept. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]
