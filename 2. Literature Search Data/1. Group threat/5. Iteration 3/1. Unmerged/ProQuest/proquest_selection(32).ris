T1  - The Effect of White Social Prejudice on Support for American Democracy
AN  - 2549696015
AB  - Social prejudice constitutes an unwillingness to associate with individuals whose cultural or racial background differs from one's own group. Such prejudice is a particularly thorny problem in the context of democracy, which requires citizens to minimally respect such differences. In this paper, we assess the relationships between these attitudes and support for democratic institutions. Using World Values Survey data from 1995 to 2011, we find that prejudice toward cultural, ethnic, or racial “others” reduces the value that white Americans assign to democracy. We also find white Americans who exhibit these attitudes are more likely to dismiss the value of separation of powers and are more likely to support army rule. These findings imply that exclusionary rhetoric targeted toward non-white groups is accompanied by lower baseline support for democracy. We close with a discussion of how our analyses inform the study of Americans' attitudes toward democracy

T1  - ‘Peasants are peasants’: Prejudice against displaced villagers in newly-built urban neighbourhoods in China
AN  - 2526045791
AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice.

T1  - Public preferences for paying for social care in later life in England: A latent class analysis
AN  - 2544913846
AB  - There is ongoing debate about how the funding system for social care of older people in England should best be reformed. We investigated how public attitudes to individual and state responsibility for paying for social care in later life vary with demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Four vignettes of individuals in need of home care or residential care with varying levels of savings, income and housing wealth were presented to a sample of people aged 18–75 years (n = 3000) in December 2018. Respondents were asked if care costs should be paid by the user, the state or shared. They were also asked about the best way to pay for social care in old age. Latent class analysis was used to identify sub-groups with similar preferences for paying for care, and to explore their socio-demographic characteristics. We identified five classes. The majority (Class 1, 58%) preferred that the state and the user should share social care costs. Class 2 (18%) thought that the state should pay all costs regardless of users' savings, income or housing wealth. Class 3 (15%) preferred users to pay all costs at all levels of savings, income and housing wealth, with the exception of those unable to afford the costs. Classes 4 and 5 (5% each) were characterised by different patterns of 'don't know' answers. Socio-economic status was higher among those proposing higher user contributions (Class 3) and lower among those with several 'don't' know' responses (Classes 4 and 5). Concerns about care costs in old age were high among those proposing that the state pays all costs (Class 2) and those preferring that users pay all costs (Class 3). This study shows that public views on social care funding vary with respondents' characteristics and that proposals to reform the system need to be carefully calibrated.

T1  - Out-Group Animus and Punitiveness in Latin America
AN  - 2407537466
AB  - The social threat perspective anticipates that members of racial/ethnic out-groups might be perceived as socially, politically, or economically threatening; criminally inclined; and in need of social control via the criminal justice system. In light of this framework, the current study examines the influence of out-group animus on punitive sentiments in the rarely explored context of Latin America. Data from the 2012 AmericasBarometer survey collected in nine countries (N = 15,145) are analyzed, and the findings indicate that animus against foreigners, Blacks, and the Indigenous is positively associated with support for punitive measures. These results lend support for the social threat perspective and provide further evidence that this relationship might be a cultural universal in societies characterized by racial/ethnic conflict.

T1  - Less human, more to blame: Animalizing poor people increases blame and decreases support for wealth redistribution: GPIR
AN  - 2407985159
AB  - Increasing economic inequality adversely affects groups with low socioeconomic status (low-SES). However, many people are opposed to wealth redistribution policies. In this context, we examined whether dehumanization of low-SES groups has a role in this opposition. In the first study (N = 303), opposition to wealth redistribution was related to denying human uniqueness (e.g., intelligence and rationality) and having negative attitudes toward low-SES groups, more than denying human nature (e.g., emotionality and capacity to suffer) to low-SES groups. Mediation analyses indicated that this effect occurred via blaming low-SES groups for their plight, after controlling for participants’ SES and negative attitudes towards low-SES groups. In the second study (N = 220), manipulating the human uniqueness of a fictitious low-SES group affected support for wealth redistribution measures through blame. These results indicate that animalizing low-SES groups reduces support for wealth redistribution via blaming low-SES groups for their situation.

T1  - Unemployment and social stigma: Naming, blaming and shaming of educated youth in rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan
TT  - Unemployment and social stigma
AN  - 2416093008
AB  - PurposeThis article aims to highlight the stigmatization attached to the unemployment of educated youth in rural regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.Design/methodology/approachThe study explicates the subjective experiences of the youth as being unemployed and societal attitudes toward them through an in-depth qualitative approach. A total of 30 unemployed male individuals were interviewed through an interview guide.FindingsThe study reveals that unemployed individuals are stigmatized and discriminately treated. They experience the difference in social support from their family and friends during unemployment, which is a discouraging aspect. This finding is in contrast to the existing literature on the subject in which family and friends are described as a major source of social support. As the study is conducted in the rural context, it is observed that local factors coupled with the joint family system have intensified negative attitudes toward the unemployed youth. Subsequently, the negative societal treatment serves as a factor for psychological challenges in their lives.Originality/valueThis article serves the need of exploring the experiences of unemployed individuals precisely in the Pakistani context.

T1  - Introduction to Dialogues: Black affective experiences in politics
AN  - 2571095605
AB  - What role might emotions play in Black public opinion and political decision-making? Extant literature in political psychology and Black politics provide us with incomplete answers to this question. While political psychology scholars have only recently begun to explore collective emotional experiences in the form of affective polarization, scholars of Black politics have largely relied on cognitive understandings of racial identity (i.e., linked fate) and its implications for policy opinions and political participation. A burgeoning body of literature in Black politics is beginning to fill these voids. This Dialogue section is devoted to understanding how emotions like pride, anger, sadness, and fear shape Black politics. Through the use of cutting edge survey experiments, these articles address the role of emotions in reactions to police killing unarmed individuals, political ambition, and political mobilization via micro-targeting in campaign advertisements. This Dialogue section will provide a critical interjection in the field as we aim to understand the political implications of the emotions of Black people who seem to be experiencing increasing levels of trauma on a daily basis.

T1  - Stigma towards psychosis: Cross‐cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination in White British and South Asians
AN  - 2381929623
AB  - Public stigma towards people with mental health problems has been demonstrated in Western societies. Little is known about non‐Western cultures and whether cultures differ in their perceptions of people with mental health problems. Aim of this study was to examine cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination towards people with psychosis. Participants were from White British and South Asian backgrounds (N = 128, aged 16–20 years) recruited from two schools and colleges in the United Kingdom. They completed a cross‐sectional survey on affective, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions of stigma. Results revealed significant cultural differences on all three stigma dimensions. South Asians attributed higher anger (prejudice) and dangerousness (stereotypes) to people with psychosis than White British. They also reported lower willingness to help, greater avoidance, and higher endorsement of segregation (discrimination). The effects of ethnic group on helping intentions, avoidance, and segregation endorsement were mediated by anger and by dangerousness. Understanding cultural differences in stigma towards psychosis will be important for designing stigma interventions as well as treatments for people with different cultural backgrounds.

T1  - The Complexity of Policy Preferences: Examining Self-interest, Group-Interest, and Race Consciousness Across Race and Political Ideology
AN  - 2354925858
AB  - Research on attitudes toward racial policies has often been limited to a single racial group (e.g., either Whites or Blacks). These studies often focus on the role of self-interest, group-interest, and race consciousness, but this work has operationalized these concepts in different ways when studying White or Black respondents. Using data from a study in which Whites and Blacks living in Chicago were asked their attitudes toward affirmative action, we build on this body of research by using common measures of self-reported self-interest, group-interest, and race consciousness to predict support for affirmative action. We also examine whether the effects of these determinants are moderated by political ideology. We find that self-reported self-interest influences support for affirmative action among Black conservatives, but not among other respondents. Self-reported group-interest, however, has significant effects that differ between Blacks and Whites and across liberals, moderates, and conservatives. We also find that race consciousness affects respondents’ attitudes toward affirmative action, but that this effect is moderated by political ideology.

T1  - How to Enhance the Effects of Mediated Intergroup Contact? Evidence from Four Countries
AN  - 2334265612
AB  - We bridge the theorizing on mediated and imagined contact and integrate these two contact forms in one sequence within a single design. We experimentally examine whether (1) encouraging people to imagine a positive intergroup encounter prior to reading a personal story of an outgroup member as well as (2) mediated contact with an outgroup member similar or dissimilar to the ingroup prototype, improve outgroup attitudes. We also test the affective and cognitive mediators through which these effects emerge. Data from four different countries that test attitudes toward four distinct immigrant groups find that although imagined contact and similarity do not consistently improve outgroup attitudes, enhanced interest in the story of an outgroup member and positive emotions mediate the effects from similarity, and - in two countries - from imagined contact. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Voting Can Be Hard, Information Helps
AN  - 2319179267
AB  - Many U.S. elections provide voters with precious little information about candidates on the ballot. In local contests, party labels are often absent. In primary elections, party labels are not useful. Indeed, much of the time, voters have only the name of the candidate to go by. In these contexts, how do voters make decisions? Using several experiments, we find that voters use candidates’ race, ethnicity, and gender as cues for whom to support—penalizing candidates of color and benefiting women. But we also demonstrate that providing even a small amount of information to voters—such as candidate occupation—virtually erases the effects of candidate demographics on voter behavior, even among voters with high levels of racial and gender prejudice.

T1  - Ableism Special Issue Introduction
AN  - 2295332265
AB  - In this special issue, we define ableism as stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and social oppression toward people with disabilities—the largest minority group in the United States. People with disabilities are broadly defined as those who have conditions that are commonly perceived to be disabilities by the general public, including physical, sensory, and intellectual disabilities, in addition to invisible disabilities, chronic health conditions, psychiatric conditions, and others. Foundational work on language, stigma, models of disability, and social and rehabilitation psychology is reviewed. The issue has three areas of focus: social and individual‐level predictors of ableism, experiences and consequences of ableism, and navigating and resisting ableism.

T1  - Comrades in the Struggle? Feminist Women Prefer Male Allies Who Offer Autonomy- not Dependency-Oriented Help
AN  - 2117646322
AB  - Feminist women view feminist men who take a backseat and offer partial help (i.e., autonomy-oriented support) as better allies than those who attempt to solve the problem themselves and who impose their will on the movement (i.e., dependency-oriented support). We support this idea in two experiments (ns = 96; 270) conducted in the United States. Further, we show that this preference is limited to women who are most motivated to challenge gender inequality, that is, those who strongly identify with feminists (Study 2). Our findings are important because although men are more willing to challenge gender inequality if they identify with feminists (Wiley et al. 2013), not all allied support is wanted or even helpful (Droogendyk et al. 2016), and some feminist men run the risk of reinforcing the very gender hierarchy that they seek to dismantle. Our studies shift the focus in research on allied activism from whether men will support women when they challenge gender inequality to what kind of support women actually want. Implications for psychological research on intergroup relations and feminist scholarship are considered.

T1  - Ideology and Deliberation: An Analysis of Public Support for Deliberative Practices in Finland
AN  - 2430088618
AB  - The introduction of deliberative practices has been proposed as a method for revitalizing representative democracies suffering from decreasing political involvement and increasing fragmentation (Dryzek, 2000; Grönlund, Bächtiger, & Setälä, 2014; Parkinson & Mansbridge, 2012). Some scholars, however, question whether citizens are willing to engage in deliberative practices (Bartels, 2003; Hibbing & Theiss-Morse, 2002; Posner, 2004). A related concern is that deliberative practices may not appeal equally to all groups of citizens, and consequently jeopardize the principle of inclusion of all relevant arguments and experiences in deliberation (Young, 2000). Whether deliberative practices can help revitalize democracy partly depends on the extent to which support for these practices is related to ideological predispositions. Previous studies suggest that ideological predispositions systematically influence individual attitudes toward public involvement in political processes (Bengtsson & Mattila, 2009; Dalton & Welzel, 2014; Inglehart, 1997; Kriesi, 2010). If a corresponding pattern were to be found for deliberative practices, the result could be detrimental to the deliberative focus on inclusiveness. An ideological bias among supporters might translate into overrepresentation of certain ideological perspectives in deliberative events. Furthermore, if support for deliberative practices depends on strong ideological predispositions, the prospective participants in deliberation are likely to behave like activists—eager to pursue their established goals by any means necessary (Mackuen, Wolak, Keele, & Marcus, 2010, p. 440)—rather than deliberative citizens, who are considerate, balanced, open-minded, and willing to compromise (Levine & Nierras, 2007; MacKuen et al., 2010). If the composition of deliberative events is ideologically unrepresentative, it can also result in harmful group composition effects that affect the final outcome (Baek, Wojcieszak, & Delli Carpini, 2012; Barabas, 2004; Gastil, Black, & Moscovitz, 2008). It is therefore important to establish how ideological predispositions shape attitudes toward the use of deliberative practices in society. Based on these considerations, we aim to study how support for deliberative practices is linked to ideological predispositions on the traditional left–right dimension and the nationalist–cosmopolitan values dimension. Jacobs, Cook, & Delli Carpini (2009) and Neblo, Esterling, Kennedy, Lazer, & Sokhey (2010) constitute a couple of pioneering studies that examine the willingness to deliberate in the United States, and show that politically marginalized groups are willing to deliberate (Neblo et al. 2010), and that self-identified liberals are more likely to engage in deliberation than people who consider themselves to be more conservatives (Jacobs et al. 2009). However, these studies are not necessarily applicable outside the American context. Moreover, Jacobs et al. (2009) restrict their analysis to a one-dimensional conceptualization of ideology that fails to capture contemporary ideological richness. We use the Finnish National Election Study from 2015 (FNES2015) to demonstrate that individuals who are left-leaning and/or adhere to cosmopolitan values support deliberative practices. In line with the work of Zaller (1992), we also find that political awareness furthers the ability to formulate opinions that are consistent with ideological predispositions.

T1  - Persuasion and ballot initiatives: how persuasive were the televised campaign ads on same-sex marriage?
AN  - 2571083685
AB  - Initiative campaigns, unlike candidate-centered elections, are efforts to mobilize and persuade residents of state and local governments on specific policies. Previous studies have conflicting findings whether or not initiative campaigns can persuade voters. For issues like same-sex marriage, voters may be even more difficult to persuade because their attitudes may be crystallized. Four states voted on marriage equality in November 2012, which resulted in historic victories for the proponents of same-sex marriage. This led to a belief that the marriage equality campaigns won because of their strategic communications. I examine the effect of televised campaign ads on people’s attitudes toward same-sex marriage by combining market-advertising data from the 2012 campaigns and a rolling cross-sectional national survey. Media markets that spill over into neighboring states are analyzed as a natural experiment, isolating the effect of televised advertisements from other campaign efforts. The results suggest that people were greatly affected by campaign ads aired by the groups opposed to marriage equality, and the ads in favor of marriage equality were ineffective. When competing sides are framing the rights of sexual and gender minorities, those opposed retain an unequal advantage in changing the minds of the public through televised media.

T1  - Shifting Societal Attitudes: Examining the Effects of Perspective Taking on Attitudes toward and Derogation of the Poor
AN  - 2160681535
AB  - People tend to hold negative attitudes about and derogate those in poverty to varying degrees, often relying on indivi-dualistic explanations of poverty that largely ignore systemic sources. This study (N = 208) examined a perspective-taking strategy that could be used to reduce distancing behaviors and negative attitudes toward the poor. Perspective takers distanced less and reported fewer negative attitudes than others. An additional finding was that men (n = 57) were more likely to derogate/distance than women, showed greater agreement with personal deficiency explanations for poverty, and reported stronger stereotypic attitudes toward people who are impoverished.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity, Inter-group Attitudes and Countervailing Pathways of Positive and Negative Inter-group Contact: An Analysis Across Workplaces and Neighbourhoods
AN  - 2015451561
AB  - This study advances the current literature investigating the relationship between contextual out-group exposure, inter-group attitudes and the role of inter-group contact. Firstly, it introduces the concept of contact-valence into this relationship; that is, whether contact is experienced positively or negatively. Secondly, it presents a comparative analysis of how processes of out-group exposure and frequency of (valenced) contact affect prejudice across both neighbourhoods and workplaces. Applying path analysis modelling to a nationally-representative sample of white British individuals in England, we demonstrate, across both contexts, that increasing out-group exposure is associated with higher rates of both positively- and negatively-valenced contact. This results in exposure exhibiting both positive and negative indirect associations with prejudice via more frequent inter-group mixing. These countervailing contact-pathways help explain how out-group exposure is associated with inter-group attitudes. In neighbourhoods, increasing numbers of individuals experiencing positive-contact suppress an otherwise negative effect of neighbourhood diversity (driven partly by increasing numbers of individuals reporting negative contact). Across workplaces the effect differs such that increasing numbers of individuals experiencing negative-contact suppress an otherwise positive effect of workplace diversity (driven largely by increasing numbers of individuals experiencing positive contact).

T1  - Multicultural Teaching in Flemish Secondary Schools: The Role of Ethnic School Composition, Track, and Teachers’ Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1992792104
AB  - In this study, we investigate the association between a school’s ethnic composition, the track in which teachers teach, and their level of involvement with multicultural teaching (MCT) in the Flemish context, taking into account the ethnic prejudice of teachers. Multilevel analyses of data from 590 Flemish teachers in 40 Belgian secondary schools suggest that teachers in schools with more ethnic minority pupils, teachers in vocational education, and ethnically unprejudiced teachers implement more MCT. These findings highlight the need for more research into the relationship between school features, the sociopsychological characteristics of teachers, and their involvement with MCT.

T1  - Young sexual minority women's definition of community: Toward addressing health disparities in the LGBTQQ community
AN  - 1977214846
AB  - In accord with Healthy People 2020 goals, the elimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) health disparities will require community-level strategies to address stigma, discrimination, and prejudice linked to poor health. We explored how young sexual minority women (YSMW) define LGBTQQ community, community connection, community engagement, and community tensions because these concepts have implications for development and evaluation of health disparities interventions. A total of 30 YSMW (aged 18-24 years) from Michigan participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Participants varied by sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. We analyzed transcribed interviews using thematic analysis and compared emergent themes across sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. Women described community connection in terms of organizational involvement, participation in LGBTQQ spaces, and collective social identity. Participants noted how community connections were linked to stigma towards the LGBTQQ community. YSMW highlighted how divisive tensions exist within subgroups constituting the LGBTQQ community, hindering opportunities for social advocacy, unified policy priorities, and community-level interventions. The heterogeneity of YSMW's experiences identifying with the LGBTQQ community and engaging within LGBTQQ spaces suggest that researchers should attend to the role of community dynamics when developing health disparities interventions and policies. Efforts to reconcile tensions within the LGBTQQ community may strengthen and advance policymakers' ability to address sexuality-related disparities.

T1  - Multilingualism and Out-Group Acceptance: The Mediating Roles of Cognitive Flexibility and Deprovincialization
AN  - 1965318247
AB  - In this research, we systematically study multilingualism as a predictor of acceptance of ethnic out-groups. It is argued that people who speak more languages are more cognitively flexible, that is, they have an enhanced flexibility in understanding and representing information. Higher cognitive flexibility is in turn expected to be related to higher deprovincialization: a reevaluation of one's ethnocentric worldview. Deprovincialization is then expected to result in more openness toward ethnic out-groups, evidenced by a more inclusive notion of the national identity and reduced out-group dislike. Cross-sectional survey data among a representative sample of native Dutch participants from the Netherlands (N = 792) provide convincing support for these hypotheses and show that multilingualism is an important yet understudied factor in social-psychological research on prejudice reduction.

T1  - Professors-in-Training or Precarious Workers? Identity, Coalition Building, and Social Movement Unionism in the 2015 University of Toronto Graduate Employee Strike
AN  - 1979383717
AB  - In this article, I argue that graduate employees took on the political identity of precarious workers who face job insecurity and income insecurity, drawing attention to the casualization of work in the academic labor market in Canada, and the cost of undertaking graduate studies in Canadian universities. Their argument appealed to media, faculty, undergraduate students, and supportive media, which was key to building solidarity and public support for graduate employees' struggle. Building on social movement unionism literature, I show how this identity moved the debate away from the bargaining table and into broader coalition building, suggesting a broader social movement unionism among academic workers.

T1  - Keeping Minorities Happy: Hierarchy Maintenance and Whites' Decreased Support for Highly Identified White Politicians
AN  - 1972054295
AB  - We test the hypothesis that, to avoid provoking minorities, Whites will withhold their support for White political candidates who are highly identified with their race. In Study 1, we found that White Republicans were less supportive of White candidates the higher the perceived White identity of the candidate due to beliefs that such candidates would provoke racial minorities. In Study 2, we replicated this effect with a manipulation of candidates' White identity. Study 3 found that Whites reported less support for high-identity candidates when they were led to believe that the hierarchy was unstable rather than stable. Consistent with our hypothesis that those who have the most to lose are most likely to avoid provoking minorities, in Study 4, we found that Whites with high subjective socioeconomic status (SES) varied their support for provocative White candidates as a function of hierarchy stability, whereas those with low subjective SES did not.

T1  - Why the Poor Support Populism: The Politics of Sincerity in Metro Manila
AN  - 1982170556
AB  - Why do the poor respond to some populist appeals and not to others? Populist support is largely attributed to a leader's "populist style." Populist style is seen as consisting of tactics aimed at cultivating popular identification. This explanation, however, cannot tell us why the poor discriminate among leaders employing similar tactics. This article considers the question with respect to the Philippine populist Joseph Estrada. It finds that the poor support Estrada because they perceive him to be sincere, or someone who cares about them beyond electoral considerations. They see him as sincere because his political performance engages their expectations and has proven coherent over time. The collective nature of their belief in Estrada's sincerity helps account for its objectivity, durability, and diffusion. The empirical case presents an opportunity to develop a more sophisticated account of populist style and to show that it depends as much on the political savvy of supporters as on the skill of leaders.

T1  - Changing Islam, changing the world: contrasting visions within political Islam
AN  - 1924047513
AB  - How do political Islamists, movements and thinkers view political change? To what extent do they promote violence as a means of bringing about change? Are they themselves willing to change and adapt to modern political systems? There is a wide array of movements in the Muslim world that grapple with these questions and as a consequence, numerous answers and disagreements. This paper will focus on three cardinal and contested issues: Is violence a legitimate means to bring about change? Is it legitimate to adopt Western political institutions? How should Muslim movements and regimes coexist with ancient political entities such as tribes and ethnic groups? By comparing and contrasting the political outlooks of the Muslim Brothers and the Salafi-Jihadis, the article highlights the ideological gaps between moderate and militant political Islam.

T1  - "Us Against Them" or "All Humans Are Equal": Intergroup Attitudes and Perceived Parental Socialization of Muslim Immigrant and Native Dutch Youth
AN  - 1978439991
AB  - Intergroup attitudes of Muslim immigrant youth and native youth in the Netherlands were examined in relation to perceived parental socialization. Our aim was to gain insights into parent-child (dis)similarity in antagonistic and egalitarian attitudes and to understand differences between these two groups in this respect. Data come from qualitative interviews with 22 Turkish Dutch, Moroccan Dutch, and native Dutch youth (aged 16-22) who were prone either to intergroup antagonism (i.e., held hostile and negative attitudes toward out-groups) or to egalitarianism (held egalitarian attitudes). Interviews were analyzed using the constant comparison method. Results show that in the majority youth group, egalitarianism as well as intergroup antagonism were quite comparable across two generations. The attitudes of Muslim minority youth diverged more from those of their parents and appeared to be related to the pedagogic relationship between parents and children. Minority youth prone to antagonism perceived a lack of adequate parental responses to their negative experiences in the context of Islamophobia. Egalitarian minority youth reported that their parents were quite sensitive to their communications about perceived exclusion and that they responded with advice and support. Findings are discussed with reference to the social learning theory and the ethnic socialization strategies identified by Hughes et al.

T1  - Socialist antisemitism and its discontents in England, 1884-98
AN  - 1973043713
AB  - Virdee's essay explores the relationship between English socialists and migrant Jews amid the new unionism of the late nineteenth century: a cycle of protest characterized by sustained collective action by the unskilled and labouring poor demanding economic and social justice. Reading this labour history against the grain, with a greater attentiveness to questions of race and class, helps to make more transparent both the prevalence and structuring force of socialist antisemitism, as well as English and Jewish socialist opposition to it. In particular, the essay suggests that the dominant socialist discourse was intimately bound up with questions of national belonging and this directly contributed to a racialized politics of class that could not imagine migrant Jews as an integral component of the working class. At the same time, such socialist antisemitism was also challenged by a minority current of English Marxists whose conceptions of socialism refused to be limited by the narrow boundaries of the racialized nation-state. And they were joined in this collective action by autonomous Jewish socialist organizations who understood that the liberation of the Jewish worker was indivisible from that of the emancipation of the working class in general. With the help of Eleanor Marx and others, these latter strands entangled socialist politics with questions of combatting antisemitism, and thereby stretched existing conceptions of class to encompass the Jewish worker.

T1  - Testing Theories of Gun Policy Preferences Among Blacks, Latinos, and Whites in America*
AN  - 1910062402
AB  - Objective 
Research examining the factors shaping gun policy attitudes has focused on the general population or whites. Little is known about how self-interest, political values, or racial prejudice shape the gun policy preferences of minorities. We seek to assess the effect of self-interest, political values, and racial prejudice on the gun policy attitudes of whites, Latinos, and blacks. We also introduce a measure of prejudice difference in group violence--which has not been previously used in the literature on gun policy opinion. 
Methods 
We use data from a new survey (2015) and analyze whites, blacks, and Latinos separately. 
Results 
We find that many of the drivers of support for gun control found in the general population apply to minorities as well, but the substantive effects vary across groups. Similar to prior general population findings, we find that for all groups concern about crime is associated with more support for gun control, and that gun ownership, being the victim of a crime, and conservative political values are associated with less support. 
Conclusion 
In contrast, we find that racial prejudice is negatively correlated with support for gun control among whites and Latinos, while one type of racial prejudice--racial resentment--increases support for gun control among blacks.

T1  - Francophone Intergroup Attitudes and Readiness for Interprovincial Migration in Canada
AN  - 1897660702
AB  - Though existing research helps account for readiness of migrants to move internationally, few social psychological studies have focused on readiness of native born citizens to move internally across regions of their own country. Francophones residing in Canada's bilingual belt comprised of Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario rated their readiness to move internally to a French and English province compared to their readiness to migrate to the United States. Questionnaires were completed in French by three groups of undergraduates: Francophone Quebecers (n = 204), Acadians in New Brunswick (n = 227), and Franco-Ontarians (n = 227). Though readiness to emigrate to a French or English province was low across all groups, Franco-Ontarians were more willing to migrate out of Province and to the US than both Acadians and Francophone Quebecers. Predictors of readiness to migrate to Acadia (New Brunswick) or Quebec were: seeking better career prospects, perceptions that Francophones contribute to linguistic vitality, avoidance of linguistic tensions, and endorsement of integration-transformation toward Francophone migrants. Predictors of readiness to move to an English majority Province were: seeking better career prospects, English language use, and acceptance of Anglo-Canadians as migrants to own province. Predictors of readiness for emigration to the United States were very similar to those for internal migration to an English majority Province, confirming that factors accounting for internal and international migration share much in common. Results are discussed using ethnolinguistic vitality and the Interactive Acculturation Model with implications for harmony and social cohesion between Francophone and Anglophone communities within Canada's "Bilingual Belt". Alternate abstract:Cette recherche porte sur les intentions de migration interprovinciale d'étudiants universitaires francophones originaires du Nouveau-Brunswick (Acadiens : N = 227), du Québec (N = 204) et de l'Ontario (N = 227). Ces répondants francophones ont rempli des questionnaires en français comprenant une série d'échelles, de type Likert, qui ont servi à mesurer leur désir de migration interne vers une province francophone ou anglophone comparé au désir d'émigration vers les États-Unis. Les résultats démontrent que bien que la volonté d'émigrer vers une autre province canadienne ou aux États-Unis était faible chez les Acadiens et les Québécois, elle était plus soutenue chez les Franco-Ontariens dont l'identité bilingue était plus forte que celle des Acadiens et Québécois. Les prédicteurs du désir de migrer vers le Québec et l'Acadie au Nouveau-Brunswick étaient surtout pour s'assurer d'une meilleure carrière professionnelle, pour délaisser les tensions linguistiques dans la province d'origine et l'endossement de l'orientation d'acculturation intégrationniste-transformatlon à l'égard des migrants francophones. Les prédicteurs du désir de migrer vers les provinces anglophones et les États-Unis étaient semblables : pour s'assurer d'une meilleure carrière professionnelle, l'usage soutenu de l'anglais dans la vie quotidienne, et l'acceptation des migrants anglophones dans la province d'origine des répondants. La vitalité ethnolinguistique et le modèle d'acculturation interactif contribuent à l'explication de ces résultats ayant des implications pour l'harmonie et la cohésion sociale des communautés francophones et anglophones de la « zone bilingue du Canada ».

T1  - Sexual Orientation in the Labor Market
AN  - 1846272819
AB  - Most analyses of sexual orientation and earnings find that gay men face a wage gap, whereas lesbian women earn higher wages than similar heterosexual women. However, analyses rarely consider bisexual men and women as a unique group separate from other sexual minorities. I argue that such binary views of sexual orientation -- treating sexual minorities as a homogenous non-heterosexual group -- have obscured understandings of the impact of sexual orientation on labor market outcomes. Specifically, I predict that unequal outcomes for gay men and lesbian women are partly due to the influence of family arrangements and their effects on earnings. In contrast, I argue that bisexual men and women should be the most disadvantaged in the labor market, due to particularly disadvantaging stereotypes, perceptions of choice to their sexual orientation, and prejudicial treatment. Using data from the General Social Survey (N = 13,554) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 14,714), I show that family arrangements explain some of the observed earnings differentials for gay men and lesbian women. Bisexual men and women, in contrast, face wage penalties that are not explained by human capital differences or occupational characteristics. Perceptions of prejudicial treatment partially explain the observed wage gaps. [web URL: http://asr.sagepub.com/content/81/6/1132.abstract]

T1  - Feminist Identity, Feminist Politics: U.S. Feminists' Attitudes toward Social Policies
AN  - 1842389972
AB  - Feminist scholars and activists have endorsed a broad and intersectional political agenda that addresses multiple dimensions of inequality, such as gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, and class. We examine whether or not this perspective is also held by self-identified feminists in the general public. Drawing on public opinion polls from 2007 to 2009, we assess self-identified feminists' attitudes toward a range of social policies. We find that after controlling for sociodemographic factors and political ideology, feminist identity is associated with progressive attitudes on policies related to gender and sexuality (e.g., abortion) as well as policies related to other social justice issues (e.g., immigration, health care). We also find some interactions between feminist identity and gender, age, education, and political ideology, suggesting some heterogeneity in feminists' political attitudes. Overall, these findings suggest that feminists in the general public support an intersectional social justice agenda rather than a narrow focus on gender issues.

T1  - Transgender Adults' Access to College Bathrooms and Housing and the Relationship to Suicidality
AN  - 1818405565
AB  - Transgender and gender non-conforming people frequently experience discrimination, harassment, and marginalization across college and university campuses (Bilodeau, 2007; Finger, 2010; Rankin et al., 2010; Seelman et al., 2012). The minority stress model (Meyer, 2007) posits that experiences of discrimination often negatively impact the psychological wellbeing of minority groups. However, few scholars have examined whether college institutional climate factors-such as being denied access to bathrooms or gender-appropriate campus housing-are significantly associated with detrimental psychological outcomes for transgender people. Using the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, this study analyzes whether being denied access to these spaces is associated with lifetime suicide attempts, after controlling for interpersonal victimization by students or teachers. Findings from sequential logistic regression (N = 2,316) indicate that denial of access to either space had a significant relationship to suicidality, even after controlling for interpersonal victimization. This article discusses implications for higher education professionals and researchers.

T1  - Friends or Foes: The Impact of Political Ideology and Immigrant Friends on Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
AN  - 1868554422
AB  - In recent years, an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment has been witnessed in the United States, particularly from politically conservative groups. According to intergroup contact theory, increased contact between in-group and out-group members, especially cross-group friendships, has been found to reduce intergroup prejudice. This study analyzed nationally representative U.S.-based data (n = 1,000) from the Transatlantic Trends Survey, 2013 to examine if having immigrant friends interacted with political ideology, such that having immigrant friends weakened the association between conservative ideology and anti-immigrant sentiment. Findings revealed that immigrant friends and political ideology each had a significant but opposite main effect on anti-immigrant sentiment, but that having immigrant friends did not moderate or buffer the effects of political ideology on anti-immigrant sentiment. Thus, aligning with a conservative political ideology is associated with anti-immigrant sentiment irrespective of having immigrant friends. Strategies to increase intergroup contact and promote cross-group friendships are made and directions for future research are offered.

T1  - Preferences in the Early Stages of Mate Choice
AN  - 1819909168
AB  - Romantic partnership is often considered an optimal barometer of intergroup relations. To date, however, it has been challenging to distinguish the characteristics people prefer in a partner from the types of partners that are locally available. Online dating presents a new opportunity to address this puzzle. In this paper, I use behavioral data from a popular online dating site to answer three questions regarding preferences in the early stages of mate choice: First, to what extent do people prefer similarity versus status in a partner -- and do these preferences vary by gender? Second, what is the relative importance of different types of preferences -- and to what extent are apparent preferences for one characteristic merely a "by-product" of preferences for another characteristic with which the first is correlated? Third, do preferences vary at different moments of selection -- and if so, how? These analyses not only provide a nuanced portrait of how interpersonal dynamics shape broader social structures -- here, a network of romantic ties -- but they recommend a future approach to mate choice that prioritizes processes over outcomes and more deeply engages the literature on gender, social networks, and symbolic boundaries.

AB  - In this paper we reflect on the Komagata Maru as a fundamental foreshadowing of a century of Sikh negotiation with the Canadian state to achieve inclusion and belonging. The commitment of Gurdit Singh, who charted the vessel, is emblematic of miri piri, the idea that the spiritual and political cannot be separated in the fight for justice. We use miri piri as a lens through which to examine a century of Sikh struggle in Canada since the Komagata Maru. We examine four cases of Sikh-led social activism that illustrate the spirit of miri piri - the integration of the spiritual and the political in the act of resistance against injustice. Our cases include the demand for refugee rights, recognition and inclusion of minority veterans, the protection of minority groups in the wake of 9/11, and the fight to protect religious expression in Quebec. We then address what we believe is missing in Sikh social activism in terms of fighting for gender and caste equality within Sikh communities themselves. We conclude with a reflection on the fact that Sikh spirituality has greatly enhanced the social fabric of Canada, but that the struggle for rights remains a daily one that Canadian Sikhs must address both within and outside their own communities.

T1  - Occupational aspirations and ethnic school segregation: social contagion effects among native German and immigrant youths
AN  - 1809640290
AB  - In this study, I broaden the perspective on young immigrants' aspirations by looking at their social embeddedness in the host society in terms of their institutionally predefined ties to school peers. In particular, I investigate the relationship between the aspirations of immigrant and native youths with special regard to the social mechanisms that may underlie peer influences. My analyses are based on multilevel data on ninth graders from the German National Educational Panel Study. The results show that a high ratio of immigrants in schools positively influences the aspirations of both immigrant and native German youths by way of school climate. However, the same context has different effects on different groups of origin. For those of Turkish descent, 'ethnic schools' are of twofold significance: first, the aspiration gap between Turks and native Germans decreases with increasing segregation, an effect that may be attributable to less perceived discriminatory experiences in school. Second, Turkish young people's stronger adaptation to the climate in ethnically segregated schools reinforces the protective effect of ethnic segregation and, additionally, lowers the aspirations of these youths. That is, immigrants' stronger orientation towards their in-group seems to contribute to a buffer against discrimination.

T1  - Cross-border mobility, transnationality and ethnicity as resources: european Somalis' post-migration mobility practices
AN  - 1793307433
AB  - Based on a qualitative study, this article explores post-migration mobility practices developed by Somali women and men who have settled in Europe. It focuses on the 'politics of mobility', considering cross-border mobility an unequally distributed resource through which people access different forms of capital, and thus an element of social differentiation. The article reveals that respondents invest resources in places other than those where they acquired them, benefiting from a favourable symbolic exchange rate between the different places. Furthermore, while a significant part of the economic, social and cultural capital of these migrants is acquired within ethnically diversified contexts, it is mostly reinvested in networks and places where their Somali ethnicity becomes an asset-either in ethnically homogeneous networks or in activities that address Somali people's needs. Cross-border mobility, transnationality and ethnicity become core resources that enable these migrants to mobilise their capital where it can be valued most highly and to access advantageous social positions, thus fostering upward social mobility. The article argues that these strategies are less the result of an identity-based ethnic preference than a compensatory mechanism implemented by people who have few prospects of having their assets valued within the wider networks in their country of residence.

T1  - Latino/a professionals as entrepreneurs: how race, class, and gender shape entrepreneurial incorporation
AN  - 1795968004
AB  - This paper examines how race, class, and gender intersect to shape professional Latinos' entrepreneurial incorporation, as observed by the conditions that prompt professional Latinos to start a business, including access to capital and experiences with discrimination. In-depth interviews with professional Latino business owners in Los Angeles reveal that individual human capital - via resources and wealth accrued through corporate careers - facilitates entrepreneurial activity. Race, ethnicity, and gender, as intersectional social group identities, combine with class to shape variegated impacts on access to capital and business experiences by gender and target market. Ethnicity is a resource for those serving the coethnic community and is more significant in shaping business ownership experiences for men who target a racially/ethnically diverse clientele, whereas gender and race are more salient for women outside the coethnic community. This study contributes to the ethnic enterprise literature by going beyond ethnicity to demonstrate that multiple dimensions of identity shape professional Latino/as' entrepreneurial incorporation.

T1  - The Impact of Class and Sexuality-Based Stereotyping on Rape Blame
AN  - 2314220975
AB  - In order to investigate whether stereotypes about sexuality can impact perceptions of sexual assault, participants read a scenario that described a situation in which a woman reported being raped. The woman’s socioeconomic status (SES) was varied, so that she appeared to be of low or high-SES. Following the vignette, participants completed explicit measures that assessed victim blame, attitudes toward rape victims, and perceived promiscuity. Participants also answered an open-ended question that was coded for minimizing and maximizing language. Last, participants completed an “attitude survey” that measured classist attitudes. It was hypothesized that participants who read about the low-SES woman would show more rape blame, display more negative attitudes about rape victims, respond to the open-ended question with more minimizing language, and perceive her as being more promiscuous. It was also predicted that these explicit measures would be positively correlated and that the language measure would be moderated by participants’ classism. Results supported these hypotheses. Participants who read about the low-SES survivor showed more negative attitudes, believed her to be more culpable, and more promiscuous. The explicit measures were positively correlated. Additionally, participants differed in linguistic minimization and maximization, such that participants who were low in classism were more likely to maximize the low-SES target’s experience, whereas participants who were high in classism were more likely to minimize the low-SES target’s experience. Taken together, these results suggest that low-SES women are stereotyped as being promiscuous and that this stereotype affects how they may be blamed after cases of sexual assault. Public Health Significance Statement: The results of this study suggest that low-socioeconomic status (SES) survivors of assault are more likely to be blamed and found culpable for the assault than high-SES women. These attitudes correlate with stereotypes about low-SES women’s sexuality.

T1  - Attentional Biases Toward Latinos
AN  - 1785500819
AB  - The current research examined attention allocation to assess whether people preferentially attend to Latino versus White faces. The current work also tested whether this attentional bias depended on whether the task involved a bi-ethnic context (only Latino and White faces) or a multi-ethnic context (Black, Latino, and White faces). Attention was measured with an exogenous cueing task that assessed attentional capture and holding toward faces of each racial group. Results showed that Latino faces captured attention faster and held attention longer than White faces. This attentional bias was evident in both bi-ethnic and multi-ethnic racial contexts.

T1  - From "brute" to "thug:" The demonization and criminalization of unarmed Black male victims in America
AN  - 1768022922
AB  - The synonymy of Blackness with criminality is not a new phenomenon in America. Documented historical accounts have shown how myths, stereotypes, and racist ideologies led to discriminatory policies and court rulings that fueled racial violence in the post-Reconstruction era and have culminated in the exponential increase of Black male incarceration today. Misconceptions and prejudices manufactured and disseminated through various channels such as the media included references to a "brute" image of Black males. In the 21st century, this negative imagery of Black males has frequently utilized the negative connotation of the terminology "thug." In recent years, law enforcement agencies have unreasonably used deadly force on Black males allegedly considered to be "suspects" or "persons of interest." The exploitation of these often-targeted victims' criminal records, physical appearances, or misperceived attributes has been used to justify their unlawful deaths. Despite the connection between disproportionate criminality and Black masculinity, little research has been done on how unarmed Black male victims, particularly but not exclusively at the hands of law enforcement, have been posthumously criminalized. This article investigates the historical criminalization of Black males and its connection to contemporary unarmed victims of law enforcement. Action research methodology in the data collection process is utilized to interpret how Black male victims are portrayed by traditional mass media, particularly through the use of language, in ways that marginalize and devictimize these individuals. This study also aims to elucidate a contemporary understanding of race relations, racism, and the plight of the Black male in a 21-century "postracial" America.

T1  - Stakeholder citizenship: the complexities of Polish migrants' citizenship attachments in the context of the Scottish independence referendum
AN  - 1784139870
AB  - This article focuses on the experiences of Scotland's largest foreign-born minority group, namely Poles, in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. We draw on 20 in-depth interviews to explore our participants' intentions and justifications for voting (or not) in the referendum. We found that our participants tended to emphasise the jus domicili principle when justifying their eligibility to vote in the referendum. However, our participants extended the jus domicili principle in their justifications to also include the intention to stay in Scotland as a central aspect of their continuing stake in (and right to vote in the referendum to determine) Scotland's future. Through exploring our participants' justifications for voting in the referendum, we were able to examine and better understand how migrants constitute their citizenship through articulating their substantive attachments (social, economic and relational or familial) in their adoptive country and in their country of origin.

T1  - Hyphenated Turkishness: The plurality of lived nationhood in Turkey
AN  - 1764331030
AB  - Is Turkish nationality one singular identity that does not permit ethnic modifiers? Or can it be understood as pluralistic, with identities nested - "hyphenated" - with Turkishness? Then, are Turkish and Kurdish identities necessarily mutually exclusive? Such questions over the boundaries of Turkishness have long been framed in the civic versus ethnic dichotomy - an approach that does not ask whether Turkish nationhood is monolithic or pluralistic. In response, this article aims to advance the public and scholarly debates over nationhood in Turkey by turning to the question of ways in which Turkishness can be hyphenated with other identity categories in Turkey, most particularly Kurdishness. First, we reframe the debate over identity by using the combinatorial approach to ethnicity to outline how Turkishness and Kurdishness can be overlapping and nested, or a hyphenated identity. Second, we draw on public opinion data to show that such a hyphenated identity is both theoretically possible and potentially salient in Turkey today. Together, these steps deconstruct the primordialist understandings of Turkishness and Kurdishness, on the one hand, and the taken-for-granted civic claims of Turkishness, on the other.

T1  - How Women of Color Detect and Respond to Multiple Forms of Prejudice
AN  - 1719468151
AB  - The processes by which women of color and White women living in the United States detect and respond to prejudice may differ because women of color experience racism, sexism and intersectional bias. This review builds on past research by articulating how existing process models of stigmatization, when applied to the stigmatization of women of color, leave important research questions unanswered. Stigmatized individuals' interpretations of and responses to others' behaviors are continuously shaped by the possibility that they will be targeted by prejudice. In each interaction in which prejudice is plausible, targets first determine whether they have experienced prejudice and, if so, they cope with the psychological and emotional consequences of prejudiced treatment. Current theories of stigmatization best account for the experiences of people who face only one form of prejudice. In contrast, we consider how women of color, who possess multiple stigmatized identities, respond to the multiple forms of prejudice they face. First, we identify barriers to including women of color in stigma research. Second, we describe research examining how targets with one stigmatized identity detect, respond to and cope with prejudice. Third, we draw on related research on multiple identities in areas outside of the stigma literature (e.g., intergroup bias, cognition) to raise questions that are important to address in future stigma research. Our analysis is supported primarily by research conducted in the U. S. Addressing the research questions raised in this review will position the stigma literature to more readily capture the stigmatizing experiences of women of color.

T1  - Power in History: Contrasting Theoretical Approaches to Intergroup Dialogue
AN  - 1689862166
AB  - Groups in conflict routinely use historical narrative to compete for status in intergroup encounters. This study examines power dynamics in conversations about history facilitated according to distinct social psychological theories. Israeli and Palestinian youth participating in an existing intergroup contact program were randomly assigned to either a (1) coexistence condition consistent with a prejudice reduction model in which the goal was to foster the construction of a common in-group identity, or (2) a confrontational condition consistent with a collective action model in which the goal was to raise awareness about identities and empower the low-status group. Dialogue facilitated in the coexistence condition reproduced power asymmetries, with a pattern of Jewish Israeli dominance. Dialogue facilitated in the confrontational condition suggested a pattern of Palestinian dominance, consistent with a collective action model. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical approaches to intergroup contact and dialogue about history among groups in intractable conflict.

T1  - The Downside of Being Up: A New Look at Group Relative Gratification and Traditional Prejudice
AN  - 1671990783
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Relative Deprivation and Justice Research              In two experiments, we examine the moderating effect of the legitimacy and the stability of the advantaged in-group status on the relationship between measures of group relative gratification (GRG) and traditional prejudice among members of a structurally advantaged group. In Study 1, 133 participants learned that their advantaged in-group status was based on legitimate or illegitimate grounds. As expected, when participants learned of the legitimate status of their in-group, GRG was associated with the endorsement of traditional prejudice. In Study 2, 188 participants learned that their advantaged in-group status was expected to remain stable or to fluctuate. As predicted, when participants were alerted to the decline in the privileged status of the in-group, GRG was positively associated with traditional prejudice. These findings illuminate the ways in which members of advantaged groups perpetuate intergroup inequities and point to a fuller, more nuanced conceptualization of system stability.

T1  - Ndorobo Notions of Relationship with Other
AN  - 1788298734
AB  - Among the Maa-speaking Ndorobo people on the southern Mau escarpment in Kenya, basic assumptions concerning Other are foundational for how an individual interacts with all that is outside of Self. In the course of field research in the Ndorobo homeland, three categories of significant Other were distinguished in Ndorobo world view. In this article these three Ndorobo categories of Other will be discussed with particular attention given to how these categories govern notions of relationship between Ndorobo and their classifications of Other. Classificatory distinctions are made between relationships of an individual Ndorobo with: (1) community Other (community in-group), (2) earthly Other (ethnic out-groups), and (3) supernatural Other (spirit beings).

T1  - The effect of television viewing on ethnic prejudice against immigrants: A study in the Italian context
AN  - 1735657105; 201536976
AB  - Television viewers construct many different meanings from the programs they watch. Here, we investigated whether ethnic prejudice is differentially influenced by the genre of television programs in their portrayal of ethnic minorities. We also wanted to determine whether a higher educational level reduces ethnic prejudice and television use. A self-reported questionnaire was administered to 401 Italian adults. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between ethnic prejudice and television program contents and educational level. Viewing Reality and Variety Shows was positively related to ethnic prejudice, News and Public Affairs was negatively related, and Films and TV series had no apparent influence on prejudice. Educational level was negatively related to both ethnic prejudice and watching Reality and Variety Shows, and positively related to viewing News and Public Affairs and Films and TV series programs.

T1  - Return Migration Intentions in the Integration-Transnationalism Matrix
AN  - 1667951537; 201509445
AB  - This article asks how return migration intentions are shaped by ties to the country of residence on the one hand, and ties to the country of origin on the other. We discuss these two sets of ties in terms of immigrant integration and transnationalism, respectively. A central tenet of the study is that, at the individual level, integration and transnationalism are neither related in a predictable way nor independent of each other. In our analysis we take methodological steps that reflect this argument, and introduce an integration-transnationalism matrix. In the empirical analysis we use quantitative survey data (N = 3,053) on ten large immigrant groups in Norway, collected by Statistics Norway in 2005-06. We find that it is the relative strength of integration and transnationalism that is decisive for return migration intentions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Psychological asymmetry in minority-majority relations at different stages of ethnic conflict
AN  - 1767328872; 201606257
AB  - This study investigated the psychological asymmetry of majority and minority intergroup attitudes at different conflict stages: high versus low intensity conflict. Cross-sectional surveys using the same outcome measures were conducted at two time points with representative Kurdish and Turkish community samples in selected neighborhoods in the city of Izmir in Turkey. The first survey was conducted during a period of low intensity conflict (LIC), whereas the second survey was conducted 6 months later during a period of high intensity conflict (HIC). The results revealed seemingly paradoxical outcomes among minority Kurds, such that during HIC they exhibited higher social distance and less support for (Turkish) nationalistic leaders, but also higher endorsement of assimilative nationalism, less out-group negativity, and lower support for minority Kurdish rights. By contrast, Turks exhibited lower social tolerance, more support for nationalistic leaders, higher out-group negativity, lower support for minority rights, and higher endorsement of assimilative nationalism during HIC than LIC. Turks' and Kurds' images of each other were also assessed, revealing patterns consistent with image theory predictions: Turks viewed Kurds as rogue, whereas Kurds viewed Turks as barbarian. While Turks' out-group images did not change over time, Kurds' images of Turks were slightly more variable at HIC than LIC. The findings are interpreted in light of distinct challenges that conflict and violence at the national level poses to ethnic minorities and majorities. The results highlight the importance of considering the role of dynamic inter-group contexts on understanding micro-level intergroup outcomes. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Minority Language Proficiency of Adolescent Immigrant Children in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden
AN  - 1738476606; 201538785
AB  - We study minority language proficiency of adolescent immigrant children in England, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. We elaborate on theoretical mechanisms of exposure, efficiency and non-economic incentives of minority language acquisition. Using data from adolescent immigrant children in England, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, we find evidence for the role of exposure in that immigrant children who were born abroad were more proficient than those born in the host country. Exposure via the percentage of co-ethnics at school is positively related to minority proficiency, whereas parental proficiency in the destination language is negatively associated. Also belonging to a larger immigrant group increases exposure to the minority language and results in language retention. Efficiency in terms of cognitive abilities does not play a role. Non-economic incentives to retain the minority language, indicated by the ethnic identification of parents, is positively related to the child's minority language proficiency and this relationship is stronger when the quality of the parent-child relationship is higher.

T1  - IMAGINING ECUADORIANS: Historicizing National Identity in Twentieth-Century Otavalo, Ecuador
AN  - 1619869604
AB  - In 1955, a monument to Inca warrior Rumiñahui was erected in Otavalo's central plaza. In this article, I study the ways in which competing imaginings of the Ecuadorian nation have shaped the material and symbolic trajectory of the monument. The monument was the outcome of a struggle for hegemony between nonindigenous elites. The current appropriation of the monument by the local indigenous population, however, is at odds with the ideological purpose for which it was built. The initiative to build the monument emerged from the public sphere-which at that time excluded indigenous peoples-in a context of national debates about the Indian problem. The widespread notion that the indigenous people of Otavalo were exceptional propelled the local nonindigenous elite to debate the Indian problem and shape, in the process, a public sphere. Elucidating the workings of the public sphere in the racialization of indigenous peoples, I aim to contribute to the academic literature about the relationship between Indian and nation in Ecuador. This literature has focused on the role that either the state or the private sphere has played in this racialization and has not paid enough explicit attention to the public sphere.

T1  - Ethnic Differences in the Attitudes and Practice of Consanguineous Marriage among Kurds and Turks in Uromiyeh District, Iran
AN  - 1667952376; 201511895
AB  - Despite the spread of modern familial values and norms and the rapid pace of modernization in Iran, kinship marriages remain a common practice among some ethnic groups, including Turk and Kurd. This study is informed by modernization and development idealism theories to examine factors associated with the practice and attitude of Kurdish and Turkish women to consanguineous marriage, utilizing data from a representative sample of 768 evermarried women residing in the district of Uromiyeh in Iran. The results indicated that consanguineous marriage was more prevalent among Kurds rather than Turks, and Kurdish rather than Turkish women held more positive orientations to consanguineous. Multivariate results showed that being a Kurd than a Turk was strongly associated with the likelihood of practicing kinship marriage and having positive attitudes to consanguineous marriage, while the levels of modernization and development idealism showed no or weak association. The results suggest that ethnic belonging can reinforce consanguineous marriage regardless of being modernized or holding modern development ideals. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Traits and Roles in Gender Stereotypes: A Comparison between Moroccan and Spanish Native Samples
AN  - 1535959661
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Social Roles of Men and Women in Spain: Emerging Issues and Implications for International Research              This study examines gender role attitudes and attitudes toward "man" and "woman" in two native samples from Spain and Morocco. The samples were made up of 400 participants, 200 in each country, containing the same number of men and women and selected with a similar procedure. We expected differences based on the independent variables of nationality, gender and educational level. The Spanish sample, female and student participants were predicted to present more egalitarian gender role attitudes and more positive attitudes toward "woman" than participants in the Moroccan sample, male and non-student participants. Overall MANOVAs were used to show the differences in gender role attitudes and attitudes toward "man" and "woman". Results confirmed the role of the nationality variable in the expected way. The Spanish sample showed a more egalitarian view and more favorable attitudes toward "woman" than the Moroccan one. Educational level and gender showed significant effects on the Moroccan sample but only partially. Moroccan student females and non-student males presented a more egalitarian view than non-student females and student males respectively.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ethnicity everywhere and nowhere: a critical approach towards parsing ethnic and non-ethnic processes
AN  - 1551001625; 201429040
AB  - This article has two parts. First, it presents Andreas Wimmer's framework for comparative ethnic boundary making as a way of disentangling ethnic and non-ethnic processes. Wimmer's framework helps avoid the persistent tendency among researchers to attribute ethnic causes to ethnic patterns of inequality. Second, it focuses on how these insights can be applied to the US case, a nation that arguably pays a lot of attention to ethnicity and where ethnic cultures are often seen as the driver of differences in educational success and mobility between ethnic groups. The article sheds light on how this understanding can be complicated through existing and further research along Wimmerian lines. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A kin-state's responsibility: Cultural identity, recognition, and the Hungarian status law
AN  - 1531933755; 201423387
AB  - In the last 30 years, many European states have assumed a form of responsibility for recognition concerning the cultural identity of the members of their kin-minority groups. Despite the increasing number of states assuming such special trans-sovereign duties relating to individuals who are neither citizens nor residents, and the endorsements given by the Council of Europe and the EU, a conceptual analysis and normative evaluation of identity recognition as a kin-state's duty remains absent from the literature on liberal multiculturalism. Focusing on the case of the Hungarian Status Law, this article problematizes identity recognition as a kin-state's responsibility, examining its legitimacy, place and limits in liberal multiculturalism. Against the current consensus in liberal multiculturalism, I argue that, although the primary responsibility for identity recognition lies with the home-state, a kin-state can complement the home-state's duties.

T1  - Effects of Sanskrit Schooling on Cognitive and Social Processes
AN  - 1520336764; 201417684
AB  - The article discusses effects of Sanskrit schooling, a traditional system of education in India, which has continued for several thousand years. Sanskrit schooling continues to be in operation in India, but has been pushed out to the margins after the introduction of formal Western-type schooling by the British. A set of studies demonstrating the influence of traditional Sanskrit and formal Western forms of schooling on children's cognitive and social processes is discussed. These specifically include studies of learning and memory, psychological differentiation, spatial language and encoding, dead reckoning, meta-cognition, social identity and prejudice, intergroup relationships and daily activities, practices and values. The article also discusses potential areas for cross-cultural collaborative research relating to psychological development of children.

T1  - Multicultural Citizenship and Religiosity: Young Australian Muslims Forging a Sense of Belonging after 9/11
AN  - 1531932640; 201424980
AB  - This article investigates the role religiosity plays in the ways young Australian Muslims enact themselves as citizens in a context in which their right to belong to the political community is often seriously questioned. Australian responses to 9/11, 7/7 and the Cronulla Riots have relied on an understanding of Muslim youth identity that sees young Muslims' religiosity primarily as a barrier to the development of good citizenship practices. Against this backdrop, this article explores the ways in which religiosity informs the everyday acts of citizenship through which young Muslims challenge dominant narratives of citizenship. Drawing on an ethnographic study of two Melbourne-based Shia youth groups, I look at the subjective accounts of multicultural citizenship that youth group members shared in the course of the groups' weekly activities. In doing so, I draw particular attention to the role religion plays in the imaginative ways young Australian Muslims fashion themselves into citizens. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Japanese Women Migrants in Australia: Situating the Self between Ethnicity and Femininity
AN  - 1728661093; 201534118
AB  - Based on fieldwork in Sydney, Australia, this paper discusses the ways in which Japanese women marriage migrants remold their gender identity in the process of settlement. Among recent Japanese migrants to Australia, women migrants, i.e., those who migrated to Australia on account of their marriage to an Australian resident or citizen, constitute the largest number. Their settlement experience suggests navigating relationships and interactions with the local ethnic Japanese community, their cross-cultural family, and the host community. In the process, they situate themselves in daily life through their gendered identity, which assumes as important a role as ethnicity. The maternal role is central in defining their identity in Australia, although for some, this essentialized identity creates ambivalence about the self in the host society.

T1  - The Disappearing Turnout Gap between Native Americans and Non-Native Americans
AN  - 1622295542; 201438433
AB  - Much research over the years has been conducted on the voting participation of various minority groups such as African Americans and Hispanics. However, less attention has been paid in the scholarly literature to voter turnout among Native American voters, According to the 2010 US Census, Native Americans make up only about 1.7 percent of the overall population. Despite this small national population, they nonetheless comprise a significant percent of the population in several states such as Alaska (19.5 percent), Oklahoma (12.9 percent), and New Mexico (10.7 percent). In these states, the Indian vote has the potential to influence local, state, and even national elections. Generally, past studies have shown that the political participation of ethnic and racial minorities tends to be lower than that of other citizens. Here, Skopek and Garner examine Native American turnout over time, using two separate and distinct data sets. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic intermarriage in longitudinal perspective: Testing structural and cultural explanations in the United States, 1880-2011
AN  - 1559004049; 201432023
AB  - Focusing on macro-level processes, this article combines Decennial Census and Current Population Survey data to simultaneously test longitudinal and cross-sectional effects on ethnic intermarriage using structural and cultural explanations. Covering a 130 year period, the results of our multilevel analysis for 140 national-origin groups indicate that structural characteristics explain why some origin groups become more 'open' over time while others remain relatively 'closed'. Ethnic intermarriage is more likely to increase over time when the relative size of an immigrant group decreases, sex ratios grow more imbalanced, the origin group grows more diverse, the size of the third generation increases and social structural consolidation decreases. Cultural explanations also play a role suggesting that an origin group's exogamous behavior in the past exerts long-term effects and exogamous practices increase over time when the prevalence of early marriage customs declines. For some of the discussed determinants of intermarriage, longitudinal and cross-sectional effects differ calling for a more careful theorizing and testing in terms of the level of analysis (e.g., longitudinal vs. cross-sectional).

T1  - Citizenship Rights of Gypsies in Turkey: Roma and Dom Communities
AN  - 1448992485; 201342908
AB  - This article compares two different Gypsy communities, the Roma community in Edirne and the Dom community in Diyarbak(dotless i)r, in terms of their access to citizenship rights (civil, social, political and cultural). The main argument is that in Turkey the Roma community has more access to citizenship rights than the Dom community due to the fact that the Roma community lives with Turks, the ethnic majority in Turkey, whereas the Dom community lives with Kurds, who are the majority in Diyarbak(dotless i)r but a minority group in Turkey. Further, the Roma community has closer connections with state and transnational space. The article explains how for both communities ethnicity is a common barrier to benefiting from full citizenship rights and why the equality principle of citizenship is ruptured for both communities.

T1  - Predicting Homophobic Behavior Among Heterosexual Youth: Domain General and Sexual Orientation-Specific Factors at the Individual and Contextual Level
AN  - 1285325607; 22956337
AB  - As a form of bias-based harassment, homophobic behavior remains prominent in schools. Yet, little attention has been given to factors that underlie it, aside from bullying and sexual prejudice. Thus, we examined multiple domain general (empathy, perspective-taking, classroom respect norms) and sexual orientation-specific factors (sexual orientation identity importance, number of sexual minority friends, parents' sexual minority attitudes, media messages). We documented support for a model in which these sets of factors converged to predict homophobic behavior, mediated through bullying and prejudice, among 581 students in grades 9-12 (55 % female). The structural equation model indicated that, with the exception of media messages, these additional factors predicted levels of prejudice and bullying, which in turn predicted the likelihood of students to engage in homophobic behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interrelated factors in efforts to reduce bullying, prejudice, and discrimination among youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Discrimination and the Health of Immigrants and Refugees: Exploring Canada's Evidence Base and Directions for Future Research in Newcomer Receiving Countries
AN  - 1478096047; 22729289
AB  - Research and practice increasingly suggests discrimination compromises health. Yet the unique experiences and effects facing immigrant and refugee populations remain poorly understood in Canada and abroad. We review current knowledge on discrimination against newcomers in Canada, emphasizing impacts upon health status and service access to identify gaps and research needs. Existing knowledge centers around experiences within health-care settings, differences in perception and coping, mental health impacts, and debates about "non-discriminatory" health-care. There is need for comparative analyses within and across ethno-cultural groups and newcomer classes to better understand factors shaping how discrimination and its health effects are differentially experienced. Women receive greater attention in the literature given their compounded vulnerability. While this must continue, little is known about the experiences of youth and men. Governance and policy discourse analyses would elucidate how norms, institutions and practices shape discriminatory attitudes and responses. Finally, "non-discriminatory health-care" interventions require critical evaluation to determine their effectiveness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Marley Hypothesis: Denial of Racism Reflects Ignorance of History
AN  - 1448996614; 201342901
AB  - This study used a signal detection paradigm to explore the Marley hypothesis -- that group differences in perception of racism reflect dominant-group denial of and ignorance about the extent of past racism. White American students from a midwestern university and Black American students from two historically Black universities completed surveys about their historical knowledge and perception of racism. Relative to Black participants, White participants perceived less racism in both isolated incidents and systemic manifestations of racism. They also performed worse on a measure of historical knowledge (i.e., they did not discriminate historical fact from fiction), and this group difference in historical knowledge mediated the differences in perception of racism. Racial identity relevance moderated group differences in perception of systemic manifestations of racism (but not isolated incidents), such that group differences were stronger among participants who scored higher on a measure of racial identity relevance. The results help illuminate the importance of epistemologies of ignorance: cultural-psychological tools that afford denial of and inaction about injustice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Community Cohesion Policies and Meaningful Interactions: Ethnographic Reflections on Gender and Interethnic Relations in Northern England
AN  - 1417522131; 201331908
AB  - Since 2001, community cohesion has become central to discussions, policies and practices concerned with encouraging interaction between different ethnic groups in the UK. Discursively at least, it has signalled a shift from earlier race relations policies aimed at promoting multiculturalism. This paper examines policies of community cohesion alongside an exploration of interethnic and intercultural encounters within everyday spaces. Drawing upon two pieces of ethnographic research in the North of England, we draw attention to the ways in which 'mixing' is gendered and consider this in terms of the opportunities created for meaningful interactions.

T1  - Social Capital and Stratification of Young People
AN  - 1559005353; 201431924
AB  - This paper addresses the impact of social capital on the status attainment process of young people at the start of their careers and examines how social class, gender and ethnicity affect the accumulation of social capital and thereby labour market stratification of young people. A sample of young Swedes graduating from vocational schools and universities between 2005 and 2006, was surveyed via the telephone about their experiences acquiring jobs. Two research questions are posed: (i) Which characteristics (class, gender and ethnicity) affect young people's access to more social capital? (ii) How is social capital rewarded in the labour market? The results show that being female, coming from the lower social classes and being a member of a stigmatized immigrant group are associated with a substantial social capital deficit. When socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds as well as the human capital of respondents are controlled, social capital is positively associated with salary level. The results indicate that social capital is a significant factor in the stratification process of young people. Adapted from the source document

T1  - INTRODUCTION: ELECTION PROCESSES, POLITICS, AND GOVERNANCE IN THE OBAMA ERA
AN  - 1512220551; 201408750
AB  - In the election of 2008, Barack Obama became the first nonwhite to be elected to the US Presidency. Mr. Obama was elected with the help of a coalition of minority groups which included the support of over 95% of African-Americans who voted and a majority youth and women. The re-election of Barack Obama in 2012 highlights the rapid pace at which we have seen the terms, expressions, perceptions, and behaviors of politics and governance redefined during the 'Obama Era' affecting the dynamics of race, gender, and class. This current special edition includes articles that clearly show that since the election of President Obama, we have witnessed a significant increase in the nature and number of controversies permeating every aspect of race, gender, and class in government and politics.

T1  - Understanding the psychological processes involved in the demobilizing effects of positive cross-group contact
AN  - 1417524102; 201332081
AB  - A theoretical framework is required that explains why and how cross-group contact reduces collective action and how the demobilizing effects can be counteracted. We propose that at least two mechanisms are involved: an affective process whereby the positive affect created offsets negative emotions and action tendencies, and a more strategic process whereby individual advancement comes to seem like a possibility.

T1  - I, me, mine: Automatic attentional capture by self-related stimuli
AN  - 1315600242; 201307350
AB  - Drawing on decades of research suggesting an attentional advantage for self-related information, researchers generally assume that self-related stimuli automatically capture attention. However, a literature review reveals that this claim has not been systematically examined. We aimed to fill in this dearth of evidence. Following a feature-based account of automaticity, we set up four experiments in which participants were asked to respond to a target preceded by a cue, which was self-related or not. In Experiment 1, larger cuing effects (faster reaction times to valid versus invalid trials) were found with a participant's own name compared with someone else's name. In Experiment 2, we replicated these results with unconscious cues. Experiment 3 suggested that these effects are not likely driven by familiarity. In Experiment 4, participants experienced greater difficulties from having their attention being captured by their own compared with someone else's name. We conclude that attentional capture by self-related stimuli is automatic in the sense that it is unintentional, unconscious, and uncontrolled. Implications for self-regulation and intergroup relations are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Ambassadors of gender equality? How use of pair forms versus masculines as generics impacts perception of the speaker
AN  - 1315600232; 201307423
AB  - Although the use of gender fair language is strongly promoted in German-speaking countries, the impact of its use on the way speakers are perceived by others is still unknown. Results of two experimental studies showed that irrespective of their sex, speakers using pair forms rather than generic masculines were perceived more competent by both men and women. Also, they were seen as less sexist by male and female listeners with positive attitudes towards linguistic equality. Findings with respect to the attribution of warmth were more complex: they were not only impacted by language use, but also dependent on speaker's sex and listener's attitude towards linguistic equality. Results are discussed in the context of language and stereotypes. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Ethnic Microaggressions and the Depressive and Somatic Symptoms of Latino and Asian American Adolescents
AN  - 1019369070; 22453294
AB  - Ethnic microaggressions are a form of everyday, interpersonal discrimination that are ambiguous and difficult to recognize as discrimination. This study examined the frequency and impact of microaggressions among Latino (n = 247) and Asian American (n = 113) adolescents (M ^sub age^ = 17.18, SD = .75; 57 % girls). Latino adolescents reported more frequent microaggressions that dismiss their realities of discrimination and microaggressions characterized by treatment as a second class citizen than Asian Americans, but similar levels of microaggressions that highlight differences or foreignness. There were no ethnic differences in the extent to which adolescents were bothered by microaggressions. Moreover, even supposedly innocuous forms of discrimination are associated with elevated levels of anxiety, anger, and stress, which may increase feelings of depression and sickness. Microaggressions should be recognized as subtle discrimination that send messages about group status and devaluation, and similar to overt discrimination, can evoke powerful emotional reactions and may affect mental health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Before Crisis: Gender and Economic Outcomes of the Two Largest Immigrant Communities in Spain
AN  - 1037877756; 201231007
AB  - In this study, we compare labor force outcomes of the two largest immigrant communities in Spain (Moroccans and Romanians) before the economic crisis hit. We are interested in understanding if and how gender influences the labor force outcomes (wage per hour, labor force participation, and unemployment rate) of these two immigrant groups. Our analyses show that, overall, gender is an important variable on Spanish labor market, but it affects differently the two groups. There is a male job market and a female job market for both Romanian and Moroccan immigrants, with men earning significantly higher wages than women. However, while for Moroccans, working women differ significantly from men in terms of demographic characteristics, Romanian women and men have similar demographic characteristics and comparable levels of labor force participation, but differ in terms of wage levels.

T1  - African Americans respond to stigmatization: the meanings and salience of confronting, deflecting conflict, educating the ignorant and "managing the self"
AN  - 1037875998; 201231061
AB  - Drawing on interviews with 150 randomly sampled African Americans, we analyse how members of a stigmatized group understand their experience of stigmatization and assess appropriate responses when asked about the best approach to deal with stigmatization and about responses to specific incidents. Combining in-depth interviews with a systematic coding of the data, we make original contributions to the previous literature by identifying the relative salience of modalities and tools for responding. We also examine closely through qualitative data the two most salient modalities of response, 'confronting' and 'deflating' conflict, the most salient tools, teaching out-group members about African Americans, and 'the management of the self', a rationale for deflating conflict that is largely overlooked in previous studies. We find that 'confronting' is the more popular modality for responding to stigmatization among African Americans. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Determinants of Perceived Immigrant Job Threat in the American States
AN  - 1373428727; 201328763
AB  - In the United States, the 2000s were marked by record numbers of immigrants and heightened levels of pro- and anti-immigrant agitation. As a result, research investigating anti-immigrant prejudice in the United States and other societies has surged. In this article, the authors investigate the determinants of perceived immigrant job threat in the fifty U.S. states in 2005. They draw upon three theoretical perspectives that dominate the study of prejudice -- group threat theory, contact theory, and cultural theory -- but move beyond these established theories to adduce three new perspectives, which they label economic competition, labor market deregulation, and globalization. The authors find support for all six perspectives. The three new perspectives augment, rather than supplant, the traditional theories. The authors find that levels of perceived immigrant job threat tend to increase in settings where there is economic stagnation, where labor unions are growing weaker, where the minimum wage is low, and where corporate restructuring has taken place.

T1  - Understanding Maori and Pasifika attitudes towards employment and the unemployed
AN  - 1373426300; 201329190
AB  - The international literature highlights both good reasons why we might expect strong similarities in the attitudes of Maori and Pasifika and other factors that challenge this assumption. New Zealand Election Study data 1990-2011 demonstrates that Maori and Pasifika do share fairly similar views on jobs, unions and wages but their opinions diverge more when it comes to the unemployed. Drawing upon qualitative data to theorise about this difference, the article highlights the need to consider the interaction between socio-economic status and the differing cultural norms of Maori and Pasifika when considering public opinion in New Zealand.

T1  - Minority Political Participation at the Local Level: The Roma
AN  - 1030866625; 201227704
AB  - This article aims to study the existing models of political representation of the Roma minority in Slovenia. The research analyses two existing models of political participation, namely, the political representation model employed in 2002 and the policy formation model introduced in 2007. As the state is limited in securing adequate representation of minority groups in an electoral democracy, conditions for minorities to have equal opportunity and to be effectively involved in public life must be created. This can be achieved with representation in advisory and decision-making institutions such as elected bodies and assemblies of national minority affairs; local and autonomous levels of administration; self-administration by a national minority in aspects concerning its identity, especially in circumstances where autonomy on a territorial basis does not apply; and decentralised or local forms of government. Based on surveys conducted in 2004 and 2008 we have tried to identify trends in the performance of the political representation model. The research work has made some interesting findings with regard to the relationship between the two models. It appears that the political representation model acts as a platform for positive change while the policy formation model is a source of conflict among Roma representatives.

T1  - The Politics of Victimization and the Model Minority
AN  - 1567044211; 201435059
AB  - The notion of injury or victimization is often problematically identified with debates on African American racial formation within U.S. ethnic literature and film. This essay, however, will argue that victim narratives and the myth of the model minority are different but related discourses. Ang critiques Chang-rae Lee's novel A Gesture Life and argues that the model minority discourse, the act of labeling some minorities but not others as "good," perpetuates the kind of systemic violence that affects all minorities, and demonstrates how the declarations of moral right--or wrong--enable the formation or renegotiation of national or racial identities.

T1  - Identity and Academic Success among Underrepresented Ethnic Minorities: An Interdisciplinary Review and Integration
AN  - 900190105
AB  - A growing body of literature provides insight into the ingredients for academic success for underrepresented ethnic minority students at all points of the academic pipeline. Theory and research in developmental and social psychology, education, and sociology all point to the important role of identity for students' academic success. The purpose of this article is to review some of the major findings across these social science disciplines to identify points of synergy that can inform effective policy recommendations. The review is structured around three points of convergence across disciplines: (1) prejudice and stereotype threat; (2) the role of social support; and (3) the availability of options for identity development. Reviewing these three topics sheds light on how the relation between identity and academic success in list be understood on individual, relational, and institutional levels of analysis.

T1  - Beyond Anti-Muslim Sentiment Opposing the Ground Zero Mosque as a Means to Pursuing a Stronger America
AN  - 1322723702; 201312345
AB  - Americans' opposition toward building an Islamic community center at Ground Zero has been attributed solely to a general anti-Muslim sentiment. We hypothesized that some Americans' negative reaction was also due to their motivation to symbolically pursue a positive U.S. group identity, which had suffered from a concurrent economic and political downturn. Indeed, when participants perceived that the United States was suffering from lowered international status, those who identified strongly with the country, as evidenced especially by a high respect or deference for group symbols, reported a stronger opposition to the "Ground Zero mosque" than participants who identified weakly with the country did. Furthermore, participants who identified strongly with the country also showed a greater preference for buildings that were symbolically congruent than for buildings that were symbolically incongruent with the significance of Ground Zero, and they represented Ground Zero with a larger symbolic size. These findings suggest that identifying group members' underlying motivations provides unusual insights for understanding intergroup conflict. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religious intolerance and Euroscepticism
AN  - 964188845; 201208938
AB  - Research on Euroscepticism focuses increasingly on the role of group identities: national identities and attitudes towards multiculturalism. Yet hardly any attention has been paid to the way in which religious intolerance shapes Euroscepticism. We argue that religious intolerance influences not only diffuse Euroscepticism, but also more specifically opposition to enlargement of the European Union with Turkey. To examine the relationship between religious intolerance and Euroscepticism, this article analyses unique data from two representative surveys conducted in Ireland and the Netherlands. Our findings show that religious intolerance is indeed a powerful determinant of attitudes towards the European Union and that it particularly shapes people's attitudes towards future Turkish enlargement. This study therefore contributes to the literature by demonstrating that social identities are strong determinants of Euroscepticism.

T1  - New Migrants in the UK: Employment Patterns and Occupational Attainment
AN  - 870432199; 201114259
AB  - The share of Old and New Commonwealth migrants in Britain greatly diminished between 1971 and 2002. The decline of former colonial Commonwealth migrants occurred alongside the rise of Central, Eastern European and Middle Eastern migrants. This paper focuses on the chances of social mobility of the previously little-studied new migrant groups and outlines the differences in employment patterns between them and UK-born Whites and old migrants. It establishes that huge differentials exist between new immigrant groups in their labour-market participation, employment rates and occupational attainment. The disadvantage of EU10, Eastern European, Turkish and Middle Eastern migrants in terms of their probabilities of being active, employed and accessing intermediate positions cannot be explained by a lack of human capital, and their situation is not likely to improve with time. For migrant women, inactivity rather than unemployment seems the greatest concern. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social representations of the Holocaust and Jewish Israeli identity construction: insights from identity process theory
AN  - 896167475; 201120258
AB  - This study explores how a group of young Israeli Jews understood and defined their ethno-national identities, focusing upon the role of social representations of the Holocaust in the construction of Jewish Israeli identity. Eleven individuals were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Transcripts were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. The analysis was informed by identity process theory and social representations theory. Three superordinate themes are reported, entitled: (i) 'perceptions of the Holocaust as a personal and shared loss'; (ii) 're-conceptualising the Holocaust and its impact upon intra-/intergroup relations'; and (iii) 'the Holocaust as a heuristic lens for understanding the Israeli-Arab conflict'. The data suggest that awareness of social representations of the Holocaust may enhance the belonging and continuity principles of identity, in particular. It is argued that the maintenance of national ingroup security constitutes a source of (group) continuity. Implications for psychological well-being are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Secondary transfer effects from imagined contact: Group similarity affects the generalization gradient
AN  - 875716804; 201115251
AB  - An experiment examined the effects of imagining contact with an illegal immigrant on attitudes towards illegal immigrants and subsequent effects of that attitude change on feelings about other groups (secondary transfer). Compared to a condition in which participants imagined negative contact with an illegal immigrant, participants who imagined positive contact reported more positive attitudes concerning illegal immigrants. Using bootstrapped mediation models, effects of positive imagined contact on attitudes towards illegal immigrants were shown to generalize to other groups that were independently ranked as similar to illegal immigrants, but not to dissimilar groups. This generalization gradient effect was relatively large. Implications for theory and practical applications to prejudice reduction are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Exclusion Causes People to Spend and Consume Strategically in the Service of Affiliation
AN  - 862595955; 201109684
AB  - When people's deeply ingrained need for social connection is thwarted by social exclusion, profound psychological consequences ensue. Despite the fact that social connections and consumption are central facets of daily life, little empirical attention has been devoted to understanding how belongingness threats affect consumer behavior. In four experiments, we tested the hypothesis that social exclusion causes people to spend and consume strategically in the service of affiliation. Relative to controls, excluded participants were more likely to buy a product symbolic of group membership (but not practical or self-gift items), tailor their spending preferences to the preferences of an interaction partner, spend money on an unappealing food item favored by a peer, and report being willing to try an illegal drug, but only when doing so boosted their chances of commencing social connections. Overall, results suggest that socially excluded people sacrifice personal and financial well-being for the sake of social well-being. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race, Punishment, and the Michael Vick Experience
AN  - 902083244; 201122304
AB  - Objective: The relationship between race and crime has been contentious, focusing primarily on offending and incarceration patterns among minorities. There has been some limited work on public perceptions of criminal punishment, and findings show that while minorities believe in the role and rule of law, they simultaneously perceive the justice system as acting in a biased and/or unfair manner. Two limitations have stalled this literature. First, research has focused mainly on criminal punishments to the neglect of noncriminal punishments. Second, most studies have not examined whether race remains salient after considering other demographic variables or discrimination and legitimacy attitudes. Methods: Using data from 400 adults, we examine how race affects perceptions of criminal punishment and subsequent reinstatement into the National Football League in the case of Michael Vick, a star professional quarterback who pled guilty to charges of operating an illegal dog-fighting ring. Results: Findings show that whites are more likely to view Vick's punishment as too soft and that he should not be reinstated, while nonwhites had the opposite views. Race remained significant after controlling for other variables believed to be related to punishment perceptions. Conclusion: Attitudes toward both criminal punishment and NFL reinstatement vary across race such that there exists important divides in how individuals perceive the system meting out punishment and subsequently reintegrating offenders back into society. These results underscore that white and nonwhites perceive the law and its administration differently. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Direct Democracy and Minority Rights: Same-Sex Marriage Bans in the U.S. States
AN  - 902080282; 201122271
AB  - Objectives: A common critique of direct democracy posits that minority rights are endangered by citizen legislative institutions. By allowing citizens to directly create public policy, these institutions avoid the filtering mechanisms of representative democracy that provide a check on the power of the majority. Empirical research, however, has produced conflicting results that leave the question of direct democracy's effect on minority rights open to debate. This article seeks to empirically test this critique using a comparative, dynamic approach. Methods: I examine the diffusion of same-sex marriage bans in the United States using event-history analysis, comparing direct-democracy states to non-direct-democracy states. Results: The results show that direct-democracy states are significantly more likely than other states to adopt same-sex marriage bans. Conclusion: The findings support the majoritarian critique of direct democracy, suggesting that the rights of minority groups are at relatively higher risk under systems with direct democracy.

T1  - Sex, Lies, and Stereotypes: HIV Positive Black Women's Perspectives on HIV Stigma and the Need for Public Policy as HIV/AIDS Prevention Intervention
AN  - 887499955; 201118152
AB  - Despite startling rates of HIV among African American women -- it is the leading cause of death among women ages 25-34 years old -- HIV positive Black women's perspectives on prevention remain understudied. HIV Positive African American women's perspectives and stated concerns about effective HIV prevention, as informed by their lived experience and situated knowledge, were obtained in this study. Learning from these women, and giving attention to their lived experience and situated knowledge could help us improve and better understand HIV prevention challenges. Interview data was drawn on 30 HIV positive Black women in a Florida inner-city. The major finding suggests, that in addition to gender, race, and class oppression, stigma, stereotypes and ineffective public policies shape HIV prevention efforts. Another finding was relatively novel: Black women's strategies to subvert oppression can be dismantled by HIV/AIDS stigma, which alienate them from their symbiotic (sometimes life sustaining) "sista" circles; and the threat of being marginalized within a minority group can elicit a decision to forego HIV/AIDS prevention. Participants' experiences advocate for holistic social and structural prevention intervention (non-behavioral approaches) to HIV/AIDS. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Attitudes Towards Transracial Adoption: Measures and Correlates
AN  - 1018353976; 201212795
AB  - Scholars know little about attitudes toward transracial adoption, how to measure them, or why people hold the attitudes they do. We measure implicit and explicit attitudes towards transracial adoption. Explicit measures generally find support; implicit measures do not. We also look at correlations between transracial adoption attitudes and racial attitudes. These correlations vary for implicit and explicit measures. Racial bias is associated with explicit reluctance to adopt a black child. Color blindness, which we might expect to be correlated with positive attitudes toward transracial adoption, is associated with negative implicit evaluations of transracial families.

T1  - The Effects of citizenship dissimilarity and national pride on attitudes toward immigrants: Investigating mediators and moderators of intergroup contact
AN  - 822521913; 201072857
AB  - Building on research from organizational sociology and the contact hypothesis, we incorporated community characteristics to examine how coworker citizenship dissimilarity influences employees' attitudes towards immigrants. We also proposed that the nature of this relationship would depend on national pride. Results from a national survey (n = 559) indicated living with more immigrants in one's neighborhood corresponded in heightened citizenship dissimilarity at the workplace. It, in turn, corresponded in employees holding more favorable views of immigrants. This effect was the most pronounced for people with high levels of national pride because of the presumably increased opportunities to dispel their previously held negative stereotypes about out-group members.

T1  - Seeing for the state: the role of social scientists in China's ethnic classification project
AN  - 818801600; 201072312
AB  - This article proposes a new understanding of the Ethnic Classification project (minzu shibie) undertaken in China's southwesternmost province of Yunnan in 1954 - a project in which social scientists and Communist Party cadres set out to determine which of the dozens, if not hundreds, of minority communities in the province would be officially recognized by the state. Specifically, this article argues that ethnologists and linguists played a far greater role in the Classification and early Chinese Communist governmentality than is typically assumed. The Chinese Communists did not teach themselves how to 'see like a state,' to use James Scott's formulation, at least not when it came to the fundamentally important problem of ethnic categorization. To the contrary, the history of the Classification project is one of an inexperienced Chinese state that was able to orient itself only by observing the world through the eyes of its social scientific advisors. The 'mentality' within early Chinese Communist Party (CCP) 'governmentality' was, in the case of the 1954 Ethnic Classification, in large part the mentality of the comparative social sciences.

AB  - Racial and ethnic diversification is becoming increasingly evident in the American population and while not new, its present scope is greater in magnitude than in past eras. This diversification will likely impact, in particular, how race is conceptualized in the future and existing relations between racial and ethnic groups. A third possible impact-that American society will become post-racial-is considered and rejected because empirical evidence does not support this proposition. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Reasonable accommodation' in Quebec: the limits of participation and dialogue
AN  - 754044619; 201053351
AB  - This article explores the Bouchard-Taylor Commission, a 2007-8 government consultation that was established in Quebec to study interculturalism, secularism and national identity, in response to what had become known as the 'reasonable accommodation debates' on the extent to which minority and immigrant cultural practices could be accommodated. The focus of this exploration is on two aspects of the Commission: the citizens' forums that were a part of its deliberative process; and the ways in which it responded to the idea of crisis. Through an analysis of aspects of the Commission's final report, the ways in which the Commission was structured and the media representations of the Commission, this article argues that, despite the spirit of equality and fairness to which the commissioners were committed and the praise it received from some members of immigrant and minority groups, the Commission ended up reinforcing the racialised hierarchies and exclusions that it wanted to redress.

T1  - Assessing Human Capital Transferability into the U.S. Labor Market among Latino Immigrants to the United States
AN  - 754037233; 201049710
AB  - Scholars have questioned whether international migrants from Latin America are able to transfer their levels of education into the U.S. labor market. In this article, the author examines the data from the Latin American Migration Project for Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, & Nicaragua to observe the ability of each of the immigrant groups to convert prior education into occupational attainments within the U.S. labor market. Results show intercountry differences in the ability of the immigrants to translate educational attainments into occupational outcomes. Nicaraguans are by far the most educated & are much better able to translate home country schooling into highly skilled U.S. occupations. However, findings reveal that Nicaraguans have received more of an occupational benefit from having legal documents. The author argues that in addition to divergent patterns of educational selectivity, the contrasting treatment of Nicaraguans & Mexicans by U.S. immigration law seems to be responsible, at least in part, for their very different positions in the U.S. labor market.

T1  - Mediators of the Contact--Prejudice Relation among South African Students on Four University Campuses
AN  - 743066561; 201043377
AB  - Intergroup contact is undoubtedly associated with lower levels of self-reported prejudice. In some situations, however, contact may have little or no association with prejudice. Studies conducted in apartheid South Africa rarely found such an association. Apartheid was overturned in 1994, but there have been few explicit tests of the relationship since then. The present study explored the relation between contact and prejudice in a large (N= 2,599) and diverse nonprobability sample of South Africans. Participants were recruited from four universities. In addition, factors were explored that might modulate the contact--prejudice relation, or have independent effects. The relation between prejudice and contact was larger for affective prejudice (r^D#~ |.35|) than for social distance (r^D#~ |.2|). Analysis showed that the effects of contact were not reducible to those of other variables, although the contact--prejudice relation was mediated in many instances. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When Inequality Matters: The Effect of Inequality Frames on Academic Engagement
AN  - 743059294; 201044766
AB  - Research indicates that, among women and ethnic minorities, perceived inequality reduces the association between self-esteem and academic outcomes. The present studies demonstrate that the perception of social inequality does not always induce subordinate-group disengagement. Rather, inequality framed as dominant-group advantage allows subordinate groups to remain engaged and causes dominant groups to disengage. Experiments 1-3 demonstrate that academic inequality framed in terms of ingroup disadvantage causes Black, Latino, and female students to disengage, but inequality framed in terms of White or male advantage does not. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrate the same effect for Whites and men-inequality framed in terms of the ingroup (i.e., advantage) causes disengagement, but inequality framed as outgroup disadvantage does not.

T1  - ETHNIC SHOPKEEPERS IN U.S. CITIES IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY
AN  - 743055897; 201031576
AB  - The literature on retail entrepreneurship makes an important distinction between shopkeeping and petty trading. Building on this literature, the present study addresses two questions about retail enterprise in U.S. cities in the late nineteenth century: To what extent were retail entrepreneurs from the Southern, Central, and Eastern (SCE) European groups shopkeepers rather than petty traders? And which region of the country offered the best opportunities for retail entrepreneurs from these groups to become shopkeepers? Census data from 1900 show that: (1) retail entrepreneurs from these immigrant groups were more likely to be petty traders than shopkeepers; and (2) the opportunities for these entrepreneurs to become shopkeepers were greatest in the South, an emerging peripheral region with relatively small immigrant communities. These findings cast doubt on the conventional view that conditions in major northern cities bolstered shopkeeping among entrepreneurial groups, such as Russian and Polish Jews, in the late nineteenth century.

T1  - Discussing Depression with Vietnamese American Patients
AN  - 199541243; 19242803
AB  - Asian patients preferentially seek mental health care from their primary care providers but are unlikely to receive it. Primary care providers need culturally-informed strategies for addressing stigmatizing illnesses. Eleven Vietnamese American community members participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. The grounded theory approach was used for qualitative coding and thematic analysis. Vietnamese community members describe experiences with depression under four themes: 1. stigma and face, 2. social functioning and the role of the family, 3. traditional healing and beliefs about medications and 4. language and culture. Based on this data, we offer suggestions for improving culturally-informed care for Vietnamese Americans. Our study adds to the research aimed at improving communication and health care relationships between physicians and Vietnamese American patients. Physicians should learn to tailor their interviewing style to the increasingly diverse patient population.

T1  - Do People Who Like Diversity Practice Diversity in Neighbourhood Life? Neighbourhood Use and the Social Networks of 'Diversity-Seekers' in a Mixed Neighbourhood in the Netherlands
AN  - 60361345; 201011834
AB  - Urban policies in various countries aim at integrating minorities into mainstream society through combating residential segregation. One strategy is to change the housing stock. Assuming that the middle classes leave certain neighbourhoods because they lack suitable dwellings, building more expensive dwellings is an important policy trajectory in the Netherlands. However, living in the proximity of other income groups is in itself insufficient to overcome racial, ethnic and class divides in social networks. The usual policy indicator for defining 'middle class', e.g. income, is not a very good predictor for the diversity of networks of people living in mixed neighbourhoods. What, then, is? The first step is to ask what distinguishes people who prefer diverse neighbourhoods. Are people who are attracted by the diversity of an area different from others? Next, we question whether people who like diversity have more diversity in their networks or contribute in other ways to a more integrated neighbourhood through their use of it. We use social network data collected in a mixed inner-city neighbourhood in Rotterdam to explore this. We argue that attracting people to an area because of its diversity may contribute to the economic viability of local businesses and possibly to the nature of interactions in public space. However, we can not empirically substantiate that a preference for a diverse neighbourhood translates into distinct practices or social networks that enhance the integration of ethnic minorities into mainstream society.

T1  - Reassessing the Communist Takeover in Romania: Violence, Institutional Continuity, and Ethnic Conflict Management
AN  - 1928595768
AB  - This article analyzes the communist takeover in Romania as the successful outcome of a long-term policy aiming to make the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) a national force. Such an attempt deserves a new analytical explanation of the highly controversial notions of institutional continuity and of "nationalization" of its membership. While mainstream explanations still focus on factors of change motivated by external (Soviet) pressure and stress that violence, coercion, and intimidation have been main instruments used by the Communist Party to implement its goals, the author argues that a reevaluation of the real extent of popular support is needed. PCR became a national mass party immediately after the coup d'état of 23 August 1944. At that time a marginal political force, traditionally ruled by non-Romanian elements and devoted to the strictest internationalism, turned national without falling into discrimination against minority groups, with the exception of the Germans. In multiethnic Transylvania the ethnic power balance consciously created by PCR with Soviet assistance helped the party to strengthen its political legitimacy among different national and social groups. Unlike the Romanian historical parties and the Hungarian nationalists, the PCR and the Petru Groza--led coalition government behaved as a transnational body and pursued integrative policies. In the troubled context of postwar reconstruction, this call for cooperation and peaceful ethnic coexistence distinguished the PCR and its allies from the opposition parties and significantly contributed to make early communist rule more acceptable to large masses of Romanians and non-Romanians, as well.
