T1  - Formation and Benefits of Intercultural Friendships: The Role of Communication
AN  - 2686235427
AB  - This qualitative study provides novel insights into exploring factors that influence intercultural friendship formation and friendship benefits, focusing on the role of communication. A research gap has been addressed by focusing on Muslim women who wear the hijab and exploring what factors had influenced their friendship formation with people from culturally different backgrounds and what impact the friendship had on the self. Findings suggested that cultural, linguistic and religious similarity was deemed as not important for friendship formation. Instead, similar values, self-disclosure and respectful communication assisted intercultural friendship formation. Friendship barriers included cultural misconceptions and behavioral uncertainty. Clear evidence emerged that these intercultural friendships led to positive attitudinal changes of the individuals within and beyond the friendship. This included increased cultural understanding, acceptance and selfreflection. It was revealed that cultural misconceptions (and levels of Islamophobia) were eliminated and ethnocentrism was reduced.

T1  - Is Group-Directed Praise Always Welcome? Reactions to Ingroup and Outgroup Praise Depend on Linguistic Abstraction
AN  - 2560602870
AB  - This research examined how recipients reacted to group-directed praise formulated by ingroup or outgroup members and varying in linguistic abstraction. Study 1 (N = 81) showed that ingroup praise was perceived as more sincere when formulated in abstract (vs. concrete) terms, whereas outgroup praise formulated in abstract terms was seen as less sincere than concrete praise. In Study 2 (N = 89), recipients of outgroup praise formulated in abstract versus concrete terms attributed more hidden agenda and prejudice to the speaker, and perceived lower congruency between the speaker’s words and beliefs; the opposite pattern occurred for ingroup praise. Perceptions of congruency and hidden agenda mediated the effects of speaker group membership and linguistic abstraction on recipients’ perception of the praising message. This research points out that linguistic abstraction influences the appraisal of group-directed praise as it works as a cue of speakers’ motives. It also suggests important implications for developing successful communications between groups.

T1  - Direct and Moderating Effects of Sexual Minority Identity Dimensions on Mental Health
AN  - 2515169398
AB  - Sexual minorities experience minority stress, which is associated with mental health disparities. However, specific dimensions of identity may buffer against these disparities. While research in other stigmatized populations has found evidence for direct and moderating effects of identity on mental health, limited research has examined these dimensions in sexual minorities. We explored the potential direct and moderating effects of identity dimensions with regards to sexual stigma and mental health. Findings from 209 lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals revealed higher centrality of sexual orientation identity and more positive private regard predicted lower psychological distress and more positive private regard predicted higher self-esteem. Additionally, centrality moderated the effect of public stigma, such that those who reported higher centrality did not report decrements to self-esteem in the face of public stigma to the extent of those with low centrality. Findings suggest centrality and private regard contribute to the psychological wellbeing of sexual minorities.

T1  - Racism and nationalism during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2492800113
AB  - Racism and xenophobia associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic disproportionately affect migrants and minority groups worldwide. They exacerbate existing patterns of discrimination and inequity, impacting especially those already facing intersecting social, economic and health vulnerabilities. In this article, we explore the nature and extent of racism sparked by COVID-19. We briefly introduce the relationship between historical pandemics and racist sentiments and discuss ethnic and racial disparities in relation to COVID-19. We contextualize racism under COVID-19, and argue that an environment of populism, resurgent exclusionary ethno-nationalism, and retreating internationalism has been a key contributor to the flare-up in racism during the COVID-19. We then discuss links between racism, nationalism and capitalism, and consider what intercultural relations may look like in a post-outbreak world. We conclude by highlighting the potential effects of COVID-racism on intercultural relations, and the national and global implications for social policy.

T1  - Whose lives mattered? How White and Black Americans felt about Black Lives Matter in 2016
AN  - 2533412241
AB  - White Americans, on average, do not support Black Lives Matter, while Black Americans generally express strong support. The lack of support among white Americans is striking, and we argue that it matters why this racial gap exists. Using a nationally representative survey collected during the crest of the first wave of widespread attention to the movement, we explore four potential explanations for interracial differences in feelings toward Black Lives Matter. These explanations reflect competing claims made by advocates and opponents of the movement and have distinct implications for understanding the meaning of these racial differences. Two explanations focus on attitudes toward the police, and two focus on racial prejudice. The results suggest that interracial differences in contact with the police mattered to views of the movement, though in opposite ways for white and Black Americans. Support for the movement among Black Americans was not motivated by an animosity toward the police. Ultimately, the lack of white support for Black Lives Matter was best explained by anti-Black animus and racial resentment, reflecting a concern about the threat this contemporary civil rights movement presents to the racial status quo.

T1  - Restrictive borders and rights: attitudes of the Danish public to asylum seekers
AN  - 2352360563
AB  - Social mechanisms explaining Danes' attitudes to asylum seekers were analysed on two main dimensions: border control and rights allocation, in a national survey of 500 adult respondents in September 2013. Data show that the respondents supported exclusionary practices against asylum seekers much more than exclusion from rights. Three main mechanisms were simultaneously at play in both exclusionary dimensions: perceptions of threat, social distance (prejudice), and perceiving asylum seekers as not "genuine refugees". Identifying asylum seekers' as a security and socio-economic threat, as persons not in "real" fear of persecution, together with prejudicial attitudes to them had a boosting effect on excluding asylum seekers from the Danish collective in terms of entry and rights. Findings are discussed in light of existing theories on exclusionary attitudes to asylum seekers.

AB  - This article provides an introduction to the collection of short articles in recognition of the 25th anniversary of political scientist Michael C. Dawson's pioneering book, Behind the Mule: Race and Class in African-American Politics (Princeton 1994). Each article in this special Dialogues section uses data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) to help us understand the ways in which linked fate continues to be instrumental to the discipline of political science and the social sciences more broadly, as well as its limitations to our understanding of group identity in American political behavior and public opinion. This introduction also offers a brief overview of the articles included in this special PGI Dialogues section.

T1  - In the name of truth: People's reactions to ingroup and outgroup members who self-disclose a severe error
AN  - 2336248703
AB  - Usually people consider morality traits to be highly valuable, both in themselves and in others. Moreover, they tend to select moral groups and are often motivated to protect the positive identity of their groups by derogating immoral ingroup members. However, sometimes even moral ingroup members could represent a threat to the group and therefore be negatively evaluated, such as in the case of people who report another person's wrongdoing (whistleblowing). To date an investigation of people's judgments of someone who self- disclose his/her own wrongdoing is still missing. Our study aims to investigate how group members react to an ingroup and an outgroup member who confessed to having committed a severe wrongdoing. Results of a study conducted by using a real episode concerning a surgeon who confessed a fatal error, confirm our expectation; even if medical students appreciated the confession of the surgeon, they are less positive in evaluating his behavior compared to other students.

T1  - 'We can't just put any belly-dancer into the program': cultural activism as boundary work in the city of Bratislava
AN  - 2261199466
AB  - Festivals are an increasingly more popular form of contemporary cultural activism. Countering prejudice through arts, using culture as a tool of communication, and creating an opportunity for marginalised groups to participate in public life, they represent a specific and novel means of civic activism. In this paper, I introduce a case study of the multicultural festival [fjúzn], aiming to enhance the public visibility of 'new minorities' and bring attention to the ethnic and cultural diversity in the city of Bratislava, Slovakia. Building on a festival ethnography and drawing on the perspective of boundary work [Jaworsky, B. Nadya. 2016. The Boundaries of Belonging: Online Work of Immigration-related Social Movement Organizations. Palgrave Macmillan], I show how the festival organisers work towards crossing and blurring symbolic boundaries in society. I offer a close interpretive reading of their attempts at capturing public places and cultivating a diverse language-scape, while showing how they simultaneously maintain, solidify, or even inscribe new boundaries. I conclude by raising critical points about the potential of activist cultural festivals to shift symbolic boundaries in the long run and serve as tools of social inclusion.

T1  - Patriarchy, Cultural Prejudices and Spousal Violence in the Ancient City of Benin of Southern Nigeria
AN  - 2292912965
AB  - This paper examines the persistence of patriarchy and traditional cultural practices which have adverse effects on women's rights and health as well as the growing incidence of spousal violence in Benin City, arising from obvious internal and external factors of social changes. Extant literature has documented shifts in family roles and general social transformations in many first world nations as a result of modernization. Efforts to capture such changes within the African space is very minimal as of now. This paper attempts to explore the Benin society of Southern Nigeria, against the backdrop of the cascading effects of human trafficking and international migration that has largely impacted on the contemporary social structure of the ancient West African city. It addresses the nature of patriarchy in relation to Benin society, discusses some of the customs and traditions that have put women in positions of inferiority. This paper concludes that patriarchy, and other cultural prejudices have the potentialities of further deepening the incidences of spousal abuse and family disorganization if efforts are not made to abolish all harmful cultural practices and enforce the legal provisions which protect women's rights and general wellbeing.

T1  - Examining the racial-ethnic continuum and perceptions of police misconduct
AN  - 2258621443
AB  - Some research suggests a racial-ethnic hierarchy exists as to perceptions of police, with African-Americans exhibiting the most negative attitudes, Whites the most positive, and Hispanics holding more intermediate attitudes. Other findings regarding Hispanics are less consistent and little study has been made of Asians. This study further tests the premise for such a hierarchy by examining the views of both Hispanics and Asians alongside those of African-Americans and Whites as they relate to police misconduct. Partial support for a hierarchy of attitudes was found, with Hispanics exhibiting the hypothesised intermediate attitudes. While race remained an important factor for explaining African-Americans' attitudes, other factors ultimately better explained Hispanics' attitudes. The attitudes of Asians were indistinguishable from those of Whites. These findings suggest the experiences of racial-ethnic groups widely vary and the premise of a racial-ethnic continuum may be too simplistic for understanding the attitudes of Asians and Hispanics.

T1  - When Essentialism Facilitates Intergroup Conflict Resolution: The Positive Role of Perspective-Taking
AN  - 2205312158
AB  - Essentialism, a fundamental belief of the fixedness of social group essences, is often associated with negative intergroup outcomes. However, research is yet to explore the role of essentialism in intergroup conflicts, despite their prevalence. To address this gap, we conducted the first direct examination on how essentialism influences conflict management toward out-group members. Moreover, we examined perspective-taking as a positive factor in improving conflict management among essentialist individuals relative to their non-essentialist counterparts in intergroup contexts. Results across three experiments provided little support to the negative effect of essentialism on intergroup (vs. intragroup) conflict management. Yet, we found that perspective-taking promoted the use of problem solving and improved one’s own gain and the dyad’s joint gain among essentialist individuals, but not non-essentialist individuals, in intergroup (vs. intragroup) conflict situations. This research suggests that when coupled with perspective-taking, essentialism can promote constructive conflict resolution in intergroup contexts.

T1  - Racial Attitudes and Health Care Policy Opinion: An Anglx–Latinx Contrast
AN  - 2138652661
AB  - Recent studies confirm that Anglxs’ racial attitudes can shape their opinions about the Affordable Care Act (ACA), particularly when this federal health care policy is linked to Barack Obama. Strong linkages made between Obama and the ACA cue Anglxs to apply their racialized feelings toward Obama to their health policy preferences. This is consistent with a growing body of research demonstrating that “racial priming” can have a powerful impact on Anglxs’ political opinions. Yet few studies have explored racialized policy opinion among minorities, and fewer still have explored racial priming among Latinxs. In this paper, we compare the effect of racial priming on the health policy preferences of Latinxs and Anglxs. Using survey evidence from the 2012 American National Election Study, we find important Anglx–Latinx differences in racialized policy preferences. However, we also find that racial priming has an effect on U.S.-born Latinxs that closely resembles its effect on Anglxs. Results suggest that increasing ethnic diversity in the United States will not necessarily produce increasingly liberal politics as many believe. American politics in the coming decades will depend largely on the ways in which Latinxs’ racial sympathies and resentments are mobilized.

T1  - Thinking through race: white racial identity, motivated cognition and the unconscious maintenance of white supremacy
AN  - 2571083861
AB  - Recent research in political science has demonstrated the effects of implicit racism on whites’ political preferences and judgments. One startling finding from this research is that even white people who think of themselves as racially egalitarian can be influenced by implicit racism without intention or awareness. While this research has been useful for identifying the ways in which whites’ unconscious biases influence political decision-making, it leaves open the questions of how and why unconscious, yet racially motivated political cognition takes place. In this paper, I offer a theoretical model of white racial reasoning, during which whites think through their racial identity, interpreting and evaluating phenomena in the social environment in ways that allow them to protect a positive sense of self and racial group. I argue that well-meaning whites’ identity investments, and not antipathy toward outgroup members, drives cognitive processing and the political judgments that result. I conclude the paper with research-based strategies for political actors hoping to help whites resist racially coded appeals and encourage more egalitarian political judgments.

T1  - The Co-Evolution of Education and Tolerance: Evidence from England
AN  - 2430651377
AB  - Using data from several periods of English history and building on the literature on culture and institutions, we analyze the co-evolution of education and attitudes toward women’s and minority rights. First, we establish a strong association between the size of twenty-first-century educational institutions in a given location and the attitudes prevalent there: the proximity of a large college or university is associated with individual support for women’s and minority rights, regardless of whether the individual has been to university. Second, we present evidence for high inter-temporal persistence in the geographical variation in the density of educational institutions over several centuries. Third, we show that the geographical distribution of later educational institutions depends not only on the distribution of medieval institutions, but also on correlates of medieval exposure to ethnic and religious diversity that are likely to have influenced attitudes. Institutions and culture co-evolve, and the inter-temporal persistence of the density of educational institutions is one mechanism (though probably not the only one) that explains the association between medieval exposure to diversity and twenty-first-century attitudes.

T1  - Intergroup contact versus conflict in Catalan high schools: A multilevel analysis of adolescent attitudes toward immigration and diversity
AN  - 2085137629
AB  - Western educational systems are often insufficiently prepared for the ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity resulting from immigration. In Catalonia, one of the wealthiest regions of Spain, a diverse, recent, and large-scale immigration coincides with a popular nationalist movement and increasingly salient national identifications. Focusing on a context where ethnic, national, religious, and linguistic divisions intersect daily, our aim was to determine if both beneficial and detrimental effects of intergroup contact exist by measuring three separate dependent variables, xenophobia, appreciation of diversity, and attitudes toward immigrant rights, among native (n = 1219) and nonnative (n = 379) students during their last year of compulsory education (10th grade). Multilevel modeling, with students nested within 82 classrooms in 30 high schools throughout Catalonia, revealed effects of national identifications, frequency of contact, socioeconomic status, and classroom ethnic composition. Results provide strong support for intergroup contact theory in that classrooms with higher proportions of immigrant students demonstrated less xenophobia and more positive attitudes towards immigrant rights overall. Implications of classroom characteristics were qualified by national identification and intergroup interactions. Simultaneously, modest detrimental implications of intergroup contact were unveiled in that higher proportions of immigrants in a classroom predicted lower appreciation of diversity; immigrants were more likely to embrace diversity when they were a minority in the classroom, though native and immigrant students were both low on appreciation of diversity in majority-immigrant classrooms. Findings also highlight the critical importance of national identification in a context where national identities are often contested.

T1  - Stereotypes as Pseudocontingencies
AN  - 2025287184
AB  - We introduce a heuristic called pseudocontingencies (PCs) as an alternative account of various stereotyping phenomena. PCs give rise to the expectation that attributes are correlated based solely on asymmetries in attribute base rates. Attributes that are encountered frequently and attributes that are encountered rarely are perceived to be correlated with each other. Such differences in information densities are typical of many stereotyped targets, including the self vs. others, the in-group vs. out-groups and majority vs. minority groups. Evidence is reviewed for PCs underlying illusory correlations, confirmation biases, gender stereotypes, Simpson's paradox, and in procedures used for implicit stereotype measurement. PCs are shown to predict specific patterns of self-enhancement and self-depreciation, the effects of intergroup contact on in-group biases and the readiness to infer stereotypes from aggregated "big-data". Although PCs can lead to seriously flawed stereotypic expectations, they afford an efficient and possibly adaptive inference strategy.

AB  - A strain of racist, xenophobic populism is sweeping through many democracies, jumping from the fringes of political discourse to the mainstream. Understanding how Donald Trump was able to take power while making explicitly racist appeals is vital to understanding this phenomenon. This article examines the 2016 Republican primary, drawing on data from the National Election Study pilot survey to explore how, and why some voters favored Trump over other Republicans. Were Trump voters reacting to the adverse economic effects of globalization, or the 2008 financial crisis? Were they traditional "Southern Strategy" Republicans? Were they white nationalists? While I find evidence that negative attitudes toward Hispanic-Americans, Muslim-Americans, and African Americans strongly predict favorability to Trump, I also find that hostile attitudes toward minority groups are not as strongly concentrated as a "white nationalism" interpretation would conclude. Rather than a single "basket" of racially anxious voters, Trump was able to appeal to a grab-bag of people with distinct anxieties. Insofar as one might be interested in defusing populism, there may not be a single solution, but rather multiple ones aimed at mobilizing diverse targets of racism.

T1  - "If You Don't Like Gay Marriage, Don't Get One!": A Qualitative Analysis of Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage in South Australia
AN  - 1969031779
AB  - Prejudice against sexual-minority groups has continuously declined in Australia over the past several decades, yet inequality in marriage policy that denies legal recognition of same-sex relationships remains. Social role theory suggests this may be due in part to traditional beliefs about gender roles that fuel concerns regarding the ability of same-sex couples to raise children because they violate these social norms and roles. The current study identified reasons behind support of, or opposition to, same-sex marriage. Data were collected from a community sample (n = 536) in South Australia through an open-ended question included on a larger survey. Content analysis suggested that gender role norms do play a part in negative attitudes toward same-sex marriage as well as perceptions of same-sex couples' ability to raise children. Our findings also revealed heteronormativity embedded in the responses of participants both for and against marriage equality. Implications for advocacy efforts focused on marriage equality, parenting by same-sex couples, and the focus for future research endeavours in this substantive domain are discussed.

T1  - Is Blindness Contagious? Examining Racial Attitudes among People of Color with Close Interracial Relationships
AN  - 1934858291
AB  - Are people of color with close relationships with whites more likely to embrace colorblind racial ideologies (CBRI)? Using restricted data from waves 1 and 2 of the Portraits of American Life Study (N = 2,713), collected in 2006 and 2012, we test whether black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents are more likely to express colorblind racial attitudes if they have an intimate partner or close friends who are white. We use ordinal logit models to examine seven CBRI attitudinal items, controlling for the respondent's socioeconomic characteristics, immigrant generation, national origin, gender, age, characteristics of the city, and region. Although black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents are less likely to express CBRI than whites are, respondents of color with close relationships with whites are more likely to minimize certain types of racism, even after controlling for other characteristics of the individual. We discuss the implications of these findings, considering the patterns of antiblack and anti-immigrant attitudes among groups of color and placing them in the context of the more negative attitudes often expressed by whites. We also describe how other demographic patterns in these attitudes could shape future trends in attitudes and suggest possible interventions.

T1  - Race, class, politics, and the disappearance of work: a rejoinder
AN  - 1906151500
AB  - I very much appreciate Jennifer Hochschild’s thoughtful commentary on my article, “When Work Disappears: New Implications for Race and Urban Poverty in the Global Economy” (1999). She focuses on two important areas that, in her judgment, were not sufficiently addressed in my article, namely a “comparative analysis of the impact of collective joblessness across racial and ethnic groups”, and the “political impact of sustained and concentrated joblessness”. I welcome the opportunity to respond directly to her arguments.

T1  - Intergenerational negotiations on (hetero)sexuality and romantic relationships - views of young people and parents in multi-ethnic contexts
AN  - 1886292855
AB  - This article focuses on intergenerational negotiations on young people's (13-19 years) sexuality and romantic relationships in families where one or both of the parents have migrated to Finland. By utilising the theoretical framework of intersectionality and negotiability of family relationships, we seek to diversify the often problem-oriented and culture-related examinations of ethnic minority families and young people's position in them. Methodologically, we draw on interview data relating to both young people and parents. In addition to the vast heterogeneity in practices and ideals, the analysis shows that while conflicts and miscommunication between generations do occur, the intergenerational negotiations for the most part are described as consensual and based on trust. Young people are allotted considerable agency by their parents, and also demonstrate a high degree of agency, whether they are complying with their parents' views or questioning them. Their negotiations also reflect and are conditioned by their position in the hierarchies of Finnish society.

T1  - Don't Read This: One Higher Education Administrator's Perspective on the Urgency of Emptiness and Social Justice
AN  - 2116060480
AB  - Mistler shared his perspective on the urgency of emptiness and social justice as a higher education administrator. He said that he was writing based on his own perspective and not speak for any group, r ace, class, gender or otherwise. He noted that he s till feel like an outsider himself even if he is readily identified by others as a member of the visible majority group. It is clear that issues faced by some groups are more dangerous, more pervasive and very urgent, while no group is immune to being the target of prejudice or unjust discrimination. He highlighted the need to cultivate the various practices of developing emptiness and receptivity toward voluntary giving away power and possession once a person realized that holding on to fractured/fracturing identities destroys environmental-peace, bodily-peace and inner-peace.

T1  - Race/Ethnicity and Justice in Academia
AN  - 1891794967
AB  - Race and ethnicity are common themes in criminology and criminal justice. Research has consistently shown that African Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities, such as Latinos, are overrepresented as victims and offenders in violent crime when compared to Caucasians (Sampson, Morenoff, & Raudenbush, 2005). Consequently, they are also overrepresented in the arrestee and prison populations (Walker, Spohn, & DeLone, 2012.) Relatedly, studies have also demonstrated an intersectionality effect in which race, ethnicity, gender, and social class affect criminal behavior and the response by criminal justice agencies (Barak, Flavin, * Leighton, 2001; Spohn & Holleran, 2000). Specifically, African American males who are of low economic standing are more likely to be victims and offenders of crime and are also more likely to be represented in criminal justice agencies as arrestees and inmates. Given the importance of race and ethnicity, criminologists spend a lot of time examining how these variables affect criminal behavior, victimization, and the response by criminal justice institutions, and a plethora of research has accumulated that explore these issues and their consequences.

T1  - The Connection Between Racist Discourse, Resettlement Policy and Outcomes in Australia
AN  - 1922436912
AB  - The influence of ultranationalist political parties and calls for culturally homogeneous societies are on the rise in Western democracies. This paper examines the connection between rising exclusionary narratives, resettlement policy and practices, and subsequent resettlement outcomes for refugee migrants. Analysis of empirical evidence from a recently released survey of humanitarian migrants demonstrates how Australian social structures and institutional practices thwart the social and economic inclusion of refugee migrants admitted for settlement in Australia. I argue that, despite evidence of these systemic flaws, the Australian Government is unwilling to address these issues and instead scapegoats individuals and minority groups for their asserted inability or unwillingness to adopt Australian values. Such action risks deepening exclusionary spaces among resettled refugee migrants and inciting intolerant public voices.

T1  - Feminist Identity, Feminist Politics: U.S. Feminists' Attitudes toward Social Policies
AN  - 1933766384
AB  - Feminist scholars and activists have endorsed a broad and intersectional political agenda that addresses multiple dimensions of inequality, such as gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, and class. We examine whether or not this perspective is also held by self-identified feminists in the general public. Drawing on public opinion polls from 2007 to 2009, we assess self-identified feminists' attitudes toward a range of social policies. We find that after controlling for sociodemographic factors and political ideology, feminist identity is associated with progressive attitudes on policies related to gender and sexuality (e.g., abortion) as well as policies related to other social justice issues (e.g., immigration, health care). We also find some interactions between feminist identity and gender, age, education, and political ideology, suggesting some heterogeneity in feminists' political attitudes. Overall, these findings suggest that feminists in the general public support an intersectional social justice agenda rather than a narrow focus on gender issues.

AN  - 1907273142
AB  - This article is concerned with the experience of children whose parents are highly mobile professionals, also known as 'Third Culture Kids' (TCKs). Through a focus on everyday practices and local emplacement, it shows how the cities of Melbourne and Singapore influence TCKs' individual trajectories and complex forms of identification. By observing their engagement, or lack thereof, with the local majority population, the article demonstrates how ethnicity, among other factors, influences their experience of place and position of privilege. Participants learn to negotiate 'national' and 'international' elements of culture by drawing on social distance, international networks, language skills and geographic mobility.

T1  - The opportunities and challenges of diversity: Explaining its impact on individuals and groups
AN  - 1891309316
AB  - Demographic trends reveal that modern societies have become increasingly diverse. Within the social sciences, these changes have been reflected in concerns about the implications of social diversity. Although early research noted that diversity may have negative consequences for societies and individuals, more recent scholarship has indicated that diversity is not always translated into negative outcomes. These inconsistent findings initiated a scholarly debate concerning the impact of many different forms of diversity for a host of social outcomes. It is now clear that the boundary conditions of these effects are yet to be fully understood. This Special Issue offers a collection of research advances identifying mediating and moderating variables addressing when and why diversity impacts intergroup relational outcomes. By focusing on different levels of diversity (i.e., in the society and in groups), this research also sheds light on the effectiveness of ideologies and policies for managing diversity.

T1  - Crossing the communication divide: Intergroup contact and the desire to learn the outgroup's language
AN  - 1829438208
AB  - This paper explores the role of ethnolinguistic vitality and intergroup contact in changing attitudes and the interest to learn Hungarian among Slovak-speaking secondary school students in Southern Slovakia (N = 225). Several indirect paths linking the all these variables were found. In general, lower local ethnolinguistic vitality of Hungarian decreased intergroup anxiety and increased the quality of contact with members of the Hungarian minority, which led to a more positive attitude toward the Hungarian minority, and enhanced the interest to learn Hungarian.

T1  - Endorsement of Polyculturalism Predicts Increased Positive Intergroup Contact and Friendship across the Beginning of College
AN  - 1817457848
AB  - U.S. universities are increasingly racially/ethnically diverse, offering students opportunities for positive, proactive intergroup interactions. However, not all students take advantage of these opportunities, making it important to understand what factors contribute to intergroup contact and friendship. In the current longitudinal investigation with 329 undergraduates at a diverse, mid-sized, public university in the Northeastern U.S., we examined the role of polyculturalism, which is the belief that diverse racial/ethnic groups have throughout history interacted and exchanged with each other, thereby influencing each other's cultures over time. We found that greater endorsement of polyculturalism before the start of college prospectively predicted increases in intergroup contact and friendship from spring of first year to fall of second year, controlling for endorsement of multiculturalism, colorblindness, and egalitarianism before the start of college. Findings suggest polyculturalism deserves further attention in research and might be useful for interventions, programs, and policies aimed at fostering positive intergroup interactions.

T1  - Voting and the Scottish referendum: perspectives of people with intellectual disabilities and their family and paid carers
AN  - 1816899881
AB  - Voting is a human right for every citizen yet many people with intellectual disabilities do not vote or have little support to exercise their right to vote. This article explores views on the wider aspects of voting against the backdrop of the Scottish referendum using focus groups involving people with intellectual disabilities (n = 12), family carers (n = 7) and paid carers (n = 5). Findings revealed that people with intellectual disabilities had similar concerns to the general population about the referendum. Regarding voting, all groups identified the need to discuss issues and for practical support and accessible information to ensure informed choices were made when voting.

T1  - The Political Ecology of Resource-based Inter-ethnic Violence: The Case of the Jarso and the Girhi in Eastern Ethiopia
AN  - 1809129920
AB  - This article discusses factors that shaped the initiation and escalation of the Jarso-Girhi violence that occurred two decades ago. The data required for the study were collected from community leaders, ordinary members of the communities, and administrative and political officers. The data were collected through one-on-one interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. The study shows that the inter-communal violence was the result of convergence and interaction between historical, ethnopolitical, sociocultural and psychosocial factors. The study reveals the impact of ethnically based mobilization in stoking underlying communal cleavages, in breaking trust and cooperation and in escalating communal unrests. The violence featured dynamics of ethnic competition and destruction in which ethnic competitors failed to minimize mutual harms and maximize mutual gains.

T1  - The Reverse Gender Gap in Ethnic Discrimination: Employer Stereotypes of Men and Women with Arabic Names,: IMR
AN  - 1797820151
AB  - We examine differences in the intensity of employer stereotypes of men and women with Arabic names in Sweden by testing how much work experience is needed to eliminate the disadvantage of having an Arabic name on job applications. Employers are first sent curriculum vitaes (CVs) of equal merit in a field experiment setup. Arabic-named CVs are thereafter enhanced with more relevant work experience than Swedish-named CVs. The results indicate a reverse gender gap in employer stereotypes because initial differences in the number of callbacks disappear for female applicants when Arabic-named CVs are enhanced but remain strong and significant for male applicants. Thus, contrary to what is often assumed about the interaction of gender and ethnicity, we find that Arabic men face stronger discrimination in the labor market than Arabic women.

T1  - Cultural Integration in the Muslim Second Generation in the Netherlands: The Case of Gender Ideology: IMR
AN  - 1774536462
AB  - In the Netherlands, relations between Muslims and non-Muslims have become polarized around issues of religion and gender. On the basis of a dataset with 669 parent-child dyads, we assess attitudes among the second generation concerning the gendered division of paid work and family responsibilities, that is, gender ideology, as compared to their parents. The aggregate picture indicates movement toward more egalitarian attitudes, indicating mainstream assimilation. At the same time, a sizable subgroup turns out to be more traditional than their parents, indicative of reactive ethnicity. Embeddedness in the ethnic community and education are shown to explain part of these divergent patterns.

T1  - Gender Differences in Intimate Partner Homicides Among Ethnic Sub-Groups of Asians
AN  - 1770927581
AB  - This study explored differences in intimate partner homicides (IPHs) among Asian Americans. Data from newspapers and femicide reports by different state coalitions on 125 intimate partner killings occurring between 2000 and 2005 were analyzed. Men were the perpetrators in nearly 9 out of 10 cases of Asian IPHs. Gender differences were found in ages of victims and perpetrators, types of relationship between partners, and methods of killing. Most homicides occurred among South-east Asians, and East Asians had the highest within-group proportion of suicides. The findings call for culturally competent risk assessment and intervention strategies to prevent IPHs among at-risk Asian Americans. [web URL: http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/22/4/432.abstract]

AN  - 1868945057
AB  - The United States has had a wavering acceptance of immigrants throughout its history, from eager invitations to violent and immediate forced removals. Presently, immigrants from Central America are in the spotlight, who have been dehumanized into that of the "other" and subjected to harsh deportation and criminal proceedings as a result of these perceptions. This article will show that 'othering' immigrants has been a part of restrictive immigration policy since the origins of the United States, continuing to present day by the following: 1) "othering" is explained in application to undocumented immigrants in America; 2) a history of US deportation policy is discussed in order to provide a context to the deep-seated tendency of "othering" in the US; 3) recent federal U.S. policies are introduced, examining the constant presence of "othering" unauthorized immigrants, with a primary focus on the Secure Communities program; 4) the widespread phenomenon of "othering" is discussed, both in the US and internationally, as well as the current state of the "alien other" in American political discourse.

T1  - The specter of discrimination: Fear of interpersonal racial discrimination among adolescents in Chicago
AN  - 1764861552
AB  - This analysis examines fear of interpersonal racial discrimination among Black, Hispanic, and White adolescents. The extent and correlates of these concerns are examined using survey data from the Project for Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Borrowing from the fear-of-crime literature, the contact hypothesis, and group threat theory, several hypotheses are developed linking discrimination fear to direct personal experience with discrimination, indirect or vicarious experience, and environmental signals of discrimination. Results show that about half of Blacks and Hispanics have feared discrimination in the past year. Multivariate results indicate that fear is most likely if one has experienced victimization first-hand and when one's parent is affected by discrimination. Further, a larger presence neighborhood outgroups produces greater fear. Overall, discrimination fear constitutes an additional obstacle for minority adolescents as they transition to adulthood. The phenomenon warrants increased scholarly attention and represents a fruitful avenue for future research.

T1  - One Size May Not Fit All: The Need for a More Inclusive and Intersectional Psychological Science on Stigma
AN  - 1719467689
AB  - In their review, Remedios and Snyder ( 2015 ) articulated how models of stigma fall short of explaining stigmatization of women of color, because they do not consider intersectionality of multiple stigmatized identities. Using the example of the intersection of race and gender, they reviewed literature on how targets of stigma detect and respond to prejudice (making prejudice attributions, the role of identity processes such as centrality), highlighting the complexity of these processes once multiple identities (namely non-prototypical categories of race and gender) are considered. In response, we provide more in depth discussion of the challenges to inclusion and intersectionality including current and traditional psychological science approaches and the perceived politicization of intersectional research, as well as the complexity of integrating multiple identities (social class, sexual orientation and gender diversity) into stigma research, including recruitment, measurement, and analysis. We offer practical suggestions in the areas of recruitment, measurement, and analysis, to facilitate more inclusive and intersectional research, given that such work would provide a more complete understanding of the experience of stigma.

T1  - The Cost of Color: Skin Color, Discrimination, and Health among African-Americans
AN  - 1732098336
AB  - In this study, the author uses a nationally representative survey to examine the relationship(s) between skin tone, discrimination, and health among African-Americans. He finds that skin tone is a significant predictor of multiple forms of perceived discrimination (including perceived skin color discrimination from whites and blacks) and, in turn, these forms of perceived discrimination are significant predictors of key health outcomes, such as depression and self-rated mental and physical health. Intraracial health differences related to skin tone (and discrimination) often rival or even exceed disparities between blacks and whites as a whole. The author also finds that self-reported skin tone, conceptualized as a form of embodied social status, is a stronger predictor of perceived discrimination than interviewer-rated skin tone. He discusses the implications of these findings for the study of ethnoracial health disparities and highlights the utility of cognitive and multidimensional approaches to ethnoracial and social inequality.

T1  - Managers are potential levers of discrimination within organizations: the role of group identification, assimilation endorsement and power
AN  - 1699176758
AB  - Two studies examined the relationship between identification with a high-position group in organizational settings (managers) and bias toward immigrants. In Study 1, (N=182; N=145), results showed positive relationships between identification with the managers' group and both in-group bias and prejudiced attitudes, indirectly through assimilation endorsement. In Study 2 (N=117), in addition to replicating the results of Study 1, we found a significant interaction, revealing that power moderated the link between identification with a high-position group and bias. Moderated mediation analysis indicated that linking managers' group identification to bias and prejudiced attitudes through assimilation was only significant for high perceived power. Results are discussed in light of interethnic ideologies and the social identity theory. Some practical implications are provided.

T1  - Decolonizing Britain and Domesticating Women: Race, Gender, and Women's Work in Post-1945 British Decolonial and Metropolitan Liberal Reform Discourses: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1765993414
AB  - This article deploys an intersectional, transnational, and postcolonial approach to uncovering what is repressed and connoted in recent pronouncements that multiculturalism in Britain has failed and that it is time for Britain to return to a lost, indigenous, "active, muscular liberalism," one that must now reassert its authority at home and abroad. To grasp what is at stake in calls for the reinvigoration of an active, muscular liberalism as simultaneously the indigenous personality and identity of not only the British "people" and nation, but indelibly of the West, they must be located within the history of British colonialism and its intersections with white, Western, imperial patriarchy. This article does so by explicating the intersections of gender, race, and class in the post-1945 double-inscription of metropole and colony in British liberalizing social reform and national reconstruction projects, symbolized by two major British government reports published in the 1940s. These are the Moyne Report (GBCO 1945), which shaped the transition of Britain's Caribbean territories from colonial to independent nations, and the Beveridge Report (Beveridge 1942), which shaped the modern British welfare state. What becomes apparent in both reports is how ethnically and racially differentiated categories of women were produced, targeted, and deployed in British metropolitan and colonial state discourses concerning the management of women and reform of racial rule at home and abroad.

T1  - From Sex to Gender: A University Intervention to Reduce Sexism in Argentina, Spain, and El Salvador
AN  - 1634405018
AB  - We present an intervention to reduce gender prejudice in future professionals of social sciences in three samples from Argentina (N = 28), Spain (N = 83), and El Salvador (N = 67), with slight differences across countries. The program was based on scientific research on sexism and gender-based power aimed at: (1) increasing awareness of gender inequalities; (2) reducing sexism in men and women; (3) providing participants with resources to implement social interventions. First the intervention is described, and then empirical evidence of its efficacy is provided. Results showed a reduction of benevolent sexism (BS), hostile sexism (HS), and essentialist views, and higher support for collective actions in Argentina (Study 1). HS and system-justifying beliefs were reduced and support for collective action increased in Spain (Study 2). In El Salvador, HS, BS (marginally), system-justifying, and homophobic beliefs were reduced (Study 3). Implications for interventions and policy making are discussed.

T1  - Racially Charged Legislation and Latino Health Disparities: The Case of Arizona's S.B. 1070
AN  - 1667952143; 201509411
AB  - Researchers have established that minority groups tend to suffer worse health outcomes compared to their white counterparts, though the specific mechanisms at play are still under investigation. The passing of Arizona's 2010 'Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act,' commonly referred to as 'S.B. 1070,' provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of an increasingly racially charged milieu on Latino health. Using the Arizona sample of the 2009-2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we find that the changing social setting around S.B. 1070 is related to poorer Latino self-reported health, but only for those whose primary language is Spanish. Furthermore, serving as control groups, we find no such relationship in other U.S.-Mexico border states that had no analogous legislation (Texas, New Mexico, and California). We expand on stress process theory and group position theory to explain this increase in Arizona's negative health reporting, despite traditional social and economic protective factors. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Organized crime and group-based ideology: The association between masculine honor and collective opposition against criminal organizations
AN  - 1700674062; 201524908
AB  - What is the role of culture in establishing young people's pathways into gang membership? Italian criminal organizations (COs) exhibit adherence to codes of honor and masculinity, important values in the context where they originated. Here it is proposed that the embedding of these values at an individual level may lessen young people's group-based opposition to such organizations, and indirectly, create a space in which such organizations can persist and recruit. In a study of young Southern Italians (N = 176; Mage = 16.17), we found that those who endorsed ideological beliefs related to the honorableness of male violence reported lower intentions to engage in antimafia activities. Consistent with the hypothesized mechanisms, this relationship was mediated by more positive attitudes toward COs, and lower reported vicarious shame in relation to the activities of COs. Directions for future research and implications for research on gangs are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - From Favourites to 'With No Return': Permanence and Mobility of Latin American Immigration in Spain during the 21st Century
AN  - 1635422336
AB  - Cet article a pour but, d'analyser d'abord les raisons qui sous-tendent la montée de l'immigration latino-américaine vers l'Espagne durant la période 2000-2013 et, ensuite d'expliquer pourquoi ce groupe persiste à rester dans ce pays malgré l'intensité de la crise économique et la destruction massive de l'emploi. Il démontre qu'autant les raisons de rester en Espagne que celles de se délocaliser, sont influencées, non seulement par le cycle économique, mais aussi le degré d'intégration accomplie par ce groupe, ainsi que par d'autres facteurs en rapport avec le contexte de leur pays d'origine.              Other international legal rules that kept that pre-eminence for certain chosen countries were added to the regularization policies favouring permanence of Latin Americans. That preferential choice was materialised in the establishment of bilateral agreements for annual quotas of workers'0 and in the imposition of visas. The aim was to select the nationalities settling in Spain and to control migration flows. When visas were imposed on Colombia and Ecuador (2001 and 2003), the inflow dropped, but the majority of immigrants had already entered into Spain, and the inertia of family regrouping completed the large stock. A similar case was that of the visas being imposed on Bolivians in 2007, when it was already impossible to control the inflow. In the case of Latin American immigration, the economic factors, such as the housing boom and the informal economy in the sectors of construction, agriculture, and above all, domestic work, were added to the weakness of external controls and the clear religious and cultural preference shown by public opinion towards these 'descendants and colonised,' as well as their fast rate of absorption (naturalisation, language, religion) and their make-up (féminisation and family), which favours integration. Neither social cohesion, nor public expense on integration was thought to be costly or difficult. The 'family centredness' and the Catholicism of Spanish society formed the cement and the foundation of social acceptance.              This is reflected in the attitudes and policies with respect to the copious immigration of the first decade of the 21st century. The most consistent opinion poll data show that Spain's social acceptance was greater in terms of cultural assimilation than in adequacy of employment. In more social-scientific terms, the majority of Spanish people cared more about religion, language, customs and the ethnic appearance of the immigrants than about their social class. It was not for nothing that the most popular question in the last surveys by the CIS (2001 and 2012) showed that the main requirement to facilitate immigrants' entry in Spain was that 'they are willing to adopt the country's way of life,' with an average of 8.0 on a scale of 0 to 10. The second most popular requirement for opening the doors to them was that 'they had a work qualification that Spain needed,' with an average value of 7.4 in 2011. And it is precisely in these historical and cultural preferences where Latin American immigration has a legal and social advantage. The different concentrations and settlement patterns of the immigrant communities show their adjustment to the community diversity in Spain. The 'Spanish' model of immigrant integration is not so much legal and political, but more geared towards fitting in within the diversity puzzle.

T1  - Diversity and the Civic Spirit in British Neighbourhoods: An Investigation with MCDS and EMBES 2010 Data
AN  - 1692290958; 201521350
AB  - Recently, there has been a proliferation of studies investigating the relationship between diversity and outcomes such as social cohesion and civic mindedness. This article addresses several common problems in this field and, using data for British neighbourhoods, elaborates on the experiences of both white British and ethnic minority respondents. We conclude that, if anything, diversity should be encouraged to cement the integration progress of migrants and foster stronger identification with Britain in the second generation. Deprivation at the neighbourhood level along with individual factors such as fear of crime is a much stronger predictor of deterioration of the civic spirit than diversity. Bridging contacts have the expected strong positive association with cohesion outcomes; and contrary to policy concerns no strong negative impact is observed for associational bonding among minority ingroupers.

T1  - Bridging the Race Barrier: Between 'Sakai' and 'Malay' in the Census Categorisations of British Malaya
AN  - 1660024515; 201505709
AB  - Racial boundary-making has been an oft highlighted theme in the study of colonialism. The most overt symbol of British attempts to make sense of the peoples in the Malay Peninsula is the classification of people according to 'race' in the censuses conducted during the colonial period. Drawing on studies of censuses which aim to denaturalise essentialised racial categories, I aim to complicate the depiction of British categorisation in order to show that races and the social identities on which they were based were not static by discussing the gradations incorporated into the census between 'Sakai', the indigenous peoples, and 'Malays', the main native group in Malaya. Introduced in 1911, the category of 'tame Sakai' was a way of quantifying individuals who could not be categorised as either indigenous or Malay. In the process, however, the factors for inclusion in the original Malay and aboriginal categories themselves became subject to debate. Though in many instances racial classification amounted to a rigidifying of identities, the case of 'tame Sakai' highlights an instance of uncertain categorisation which was outwardly acknowledged within the census. The various discourses pulling at the Sakai category show races not as ideal existing types of humans, but as a complex and sometimes contradictory manner of understanding people in Malaya. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What Does National Resilience Mean in a Democracy? Evidence from the United States and Israel
AN  - 1728662493; 201534635
AB  - Given various challenges to national security in democracies, such as terrorism and political violence, a growing need for reconceptualization of the term 'resilience' emerges. The interface between national security and resilience is rooted in individuals' perceptions and attitudes toward institutions and leadership. Therefore, in this article, we suggest that political-psychological features form the basis of citizens' perceived definitions of national resilience. By comparing national resilience definitions composed by citizens of two democratic countries facing national threats of war and terrorism, the United States and Israel, we found that perceived threats, optimism, and public attitudes such as patriotism and trust in governmental institutions, are the most frequent components of the perceived national resilience. On the basis of these results, a reconceptualization of the term 'national resilience' is presented. This can lead to validation of how resilience is measured and provide grounds for further examination of this concept in other democratic countries.

T1  - Racism: Less is More
AN  - 1667951018; 201509511
AB  - Racism has been in sharp decline in recent decades yet the word, as accusation, is used more than ever. The word/idea needs to be more restrictively defined and kept for when it is really needed. When almost everyone is a racist, no one is. To this end we need to distinguish more clearly between the greater comfort people often feel among familiar people and places and active hostility towards outsider ethnic groups. We also need a more discriminating language to describe the spectrum of discrimination. Prejudice, clannishness-even in some instances discrimination itself-should be regarded as sentiments and behaviours that are distinct from proper racism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Balancing stigma and status: racial and class identities among middle-class Haitian youth
AN  - 1559005734; 201431942
AB  - This article examines the identity formation of middle-class Haitian youth. Segmented assimilation theory predicts that the Haitian second generation will integrate into the black American underclass or maintain strong ethnic group identities. The black middle class, however, is an unexplored pathway of cultural assimilation. This paper uses the literature on the racial and class experiences of the black American middle class as a departure point for understanding the boundary work of middle-class Haitian youth. Based on qualitative interviews and a focus group, we uncover the mechanisms of identity formation for this invisible population. Racial, ethnic and class boundaries compel Haitian youths to create strategies of either empowerment or distancing. They negotiate between their middle-class status and ethnoracial exclusion in a racially segregated neighbourhood, an ethnically homogenous church and a mixed-race school setting. This study's findings extend our theoretical understandings of middle-class immigrants and their identity work. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Being White Helps: Intersections of Self-Concealment, Stigmatization, Identity Formation, and Psychological Distress in Racial and Sexual Minority Women
AN  - 1641424334; 201500277
AB  - This study had two objectives: (1) examine the impact of self-concealment on identity formation and on degree of psychological distress and (2) examine the impact of perceived stigma on identity formation and on degree of psychological distress. Analyses were conducted on a diverse sample of 166 women, ages 18-32 (white lesbian, non-white lesbian, white heterosexual, and non-white heterosexual). Findings revealed that self-concealment was positively associated with psychological distress in stigmatized women, but unrelated to psychological distress in the non-stigmatized group. Furthermore, although perceived stigma negatively impacted identity formation in the heterosexual groups, it did not impact either group of lesbians. Finally, non-white heterosexual women's perception of stigma was associated with psychological distress. Implications and specific psychological health disparities between groups are discussed.

AB  - In the post-9/11 American imagination, stereotypical images of the terrorist from the Middle East and the illegal migrant worker from south of the US border consistently appear in media and rhetoric. Dominant US representations of Latinos and Middle Eastern Muslims shape not only how US government and media construes them as 'Brown Threats,' but also how citizens in the US interpret these minority groups as dangerous, foreign, inauthentic and brown(ed) Americans. By analyzing law, rhetoric and visual culture, the concept of the Brown Threat interrogates contemporary conflations of Latinos and Middle Eastern Muslims. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial and Gender Discrimination, Early Life Factors, and Chronic Physical Health Conditions in Midlife
AN  - 1541999279; 201426917
AB  - Purpose Most studies of perceived discrimination have been cross-sectional and focused primarily on mental rather than physical health conditions. We examined the associations of perceived racial and gender discrimination reported in adulthood with early life factors and self-reported physician diagnosis of chronic physical health conditions. Methods: We used data from a racially diverse birth cohort of U.S. women (n = 168; average age, 41 years) with prospectively collected early life data (e.g., parental socioeconomic factors) and adult reported data on perceived discrimination, physical health conditions, and relevant risk factors. We performed modified robust Poisson regression owing to the high prevalence of the outcomes. Results: Fifty percent of participants reported racial and 39% reported gender discrimination. Early life factors did not have strong associations with perceived discrimination. In adjusted regression models, participants reporting at least three experiences of gender or racial discrimination had a 38% increased risk of having at least one physical health condition (relative risk, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.87). Using standardized regression coefficients, the magnitude of the association of having physical health condition(s) was larger for perceived discrimination than for being overweight or obese. Conclusion: Our results suggest a substantial chronic disease burden associated with perceived discrimination, which may exceed the impact of established risk factors for poor physical health.

T1  - Performing ethnic relations in Russia's North Caucasus: regional spectacles in Stavropol' krai
AN  - 1541997831; 201426875
AB  - Using materials gathered during fieldwork carried out in Russia in 2008 and 2009, this paper examines the 'Day of Stavropol' krai 2009' celebration and links it to debates on ethnic relations, identity and nationalism in post-Soviet Russia. It is argued that celebrations, festivals, parades and other 'spectacles' are significant, yet often overlooked, influences on ethnic relations. Although authorities at national and regional scale play a prominent role in governing ethnic relations, it is often the case that they revert to Soviet-era practices -- such as the 'folklorization' of ethnic groups -- and produce a narrative that proclaims the 'eternal harmony' of ethnic relations. Given widespread ethnic tensions that exist in Russia, such a representation of ethnic relations is far from the reality lived by people in everyday life. Thus, this paper explores how citizens' understandings of ethnic relations relates to that portrayed by state authorities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Yielding to the sons of the soil: Abkhazian democracy and the marginalization of the Armenian vote
AN  - 1520341486; 201413206
AB  - Among the post-Soviet de facto states, Abkhazia is unique in that the secessionists pursued self-determination in the name of a minority group. Today the ethnic Abkhaz enjoy a virtual monopoly on political power. Simultaneously, Abkhazia has developed a reasonably democratic political system. How has it been possible for the ethnic Abkhaz to monopolize power within a political system that exhibits most of the trappings of democratic rule? We discuss four alternative theories of ethnic marginalization to explain why the Armenians, the largest minority community in Abkhazia, have abstained from translating numerical strength into political influence. We argue that it is essential to examine sentiments and behaviour not only among the dominant group, but just as much among the marginalized group. Particularly relevant is the pervasive perception that rights in and 'ownership' of a territory are linked to 'rootedness'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Putting stigma in context: Do perceptions of group stigma interact with personally experienced discrimination to predict mental health?
AN  - 1504423287; 201405301
AB  - Research has linked experiences of personal discrimination with negative mental health consequences, but less is known about the role of group stigma (perceived stigma against one's group as a whole). The theoretical literature has offered mixed predictions. The present study examined the independent and interactive effects of group stigma and personal discrimination on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in a sample of gay and bisexual men (N = 986). Experiences of personal discrimination predicted depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation regardless of group stigma. However, group stigma was associated with depressive symptoms contextually-only when level of perceived personal discrimination was low. Personal discrimination may be a relatively more powerful force in the lives of stigmatized group members that overwhelms the influence of group stigma in harming mental health.

T1  - Occupational Adjustment of Immigrants in The Netherlands
AN  - 1504421994; 201405556
AB  - This article examines the speed of the occupational adjustment of immigrants using Labour Force Surveys 2004 and 2005 from Statistics Netherlands. The analysis provides new evidence that immigrants start with jobs at the lower levels of skill distribution. Their occupational achievement improves significantly with the duration of residence. The extent of this initial disadvantage and the rate of adjustment vary across immigrant groups according to the transferability of skills associated with their cultural and linguistic distance from Dutch society as predicted by the theory of immigrant occupational mobility. Most notably, Turks and Moroccans face the greatest initial dip and achieve the highest rate of adjustment, while the opposite holds for Caribbean and Western immigrants. Our results are robust to three alternative measures of occupational status. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Hunkering Down or Hunkering Away?" The Effect of Community Ethnic Diversity on Residents' Social Networks
AN  - 1448995012; 201342873
AB  - We identify two issues with the current literature suggesting that community ethnic diversity undermines social capital: (1) studies predominantly use attitudinal indicators of social capital; and (2) these attitudinal indicators are neighbourhood specific. We suggest the "size" of, and "frequency of interaction" within, individuals' social networks form more valid indicators of social capital. Thus it remains unknown: (1) whether diversity undermines individuals' social connectivity or only attitudes towards neighbours; or (2) whether diversity undermines individuals' total levels of social connectivity or only neighbourhood connectivity. We demonstrate that diversity negatively predicts both local trust and local social connectivity. However, diversity does not negatively predict individuals' total levels of connectivity. From a social connectivity perspective, diversity may undermine local social capital yet exert little effect on individuals' total levels of social capital. Instead, individuals in diverse communities possess equally sized (and active) but less neighbourhood-centric networks. However, this appears dependent on the ability to maintain dispersed social networks: less mobile individuals (e.g. the elderly) report both lower local and lower total social capital in diverse communities.

T1  - Globalization, socio-economic status and welfare chauvinism: European perspectives on attitudes toward the exclusion of immigrants
AN  - 1463008351; 201345616
AB  - This article addresses the question of whether globalization impacts individual preferences to exclude immigrants from national welfare systems ('welfare chauvinism'). Intergroup contact theory and arguments from the 'new cosmopolitanism' debate suggest that cross-border social contacts ('social globalization') foster a willingness to include and accept newcomers. However, group conflict theory suggests that trade openness ('economic globalization') can unleash feelings of insecurity and trigger welfare chauvinism. While these approaches point in different directions, we argue that the impact of globalization on welfare chauvinism differs across socio-economic status groups. Using cross-national data from the European Social Survey 2008/2009, we find scarce support for the hypothesis that social globalization reduces welfare chauvinism in general. However, there is evidence that it diminishes exclusionary attitudes among those with relatively high socio-economic statuses. Moreover, we find no general evidence for an impact of economic globalization on chauvinism, but a positive interaction of intensified engagement with global market forces and higher socio-economic status.

T1  - A time to make (and lose) friends: effects of soccer tournaments on German adolescents' attitudes toward foreigners
AN  - 1433108426
AB  - The present research examined the effects of one's national sports team defeats in international competitions on adolescents' out-group attitudes and the moderation of these effects by in-group identification. We conducted two longitudinal studies surveying German adolescents (Soccer World Championship 2006 and European Championship 2008). Both studies showed deterioration in adolescents' evaluations of people from the countries whose soccer teams defeated the German team (Italy and Spain). There was no generalization to other national groups. The deterioration in out-group evaluations was shown to be more pronounced for adolescents reporting a high in-group identification. The results are discussed in terms of macro-societal effects on adolescents' attitude development and the function that intergroup bias serves for social identity.

T1  - Signal Detection Analysis of Factors Associated With Diabetes Among Semirural Mexican American Adults
AN  - 1429629012; 201338364
AB  - Signal detection analysis was used to evaluate a combination of sociodemographic, acculturation, mental health, health care, and chronic disease risk factors potentially associated with diabetes in a sample of 4,505 semirural Mexican American adults. Overall, 8.9% of adults had been diagnosed with diabetes. The analysis resulted in 12 mutually exclusive groups, with diabetes prevalence ranging from 1.8% to 44.1%. Three groups were at the highest risk (34.5%-44.1% diabetic) and accounted for almost half of those with diabetes. Each of these groups was distinguished by their middle to older ages and presence of one or more chronic conditions (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and/or poor mental health) in addition to diabetes. The differing composition of the groups identified by the signal detection analysis has important implications for the design and implementation of public health interventions and health care treatment programs for Mexican Americans with diabetes.

AN  - 1478096510; 22323124
AB  - To investigate variations in explanations given for disparities in health care use between migrant and non-migrant groups, by clients and care providers in Sweden. Qualitative evidence collected during in-depth interviews with five 'migrant' health service clients and five physicians. The interview data generated three categories which were perceived by respondents to produce ethnic differences in health service use: "Communication issues", "Cultural differences in approaches to medical consultations" and "Effects of perceptions of inequalities in care quality and discrimination". Explanations for disparities in health care use in Sweden can be categorized into those reflecting social/structural conditions and the presence/absence of power and those using cultural/behavioural explanations. The negative perceptions of 'migrant' clients held by some Swedish physicians place the onus for addressing their poor health with the clients themselves and risks perpetuating their health disadvantage. The power disparity between doctors and 'migrant' patients encourages a sense of powerlessness and mistreatment among patients. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racial Threat and White Opposition to Bilingual Education in Texas
AN  - 1417525056; 201331938
AB  - This study examines local contextual conditions that influence opposition to bilingual education among non-Hispanic Whites, net of individual-level characteristics. Data from the Texas Poll (N = 615) are used in conjunction with U.S. Census data to test five competing hypotheses using binomial and multinomial logistic regression models. Our results support a "racial threat" hypothesis, suggesting that increasing opposition to bilingual education among Whites corresponds to changes in the Hispanic population. We find opposition to bilingual education among non-Hispanic Whites to be most pronounced in areas with substantial growth in an already sizeable Hispanic population, and least pronounced in areas of high growth rates and historically low proportions of Hispanics. Importantly, our results highlight the relevance of the interaction between minority group size and minority growth rates in generating majority opposition to bilingual education programs in the United States.

T1  - The "Wages of Burman-ness:" Ethnicity and Burman Privilege in Contemporary Myanmar
AN  - 1347784875; 201318947
AB  - Ethnicity is one of the primary lenses through which scholars view conflict in Burma/Myanmar. In this paper I examine the dominance of the majority ethnic group in Myanmar, the Burmans, and the ways in which Burman-ness functions as a privileged identity. I draw from the theoretical framework of Whiteness and White privilege in critical race theory to argue that, although there are important analytical differences between race and ethnicity, we can conceptualise Burman-ness as a form of institutionalised dominance similar to Whiteness. I support this argument by documenting the ways in which Burmans are privileged in relation to non-Burmans, while still, in many cases, seeing themselves as equally subject to government repression. This analysis of Burman privilege (and blindness to that privilege) is particularly relevant given the fact that the political reforms implemented by Myanmar's new, partly civilian government since 2011 have opened new opportunities for (mostly Burman) activists while coinciding with increased military violence in some non-Burman border regions of the country.

T1  - AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AND SELF-ESTEEM: THE VARIOUS SOURCES
AN  - 1464753692
AB  - As a result of prejudice and discrimination, African American women are likely to experience adversity. We examined possible sources of self-esteem among 16 African American Women utilizing a mixed design (i.e., quantitative and qualitative). Quantitative data was gathered through objective measures (i.e., Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, Reflected Appraisal Scale, Revised African American Identity Scale, Womanist Identity Attitude Scale, and Feminist Identity Scale). Qualitative data was obtained through an unstructured interview. Results indicated that religion, specifically, having a good relationship with God influenced self-esteem. Family closeness related to self-esteem and role models enhanced identity development as well as self-esteem. Based on these findings, socialization factors may assist in maintaining self-esteem in dealing with adversity for African American women. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Leadership as an emergent group process: A social network study of personality and leadership
AN  - 1347783707; 201318355
AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted on the social network of a leaderless group to explore how Big Five personality traits affect leadership emergence, in the form of receiver ties (being nominated as a leader), sender ties (nominating others as leaders), and similarity effects (nominating similar/different others as leaders). Forty one students on a 3-month study abroad program participated in intensive group work, and their perceptions of emergent task- and relationship-oriented leadership within these groups were assessed three times across the life cycle of the group. Results indicated that individuals scoring higher on extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness were nominated more as task- and relationship-oriented leaders, whereas those who were more agreeable were more likely to emerge as relationship-oriented leaders. In terms of emergent followership, group members who were more agreeable and neurotic (and less open to experience) were less likely to follow relationship-oriented leaders, whereas more conscientious individuals were more likely to follow task-oriented leaders. With respect to the effects of complementarity and similarity, both task- and relationship-oriented leader nominations were based on dissimilar levels of agreeableness between leaders and followers, whereas nominated relationship-based leaders tended to have similar levels of openness to experience to followers. Implications of these results are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Depleting Capital?: Race, Wealth and Informal Financial Assistance
AN  - 1315601069; 201307652
AB  - Recent work suggests that part of the racial gap in wealth is explained by racial differences in network poverty. In this article, data from the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances and the 2005 and 2007 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) are used to demonstrate that middle- and upper-income blacks are more likely to provide informal financial assistance than their white counterparts. Further, a lagged model using the PSID finds that this difference in financial assistance can account for part of the racial gap in wealth. An empirically useful definition of negative social capital is developed to illustrate how obligations of group membership can have stratifying consequences for individuals.

T1  - Good culture, bad culture...no culture! The implications of culture in urban regeneration in Bradford, UK
AN  - 1221412591; 201246366
AB  - This paper shows how regeneration policies in Bradford (UK) have over the years been modified following local, national and international events since 1997. It will be argued that policy makers reacted to public perceptions of the city itself and of its large Muslim community in three phases: celebration of local minority ethnic culture; pathologization of the same; exclusion of any cultural element from the city's self-projection. The paper suggests that these changes are at the same time reflexive of historical events and hegemonic discourses, and likely to be constitutive (as they have the potential to deeply affect social relations in the city). Further investigation is required to measure such constitutive long-term effects on minority ethnic groups and social relations in the city.

T1  - Smoking, Ethnic Residential Segregation, and Ethnic Diversity: A Spatio-temporal Analysis
AN  - 1364700120; 201326631
AB  - Ethnic residential segregation is a profound social divide in many societies. In the health arena, U.S. work has been influential in demonstrating the impact of ethnic residential segregation on child health outcomes, showing how it can compound other forms of disadvantage. This article builds on and extends this research by examining the transferability of conclusions concerning the health impact of ethnic residential segregation to a non-U.S. context and to the field of health behavior. Using complete adult population data from the 1996 and 2006 New Zealand Censuses of Population geocoded to local and urban area levels, we examine smoking prevalence and cessation in relation to ethnic segregation and diversity. The article employs a repeated cross-sectional multilevel modeling strategy with smoking and cessation as outcome variables. The differential impact of segregation and diversity on smoking behavior by different ethnic groups is considered, taking into account the confounding effect of socioeconomic status and demographic variation. Conclusions suggest that Maori isolation has little overall effect but ethnic diversity has some relevance. Individual ethnic status and area-level deprivation are more important in understanding smoking behavior. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Making contact. Generating interethnic contact for multicultural integration and tolerance in Amsterdam
AN  - 1322718506; 201312378
AB  - Interethnic contact is considered a potent tool for the generation of interethnic understanding and tolerance. This faith has engendered countless social projects that seek to stimulate contact between members of different ethnic groups under 'optimal conditions'. However, the academic literature does not stipulate how, if at all, these optimal conditions can be realized in real world interventions. This article investigates how the organizers of a number of Dutch projects for 'contact under optimal conditions' conceived of such contact and how these conceptualisations informed how projects were set up, executed and experienced. The analysis demonstrates that organizers conceived of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' as a natural autonomous process. Optimal conditions for this natural process were assumed to be guaranteed when project workers interfered as little as possible with the contact between participants. The 'natural' processes thus engendered were assumed to lead to the recognition of fundamental sameness between two ethnic groups and/or the recognition of the superficiality of their differences. In practice, however, projects were set up in ways that privileged the exchange of uncontroversial information on personal tastes and ethnic differences. Moreover, the emphasis on the dual recognition of fundamental sameness and superficial difference produced a discursive context in which the exploration of conflicts of interest was foreclosed. These results suggest that the notion of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' may in practice have connotations that lead to practices that reinforce, rather than challenge, existing prejudices and misunderstandings.

T1  - Discrimination, Family Relationships, and Major Depression Among Asian Americans
AN  - 1010078718; 22083344
AB  - Depression represents a growing concern among Asian Americans. This study examined whether discrimination and family dynamics are associated with depression in this population. Weighted logistic regressions using nationally representative data on Asian American adults (N = 2095) were used to examine associations between discrimination, negative interactions with relatives, family support, and 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD). Discrimination (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.67, 2.71) and negative interactions with relatives (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.58) were positively associated with MDD. Family support was associated with lower MDD (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.89), and buffered lower levels of discrimination. Results suggest that discrimination may have negative mental health implications, and also point to the importance of family relationships for depression among Asian Americans. Findings suggest that providers may consider stress experienced at multiple ecological levels to address Asian American mental health needs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Goal commitment and alignment of personal goals predict group identification only when the goals are shared
AN  - 1023026828; 201223710
AB  - Selfish pursuits of personal goals in group contexts may conflict with the group goal. Drawing on the shared reality theory and the intersubjective consensus approach to cultural dynamics, however, we propose that commitment to personal goals would be accompanied by greater group identification when individual group members realize that their personal goals are widely shared in the group. In one experiment (Study 1), we manipulated perceived sharedness of personal goals and found that commitment to personal goals correlated positively with group identification only when participants learned that their goals were shared. Subsequent surveys that incorporated a 3-month longitudinal design (Studies 2 and 3) further confirmed that goal commitment and alignment with personal goals predicted group identification only when the goals were shared in the group.

T1  - Commodifying migration: excluding migrants in Europe's emerging social model
AN  - 1081868692; 201235361
AB  - Modes of social inclusion and the dominant ways of perceiving related issues of social justice are in a state of transformation in contemporary Western societies. Traditional features of the European social model are called into question by a neoliberal logic that favours market solutions to manage social inclusion. As Yasemin Soysal convincingly argues, this transformation affects the very core of citizenship rights which in the postwar perspective of TH Marshall, were meant to promote a more cohesive and just society. Soysal claims that in the current neoliberal climate, social policies are guided by the principle of 'individuality' (understood as the imperative to 'invest' into individuals' marketable capabilities) rather than the traditional notion of redistributive social justice. According to her interpretation, the nascent social model in Europe paves the way for the gradual withering away of rights of citizens as primarily granted through the status of communal membership. Built on this diagnosis, Soysal's article poses the question regarding how this transformation affects migrants. Already under regular circumstances, migration is associated with a heightened sense of uncertainty especially within the labour market: Moving from one country to another often constitutes challenges pertaining to the recognition of qualifications, learning the codes of the labour market, finding a new supportive social network, etc. In hindsight, one could argue that the relatively robust welfare state and low levels of unemployment in the 1960s-70 period were instrumental in promoting the social inclusion of the postwar 'guest worker' migrants. And beyond relatively generous social policies at the time, work-based forms of (union-supported) solidarity helped to link the demand for successful social inclusion and citizens' rights to the regulative idea of redistributive social justice. Yet, this situation has changed dramatically: Manifestly, the neoliberal adjustment of labour market relations and social policy perspectives has called into question this traditional mode of inclusion. In particular the less privileged migrants are extremely vulnerable to the imponderability of the increasingly deregulated labour market and the gradually eroding social safety net in Europe. Yet, in this commentary, I propose that Soysal in her analysis of the distinct status of migrants in Europe, could have been more explicit about the implications of Europe's new 'social project'. I will argue that migrants are not simply exposed to this project's endemic forms of social exclusion and inequality in a more pronounced way than most other groups in society. Beyond this new sense of socio-economic vulnerability, we witness a far-reaching shift in the discursive representation of migration that is likely to have a critical impact on the politics and policies of migration. In my view, Soysal's succinct account of how the transformation of rights and obligations contributes to the reproduction of social inequalities could have benefited from acknowledging how migrants' struggle for justice is also intimately linked to struggles over recognition and symbolic inclusion. In this respect the neoliberal discursive paradigm has a profound impact on the socially dominant perception of migrants and their sense of entitlement as newcomers. In a second step, I will critically discuss Soysal's claim regarding the steady erosion of migrants' rights at the national level which could be counterbalanced by a new set of international, EU-sanctioned rights and social privileges.

T1  - Ordinary people doing extraordinary things: responses to stigmatization in comparative perspective
AN  - 1037875975; 201231111
AB  - This special issue offers a first systematic qualitative cross-national exploration of how diverse minority groups respond to stigmatization in a wide variety of contexts. This research is the culmination of a coordinated study of stigmatized groups in Brazil, Israel and the USA, as well as of connected research projects conducted in Canada, France, South Africa and Sweden. The issue sheds light on the range of destigmatization strategies ordinary people adopt in the course of their daily life. Articles analyse the cultural frames they mobilize to make sense of their experiences and to determine how to respond; how they negotiate and transform social and symbolic boundaries; and how responses are enabled and constrained by institutions, national ideologies, cultural repertoires and contexts. The similarities and differences across sites provide points of departure for further systematic research, which is particularly needed in light of the challenges for liberal democracy raised by multiculturalism.

T1  - Complement or competition: Latino employment in a nontraditional settlement area
AN  - 1429627910; 201335833
AB  - The migration of Latinos to nontraditional settlement areas in the United States is renewing interest in how an established low-skilled work force is affected by the inflow of a minority group whose members tend to have a weak basket of human capital. Some scholars focus on how the incoming group creates head-to-head competition with established workers. An alternative view posits that, depending on the context of the receiving labor market, incoming workers may primarily fill roles that complement preexisting labor market arrangements. I study these issues in the region of the country that has experienced the most pronounced in-migration of Latinos during the past few years. The findings indicate migrating Latinos tend to complement preexisting labor market conditions rather than spark job competition and undercut the earning power of non-Latinos.

T1  - Love thine enemy? Evidence that (ir)religious identification can promote outgroup tolerance under threat
AN  - 1018354228; 201212758
AB  - The divide between religious traditionalists and secular humanists has been widening for decades; yet, little is known about factors that attenuate hostility between these groups. Two studies examined whether (ir)religious identification could mitigate negative feelings toward (ir)religious outgroups. Following priming to make salient religious groups in daily life or group-based threat, Atheists and Christians in Britain (Study 1, n = 113), and Atheists, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and Protestants in Canada (Study 2, n = 181) reported intergroup feelings, ingroup evaluations, and perceptions of their group as viewed by others. Atheists reported the lowest ingroup identification and felt equally negative toward all religious groups. Likewise, religious group members generally felt most negative toward Atheists. However, identification with the (ir)religious ingroup was associated with less hostility toward the outgroup(s). This was particularly marked for Atheists who perceived that religious followers felt positively toward them. These results challenge suggestions that (ir)religious identification and threat necessarily promote intergroup hostility. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

AN  - 964192565; 201207503
AB  - This study examines what may be termed a historical fracture in the black diaspora in the United States, where African Americans and African Caribbeans still struggle to maintain and solidify friendships. A brief historical account of the relationship between African Americans and African Caribbeans is provided to demonstrate the longevity of this diasporic rupture. I then proceed to offer a close textual reading of Brown Girl Brownstones and The Friends to fully explore what fuels the tensions between group members. This study concludes that coalition building and a rekindling of former friendships can heal this ruptured diaspora. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cosmetic Surgery, Racial Identity, and Aesthetics
AN  - 1417526921; 201332009
AB  - Human motives are varied, often hidden, and sometimes highly complicated, and this point applies with special force to persons' motives to modify their bodies. The motives to undergo cosmetic surgery in order to change one's appearance have, or at least seem to have, racial dimensions that are both particularly complicated and peculiarly obscure. In the case of cosmetic Asian eyelid surgery, at least six theories shed light on the explanation, analysis, and appraisal of this class of body modifications. The theories are here called benign explanation, performance theory, aesthetic oppression, internalized racism, Foucauldian care of the self, and complicity with a racist society. These theories, as articulated here, illuminate bodily alterations that relate to racial identity, especially in regard to minority races. Several of these theories make room for the exercise of freedom in the face of pressures to succumb to a seeming aesthetic ineluctability created by a dominant race. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - National identity and money: Czech and Slovak Lands 1918-2008
AN  - 860082076
AB  - An expanding literature on money and identity is built around the assumption that political elites deliberately use currency design to foster national identities. However, the empirical evidence in favor of this assumption has been fragmentary. Drawing on detailed primary sources we demonstrate nationalist intentions of political elites involved in currency design. We also examine how political elites use banknotes as official pronouncements on who is and who is not part of the nation and what the official attitude toward foreigners is. By tracing changes in the inclusive and exclusive messages directed at an intra-state or international audience we document that there is no connection between ingroup (national) love and outgroup (foreigners, minorities, opposition) hate. The amount of exclusive messages to outgroups culminated in conditions of perceived threat when political leaders tried to mobilize pre-existing identities to secure or maintain political power. In contrast, the officials deliberately tried to broaden ingroup boundaries in order to build international communities. Finally, we document that in the case of limited support for the new conception of identity, officials tried to depict the old and the new identity as complementary, embedding the new identity in existing discourses.

T1  - Asian American-White Differences in the Effect of Motherhood on Career Outcomes
AN  - 856403221; 201106878
AB  - U.S.-born Asian Americans are unique among American minority groups in that they lack earnings disadvantages relative to Whites with similar education levels. Controlling for education and age, there is little difference in the earnings of U.S.-born Asian and White men, but Asian women have higher earnings than comparable White women. Using data from SESTAT, this study tests the hypothesis that Asian American women's high earnings may result from adjusting their labor supply less than White women in response to parenthood, leading to greater work experience over time. Findings show that Asian American women are less likely than White women to reduce labor supply in response to parenthood and that their resulting greater work experience explains their high rate of earnings growth.

T1  - Transnational Home Engagement among Latino and Asian Americans: Resources and Motivation
AN  - 914766157; 201200203
AB  - Is immigrant groups' assimilation to host society at odds with their engagement with the country of ancestral origin? This study divides the concept of assimilation into socioeconomic resources and attachment to host society, and argues that assimilation and transnational perspectives are coexisting paradigms. Analyses using the nationally representative samples of Latino and Asian Americans indicate that higher-order generations reduce the odds of home country engagement, i.e., frequent return visits; attachment to American society does not discourage return visits; socioeconomic resources increase frequent visits; and the country of origin is a significant predictor of home country visits.

T1  - Sri Lankan Muslims: between ethno-nationalism and the global ummah
AN  - 852899029; 201103312
AB  - Sri Lanka's Sunni Muslims or 'Moors', who make up eight percent of the population, are the country's third largest ethnic group, after the Buddhist Sinhalese (seventy-four per cent) and the Hindu Tamils (eighteen per cent). Although the armed LTTE (Tamil Tiger) rebel movement was defeated militarily by government forces in May 2009, the island's Muslims still face the long-standing external threats of ethno-linguistic Tamil nationalism and pro-Sinhala Buddhist government land and resettlement policies. In addition, during the past decade a sharp internal conflict has arisen within the Sri Lankan Muslim community between locally popular Sufi sheiks and the followers of hostile Islamic reformist movements energised by ideas and resources from the global ummah, or world community of Muslims. This simultaneous combination of 'external' ethno-nationalist rivalries and 'internal' Islamic doctrinal conflict has placed Sri Lanka's Muslims in a double bind: how to defend against Tamil and Sinhalese ethnic hegemonies while not appearing to embrace an Islamist or jihadist agenda. This article first traces the historical development of Sri Lankan Muslim identity in the context of twentieth-century Sri Lankan nationalism and the south Indian Dravidian movement, then examines the recent anti-Sufi violence that threatens to divide the Sri Lankan Muslim community today.

T1  - The Role of Shame as a Mediator Between Anti-Black Racial Identity Attitudes and Negative Affect in a Sample of African American College Students
AN  - 1018353954; 201212773
AB  - A sample of 168 African American undergraduates was surveyed to clarify past findings demonstrating a consistent relationship between endorsing negative attitudes about being African American and experiencing negative affect. Specifically, shame was tested as a mediator between participants' endorsement of preencounter attitudes (i.e., anti-Black attitudes) and both feelings of depression and global self-esteem, respectively. As predicted, shame acted as a complete mediator in both equations. Limitations and implications are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Tonga Orature as Historical Record: An Afrocentric Exegesis of the Dialectics Between African Human Factor Agency and the European Enslavement of Place
AN  - 835111541; 201100487
AB  - The article critically examines the history of the Tonga people's experiences of civilization and displacement from their life-affirming geographical location as enunciated through their oral forms, particularly, songs and other forms of reminiscence. The experiences of the Tonga people of Zimbabwe are largely overlooked in scholarship because they are considered one of the so-called minority groups, meriting little or no attention at all. Informed by an Afrocentric approach, in which it is 'valid to posit Africa as a geographical and cultural starting base in the study of peoples [of Africa and] of African descent,' the article brings out an understanding of African orature as a redoubtable expression of the African classical past and the subsequent subversion and decimation of African human factor agency as a result of the European enslavement of place. In this regard, the authors contend that Africologists would do well to study African people's orature, as it often reflects their story from their own perspective.

T1  - Mandated multiculturalism: An analysis of core curricula at tribal and historically black colleges
AN  - 818801852; 201071764
AB  - Multicultural content has become increasingly widespread in the core curriculum at colleges and universities in the United States. This article examines whether multicultural requirements are more prevalent at minority-serving colleges (i.e., tribal and historically black colleges) than at 'mainstream' institutions without a minority-serving charter. It examines the prevalence of two kinds of multicultural content: pluralistic content that canvasses multiple minority groups or cultures, and particularistic perspectives that focus on only one group (in this case, African Americans or American Indians). Multivariate analyses indicate that tribal, black, and mainstream colleges do not differ with respect to pluralistic requirements in the core curriculum, but that particularistic requirements are more extensive at black colleges and especially at tribal colleges.

T1  - Black Retail Enterprise And Racial Segregation In Northern Cities Before The "Ghetto"
AN  - 764417918; 201064696
AB  - Past research indicates that black entrepreneurship in northern cities was unaffected by residential segregation by race until after the formation of the "ghetto." In the present study, however, an analysis of Census data shows that in the urban North during the late nineteenth century, the residential segregation of blacks was positively associated with blacks' shopkeeping ratio, a measure of the extent to which black retail entrepreneurs were merchants rather than peddlers. This finding accords with the theory that ethnic businesses are often supported by the residential segregation of group members. Moreover, it implies that black merchants in northern cities may have been bolstered by business ownership opportunities created by a socially and spatially segregated market of black consumers much earlier than previously believed.

T1  - Cyprus, ethnic conflict and conflicted heritage
AN  - 758122077; 201056906
AB  - This article examines the dominant heritage discourse in Cyprus concerning preservation and destruction, and its implications for ethno-cultural identity construction and promotion. By exploring two heritage sites (one north and one south of the Buffer Zone) it suggests that heritage practice is more complex than commonly presented. Specifically, it shows how ethnic conflict has not only been responsible for heritage destruction but also for the preservation of it as an unintended consequence of 'freezing' development. It also examines how ethnic groups and individuals may come to evaluate their 'own' heritage negatively, specifically as an inconvenient cultural load, in efforts to develop ideologically specific or socially 'progressive' identities.

T1  - A Tale of Two Counties: Natives' Opinions Toward Immigration in North Carolina
AN  - 758121612; 201057035
AB  - This article compares native residents' opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties - one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents' tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.

T1  - The Role of Historical Knowledge in Perception of Race-Based Conspiracies
AN  - 868013659; 201112974
AB  - We test the hypothesis that knowledge of historically documented, anti-black conspiracies affects perceived plausibility of new, anti-black conspiracies. In Experiment 1 (N = 78), African Americans and European Americans read about a current conspiracy aimed at undermining either African American or European American elected officials. African Americans perceived the anti-black conspiracy as more plausible and the conspiracy informant as more credible than did European Americans. The difference in perception of informant credibility was mediated by recognition of historically documented, anti-black conspiracies. In Experiment 2, we manipulated European Americans (N = 105) exposure to information about historically documented, anti-black conspiracies. European Americans who learned about actual, past anti-black conspiracies perceived new anti-black conspiracies as more plausible than did European Americans who learned about race-silent conspiracies or who did not learn about conspiracies. To the extent that European Americans lack awareness of incidents of racism in US history, they are likely to underestimate the possibility that racism impacts contemporary events.

T1  - What Does "White" Mean? Interpreting The Choice Of "Race" By Mixed Race Young People In Britain
AN  - 754040352; 201049803
AB  - Despite the often cited idea that racial identities are socially constructed, and potentially fluid, much public policy is still based on surveys that elicit only one measure of racial identity. A number of U.S. studies have employed "best single race" questions on racial identification, in which multiracial respondents are asked to choose only one race to describe themselves. We extend some American studies by examining responses to a "best single race" survey question posed to a small sample of multiracial young people in Britain. In-depth interviews with British multiracial respondents are employed to investigate the extent to which a "best single race" (BSR) question captures someone's sense of attachment and belonging to a particular ethnic or racial group. In particular, we focus on how we should interpret East Asian/white respondents' choice of "white" as their BSR. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reversal of Fortunes or Continued Success? Cohort Differences in Education and Earnings of Childhood Immigrants
AN  - 754037657; 201049679
AB  - Using several years of Canadian census data, this study examines cohort differences in educational attainment and earnings among childhood immigrants who arrived in Canada between 1960 and 1989. Successive cohorts of childhood immigrants had increasingly higher university completion rates than their Canadian-born peers by age 25--34. We find that this lead was tempered by declining earnings of immigrant parents relative to Canadian-born parents, particularly among the 1980s cohort. Despite rising university completion rates, wages of male (but not female) childhood immigrants lagged behind those of their Canadian-born peers. This gap can be accounted for largely by the rising share of members of racial minority groups and the decreasing incidence of full-time employment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Kazakhs of Western Mongolia: transnational migration from 1990-2008
AN  - 754041566; 201053274
AB  - The Kazakhs are the largest minority group in Mongolia, a relatively homogenous country dominated by Khalkh Mongols. Since 1991, Mongolia has transitioned politically and economically and witnessed significant changes in internal and international migration flows. The large-scale movement of ethnic Kazakhs from Western Mongolia to Kazakhstan represents one such emerging international flow. This migration is influenced by economic motivations, historical cultural ties to Kazakhstan, and immigration policies of both countries. This paper assesses the local and national circumstances that shape migration decision-making in Western Mongolia during the transition years and highlights changes in the characteristics and directions of migration flows during this time. We identify three periods of migration with each period characterized by changing economies and national policies in Mongolia and Kazakhstan, as well as changes in communications technologies and extensiveness of social networks among prospective migrants. These periods illustrate how transnational migration flows evolve through time and are affected by national, local, and individual circumstances. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Strategic Assimilation or Creation of Symbolic Blackness: Middle-Class Blacks in Suburban Contexts
AN  - 754038379; 201049754
AB  - The black middle class has been the subject of a great deal of scholarly inquiry. Recently, scholars have directed their attention towards understanding how middle class blacks negotiate their racial identity. Some contend that blacks engage in strategic assimilation, working and sometimes living alongside members of the dominant group, while simultaneously maintaining social ties with members of their own racial group. To examine changes in the size and composition of the black middle class in various suburban contexts comparisons were made of selected demographic data from 1990 and 2000. The purpose of the study is to see if middle class blacks are engaging in strategic assimilation. The findings reveal that the size of the black middle class increased between 1990 and 2000 and that demographic differences exist between members of the black middle class based upon whether or not they reside inside or outside of the suburbs. The findings support the contention that middle class blacks are not engaging in strategic assimilation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Health Competence As Predictor of Access to Care Among Latinos in Baltimore
AN  - 199566986; 18060500
AB  - The goal of this study is to identify the underlying structure of Health Competence and its value as a predictor of access to care among the Latino population in Baltimore, Maryland. Data on a cross-sectional urban probability sample were collected from 330 foreign-born Latino men and women aged 21-75 years residing in Baltimore at the time of the survey. Principal components analysis yielded a two-component solution: the first component comprised "factors enabling" access to care; the second, "perceived barriers". When testing the predictive power of the Health Competence construct using model building and the log likelihood criteria the "enabling factors" added significantly (P < .005) to the power of the socio-demographic variables to predict access to care, making it an important tool for programs aiming to improve US Latinos' health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'True stories from bare times on road': Developing empowerment, identity and social capital among urban minority ethnic young people in London, UK
AN  - 743066938; 201043206
AB  - This paper is based on evaluative research in an inner-London borough on a programme designed to raise self esteem and deter minority ethnic young people from involvement in crime and participation in gangs. The aim of the programme was to work with young people 'at risk' or involved with gangs, violent crime and who may use weapons and to divert them from this behaviour. Essentially, the paper explores the way in which minority ethnic young people can be equipped to develop social capital. The paper firstly applies a brief contextual understanding of urban minority ethnic young people's experiences of school and 'street life'; secondly, it will describe the background and aims of the programme; and thirdly it will discuss whether and how the programme contributed to developing trust; to notions of awareness and empowerment; self-esteem and identity; and how it impacted on their social and family relationships.

T1  - Collaborative problem-solving with distributed information: The role of inferences from interdependent information
AN  - 743053458; 201031471
AB  - This article studies inferences from distributed, interdependent information in group problem-solving. Three inference types (collaborative, individual, and shared) are distinguished, based on information sharing and distribution, with a special focus on collaborative inferences that generate new information no individual group member could have inferred. In an experiment, n= 27 dyads solved a specifically designed inference task. Inferences from shared information were the most likely, individual inferences from unshared information less likely, and collaborative inferences from unshared, distributed information the least likely to be drawn. An analysis of inference patterns in dyads' discussions points towards the individual- and group-level processes involved in drawing collaborative inferences, and explains why first support measures explored in this study were not optimally designed.

T1  - Latino Employment and Residential Segregation in Metropolitan Labor Markets METROPOLITAN LABOR MARKETS
AN  - 758123158; 201056916
AB  - The spatial configuration of minorities relative to Whites in a metropolitan area, or residential segregation, has been identified as a significant barrier to access to employment opportunities for racial/ethnic minorities, including Latinos, in metropolitan labor markets. Dominating the research are tests of place stratification models that focus on segregated ethnic enclaves or the mismatch between minority communities and employment opportunities. Both approaches focus on predominantly Latino neighborhoods and communities, but overlook their structural location and isolation in the broader metropolitan labor market. This study examines whether and to what extent structural characteristics of metropolitan labor markets in which Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans live and work shape their employment opportunities and whether or not these relationships vary across the three Latino native-origin groups. We utilize a unique dataset of the demographic, employment, educational, occupational, and industrial characteristics of the 95 largest US cities. The analyses feature both OLS regression to ascertain if varying levels of segregation across metropolitan areas in 2000 is associated with different levels of employment for Latinos, and a fixed-effects analysis to determine if changes in these structural factors between 1980 and 2000 within the same labor market affect the employment rates of Latinos in that metropolitan area. We find that segregation has a deleterious effect on Latino men's employment; in cities where segregation is worse, their employment rates are lower, and as the cities that they live in became more segregated over the 20 year period of study, their employment rates decreased.

T1  - Voting across ethnic lines in late Imperial Austria
AN  - 60365265; 201019012
AB  - ABSTRACT. The Austrian party system, following the introduction of universal manhood suffrage in 1907, has conventionally been characterised as being divided along ethno-national lines, reinforcing perceptions that politics within the Habsburg Empire was overwhelmingly driven by nationalism. However, the electoral results in a number of districts only make sense if one assumes that voters cast ballots for their alleged ethnic opponents. A systematic analysis of election results, utilising a simple process of elimination and drawing on the highly detailed statistical records available, strongly suggests that such voting was commonplace. Furthermore, alternative explanations based on differential voting qualification rates, errors in the census, and electoral fraud do not withstand close scrutiny. One must therefore conclude that although ethnic conflict did occur, it was paralleled by inter-ethnic bargaining and compromise, thereby supporting more positive appraisals of Austrian electoral and parliamentary politics and of representative political institutions in ethnically divided societies.

T1  - Altruism towards strangers in need: costly signaling in an industrial society
AN  - 60339735; 201017385
AB  - In the present study, the costly signaling theory (CST) is used to examine the effect of an offer of charity on social recognition. On behalf of a charitable organization, 186 students enrolled in 16 different courses were asked to offer support to unfamiliar persons in need. In accordance with our predictions, the results show that significantly more subjects are willing to give assistance if they make charity offers in the presence of their group members than when the offers are made in secret. In accordance with CST-but not with the prevailing explanations in social psychology-the likelihood of charity service was strongly influenced by the expected cost of altruistic behavior. Publicly demonstrated altruistic intentions yielded long-term benefits: Subjects who were willing to participate in a particular charity activity gained significantly higher sociometry scores (as a sign of social recognition) than did others. The cost of volunteerism correlated with social recognition in the case of a charity act judged as the most expensive (giving assistance to mentally retarded children), but not for the other categories of charity offer. Our results suggest that public generosity towards strangers as a costly signal may convey reliable information about subjects' personality traits, such as cooperativeness, but our data do not support the hypothesis that the signaling mechanism is related to sexual selection and mate choice.
