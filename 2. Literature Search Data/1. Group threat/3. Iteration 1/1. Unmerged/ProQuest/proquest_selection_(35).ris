T1  - Does Respect Foster Tolerance? (Re)analyzing and Synthesizing Data From a Large Research Project Using Meta-Analytic Techniques
AN  - 2666836775
AB  - Our own prior research has demonstrated that respect for disapproved others predicts and might foster tolerance toward them. This means that without giving up their disapproval of others’ way of life, people can tolerate others when they respect them as equals (outgroup respect–tolerance hypothesis). Still, there was considerable variation in the study features. Moreover, the studies are part of a larger research project that affords many additional tests of our hypothesis. To achieve integration along with a more robust understanding of the relation between respect and tolerance, we (re)analyzed all existing data from this project, and we synthesized the results with the help of meta-analytic techniques. The average standardized regression coefficient, which describes the relationship between respect and tolerance, was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.16, 0.34]). In addition to this overall confirmation of our hypothesis, the size of this coefficient varied with a number of variables. It was larger for numerical majorities than for minorities, smaller for high-status than for low-status groups, and larger for religious than for life-style groups. These findings should inspire further theory development and spur growth in the social-psychological literature on tolerance.

T1  - Resisting Privilege: Effects of a White Privilege Message Intervention and Conservative Media Use on Freedom Threat and Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2662236714
AB  - Identifying ways to effectively communicate about racial/ethnic disparities is a place where communication scholars can make vital contributions. Yet, existing studies on this subject are scarce. Borrowing from reactance theory and the 3D model of White identity management, the present study tested whether exposing White adults to White privilege messaging helps them to become more aware or deny racial privilege. The results of our experiment revealed that there was a main effect for reading about racial privilege and increased awareness of privilege. However, in keeping with reactance theory, if the message stoked a perceived threat to freedom, message exposure resulted in the denial of both blatant and institutional racism. We also found a moderating role for Fox News viewing such that awareness of racial privilege was not affected by the intervention for heavy Fox News viewers, but it was for low Fox News viewers. We conclude that messages focused on explaining White privilege are promising, but there are risks.

T1  - Individuals in Default or the System? Race and Ethnicity, Stratification Views on Legal Debt, and Desire for Escalating Punishment
AN  - 2616575361
AB  - How do members of racial and ethnic groups explain the origins of unpaid legal debt from monetary sanctions, and how do such attributions undergird group differences in support for policy responses that escalate punishment? Using data from the Chicago Area Finances Survey, 2019, we apply an attributional typology of stratification beliefs to account for why legal debt from fines, fees, and tickets goes unpaid. We find differences in attribution types along key measures of socio-demographics and political values, and we identify racial differences in these attributions when other measures are held constant. How people understand why legal debt goes unpaid shapes their policy preferences as well, and they explain a small but significant fraction of racial and ethnic differences in the desire for punitive recourse.

T1  - The impact of symbolic boundaries on perceptions of relations between Japan and South Korea
AN  - 2494717354
AB  - This paper argues the perceptions of relations between two nations involve not only the institutionalized national-boundary but also the perspectives of multiple symbolic boundaries. Based on a qualitative study, this paper aims to explain how different symbolic boundaries impact Japanese experts’ perception of interrelations between Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The paper includes an analysis of opinion surveys, 20 semi-structured interviews with experts, and three focus group interviews with university students of Peace Studies Departments conducted throughout June and July of 2018 in Tokyo, Japan. These results advance existing scholarship by showing that Japanese experts use the following four symbolic boundaries to comprehend relations between Japan and South Korea: boundaries between (1) victims and perpetrators; (2) ‘the West’ and the Asian cultural and political space; (3) nationalistic and peaceful countries; and (4) a state and people.

T1  - Justice: The Racial Motive We All Have and Need
AN  - 2492207568
AB  - This essay posits that justice is the core value epitomizing our moment. Justice is violated when positive outcomes are undeserved, and the felt sense of injustice motivates a need for retribution. Because politics involves allocation (distribution and redistribution), deservingness is a core appraisal of “who gets what” and therefore justice is fundamental for politics. This is especially germane to race, ethnicity, and politics scholars. I present a few core tenets of justice theory, and argue that political science can take advantage of the moment to engage the concept of justice; especially as it relates to the study of racial attitudes and the identification of racial enablers—those ostensible non-racists who facilitate the status quo. Summarily, I propose that justice can unify debates over prejudice and politics, and advance our scholarly understanding of how well-intentioned people—regardless of their identities, or ideological or partisan labels—can facilitate racism, racial inequality, and injustice.

T1  - Exploring Inconsistencies in the Interpretation of Canada’s Section 161 Order for Sexual Offending
AN  - 2521461068
AB  - Community-based risk management strategies for people convicted of sexual offences (PCSO) can hinder successful reintegration, which plays an important role in reducing sexual recidivism. Section 161 of the Criminal Code is a Canadian risk management strategy, which aims to protect children by prohibiting people convicted of sexual offences against children (PCSO-C) from engaging in behaviours assumed (sometimes erroneously) to be associated with sexual offending. This study was the first to evaluate Section 161 prohibition orders. We explored inconsistencies in the interpretation and (hypothetical) application of these conditions between PCSO-C subject to Section 161 and two non-forensic subsamples of the Canadian public – community members and undergraduate students. Non-forensic participants expressed more negative attitudes towards the treatment of PCSO, which were found to mediate the relationship between group membership and subjective legal decision-making. Degree of support for Section 161 conditions did not appear to moderate this effect. Results raise concerns about the potential for increased personal discretion when enforcing or adhering to ambiguous or overly broad legal conditions. We suggest the need for continued efforts to establish an empirical understanding of the application, efficacy, and potential collateral consequences associated with this Canadian risk management strategy.Alternate abstract:
Les stratégies de gestion du risque dans la communauté pour les personnes reconnues coupables d’infractions sexuelles (PCIS) peuvent nuire à une réintégration réussie, ce qui joue un rôle important dans la réduction de récidive sexuelle. L’article 161 du Code criminel est une stratégie de gestion du risque canadienne, laquelle cherche à protéger les enfants en empêchant les personnes reconnues coupables d’infractions sexuelles contre les enfants (PCIS-E) d’avoir des comportements qui sont présumés (parfois de façon erronée) comme étant associés avec des infractions sexuelles. Cette étude a été la première à évaluer l’ordonnance d’interdiction de l’article 161 et à explorer les incohérences dans l’interprétation et l’exécution de ces conditions entre les PCIS-E contraints par l’article 161 et deux sous-échantillons non judiciaires du public canadien – des membres de la communauté et des étudiants de premier cycle. Les participants non judiciaires ont exprimé des attitudes plus négatives envers le traitement des PCIS, ce qui servait de médiateur entre l’appartenance au groupe et la prise de décision juridique subjective. Un certain soutien des conditions de l’article 161 conditions n’a pas semblé modérer cet effet. Les résultats soulèvent des inquiétudes en ce qui concerne le potentiel d’avoir une plus grande discrétion personnelle lors de la mise en application de conditions légales ambiguës et trop étendues. Nous suggérons que nous devons continuer nos efforts pour établir une compréhension empirique de la mise en application, de l’efficacité et des conséquences collatérales potentielles associées avec cette stratégie de gestion du risque canadienne.

T1  - Proportion of Foreigners Negatively Predicts the Prevalence of Xenophobic Hate Crimes within German Districts
AN  - 2409515437
AB  - Statistics show that the increase in the number of refugees to Germany since 2015 was accompanied by an increase in xenophobic hate crimes. We deduced rivaling predictions from intergroup contact and intergroup threat theories that could explain the occurrence of xenophobic hate crimes. By combining structural data of the 402 German districts with the 2015 police crime statistics, we found evidence to support our predictions that aligns with intergroup contact theory: the higher the proportion of foreigners in a district, the lower the prevalence of xenophobic hate crimes. Our analyses further show that the prevalence of xenophobic hate crime attacks was positively related to the total prevalence of registered criminal offenses in a district and was higher in eastern German districts.

T1  - Race‐Based Stress in White Adults: Exploring the Role of White Racial Identity Status Attitudes and Type of Racial Events
AN  - 2386130059
AB  - The impact of racial experiences on Whites has been underresearched and has rarely been considered traumatic. To understand these experiences, it is important to consider variation in one's orientation to their racial group (i.e., racial identity) and the type of racial encounter. Using a White adult sample and hierarchical cluster analysis, the authors found that reactions to race‐based encounters were associated with varying levels of psychological distress and well‐being and racial identity statuses. Clinical implications are discussed.Alternate abstract:El impacto de las experiencias raciales en personas blancas no ha sido suficientemente investigado y en raras ocasiones ha sido considerado traumático. Para comprender estas experiencias, es importante considerar la variación en la orientación de cada individuo hacia su grupo racial (es decir, la identidad racial) y el tipo de encuentro racial. Usando una muestra de personas adultas blancas y un análisis jerárquico de clústeres, los autores hallaron que las reacciones a los encuentros raciales estaban asociadas a niveles variables de malestar psicológico, así como de estados de bienestar e identidad racial.

T1  - Parallel Lives: Intergroup Contact, Threat, and the Segregation of Everyday Activity Spaces
AN  - 2360027179
AB  - Although intergroup contact can reduce prejudice, opportunities to experience such contact are often constrained by systems of segregation. Work on this problem has focused on divisions entrenched within institutions of residence, education, and employment. Our research employed a complementary approach, which treated segregation as the outcome of individuals' movements over time within everyday life spaces. Taking as a case study Catholics' and Protestants' use of public environments in north Belfast, we used GPS tracking technology, combined with GIS analytics, to explore the time geography of residents' activity space use over a 2-week period (Study 1). We also conducted a field survey to explore how psychological factors shaped their willingness to use activity spaces beyond their own communities (Study 2). Analysis based on around 1,000 hr of raw movement data revealed that north Belfast is marked by high levels of segregation, expressed via residents' limited use of public spaces, facilities, and pathways located in outgroup areas. However, use of shared spaces is also common, with Catholics spending more time in such spaces than Protestants. Structural equation modeling suggested that residents' self-reported willingness to use activity spaces outside their own communities was associated with both negative and positive intergroup contact-relationships partially mediated by realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anxiety over interaction across sectarian lines. Both kinds of contact and realistic threat were also associated with the time residents actually spent in spaces beyond their own communities. Opportunities for integrating psychological and geographic research on contact and segregation are highlighted.

T1  - Race, Ethnicity, and the American Criminal Justice System: The Perceptions and Experiences of West Indian Men
AN  - 2274303528
AB  - Using in-depth interview data from 30 young Black men of West Indian background, we examine their experiences with and perceptions of the American criminal justice system. Their experiences lead these men to contend that the system, especially police authorities, do not differentiate between Blacks based on ethnicity and subsequently treat West Indians and African Americans in a similar manner, that is, race trumps ethnicity. These men discuss their concerns about stereotypes of minorities, especially as they are reflected in the media, as the primary reasons for their treatment. However, these men also provide nuanced accounts in which not all system actors engage in discriminatory behavior. These accounts rest on an immigrant lens regarding criminal justice, which may indicate a more favorable outlook compared to their native-born Black counterparts. Overall, though, the interview data suggest that a Black–White divide regarding such perceptions will persist in an era of substantial sociodemographic change.

T1  - Contact theory in the workplace: The case of Jewish–Arab contact in Israel
AN  - 2187744612
AB  - Contact theory is a fundamental theory in social psychology, suggesting that contact between antagonistic groups can reduce prejudice and stereotypes. The current study applies former studies in evaluating a specific case of the connection between contact and attitudes toward minorities in work contexts. A survey was conducted using 873 Israeli Jews in order to assess their attitudes toward the Arab population in Israel and Arabs' work characteristics. The results indicated that the connection between intergroup contact and attitudes is complex. On the one hand, workplace contact between Israeli Jews and Arabs was significantly correlated with the willingness to meet Arabs in and outside the workplace and to perceive Arabs in a less threatening way. However, contact during work was not significantly correlated with the participants' general attitude toward the Arab population. In addition, contact during work was not found to be significantly correlated with the participants' perceptions about Arabs' personality traits or work characteristics. The results of this study also suggest that attitudes toward Arabs' work characteristics have a strong connection to other dimensions of attitudes toward Arabs, even more than the impact of contact during work.

T1  - Black-white Biracial Students’ Evaluations of Blackness: The Role of College in Shaping Racial Regard
AN  - 2406943508
AB  - This study explores biracial students’ racial regard, an evaluative component of racial identity that captures positive and negative feelings about the racial groups to which one belongs. Drawing on data from interviews with 62 black-white biracial students attending predominantly white institutions (PWIs) or historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), I explore the conditions of educational contexts that promote or hinder development of positive racial regard. HBCU students highlighted the importance of college for improving their evaluations of blackness, while narratives of improved regard were rare among PWI students. Students’ evaluations of blackness and descriptions of contact with black peers support contact theory’s propositions about the type of contact likely to improve racial attitudes; specifically, I show how HBCUs can improve racial regard by facilitating institutionally supported contact between equal-status black and biracial students in the pursuit of common goals. My findings also extend contact theory by suggesting another condition of contact that can improve evaluations of blackness: contact with a heterogeneous group of black peers. These findings add to the literature on biracial identity by exploring racial regard, an understudied dimension of racial identity with important mental health implications. The findings also speak to the importance of HBCUs for fostering positive racial regard at a time when the purpose and longevity of these institutions is often questioned.

T1  - Continuity and change in local immigrant policies in times of austerity
AN  - 2430231172
AB  - European cities are increasingly being recognised for the role they play in devising and implementing their own migration, integration and diversity policies. Yet very little is known about the local dimension of immigrant policymaking in crisis contexts. This introductory piece offers a rationale for analysing city-level immigrant policies in times of crisis and the salience of using crisis as a metaphor for the state of things, and outlines key scholarly works, debates, concepts and theories. It provides a range of historical and contemporary examples and considerations, and introduces an empirical city case study that is published as part of this mini-symposium. It argues that a crisis lens leads to a systematic understanding of local-level immigrant policymaking in recent and contemporary Western Europe. The mini-symposium’s focus and findings should be relevant to both on-going academic and policy debates.

T1  - “We for She”: Mobilising men and women to act in solidarity for gender equality: GPIR
AN  - 2072578501
AB  - Gender (in)equality is typically studied as a women’s issue to be addressed via systemic measures (e.g., government policy). As such, research focusing on mobilising men (and women) towards achieving gender equality is rare. In contrast, this paper examines the mobilisation of both men and women towards gender equality as common cause. Experiment 1 shows that men’s collective action intentions increase after reading messages that position men as agents of change towards gender equality, compared to messages that frame this issue as stemming from inadequate government policy. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that messages framing gender equality as an issue for both men and women increase men’s collective action intentions, compared to when gender inequality is framed as primarily concerning women. However, this effect emerges primarily under conditions where the source of message is male (Experiment 3). Practical and theoretical implications for mobilising political solidarity in gender equality contexts are discussed.

T1  - Thinking through race: white racial identity, motivated cognition and the unconscious maintenance of white supremacy
AN  - 2571083861
AB  - Recent research in political science has demonstrated the effects of implicit racism on whites’ political preferences and judgments. One startling finding from this research is that even white people who think of themselves as racially egalitarian can be influenced by implicit racism without intention or awareness. While this research has been useful for identifying the ways in which whites’ unconscious biases influence political decision-making, it leaves open the questions of how and why unconscious, yet racially motivated political cognition takes place. In this paper, I offer a theoretical model of white racial reasoning, during which whites think through their racial identity, interpreting and evaluating phenomena in the social environment in ways that allow them to protect a positive sense of self and racial group. I argue that well-meaning whites’ identity investments, and not antipathy toward outgroup members, drives cognitive processing and the political judgments that result. I conclude the paper with research-based strategies for political actors hoping to help whites resist racially coded appeals and encourage more egalitarian political judgments.

T1  - Marriage and Social Boundaries among British Pakistanis
AN  - 2114224179
AB  - A cosmopolitan environment offers challenges for cultural groups that seek to reproduce themselves in the next generation. British Pakistanis have not seen the kind of breakdown in marriage boundaries that characterizes other post-war migrants to Britain. The article examines how this pattern is linked to commitments to transnational marriage, which promise a source of future remittances to Pakistan. However, the need to maintain these links has exaggerated the importance of religious and moral display for British Pakistanis, and these have wider effects in the policing of social contact with outsiders and the negative portrayal of the sexual morality of non-Pakistanis.

T1  - Millennials and Race in the 2016 Election
AN  - 2031052338
AB  - In addition to being the most racially and ethnically diverse generation, millennials comprised an equal number of the voting-eligible population as baby boomers in 2016 and are projected to become the largest share of the American voting-eligible population by 2018. Drawing from several distinct datasets, this study explores three primary topics: (1) examining how race influenced the vote choice of millennials in the 2016 presidential election; (2) comparing partisanship and vote choice among white millennials to older whites; and (3) identifying differences between white millennials who voted in 2016 to those who did not cast a ballot. The study finds that young whites are the outlier category of their age group; being white is associated with a higher probability of voting for Donald Trump, even when accounting for the effects of racial resentment, partisanship, ideology, and other factors. While white millennials appear conservative relative to their peers of color, however, the preferences of young whites are more Democratic than older whites. Non-voting white millennials are more likely than their voting counterparts to identify as independents and ideological moderates, making them a political swing bloc as white millennials age. While political observers are quick to point to the liberal-leaning preferences of young people as a whole, disaggregating the 18-30 age group by race as this study suggests that the Democratic preferences displayed by millennials in the aggregate are largely driven by the cohort's racial and ethnic diversity.

T1  - Unpacking Chinese America: The Political Participation of Taiwanese Americans in the Early Twenty-First-Century United States
AN  - 2157620365
AB  - Who are (or can count as) Taiwanese Americans? To what extent and in what ways do they participate politically in the United States? This study attempts to unpack the concept of Chineseness by examining various formations of identity boundaries of Taiwanese Americans. We empirically assess their “success” in political participation and incorporation by analyzing patterns of political participation of U.S. voting-age adults who were born in or originated from Taiwan, as compared to those who were born in or originated from (Mainland) China and Asia as a whole. We argue that Taiwanese Americans occupy a distinct space in modern Asian American history and a better understanding of the experiences of this often overlooked and misunderstood community can further explicate the complexity of being Chinese in contemporary America. However, we discuss multiple sets of methodological challenges in systematically studying the population through U.S. census survey and several other types of quantitative data. Whereas we find immigrants originated from Taiwan to be generally more active in electoral politics than those from Mainland China, our findings challenge the pluralist assumptions of a linear process of political incorporation and reject an overtly simplistic characterization of Taiwanese Americans as a “model-minority” success story.

T1  - The role of race, ethnicity and tribal enrolment on asset accumulation: an examination of American Indian tribal nations
AN  - 1916702735
AB  - We analyse survey data from the National Asset Scorecard for Communities of Color Project for asset accumulation in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The survey oversampled the American Indian/Alaska Native population in order to examine asset accumulation among a variety of racial, ethnic and legal status groups. We examine differences in asset accumulation across tribal members from a variety of American Indian tribes. Additionally, we make comparisons across those that are tribally enrolled to those that are not tribally enrolled. We find substantial difference across tribal affiliation in our data once we disaggregate the category of American Indian. Our research adds a new dimension to the literature examining differences in wealth accumulation by race and political status for a little-studied group. Specifically, we examine the intersection of race and legal status in wealth and asset accumulation.

T1  - Perspectives and Experiences of DeafBlind College Students
AN  - 1929694236
AB  - DeafBlind individuals are resilient human beings who face significant and complex challenges in all aspects of life. Challenges include access to information, communication, academics, social activities, identity, independence, mobility, and moving around in the world. Recently, more DeafBlind students are attending higher education institutions. Therefore, this study focuses on discovering experiences and perspectives of DeafBlind college students who attend a bilingual and bicultural university for sighted Deaf students, where there are a limited number of DeafBlind students. Personal interviews and observations are used to explore how DeafBlind adults navigated college life and what coping strategies they used to overcome academic and social challenges. A grounded theory-based approach was used, as an analysis, as there is limited information and research available about DeafBlind college individuals. Insights and strategies are provided to support new DeafBlind students who plan to attend post-secondary education or are already attending college.

T1  - Queering Spirituality and Evolving Sexual Ethics
AN  - 1923057352
AB  - Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (GLBTIQ) people from culturally diverse and religious backgrounds may sometimes feel that we must choose between keeping connected to our religious/ethnic communities while denying our gender-identities/expressions and sexuality, or connecting to a broader Australian GLBTIQ-community that is White/Anglo-dominant and normatively hostile to overt expressions of faith, religiosity and spiritual longing. In this paper, I explore working definitions of the terms 'spirituality', 'religion' and queer corollaries of spiritual community, paying particular attention to non-religious secular manifestations. I will argue that gender, sexual and political liberation within a multicultural society can and must accommodate both pluralist and integrative approaches to seemingly paradoxical ideas around secularism and religiosity. I will discuss my experiences as a cisgender gay Buddhist Malaysian-Chinese Australian man and my relationships with a group of Asian gay men from religiously diverse backgrounds as case examples, to explore possible frameworks for how these may be manifested and enacted.

T1  - Tu Casa, Mi Casa: Naturalization and Belonging among Latino Immigrants: IMR
AN  - 1911516807
AB  - Previous studies reach contradictory conclusions regarding the relationship between residential concentration and naturalization. This paper tackles the impasse by exploring the pathways through which immigrant communities influence individual naturalization. Specifically, this study examines naturalization among Latino immigrants using the 2006 Latino National Survey linked to county data. Multilevel model results indicate that the county concentration of naturalized co-ethnics positively predicts individual naturalization, and this relationship operates through two channels: information dissemination and perceived belonging. Regarding the latter, Latino immigrants who live among naturalized co-ethnics identify more strongly as "American," and strength of American identification mediates nearly one-half of the relationship between concentration and naturalization.

T1  - The Coptic diaspora and the status of the Coptic minority in Egypt
AN  - 1884516402
AB  - This paper examines the political activity of the Coptic diaspora in the United States in support of the Coptic minority in Egypt. Analysing its strategy reveals that for years it has focused on lobbying the United States and international bodies, in order to raise international awareness of the Coptic minority status. By using this strategy, it has framed the struggle for Copts' rights in a manner that contradicts the Egyptian unity narrative, and the strategic choices of those they are struggling for. This paper shows that understanding the limitations of this strategy alongside a change in the structure of opportunities in Egypt has led to a change in the pattern of activity of the diaspora activists. Alongside lobbying for international involvement, they have developed additional strategies, including strengthening their influence in the homeland and even direct action vis-à-vis the Egyptian authorities. This paper, which emphasises the pattern of action of diaspora activists that represent minorities, directs attention to the structure of opportunities in the homeland, the variety of relationships between the diaspora and the homeland, and their effect on the ability of the diaspora activists to become a significant force in shaping the life of the minority.

T1  - Multiculturalism and secularism: Theoretical understandings and possible conflicts
AN  - 1891652175
AB  - Multiculturalism in a European context increasingly has come to denote a concern with religious minorities. Claims for multicultural accommodation of minorities therefore potentially conflict with secularist requirements of separation of politics and religion. Whether there is a conflict depends on the general understandings of multiculturalism and secularism. The paper therefore distinguishes and examines different general understandings. Both multiculturalism and secularism can be understood as sets of policies, or as forms of minority accommodation or views about the relationship between religion and politics defined in relation to liberalism. Both understandings are problematic, so the paper proposes alternative formal understandings of multiculturalism and secularism. Multiculturalism denotes interpretations of what underlying (often liberal) principles imply under new circumstances of diversity. Secularism denotes what such principles imply for the relationship between politics and religion. Such formal understandings provide theoretical frameworks for specifying different conceptions of multiculturalism and secularism and for determining in precisely which respects conflicts might arise. But the frameworks also indicate that conflicts are not general or necessarily fundamental, and they provide tools for reinterpreting conceptions in ways that might avoid apparent conflicts.

T1  - Education and Employment among Muslims in Indian Jammu and Kashmir
AN  - 1892718886
AB  - Muslims constitute about 14% population of India and are the largest religious minority community spread over the length and breadth of the country. The minority community in question has been relegated to the lowest socio-economic stratum in Indian society especially after the partition and independence of the country. However, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Muslims are in majority constituting about 67% population of the state. In the current study, the Concentration Index of Muslim population, variation in literacy rate and work participation, occupational structure across region and religion, as well as the interrelationship between concentration of Muslim population, literacy rate and work participation in Jammu and Kashmir has been explored and explained. The present study is based upon secondary information obtained from Census 2001 and is also supplemented with government reports, published work wherever necessary. As far as share of Muslims in the sphere of education and employment in the state of Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, they have reported lower share among the population of literates, category of other workers and higher share in the occupational category of cultivators, agricultural labourers, household industry workers and non-workers in comparison to all religious groups. This means that despite being in majority, their situation is similar to their co-religionists at the all India level.

T1  - A Foreigner Who Does Not Steal My Job: The Role of Unemployment Risk and Values in Attitudes toward Equal Opportunities: IMR
AN  - 1821572308
AB  - Immigration has become systematically politicized and opposed by many individuals. We examine individual attitudes toward equal opportunities for foreigners and Swiss citizens, using cross-sectional data from the Swiss Household Panel. Individuals with low levels of education tend to oppose foreigners, while the opposition by individuals with high levels of education increases with the risk of unemployment. Values and beliefs explain the negative attitudes of individuals with low levels of education, but not the association with the risk of unemployment for individuals with high levels of education. Clearly, both values and economic factors are important for explaining attitudes toward foreigners.

T1  - Occupational aspirations and ethnic school segregation: social contagion effects among native German and immigrant youths
AN  - 1809640290
AB  - In this study, I broaden the perspective on young immigrants' aspirations by looking at their social embeddedness in the host society in terms of their institutionally predefined ties to school peers. In particular, I investigate the relationship between the aspirations of immigrant and native youths with special regard to the social mechanisms that may underlie peer influences. My analyses are based on multilevel data on ninth graders from the German National Educational Panel Study. The results show that a high ratio of immigrants in schools positively influences the aspirations of both immigrant and native German youths by way of school climate. However, the same context has different effects on different groups of origin. For those of Turkish descent, 'ethnic schools' are of twofold significance: first, the aspiration gap between Turks and native Germans decreases with increasing segregation, an effect that may be attributable to less perceived discriminatory experiences in school. Second, Turkish young people's stronger adaptation to the climate in ethnically segregated schools reinforces the protective effect of ethnic segregation and, additionally, lowers the aspirations of these youths. That is, immigrants' stronger orientation towards their in-group seems to contribute to a buffer against discrimination.

T1  - Historicity and citizenship as conditions for national minority rights in Central Europe: old principles in a new migration context
AN  - 1809640287
AB  - Having a historical presence in a country and citizenship of that country are two basic conditions under which national minority rights are granted in many countries, but increasing international migration has started to pose a challenge to this conception. Like other countries of Central Europe, the Czech Republic has adopted the two conditions for granting rights to traditional 'national minorities' and has developed a separate policy for the 'integration of foreigners'; however, the emergence of the second generation of Vietnamese has presented a special challenge to this two-tier policy system. Recent renegotiation of the historicity of this immigrant group has resulted in its 'official recognition' as a national minority. This paper discusses this case in its wider Central European context, and addresses the question of whether we are observing an erosion of the two-tier policy system or a reconsideration of the distinction between 'old' and 'new' minorities. Finally, the paper touches upon the question of the role and usability of 'old' minority language rights, considering the lack of interest among the traditional minorities vs. the linguistic situation of the migrants' second generation.

T1  - Ethnicity as political cleavage: the political agenda of the Polish national minority in Lithuania
AN  - 1805242626
AB  - This article examines the role of ethnicity in the formation of political cleavage and is based on the analysis of the political agenda of the Polish national minority in Lithuania after the re-establishment of the independent state in 1990. It analyzes the political performance of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (EAPL), an ethnic-based "niche" political party that tends to keep a monopoly over the representation of interests of the Polish minority in Lithuania and collects a vast majority of the votes of citizens of Polish origin. The article considers how specific in comparison to the titular nation the interests of the Polish national minority are, and how different in comparison to the political agendas of other political parties the political agenda of the EAPL is.

T1  - Islamic Jurisprudence of Minorities (Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat): The Case of the Palestinian Muslim Minority in Israel
AN  - 1797943330
AB  - This article examines the doctrine of Jurisprudence of Muslim Minorities (Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat) in the context of the Palestinian Muslim community in Israel. The first part discusses the origins and goals of Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat. After outlining the particular historical and political context of the Palestinian minority in Israel, the article focuses on the ethno-religious political mobilization developed by the Muslim community vis-à-vis the state's strategies of control and domination, and points out the difficulties involved in the application of Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat, as used in "Western" states, for the reality that Muslims face in Israel. The article suggests a vigilant approach toward the Jurisprudence of Minorities, as we argue that, when applying it in this context of the Muslim community in Israel, this doctrine has two substantial limitations. The first is theoretical and it concerns the doctrine's current incapability to distinguish between different types of minorities, as well as failing to recognize a difference between various political regimes and societal lives that might be inherently less or more accommodating or even hostile to minorities, and Muslim minority communities in particular. The second limitation relates to the political dimension and the lack of consideration for the status of the Palestinian minority as an indigenous and national minority and not an immigrant minority. Their status as national minorities, at times also as indigenous peoples, who are perceived as entitled to group-based "self-government rights", poses a serious challenge to this doctrine's scope and viability.

T1  - Concealing Concealment: The Mediating Role of Internalized Heterosexism in Psychological Distress Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Older Adults
AN  - 1773059753
AB  - Recent population-based studies indicate that sexual minorities aged 50 and older experience significantly higher rates of psychological distress than their heterosexual age-peers. The minority stress model has been useful in explaining disparately high rates of psychological distress among younger sexual minorities. The purpose of this study is to test a hypothesized structural relationship between two minority stressors-internalized heterosexism and concealment of sexual orientation-and consequent psychological distress among a sample of 2,349 lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults aged 50 to 95 years old. Structural equation modeling indicates that concealment has a nonsignificant direct effect on psychological distress but a significant indirect effect that is mediated through internalized heterosexism; the effect of concealment is itself concealed. This may explain divergent results regarding the role of concealment in psychological distress in other studies, and the implications will be discussed.

T1  - Institutional Governance of Minority Religious Practices: Insights from a Study of Muslim Practices in Danish Schools
AN  - 1784152064
AB  - An increasing number of studies are concerned with the ways in which the religious practices of Europe's minority populations are accommodated on the political, national and local levels. In this article, I present a case study of Muslim practices in Danish schools. The study is an investigation of how and why six selected practices are governed in Danish schools: halal food, fasting, prayer, head scarves, holidays and mosques. The results underline the importance of the specific practice in question for the way in which it is governed: some practices are easily accommodated, while others are rejected outright by the schools. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how governance of Muslim practices is developed in the absence of national regulation and against the prevailing ideals in the Danish public debate. In fact, the governance developed seems to be a direct response to the number of Muslim children in school and in line with general school ideals of inclusion. However, the results also indicate that more direct involvement by local or national authorities might push schools to be more exclusive with regard to Muslim practices.

T1  - In Their Own Words: Mental Health and Quality of Life of West African Refugees in Nigeria
AN  - 1760244520
AB  - Refugees are exposed to extreme stressors and are therefore at risk of mental health and social problems. Other issues refugees have to cope with include the loss of their country, culture, language, profession, family, friends, and future plans. Much of the studies that have been done on refugee mental health have not attempted to explain what these experiences mean to these individuals. Thus, this study provides explorative data on the mental health and quality of life of West African refugees living in Nigeria in order to understand their views and perspectives. This study carried out in 2010 employed qualitative methods; a total of four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted among adult male and female refugees purposively selected at the Oru Refugee Camp, Ogun State, Nigeria. Respondents described quality of life as a major determinant of mental health status. Most of the participants believed that women were more predisposed to mental ill health due to their sensitive emotional make-up. Factors identified by respondents as affecting mental health and quality of life among refugees included poverty, unemployment, physical health, housing and environment, discrimination, stigmatization, and insecurity. Refugees rated their mental health and quality of life as poor due to the aforementioned factors. Recommendations were made to the international community, national and local governments to invest more on education, provision of vocational and entrepreneurial skills as well as adequate housing in order to improve the mental health and quality of life of refugees.

T1  - The Siren's Call? Exploring the Implications of an Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights on National Minorities
AN  - 1855325508
AB  - Calls for the adoption of an Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on National Minorities have persisted within the Council of Europe despite the adoption of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM). This article explores the potential implications of the adoption of an Additional Protocol on National Minorities to the ECHR for the FCNM. The European Court of Human Rights (ECTHR) already has several tools that would allow it to extend protection to persons belonging to national minorities. However, as the ECTHR tends to allow States a wide margin of appreciation in cases concerning persons belonging to minorities, it is argued that the adoption of an Additional Protocol on National Minorities may not be desirable, as it has the potential to undermine the progress made by the Framework Convention Advisory Committee.

T1  - Ethnicity and international security in the Far East from the perspective of national security
AN  - 1784139473
AB  - Ethnicity in the modern world impacts national domestic politics besides forming puzzles for the international environment. Simplifying ethnicity may result in obvious blunders, particularly regarding political issues. For instance, examining the ethno-political factor leads to the assumption that rioting ethnicity threatens both domestic and international securities, with ethnic conflicts having a powerful destructive potential. Amidst the global trends, ethnic processes are converting into a trigger of the contemporary international relations. This article aims to study the role of ethnicity as significant non-governmental actors from the perspective of national security in the Far East. The objectives of the study include researching contemporary security issues in Northeast Asia as well as novel possibilities for Russia in the process of the formation of the structures of security in Northeast Asia. The main aspect of the paper is to describe the ethnosystems of the Far East (the cases of Koreans, Tungus and Nanai) as independent coherent phenomena. It is important to show that international security is the major psychomental complex of the national system and via what mechanism this drive for international security may force adaptation by the ethnosystem. It is important to provide a concrete example of an ethnic process adapting to international security as an external pressure imposed externally. Methodology: This paper is based on the results of previous researches and findings, including the data containing information about the ethnopolitical situation in Northeast Asia as well as the interrelations among the neighbouring states and referred to the system analysis and the interdisciplinary approach.

T1  - Online discussion, politicized identity, and collective action: GPIR
AN  - 1752001007
AB  - Although online discussions may stimulate political participation, little is known about how computer-mediated communication among members of political groups contributes to develop their politicized identity, thus indirectly stimulating collective action. Two studies involving activists from two web-based social movements investigated how online discussions moderate the effects of collective efficacy, group-based anger, and moral obligation on politicized identity. Self-reported frequency of online discussions and activists' perceptions of two content-related characteristics of online discussions both interacted with collective efficacy and moral obligation beliefs in predicting politicized identity. Politicized identity mediated the effects of these interactions on collective action intention. We discuss how specific characteristics of online political discussions may contribute to politicize group identity via group-level and individual-level paths.

T1  - Everyday and Cosmo-Multiculturalisms: Doing Diversity in Gentrifying School Communities
AN  - 1784151417
AB  - Gentrification is transforming the class and ethnic profile of urban communities across the world, and changing how people deal with social and cultural difference. This paper looks at some of the social consequences of gentrification in Sydney, Australia, focusing on local schools. It argues that in this urban Australian context, the influx of middle-class Anglo-Australians into traditionally working-class, migrant-dominated areas is significantly changing how people relate to each other within local schools, often fragmenting and dividing school communities. These shifts are intensified by the public policy of school choice, which has enabled some parents to bypass their local school for a more 'desirable' one. This paper presents a close local study of two schools within one gentrifying Sydney suburb, examining how the schools have become more polarised. In particular, we examine how this demographic polarisation has given rise to two distinct modes of 'doing diversity', namely, 'everyday' and 'cosmo-multiculturalisms'. While the former is about daily, normalised encounters across difference, the latter is a form of multiculturalism based on strategic and learned 'appreciation' and consumption of difference, characteristic of gentrified communities.

T1  - "MARKING WHITENESS" FOR CROSS-RACIAL SOLIDARITY
AN  - 1733239733
AB  - The dramatic difference in typical Black and White lifeworlds--or sets of "cultural givens" assumed by Black and White Americans and used to interpret experience--impedes the development of a cross-racial solidarity oriented toward racial justice. If such a cross-racial solidarity is to be realized, actors must reorient the average White lifeworld in ways that make Whites more receptive to Black claims. I identify, theorize, and assess a particular strategy for transforming the dominant White lifeworld, and thus facilitating cross-racial solidarity, that directly confronts contemporary Whiteness: "marking Whiteness." The idea of "marking Whiteness" is abstracted from three different texts--the blog-turned-book Stuff White People Like, a satiric essay entitled "I Am a Martyr (And So Can You!): A Guide to White Male Victimhood" published in Esquire magazine, and the sketch comedy phenomenon Chappelle's Show. Interventions that "mark Whiteness" make Whiteness hyper-visible--as is characteristic of "marked" groups--and portray average White behavior and ideas as integral to the systemic reproduction of racial injustice. "Marking Whiteness" renders the racial polity visible, and makes contemporary Whites' complicity in racial injustice undeniable. While there are good reasons to be skeptical of the progressive credentials of any mass cultural product and popular texts are often subject to misinterpretation, popular culture should be recognized as an important site in lifeworld and solidarity construction and reconstruction.

T1  - RACE AS LIVED EXPERIENCE
AN  - 1733239649
AB  - A growing body of social science research has sought to conceptualize race as a multi-dimensional concept in which context, societal relations, and institutional dynamics are key components. Utilizing a specially-designed survey, we develop and use multiple measures of race (skin color, ascribed race, and discrimination experiences) to capture race as a "lived experience" and assess these measures' impact on Latinos' self-rated health status. We model these measures of race as lived experience to test the explanatory power of race, both independently and as an integrated scale, with categorical regression, scaling, and dimensional analyses. Our analyses show that our multiple measures of race have significant and negative effects on Latinos' self-reported health. Skin color is a dominant factor that impacts self-reported health both directly and indirectly. We then advocate for the utilization of multiple measures of race, adding to those used in our analysis, and their application to research regarding inequities in other health and social outcomes. Our analysis provides important contributions to research across a wide range of health, illness, social, and political disparities for communities of color.

T1  - Racial Differences in Self-Reports of Short Sleep Duration in an Urban-Dwelling Environment
AN  - 1761675321; 201602190
AB  - Objectives. To explore whether there are differences in sleep duration between blacks and whites residing in similar urban neighborhoods and examine whether the relationship between sleep durations and sociodemographic and/or health indices are consistent for blacks and whites. Methods. A total of 1,207 participants from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Disparities across the Life Span study (age: mean = 47, standard deviation = 8.74). Sleep duration was assessed by a self-report of hours of nightly sleep in the past month. Sociodemographic measures included age, sex, education, poverty status, and perceived neighborhood disorder. Health status was assessed using measures of vigilance, depression, perceived stress, coronary artery disease, diabetes, blood pressure, and inflammation. Results. There were no significant racial group differences in sleep duration. Whites, however, were more likely than blacks to report sleep durations of 7hr with increasing stress and education levels. Blacks were more likely than whites to report short sleep durations (i.e., 6-7hr vs. >7hr of sleep) with increasing inflammation levels. Discussion. Although racial disparities in sleep duration are minimized when the environment is equivalent between blacks and whites, the underlying demographic and health explanations for short sleep durations may vary between whites and blacks.

T1  - Social Capital and Mental Health among Brazilian Immigrants in Japan
AN  - 1700676271; 201525322
AB  - This study investigates the effect of social capital on the psychological well-being of Brazilian immigrants in Japan. Social capital in immigrants has drawn considerable attention from sociologists and other social scientists because many advanced countries have accepted a large number of immigrants from other countries. Previous studies of immigration in the US have emphasized the important role of bonding social capital with family and co-ethnic friends in helping immigrants obtain social and emotional support from others. Conversely, other studies of immigration in European countries have suggested that bonding social capital with co-ethnic members does not necessarily lead to better outcomes. These contrasting findings demonstrate that social capital is largely embedded in the institutional settings within which immigrants deploy it. In this study, we explored how the psychological well-being of Brazilian immigrants in Japan depended on different forms of social capital. The results indicate that despite the lack of economic resources in their ethnic communities, Brazilian immigrants benefited significantly from bonding social capital with their extended families in terms of improved mental health. This study suggests that the effectiveness of bonding social capital substantially differs in terms of the objective and subjective realities of immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Using Celebrity News Stories to Effectively Reduce Racial/Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1662632272
AB  - This article argues that exposure to admirable media celebrities from racial/ethnic outgroups is an effective, proactive, and viable strategy for prejudice reduction and intergroup harmony. It uses mediated contact and exemplification theories to demonstrate that reading news stories about likable outgroup media personalities who serve as counter-stereotypic exemplars can subtly modify racial attitudes, which are malleable and context-sensitive. Specifically, results from a between-participants experiment (N = 88) show that exposure to news stories about counter-stereotypic African American media personalities as compared to stereotypical ones reduces stereotypical perceptions and symbolic racist beliefs of White Americans about African Americans. Furthermore, these favorable attitudes translate into an increased willingness to support affirmative action policies.

T1  - Decolonizing Britain and Domesticating Women: Race, Gender, and Women's Work in Post-1945 British Decolonial and Metropolitan Liberal Reform Discourses: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1765993414
AB  - This article deploys an intersectional, transnational, and postcolonial approach to uncovering what is repressed and connoted in recent pronouncements that multiculturalism in Britain has failed and that it is time for Britain to return to a lost, indigenous, "active, muscular liberalism," one that must now reassert its authority at home and abroad. To grasp what is at stake in calls for the reinvigoration of an active, muscular liberalism as simultaneously the indigenous personality and identity of not only the British "people" and nation, but indelibly of the West, they must be located within the history of British colonialism and its intersections with white, Western, imperial patriarchy. This article does so by explicating the intersections of gender, race, and class in the post-1945 double-inscription of metropole and colony in British liberalizing social reform and national reconstruction projects, symbolized by two major British government reports published in the 1940s. These are the Moyne Report (GBCO 1945), which shaped the transition of Britain's Caribbean territories from colonial to independent nations, and the Beveridge Report (Beveridge 1942), which shaped the modern British welfare state. What becomes apparent in both reports is how ethnically and racially differentiated categories of women were produced, targeted, and deployed in British metropolitan and colonial state discourses concerning the management of women and reform of racial rule at home and abroad.

T1  - Cossacks and Indians? Métissage in Action
AN  - 1749279459
AB  - In 1914 a sojourner in Winnipeg commented on the city's "Ukrainian Indians" to underline its seeming lack of European sophistication. Some decades later, however, that pejorative connotation was no longer operational: the notion of a "Ukrainian Indian" living in Canada was now something to be celebrated. This dramatic turnabout came with the release in 2012 of a blockbuster "bio-pic" produced in Ukraine. The film ("Fire Crosser") depicts the career of a Soviet Ukrainian hero-fighter pilot, allegedly killed in action during World War Two, but discovered years later alive and well as the Ukrainian-speaking chief of a band of Iroquois not far from Montreal. The decades that separated these two polarities offered many opportunities for ethno-cultural interaction, primarily on the Prairies where the harsh realities of pioneering forced Ukrainian settlers to borrow survival techniques from nearby Aborigines, who were invariably highly attuned to the vicissitudes of the very wilderness that the Ukrainians had come to conquer. Life stories from this initial period of Ukrainian settlement generally describe such early encounters as positive, amiable experiences. A rare exception is the deadly skirmish imagined by the Canadian poet Yar Slavutych. In some instances, however, their proximity to Ukrainian settlements worked against the Aborigines, who unwittingly became convenient scapegoats for criminal acts and missing children. After World War Two, with the "success" of Canada's Ukrainian pioneering experience firmly acknowledged, a new factor surfaced: a Ukrainian empathy for the perceived stagnation and plight of Canada's Aborigines. In actuality, this awareness had been initiated earlier by sojourning writers from Soviet Ukraine; their stories in Ukrainian dramatized the tragic fate of Canada's downtrodden Aboriginal peoples.

T1  - The Ukrainian Canadian Chaplaincy during World War Two
AN  - 1749279365
AB  - This paper discusses the creation, development, and significance of the office of Ukrainian chaplaincy in the Canadian military forces during World War II. Seven Ukrainian chaplains—three from the Ukrainian Catholic Church of Canada and four from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada—served the approximately 32,000–35,000 military personnel. Of these, three chaplains served in England and two in Europe. The work of the chaplains is discussed as is the role of their superiors in Canada and abroad. The paper evaluates the significance of the Ukrainian chaplaincy in the military effort, as well as in the development of the post-WWII Ukrainian Canadian community.Alternate abstract:Cet article présente la création, le développement et l’importance du bureau de l’aumônerie ukrainienne dans les forces militaires canadiennes pendant la seconde guerre mondiale. Sept aumôniers ukrainiens – appartenant aux Églises ukrainiennes du Canada, dont trois catholiques et quatre orthodoxes – ont œuvré auprès d’environ 32,000–35,000 officiers et soldats. Parmi eux, trois ont servi en Angleterre et deux sur le continent européen. Nous étudions ici le travail de ces aumôniers, ainsi que le rôle de leurs supérieurs au Canada et outremer. Nous y évaluons aussi l’importance du rôle de l’aumônerie ukrainienne dans l’effort militaire, ainsi que dans le développement de la communauté canadienne ukrainienne d’après la seconde guerre mondiale.

T1  - The Ukrainian Cultural Landscape in Canada and Brazil: A Century of Change and Divergence
AN  - 1749278071
AB  - Between 1891 and 1914 thousands of Ukrainian peasants left their ancestral homeland in Western Ukraine to seek land on the agricultural frontiers of Western Canada and southern Brazil. Often these emigrants who left for radically different frontiers originated from the same districts and villages; some even came from the same families. The new landscapes created in Canada and Brazil by these Ukrainian pioneers reflected environmental differences between the Old World and the New. The Ukrainian landscape in Brazil showed the most immediate response to environmental change, but the isolation of the Brazilian communities meant that evidence of traditional folkways and aspects of material culture survived far longer in Ukrainian Brazilian areas than in Ukrainian Canadian communities. At the same time as these landscapes in the Ukrainian diaspora were evolving, the landscapes of the hearth area were also experiencing change. This paper is thus an attempt to consider the role of time, environmental change, and culture in three areas that are geographically widely separated, but retain certain cultural commonalities in radically different physical and political environments.

T1  - Are There Racial Gaps in High School Leadership Opportunities? Do Academics Matter More?
AN  - 1783935863
AB  - Participation in high school sports and leadership activities is typically associated with later adult earnings premia. In stark contrast to the large but diminishing racial disadvantage found in other measures of educational opportunity, this analysis of high school leadership development finds few examples of racial disadvantage in historical 1960 data, but an emerging disadvantage to black female students between 1972 and 2004. Earnings regressions reveal positive earnings premia to black women who engaged in sports and leadership activities as adolescents, but not to black men. Particularly large premia to higher math scores (or penalties to lower math scores) among black workers are also observed. These findings call into question any world-view in which U.S. wages are a simple function of observable worker qualifications, and highlight the continued need to monitor equitable access to educational opportunities in U.S. schools.

T1  - Minority Representation and Order Maintenance Policing: Toward a Contingent View
AN  - 1667952472; 201509625
AB  - Objective This article's aim is to test the impact of black political and bureaucratic representation on the rate at which blacks are arrested for order maintenance violations in U.S. cities. Methods Using data from the Law Enforcement Management and Administration Survey, the Census Bureau, and the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, for all U.S. cities over 100,000 population, the article first documents the continuing influence of black elected officials in promoting black representation on police forces. After establishing the appropriateness of order maintenance policing as a follow-up focus, the article then tests hypotheses that link variation in the rate of black order maintenance arrests to black political and bureaucratic representation, contingent upon form of government. Results Black political representation does constrain black order maintenance arrests, while black representation on the police force does not. Conclusion Even with a more racially representative police force in place, black political representation is what matters in constraining controversial patterns of police practice.

T1  - The Invisible Second Generation? Statistical Discrimination and Immigrant Stereotypes in Employment Processes in Norway
AN  - 1667952360; 201509576
AB  - Although children of immigrants usually have acquired fluency in the majority language as well as domestic educational qualifications and work experience, recent quantitative and experimental studies indicate that the 'second generation' experiences discrimination in accessing entry-level jobs in Europe. In this article, I take as my point of departure a field experiment documenting that descendants of Pakistani immigrants indeed face discrimination in the Norwegian labour market, and use data from in-depth interviews with 42 of the employers subjected to research in the experiment to explore the decision-making processes leading to the disadvantages observed. The qualitative material suggests that stereotypes associated with immigrants are inferred from ethnically distinct names by employers, and that negative experiences are generalised between ethnic groups and across generations. The implications for the employment opportunities of children of immigrants are potentially severe. Instead of experiencing equal access to the labour market, they encounter attitudes and stereotypes attached to their parents' generation, making their domestic educational qualifications and linguistic fluency 'invisible' in the eyes of employers.

T1  - Inequality in the United States and Germany: Facts, Interpretations, and Blind Spots
AN  - 1667952741; 201509547
AB  - In the past few years, there has been renewed attention paid to issues of inequality in the Atlantic. Relatively, high inequality has been an important topic of discussion in the US for a long time. Apart from analysis of inequality between race groups (which in the US is closely linked to a history of slavery and the subsequent segregation and disenfranchisement of African-Americans), much of the focus of debates on inequality have focused on income inequality. On many fronts, the inequality situation in Germany is more favorable than in the US. Income inequality is markedly lower in Germany than in the US, although it has also risen substantially. Different beliefs on both sides of Atlantic about the facts on inequality and mobility may play a role. Politics seem to play an important role, too. Both factors have generally reduced state intervention to address inequality. In a much more consensus-oriented Germany, centrist governments have felt the need to address equity issues much more forcefully. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Managing diversity: How leaders' multiculturalism and colorblindness affect work group functioning
AN  - 1700674229; 201524898
AB  - Workforces are becoming increasingly diverse and leaders face the challenge of managing their groups to minimize costs and maximize benefits of diversity. This paper investigates how leaders' multiculturalism and colorblindness affect cultural minority and majority members' experiences of connectedness (feeling accepted or distancing from group) and relationship conflict in their group. We collected data from 29 culturally diverse student work groups and their leaders. We used repeated measures (baseline and follow-up) of group functioning and independent measures of members' and leaders' diversity perspectives. Multilevel analyses revealed that leaders' diversity perspectives affect work group functioning, controlled for members' own perspectives: Leaders' multiculturalism predicted feeling accepted in the group for minority members. In contrast, leaders' colorblindness predicted distancing from the group and relationship conflict for minority members. There were no significant effects of leaders' diversity perspective on majority members and no reverse effects of prior group functioning on leaders' diversity perspectives.

T1  - The temporal variation of ethnic segregation in a city: Evidence from a mobile phone use dataset
AN  - 1559006723; 201432020
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the temporal variation of ethnic segregation in the city of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. We employ data on mobile-phone use to compare variations in segregation indices during the day, the week, and the year. The results indicate that the locations of people are more segregated at night, with considerably less segregation during the daytime. The segregation is significantly lower on workdays compared to weekends. Segregation is also lower during summer holidays compared to the winter working period. The results show that although places of residence are segregated, different ethnic groups use the city together during the day, which increases the potential for interethnic contacts. The results demonstrate also that temporal segregation indices based on mobile-phone use are considerably lower than segregation indices of places of residence that are derived from the census.

AN  - 1692290273; 201521385
AB  - Social, scientific, and ethical factors underscore the value of respectfully including people with intellectual/developmental disabilities in research despite significant barriers to their research participation. In pursuit of this goal, we worked with two research advisors with intellectual/developmental disabilities to develop a qualitative study toolkit emphasizing accessibility, flexibility, variety, and responsiveness. The toolkit includes procedures and materials for recruitment, consent, interview locations and questions, breaks, and incentives. We recommend that future research utilizes insights of individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities in research that impacts their lives, and that researchers systematically improve the use of procedures and toolkits.

T1  - Multicultural desires? Parental negotiation of multiculture and difference in choosing secondary schools for their children
AN  - 1650147669; 201502144
AB  - This paper considers the ways in which parents talk about choosing secondary schools in three areas of Greater Manchester. It argues that this can be a moment when parents are considering their own attitudes to, and shaping their children's experiences of, multiculture. Multiculture is taken as the everyday experience of living with difference. The paper argues that multiculture needs to be understood as shaped not only by racialized, ethnic or religious difference (as it is commonly understood) but also by other differences which parents may consider important, particularly class and approaches to parenting. We stress the need to examine what parents say about schooling in the context in which they are talking, which is shaped by local areas and the experiences of their children in primary schools. Based on interviews with an ethnically mixed groups of parents from different schools, we show how perceptions of the racialized and class demographics of schools can influence parents' choice of secondary schools. The paper also argues that attention needs to be paid to the ways in which terms such as 'multicultural' and 'mix' are applied uniformly to very different contexts, be they particular schools or local areas, suggesting there is a paucity of language in Britain when talking about multiculture.

T1  - Diversity and the economy: a cross-country, comprehensive study
AN  - 1559007256; 201431944
AB  - Using Alesina et al.'s (2003) fractionalization indices that separately measure ethnic (E), linguistic (L) and religious (R) diversity for 180 countries, a cluster analysis is performed to group the countries into three distinct clusters based on their similarities in the three diversity measures. Given these country clusters, this study examines how these different clusters perform, on average, in regard to thirteen different economic and political indicators. The results presented for the economic indicators suggest that ethnic and linguistic diversity measures might be relatively more important in affecting economic outcomes compared to religious diversity. In terms of the political indicators considered in this analysis, the countries in the most ethnically, linguistically and religiously diverse cluster performed statistically lower on average relative to the other country clusters.

T1  - Maintaining Hierarchies in Predominantly White Organizations: A Theory of Racial Tasks
AN  - 1512220991; 201408920
AB  - Predominantly White workplaces are environments in which Whiteness is privileged in numerous ways. Studies show workers of color doing self-presentation, emotion work, and other forms of social interaction intended to help ease the difficulties associated with being in the minority. In addition to the expectation that they smooth interactions with White peers, workers of color are assigned positions and tasks which reinforce that racial status quo. In this theoretical article, we attempt to place these various processes under an umbrella term we define as 'racial tasks.' We examine the ideological, interactional, and physical labor racial minorities perform in mostly White work settings, and the ways these racial tasks vary at different levels of the organizational structure. We consider the ways that the tactics and requirements associated with racial tasks maintain the racial hierarchy of predominantly White organizations and conclude by examining the implications of this work for racial minorities.

T1  - LIFE IN DUALITY: BIRACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT
AN  - 1767329278; 201606113
AB  - Biracial college students are an often overlooked student population in literature relating to college students, indicating the need to further explore their experiences and development throughout higher education. Their unique positions in society may afford them privileges that many minorities are not privy to while simultaneously disqualifying them from advantages associated with mono-racial Americans. Exploring how these students make sense of and navigate their higher education surroundings serves as the foundation for this research. Many biracial college students live in duality, understanding both their Black identity coupled with their White identity. This may present a challenge for some biracial students in higher education, given that the collegiate years are a prime time for self-discovery and identity development. This article will discuss historical perspectives that may speak to the position of biracial college students, explore the current literature on biracial identify development, and seek to understand the perspectives of a biracial college student at a predominately White institution in the south.

T1  - IMPACT OF SELF-CONSTRUAL ON CHOICE OF ENTERPRISE SOCIAL MEDIA FOR KNOWLEDGE SHARING
AN  - 1622297808; 201438278
AB  - Researchers have rarely focused on organizations choosing the right knowledge-sharing media according to users' individual-level variables such as self-construal. In this paper, the authors investigated the impact of self-construal (independent vs. interdependent) and organizational relationship (ingroup vs. outgroup) on employees' motivation, self-efficacy, and openness of sharing through two widely adopted online knowledge-sharing social media: Wikipedia and a question and answer (Q&A) archive. Quantitative responses to 4 scenarios were collected from 232 Chinese employees. The results indicated that when sharing with outgroup members, interdependent employees (but not independent employees) had higher self-efficacy and openness of sharing using Wikipedia than using Q&A. No difference between the two social media was found in the ingroup sharing. Theoretical implications and implications for practicing managers are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Resentment of Paternalism as System Change Sentiment: Hostile Sexism Toward Men and Actual Behavior in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 1559004887; 201431889
AB  - Taking inspiration from Glick and colleagues (2004), this study tested the idea that resentment of paternalism (which is part of the hostile sexism toward men construct) might approximate desire for system change by correlating this variable with actual behavior associated with system change in a single culture. Specifically, voting behavior in the 2008 U.S. presidential election was predicted from political party affiliation, measures of hostile and benevolent sexism toward both women and men, and egalitarian racial attitudes using a U.S. college student sample. Results indicated that the only significant predictors of voting behavior were political party affiliation, resentment of paternalism, and egalitarian racial attitudes. Higher levels of resentment of paternalism were in fact associated with voting for the ticket that represented system change-holding the other predictors constant. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Dogla politics? Questioning ethnic consociationalism in Suriname's national elections of 25 May 2010
AN  - 1512220209; 201408849
AB  - This paper asks to what extent Suriname's consociational democracy still rests on its historically shaped meta-ideology of ethnic essentialism. Based on ethnographic data of the country's national elections in 2010, I suggest that the 'ethnic taboo' of ethnic mobilization by politicians was present to a certain extent. However, this taboo was challenged by the nationalist turn of Desi Bouterse's National Democratic Party. Furthermore, when considering voting behaviour and that of ethnically mixed Doglas in particular, we see that Surinamese politics is more complex. I will argue that while we have been thinking about Surinamese politics as being on a par with ethnic groupings, these 2010 elections were not simply about ethnicity. Ethnicity may have informed but did not fully explain people's political choices, because people are too complex to be captured in an exclusively ethnic category, and because the Surinamese political system is too complex to maintain clear ethnic categories.

T1  - Culture, Intermarriage, and Immigrant Women's Labor Supply
AN  - 1459833506
AB  - We examine the impact of culture on the work behaviour of second-generation immigrant women in Canada. We contribute to the literature by analysing the role of intermarriage in intergenerational transmission of culture and its effect on labour market outcomes. Using female labour force participation and total fertility rates in the country of ancestry as cultural proxies, we find that culture affects the female labour supply. Cultural proxies are significant in explaining number of hours worked by second-generation women with immigrant parents. The impact of culture is significantly larger for women with immigrant parents who share the same ethnic background than for those with intermarried parents. The weaker effect of culture for women raised in intermarried families stresses the importance of intermarriage in assimilation process. Our findings imply that government policies targeting women's labour supply may have differential effects on the labour market behaviour of immigrant women of different ancestries.              Policy Implications              The result that culture has statistically significant impact on second-generation immigrant women's labour supply has policy implications in terms of the government programmes and benefits that target the labour supply of women and immigration policies in general.              Our findings imply that government policies targeting women's labour supply may have differential influence on the labour market behaviour of second-generation immigrant women of different ancestries.

T1  - War by Other Means: Cultural Policy and the Politics of Corporate Consociation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
AN  - 1512219360; 201408797
AB  - Civil war obliterates memories of past coexistence. Yet, memories can also be erased through peacetime denial of legitimacy and funding to institutions preserving artifacts and remains testifying to a past of cultural hybridity. This article examines the interplay between cultural policy and constitutional framework in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to explain the recent closure of Sarajevo's museums. It argues that the institutions' demise reflects a new state-building project founded on the separate development of mutually exclusive cultural and ethnic communities. Amnesia about past coexistence is instrumental to the political stability of BiH's corporate consociation but may hamper long-term conflict resolution. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Dialogue and interethnic trust: A randomized field trial of 'sustained dialogue' in Ethiopia
AN  - 1463011772; 201345874
AB  - The growing field of peacebuilding has tried to mitigate interethnic conflicts by creating various sorts of dialogue programs, aiming to build social bonds and bridges between individuals from groups with a history of violent interaction. Yet, little is known of the effect of dialogue initiatives on interethnic relations and peacebuilding. Previous research on dialogue programs has suffered from the serious problem of selection bias: in other words, by not having comparable control groups it has not been possible to separate selection effects (that a program attracts certain types of people) from process effects (that programs have an effect on people). The present study is the first to examine the effects of a dialogue process in a context of political tension and ethnic violence through a randomized field experiment, thereby eliminating this problem. Using a stratified randomization process, participants were selected to a two-term Sustained Dialogue program at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, in 2009-10. Immediately following the dialogue intervention, an attitudinal survey and a behavioral trust game were conducted with a group of 716 participants and non-participants. We found that the program had a positive effect on participants' attitudes: it worked for decreasing mistrust and increasing the level of trust between people of different ethnic origins. Concurrently, however, participation in the dialogue program increased the sense of importance of ethnic identities as well as the perception of being ethnically discriminated -- a somewhat counter-intuitive finding. Participation in dialogue processes had no significant effect on game behavior: participants in Sustained Dialogue were neither more trusting nor trustworthy than non-participants. This study shows the fruitfulness of randomized field-experiments in the area of peace and conflict research and finishes by identifying some important paths for future research.

T1  - Immigration and Perceived Ethnic Threat: Cultural Capital and Economic Explanations
AN  - 1429640202; 201335783
AB  - This article aims to study to what extent the share of immigrants in a country influences individuals' perceptions of ethnic threat and how this can be explained by theories of economic and cultural threat. Following an economic logic, people with a weak socio-economic position should have a greater perception of ethnic threat. This would be more so if the share of low-educated immigrants in a country was relatively high. Following a cultural logic, greater perceptions of ethnic threat should be found among individuals with a weak cultural position, which would apply more strongly if the share of non-Western immigrants in a country was relatively high. Both theories are studied using data from the first round of the European Social Survey, enriched with country-specific variables. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the theories under scrutiny and in the light of current scientific debates about the influence of immigration on Western societies.

T1  - Transnational Ties During a Time Of Crisis: Israeli Emigration, 2000 To 2004
AN  - 1417521740; 201331909
AB  - Despite their impressive patterns of economic mobility and generally successful adaptation into Western host societies, Israeli emigrants frequently view their stay abroad through the perspective of Zionism. As such, they express ambivalence about their presence on foreign soil. They seldom describe themselves as host country nationals, commonly socialize with other Israelis, frequently describe their intentions to return home, and often do so. However, recent events may challenge this outlook. During the 1990s, Israel's significant demographic and economic growth, relatively peaceful relations with neighbouring countries and increasingly globalized economy had the effect of lessening the stigma on going abroad. Then, since the fall of 2000, Israel has been rocked by the Al Aksa Intifada, as well as a major recession. These events have made life more difficult for Israelis. Accordingly, conditions of the last several years can be seen as altering Israelis' motives for emigration and simultaneously shifting the probability of return among those already overseas. While a topic of interest in its own right, the experience of Israeli emigrants since late 2000 also offers a natural experiment for evaluating how theories about migrant transnationalism consider the consequences of specific events upon relations with citizens abroad. This paper relies on in-depth interviews and other data sources to explore Israeli emigrants' views about remaining in host societies versus returning to Israel since late 2000. In so doing, it considers how emigrants evaluate potential benefits, costs and feelings of identification associated with residence overseas versus Israel. The paper also seeks more general insights into how relations between migrants and the country of origin are altered when events affect political and economic conditions in the country of origin.

T1  - Transnationalism and Community Building: Chinese Immigrant Organizations in the United States
AN  - 1364702648; 201323628
AB  - An emergent literature on transnationalism has been burgeoning since the 1990s to examine new patterns of immigrant settlement. Research to date has emphasized the effects of transnationalism on the development in sending countries rather than receiving countries, focused on immigrant groups from Latin America rather than Asia, and examined individuals rather than immigrant organizations as units of analysis. As a consequence, we do not have reliable knowledge about the impacts of transnationalism on immigrant communities in the host society and the extent and sources of intergroup variations. To fill this gap and to supplement knowledge gained from Latin American experiences, this article offers a conceptual framework for analyzing the relationship between transnationalism and community building by examining Chinese ethnic organizations in the United States. We show that immigrants often engage their ancestral homelands via organizations and that organizational transnationalism contributes to strengthening the infrastructure and symbolic systems of the ethnic community and enhancing the community's capacity to generate resources conducive to immigrant incorporation.

T1  - Ethnicity: Fault Lines among "Our People"
AN  - 1494751764; 201402091
AB  - This paper addresses the extent to which migrants' identity in a new place is contingent on ideas of "ethnicity", using the case study of Serbs in London. It aims firstly to examine what "ethnicity" means, and the different dimensions of identity and circumstance that inform this. It then aims to deconstruct the notion of ethnicity by exploring the different ways in which ethnic markers are used in different spaces, and interactions with "other" ethnic groups in the city. The research methodology consisted of qualitative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 66 Serbian migrants, and participant observation with a further 20 households, in London. The sampling strategy was reflexive in order to ensure the inclusion of a wide range of migrant experiences according to different socio-political, economic and spatial backgrounds. The findings reveal a diversity of conceptualisations of what "being Serbian" means, signifying that this is not a concrete or quantifiable measure. However, certain broad patterns did emerge, in the sense that those who expressed the ability to "choose" their ethnicity were more likely to be those with sufficient cultural, economic, social and human capital that enabled them to negotiate this situationally. Another key feature that emerged was that "ethnicity" may be the easy label given to what are in fact class and migrant status-based identities, depending on where people are positioned within the socio-political matrix. This, and particularly workplace based identities and migrant status -- rather than ethnic qualities -- also affected the perceived boundedness from ethnic "others" within the city.

T1  - Exclusion of HIV-positive people with disabilities in the media
AN  - 1541997148; 201426880
AB  - This current issue piece aims to address the harmful exclusion of people with disabilities in the Iranian media. In a case study, this author collected news related to statistics of HIV-positive people covered by popular news websites written in the Persian language between June 2011 and June 2012. Within the analysed electronic texts, no reference was made to the number of HIV-positive people with disabilities. Under the rubric of critical discourse analysis, one can argue that this lack of representation may also be linked to a more general level of discourse that constitutes the marginalization of people with disabilities. This damaging exclusion both legitimizes and reproduces the ideology that people with disabilities are social minorities who can be excluded to the benefit of powerful people. This current issue piece also discusses the potential negative consequences of excluding HIV-positive people with disabilities from the discourse of HIV/AIDS in the media. Ultimately, the conceivable reasons for the Iranian government failure or refusal to publish the statistics of HIV-positive people with disabilities will be provided. Studies from various countries could shed more light on the exclusion of HIV-positive people with disabilities in the media and the interplay between HIV/AIDS and disability issues.

T1  - The embodiment of British Italian war memory? The curious marginalization of Dennis Donnini, VC
AN  - 1283643178; 201303480
AB  - Ugolini examines the contested nature of Second World War commemoration among the Italian diasporic community in Britain. Traditionally, many ethnic groups in Britain use evidence of war-time military service as a way of forging a sense of belonging in the national imaginary but Italian memorialization tends to focus on the war-time experience of internment rather than service in the British forces. In particular, Ugolini assesses the communal neglect of the heroic story of Fusilier Dennis Donnini, a Victoria Cross winner of Italian parentage. She argues that the silence surrounding second-generation Italians who fought in British uniform reflects the durability of the concept of the 'good Italian' that prevailed in the interwar period when Mussolini's Fascist regime aimed 'to secure the allegiance' of diasporic communities to the Fascist movement in Italy. The configuration of the 'enemy alien' internee as the 'good Italian' within memorial activity reinforces the historiographic displacement of the experiences of those who served, and died, in British uniform. While Dennis Donnini VC embodies heroism and martial valour, his experience does not conform to the dominant narrative of war-time victimhood that, in turn, succeeds in diverting attention away from the complexities of Italian diasporic allegiances and an interwar communal elite compromised by it apparent support of Fascism.

T1  - Model Blacks or "Ras the Exhorter": A Quantitative Content Analysis of Black Newspapers' Coverage of the First Wave of Afro-Caribbean Immigration to the United States
AN  - 1125220591; 201240517
AB  - This article examines the depiction of first-wave West Indian immigrants to the United States in Black print culture in the early 20th century. The authors conduct a series of content analyses of four newspapers that had wide circulation in the Black community between 1910 and 1940. Each content analysis serves as an empirical test one of four common hypotheses about ethnic differentiation between West Indians and African Americans: (a) the group consciousness hypothesis, (b) the racial nationalism hypothesis, (c) the radical politics hypothesis, and (d) the model minority hypothesis. The authors find very little empirical support for either the group consciousness hypothesis or the racial nationalism hypothesis and find only a modicum of support for the radical politics hypothesis. Finally, the authors find evidence confirming the model minority hypothesis. They also find that the Black press presented an accurate portrayal of the West Indian immigrants' socioeconomic advantages to native-born Blacks.

T1  - Cleaning Up the Dirty Work: Professionalization and the Management of Stigma in the Cosmetic Surgery and Tattoo Industries
AN  - 1283640126; 201303108
AB  - This article considers the similarities between the cosmetic surgery and tattoo industries, focusing on how each has transitioned from a disreputable and deviant industry to achieve varying degrees of mainstream acceptance and success. Specifically, each industry is conceptualized as engaging in "dirty work" requiring practitioners to actively reframe and legitimate their respective industry. Using Event Structure Analysis, I model and compare the development of each industry based on linear historical narratives. The resulting models illustrate the importance of events within each narrative along with their relationship to each other. Findings suggest that the creation of industry-wide professional organizations is integral to changing public perception of a given industry. Furthermore, findings show that the more hierarchical structure of the cosmetic surgery industry, as well as its integration into the medical industry, have helped it to thrive in a manner that contrasts sharply with the more disorganized structure of the tattoo industry.

T1  - Name change and destigmatization among Middle Eastern immigrants in Sweden
AN  - 1037875354; 201231016
AB  - Research has shown that individuals in Sweden with foreign-sounding surnames who take on more Swedish-sounding or neutral surnames have a positive earnings progression compared to individuals who keep their foreign-sounding names. This article explores the strategies underlying these surname changes. I draw on forty-five interviews from a population of individuals with Middle Eastern backgrounds who changed surnames during the 1990s. Drawing on stigma and destigmatization theory, I argue that immigrant name change, a strategy typically associated with cultural assimilation, is a destigmatization strategy aiming for pragmatic assimilation. Through passing (as either Swedish or non-Middle Eastern), immigrants may keep the benefits of maintaining ethnic identity in their private life and the benefits of more easy public interactions outside the ethnic group. This study also illustrates how the institutional enabling of name change both creates and enables pragmatic assimilation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Greek American Identities in the 21st Century: A Generational Approach
AN  - 1641424405; 201500227
AB  - For more than a century, researchers have attempted to interpret and understand the assimilation/acculturation process and identity of immigrant ethnic groups in the United States. During the early 1900s, the term melting pot came into general usage to describe the emergence of the new immigrant American. Based on both the metaphor and the sociological melting pot theory, it was assumed that immigrants like ingredients mixed in a pot, would eventually blend into one mainstream culture and lose their own distinctions over time. It was concluded that by the third generation, grandchildren of immigrants would have completely assimilated into the American society, leaving behind all traces of ethnicity. Subsequent studies supported this hypothesis by demonstrating that ethnic Americans become less ethnic over several generations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mobilizing Race, Class, And Gender Discourses In A Metropolitan Community Church
AN  - 1347781261; 201318921
AB  - Drawing on principles of intersectionality, I explore how members of a southeastern Metropolitan Community Church use race, class, and gender discourses to construct and signify moral identities as Christian sexual minorities. Based on fourteen months of fieldwork, I demonstrate how members mobilized discourses emphasizing the incorporation of racial diversity, the minimization of class distinctions, and the equalization of gender categories within the church to signify their own moral worth. Moreover, I show how members anchored these discourses in the authority of Biblical scripture, which allowed them to claim moral standing within the larger Christian tradition while minimizing the tension between their sexual and religious identity claims. In conclusion, I draw out two central implications of this work: (1) how race, class, and gender discourses may provide symbolic resources for integrating sexual and religious identities and locally constructing sexual and religious morality; and (2) the importance of intersectional analyses for assessing LGBT religious experience.

T1  - Cross-Cultural Equivalence of a Measure of Perceived Discrimination Between Chinese-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans
AN  - 1266144761; 201300351
AB  - This article examines the cross-cultural equivalence of the Williams Everyday Discrimination Scale with 484 Vietnamese-Americans and 586 Chinese-Americans from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). Reliability and validity analyses were conducted to determine the cross-cultural comparability of the scale between the Vietnamese and Chinese samples in the data. Results indicated that five items out of the original nine which captured a perceived sense of unfair treatment were comparable between the two samples. These results suggest that this five-item scale can be used in future research in identifying culturally and ethnically different causes and consequences of perceived discrimination.

T1  - From Avatar to Reality: Development, Environment and the Representation of Cameroonian Pygmies
AN  - 1125223879; 201240410
AB  - This article discusses the challenges facing indigenous peoples when external interventions are conducted in their territories. Using a discourse analysis approach, it shows how indigenous peoples are constructed by groups pursuing diverging interests. Focusing on the case of Cameroonian Pygmies, three discourses are studied: the conservationist, the development and the pro-indigenous peoples discourses. The result of the analysis shows how indigenous peoples are represented and which values and norms stand out in discourses. It highlights how the construction of one's own reality can advantage or disadvantage groups of peoples: Pygmies represent a threat to the environment for environmentalists, they are poor for development actors, and they are above all mistreated for those defending their rights. The underlying theme is the transition to "modernity", its inevitability or imposition, as well as the resistance and adaptation of indigenous peoples to external influences.

T1  - The Politics of Victimization and the Model Minority
AN  - 1567044211; 201435059
AB  - The notion of injury or victimization is often problematically identified with debates on African American racial formation within U.S. ethnic literature and film. This essay, however, will argue that victim narratives and the myth of the model minority are different but related discourses. Ang critiques Chang-rae Lee's novel A Gesture Life and argues that the model minority discourse, the act of labeling some minorities but not others as "good," perpetuates the kind of systemic violence that affects all minorities, and demonstrates how the declarations of moral right--or wrong--enable the formation or renegotiation of national or racial identities.

T1  - Race and Criminology in the Age of Genomic Science
AN  - 1283644166; 201303497
AB  - Objective: To survey the contemporary literature in the social and biological sciences relevant to race that examines both the reality and the usefulness of the concept. Race is considered a major correlate of criminal behavior, and thus a fresh look at the concept is of obvious importance to criminologists and sociologists. Method: Social, genetic, medical, and criminology databases were keyword searched for articles on race that either addressed its existence/nonexistence or usefulness as a concept. Results: We find that biologist and social constructionists talk past one another and never venture beyond the comfort of their own positions. Genetic studies using very few chromosomal loci find that genetic polymorphisms divide human populations into clusters with almost 100 percent accuracy and that they correspond to the traditional anthropological categories. Conclusion: There is much to gain by recognizing that these categories differ genetically, and that we can dispense with the term race in favor of some other term such as population or ethnic group and nothing would be lost except a word.

T1  - Conversion vs. Tolerance: Minority-focused influence strategies can affect group loyalty
AN  - 964198136; 201207182
AB  - Past research has documented that social change has different implications for group identification when it is effected through successful minority's advocacy for tolerance of diversity vs. conversion of opponents to supporters. Extending these findings, the current study demonstrated that minorities who successfully advocated tolerance, compared to those who successfully converted opponents, were more loyal to the group. This was evident in their working harder for the group at their own personal expense and without expecting anything in return. The effect of influence strategy on group loyalty was mediated by evaluative and cognitive components of group identification. Implications for group dynamics in which active minorities employ different influence strategies and their motivational underpinnings are discussed.

T1  - Pakeha Women and Maori Protocol: The Politics of Criticising Other Cultures
AN  - 1023030702; 201223820
AB  - Feminists have fiercely debated whether it is wrong for outsiders to criticise gendered customs and practices identified with cultural minorities. This article explores the ethics of criticising other cultures by analysing the reaction to public criticism of Maori ceremonial protocol by two Pakeha women. It argues that the response to outsiders' criticism does not depend in a simple and direct way on whether insiders have resisted the criticised practice. There is a history of Maori women formulating critiques of the gender roles in Maori ceremonies, but the public response from Maori women to the Pakeha women's criticism was overwhelmingly negative. The outsiders' criticism was understood as an attack on the incorporation of Maori cultural expression into the public sector, rather than as a gesture of support or solidarity.

T1  - Diverse Pathways to Immigrant Political Incorporation: Comparative Canadian and U.S. Perspectives
AN  - 1023029110; 201225047
AB  - In both Canada and the United States, immigration is producing major demographic and sociocultural changes. Yet relatively little research has been devoted to the impact of immigration on each country's political life. Even less attention has been paid to comparing the patterns of immigrant political participation in both countries. This has left underinvestigated a host of important questions about the body politic of Canada and the United States: Measured at national, urban, and community scales, do immigrants in the two countries become integrated into formal politics such as voting and running for elected office? Are they engaged in more informal political activities such as community and ethnic organizing? If so, then how do various immigrant communities mobilize politically, form agendas and alliances, express their voices, and expand their opportunities? As more countries and cities around the world become immigration destinations, there is much to be learned about creating inclusive political systems from the comparative experience of Canada and the United States illustrated in this volume.

T1  - Cyberbomb: Effects of being ostracized from a death game
AN  - 1910239667
AB  - Recent research has shown that ostracism is distressful regardless of mitigating circumstances, providing evidence that humans are hard-wired to be hypervigilant to ostracism cues. Arguing that it is also highly adaptive to avoid being in a situation that signals a threat to survival we reasoned that the immediate distress to ostracism would be mitigated in a game of bomb-toss (Cyberbomb) compared to a game of ball-toss (Cyberball). Results showed that such a symbolic threat to survival is able to reduce the immediate distress caused by ostracism (Study 1 and Study 2), and--when the negative consequences of not surviving are highlighted--still powerful enough to induce aggression to fellow game players (Study 2). Taken together the studies speak to the often assumed but relatively untested relation between exclusion and survival that has been proposed in theories on belonging, exclusion and ostracism.

T1  - The next generation of Assyrians in Sweden: religiosity as a functioning system of meaning within the process of acculturation
AN  - 1023024763; 201223807
AB  - For ethnic groups in which religion is an important dimension of culture, attention needs to be paid to religiosity as a system of meaning when studying their process of acculturation. Using a sequential mixed model research approach, where quantitative have preceded qualitative methods, three generations of the Assyrian population in a Swedish city have been studied concerning their acculturation processes in relation to religious values and practices. The research question guiding this study is: Does religiosity function as a system of meaning among the Assyrian youth in Sweden? The main objective of this study is to highlight the role of religiosity in the process of acculturation. The quantitative questionnaire material shows that religious values and practices decline from the first to the third generation (statistical significance at p < 0.001). The qualitative interview study with members of the third generation shows that religion has been a positive part of childhood. In adulthood, however, other systems of meaning also have become central at the same time as religious institutions and representatives are being criticised. This change needs to be understood against the background of the Swedish cultural context, one of the most secularised in the world. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary
AN  - 896195493; 201120578
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - Racial Disparities in Health: How Much Does Stress Really Matter
AN  - 887500749; 201118200
AB  - Despite the widespread assumption that racial differences in stress exist and that stress is a key mediator linking racial status to poor health, relatively few studies have explicitly examined this premise. We examine the distribution of stress across racial groups and the role of stress vulnerability and exposure in explaining racial differences in health in a community sample of Black, Hispanic, and White adults, employing a modeling strategy that accounts for the correlation between types of stressors and the accumulation of stressors in the prediction of health outcomes. We find significant racial differences in overall and cumulative exposure to eight stress domains. Blacks exhibit a higher prevalence and greater clustering of high stress scores than Whites. American-born Hispanics show prevalence rates and patterns of accumulation of stressors comparable to Blacks, while foreign-born Hispanics have stress profiles similar to Whites. Multiple stressors correlate with poor physical and mental health, with financial and relationship stressors exhibiting the largest and most consistent effects. Though we find no support for the stress-vulnerability hypothesis, the stress-exposure hypothesis does account for some racial health disparities. We discuss implications for future research and policy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Trans-systemic Society and Regional Perspective in Chinese Studies
AN  - 887498917; 201118127
AB  - This essay proposes to establish a connection between the concept of "trans-systemic society" and the concept of "region" mainly for two reasons. On the one hand, the idea of region, which is distinct both from nation-state and from ethnicity, and which is based on a special human geography and culture, is uniquely hybrid, fluid, and integrated. Thus, it affords us a perspective that transcends nationalism with which to reinterpret China and its historical evolution. On the other hand, the idea of trans-systemic society shows a society composed of different ethnic groups or nationalities, religions, and even civilizations, which is also intertwined with the concept of trans-societal system. For example, the tributary system in Chinese history is not only a mode of contact in a trans-systemic society but also a form of network in the trans-societal system. It links various political communities within a broader region. Therefore, revisiting the idea of region, especially the idea of ethnic region, through the lens of trans-systemic society and trans-societal system, is crucial to addressing such questions as "How do we understand China?" or "What is China?".

T1  - The Adaptation of Migrant Children
AN  - 887497049; 201118177
AB  - Alejandro Portes and Alejandro Rivas examine how young immigrants are adapting to life in the United States. They begin by noting the existence of two distinct pan-ethnic populations: Asian Americans, who tend to be the offspring of high-human-capital migrants, and Hispanics, many of whose parents are manual workers. Vast differences in each, both in human capital origins and in their reception in the United States, mean large disparities in resources available to the families and ethnic communities raising the new generation. Research on the assimilation of these children falls into two theoretical perspectives. Culturalist researchers emphasize the newcomers' place in the cultural and linguistic life of the host society; structuralists, their place in the socioeconomic hierarchy. Within each camp, views range from darkly pessimistic-that disadvantaged children of immigrants are simply not joining the American mainstream-to optimistic-that assimilation is taking place today just as it has in the past. A middle ground is that although poorly endowed immigrant families face distinct barriers to upward mobility, their children can overcome these obstacles through learning the language and culture of the host society while preserving their home country language, values, and customs. Empirical work shows that immigrants make much progress, on average, from the first to the second generation, both culturally and socioeconomically. The overall advancement of the immigrant population, however, is largely driven by the good performance and outcomes of youths from professional immigrant families, positively received in America. For immigrants at the other end of the spectrum, average socioeconomic outcomes are driven down by the poorer educational and economic performance of children from unskilled migrant families, who are often handicapped further by an unauthorized or insecure legal status. Racial stereotypes produce a positive self-identity for white and Asian students but a negative one for blacks and Latinos, and racialized self-perceptions among Mexican American students endure into the third and fourth generations. From a policy viewpoint, these children must be the population of greatest concern. The authors cite two important policy measures for immigrant youth. One is to legalize unauthorized migrants lest, barred from conventional mobility channels, they turn to unorthodox means of self-affirmation and survival. The other is to provide volunteer programs and other forms of outside assistance to guide the most disadvantaged members of this population and help them stay in school.

T1  - Racial/ethnic residential segregation: Framing the context of health risk and health disparities
AN  - 881468852; 201116487
AB  - An increasing body of public health literature links patterns of racial/ethnic residential segregation to health status and health disparities. Despite substantial new empirical work, meaningful understanding of the pathways through which segregation operates to influence health remains elusive. The literature on segregation and health was appraised with an emphasis on select conceptual, methodological, and analytical issues. Recommendations for advancing the next generation of racial/ethnic residential segregation and health research will require closer attention to sharpening the methodology of measuring segregation, testing mediating pathways and effect modification, incorporating stronger test of causality, exploring factors of resilience in segregated areas, applying a life-course perspective, broadening the scope of the investigation of segregation to include nativity status in blacks and other racial/ethnic groups, and linking segregation measures with biological data.

T1  - To Belong in Aotearoa New Zealand: Latin American Migrant Experiences in Multicultural Auckland
AN  - 870432687; 201114263
AB  - In this paper, I give voice to Latin Americans' ideas about belonging in Aotearoa New Zealand society. As a small, low-profile migrant community in Auckland, their self-positioning in the urban social matrix is especially interesting because of New Zealand's official policy as a bicultural nation, aspiring to an equal partnership between indigenous Maori and Pakeha (European New Zealanders). This study is situated in the context of transnational migration research which stresses the potential for migrants to use transnational linkages to negotiate 'belonging' in the receiving society. Due to New Zealand's revised immigration laws in the late 1980s, the cultural composition of Auckland has changed enormously in the last decades. Increasing non-white immigration has challenged New Zealand's national identity as a bicultural, but predominantly white, society in the South Pacific. However, it is unclear where other ethnic groups are situated in this bicultural framework. Based on fieldwork and discursive accounts, I scrutinise Latin American migrants' understanding of biculturalism in a multicultural context. I am particularly interested in their self-positioning in the wider social matrix and in the contested forms of (self-)inclusion and exclusion. I situate these practices in migrants' biographies as they are shaped by political ideas, class and economic opportunities. I argue that these conditions are key in migrants' perceptions of 'belonging' and self-positioning in the urban ambit. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ali's Disappearance: The Tension of Moving and Dwelling in the Norwegian Welfare Society
AN  - 852898090; 201103220
AB  - In this article I address the tension--experienced by many young migrants--between pursuing individual goals and dreams for the future in Norwegian society, and fulfilling their responsibilities to family, kin and ethnic community. The discussion starts with the story of Ali, a young Somali boy who was sent abroad by his relatives in Norway to look after an aunt in Italy. The discussion centres around three issues. The first concerns the nomadic habitus and its relation to person, space and place; the second is about how space and self are constructed in the Norwegian welfare discourse of integration; and the third explores the overlapping expectations and interests implied in these different ways of structuring individuality and collectivity. The article concludes by emphasising the importance of considering both collective and individual motives, drives and responsibilities in analysing the lives of young migrants.

T1  - Imposed Politics Of Cultural Differences: Managed Multiculturalism in Israeli Civil Society
AN  - 1081865211; 201235335
AB  - This article analyzes the processes by which multicultural discourses and practices are implemented and adapted in local settings. Based on five years of ethnographic fieldwork in an Israeli NGO that promotes economic and social rights, this work examines the micro-politics of multiculturalism and the complex uses of this concept by various Jewish and Arab actors in the organization. The research shows how multicultural notions concerning Arab culture were introduced by the Jewish actors in order to depoliticize Jewish-Arab relations and preserve the balance and stability within the organization. By adopting characteristics of state multiculturalism-in a country where multiculturalism is not an aspect of official government policy-the Jewish actors attempted to produce social change while preserving central elements in the hegemonic Zionist-nationalistic worldview.

AN  - 1037879272; 201230910
AB  - This article explores my own personal struggles with Attention Deficit Disorder as well as the larger implications of the disorder facing society as a whole through the lenses of both micro and macro sociological theories and concepts using a sociological imagination framework. It also works towards breaking down the common beliefs and misconceptions in society about what exactly having ADD entails, and how on a personal level one can work to combat these misconceptions. As a person with Attention Deficit Disorder taking the step of sharing her story in this paper, I believe it is important to work toward a paradigm shift in how the world views ADD, because for those who have ADD, the greatest barrier to the diagnosis is the public perception.

T1  - Can the American Dream Survive the New Multiethnic America? Evidence from Los Angeles
AN  - 1010633277; 201210492
AB  - Drawing from a survey conducted in Los Angeles, we examine perceptions of achievement and optimism about reaching the American dream among racial, ethnic, and nativity groups. We find blacks and Asian Americans less likely than whites to believe they have reached the American dream. Latinos stand out for their upbeat assessments, with naturalized citizens possessing a stronger sense of achievement and noncitizens generally optimistic that they will eventually fulfill the American dream. We discuss patterns of variation between the racial and ethnic groups as well as variation within each group. Notwithstanding interesting differences along lines of race, ethnicity, and nativity, we find no evidence that the nation's changing ethnic stew has diluted faith in the American dream.

T1  - ARTICULATING A POLITICS OF (MULTIPLE) IDENTITIES
AN  - 852898619; 201103321
AB  - This work examines the strategies Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people use in Black environments to proclaim a gay identity that is simultaneous with a Black identity. It identifies three distinctive features of LGBT protest in Black communities. Black gay protest takes on a particular form when individuals are also trying to maintain solidarity with the racial group despite the threat of distancing that occurs as a result of their sexual minority status. Black sexual minorities who see their self-interests as linked to those of other Blacks use cultural references to connect their struggles to historical efforts for Black equality and draw from nationalist symbols and language to frame their political work. They believe that increasing their visibility in Black spaces will promote a greater understanding of gay sexuality as an identity status that can exist alongside, rather than in competition with, race. The findings of this research have implications for larger discussions of identity, protest, and gay sexuality in intraracial contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - European American children's and adolescents' evaluations of interracial exclusion
AN  - 743045733; 201031475
AB  - No research, to date, has investigated the role of ethnic school composition (and intergroup contact) on European American youth's use of stereotypes to explain interracial discomfort in the context of peer exclusion. In this study, European American fourth-, seventh- and 10th-grade students (N = 414), attending low and high ethnically-diverse public schools (with low and high self-reports of cross-race/ethnic friendships respectively) evaluated three contexts of interracial exclusion (at lunch time, at a school dance, and at a sleepover). In addition to age and context effects, participants enrolled in high-diversity schools were less likely to use stereotypes to explain racial discomfort, more likely to view racial exclusion as wrong, and more likely to estimate that racial exclusion occurs, than were participants enrolled in low-diversity schools. These findings have implications for the role of social experience on racial attitudes and judgments about exclusion. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Desirable Difference: The Shadow of Racial Stereotypes in Creating Transracial Families through Transnational Adoption
AN  - 743043283; 201026573
AB  - The article analyzes how parents decide to adopt a child transnationally by detailing how the meaning of race is articulated in the formation of family. Drawing from my interviews with adoptive parents, I examine how they internalize ideas about different racial groups. For example, I investigate how what they have learned from the adoption agencies, their own perceptions of racial stereotypes, and their perceptions of the communities in which they reside influence their understanding of race. The article suggests that adoptive parents, when considering whether to adopt children from the U.S. or overseas, use a criteria dictated by racial stereotypes in understanding Asian Americans as the model minority, African-Americans as a deficient group, and Latinos occupying an intermediary position.
