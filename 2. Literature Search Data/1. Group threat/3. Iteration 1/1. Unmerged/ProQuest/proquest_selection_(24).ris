T1  - The development and validation of a multidimensional scale of perceived Latino threat
AN  - 2658419133
AB  - Perceived threat is a central feature of theories of intergroup behaviour, such as the minority threat perspective. Studies have linked perceptions of Latinos as threatening the interests of Whites to Whites’ support for more punitive policies in the U.S., especially in areas experiencing a recent growth in the Latino population. This research, however, is limited in that researchers rarely measure perceptions of Latino threat directly and have yet to expand on the limitations of existing measures. To this end, this study was designed to develop a 20-item Perceived Latino Threat Scale (PLTS) and assess its association with relevant external criteria, including several vehicles for the social control of Latinos. The scale was administered to students attending a Southwestern university during the Republican Party presidential primaries (Study 1: N = 332) and just prior to the 2016 election (Study 2: N = 259). Bifactor analyses indicated that perceptions of Latino threat can be subdivided into four dimensions: economic, political, criminal, and opportunity threat. Higher perceptions of Latino threat, especially economic threat, were associated with support for Donald Trump, being a Republican and politically conservative, and harbouring punitive attitudes toward crime and border control. Implications for theory and research are discussed.

T1  - Counteracting subliminal cues that threaten national identity
AN  - 2617655292
AB  - In spite of their subtle nature, subliminal cues of group devaluation can have profound effects on members of targeted groups. Across three studies, we examine factors that allow people to counteract subliminal cues of group devaluation. We do this in the context of Spanish–German intergroup relations following the 2008 financial crisis. Throughout the crisis, narratives in politics and the media have drawn on national stereotypes to legitimize the economic situation in Spain. We argue that this represents a threat to our Spanish participants and that exposure to subliminal cues that reflect this threat will trigger responses that counteract this threat. Indeed, results showed that when subliminal associations legitimize the disadvantage faced by the group, our Spanish participants reversed the subliminal associations to which they were exposed. These findings show that Spanish participants are able to counteract the devaluation of their national in‐group, even when that devaluation occurs outside of conscious awareness.

T1  - Making the planet green again: The interplay of attitudes and group norms in the conversion to organic farming
AN  - 2597113312
AB  - Attitudes and social norms are key social psychological concepts that have often been considered as independent determinants of human behavior. However, questions about the interplay between the two are somewhat of a blind spot in social psychology. In the present research, we test the hypothesis that when an important change in norms is involved, behavioral intentions will be shaped by a discrepancy between personal attitudes and the perceived group norm, that is the perception of other group members’ attitudes. This proposition is tested and supported across three studies in a context of the conversion to organic farming, a behavior indicative of a significant societal and behavioral change. Farmers who did convert to organic farming were those who perceive other farmers to hold less positive attitudes toward this environmentally‐friendly practice compared to their own (Study 1a & 1b, N = 1,023). Among conventional farmers, the intention to convert to organic farming is also predicted by a discrepancy between personal attitudes and the perceived group norm (Study 1b). Finally, among agricultural colleges’ students (Study 2, N = 280), the intention to become an organic farmer was influenced by an interaction between attitudes and perceived group norm and not only by independent effects of these two variables. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for a better understanding of behavioral adaptation in times of social change are discussed.

T1  - National Belonging and Public Support for Multiculturalism
AN  - 2549696090
AB  - How do views about national identity shape support for multiculturalism? In this paper, we argue that individuals who view national ingroup belonging as “achievable” are more likely to support multiculturalism than individuals who view belonging as “ascriptive.” Using data from the 1995, 2003, and 2013 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) Nationality Identity survey waves across 35 advanced democracies, we find achievable national identities correspond with support for multicultural principles but not for programmatic aspects involving government intervention. Robust analyses reveal these patterns are specific to the content, rather than the strength, of one's national identity. Our findings underline the role of both national belonging and outgroup attitudes on building support for policies of inclusion—and therefore social solidarity—in diverse democracies.

T1  - From Student to Employee: Group Compatibility Predicts Group Identification and Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 2521296386
AB  - Transitions go along with the need to integrate a previous outgroup into the self-concept. This study examines whether this integration follows cognitive consistency principles. In line with recent theorizing, we test whether the perceived compatibility of a previous and a current ingroup determines identification with these groups and intergroup attitudes. We primed employees who were former students (N = 269) to perceive the groups of students and employees as either more compatible or less compatible, and measured the strength of identification and group attitudes with regard to both groups. The findings largely confirmed predictions. Greater compatibility between social groups increased identity integration and reduced intergroup bias. Identity integration mediated the effect of compatibility on intergroup bias. In line with predictions, the voluntariness of group change explained which of the groups people identified more strongly with when groups were perceived low in compatibility. The results of the study provide evidence that integrating identities into the self-concept follows cognitive consistency principles and suggests that emphasizing similarities between previous and current ingroups fosters identity integration and reduces intergroup bias.

T1  - (Mis)Calculations, Psychological Mechanisms, and the Future Politics of People of Color
AN  - 2492208472
AB  - This essay comments on three questions about race, ethnicity, and politics in the contemporary United States—How did we get here? Who are we now? And, where are we going next? I grapple with these questions as a political psychologist steeped in the study of intergroup politics. In this capacity, I will argue that structural (mis)calculations have paved the road toward present intergroup relations, where identity politics reigns supreme. I then discuss America's current racial landscape, arguing that reality is more complex than before, especially as it concerns political relations between Whites and non-Whites. In this regard, I will claim that political psychology holds special insights to generate new knowledge about how (non-)Whites are navigating this changing racial landscape. Finally, I will advocate, strongly, for a greater sense of wonder about the multiplicity of identities that people of color hold. In particular, I will claim that by relaxing our assumption that race is the main identity that matters to people of color, we stand to better appreciate just how adaptive non-Whites are to their political surroundings, leading us toward new insights about the origins and nature of mass political engagement and involvement.

T1  - Better in the (near) future: Group‐based differences in forecasting biases
AN  - 2408791447
AB  - Social identities are an important component of an individual’s self‐concept. In the current research, we examine how identification with a group can lead to biased intergroup judgments similar to those made when evaluating the self, relative to others. We compared evaluations of in‐ and outgroups in order to examine differences in temporal perspective and optimistic evaluations. Our findings suggest that compared to an outgroup, ingroup members more strongly consider the future potential of their group, are more optimistic when considering future ingroup outcomes, and hold a more uniformly positive view of an ingroup’s future. Furthermore, we find that when evaluating ingroups, shifts in temporal perspectives are related to greater optimism. We conclude by discussing theoretical implications and future research related to temporal judgments and social groups.

T1  - Colour violence, deadly geographies, and the meanings of “race” in Brazil
AN  - 2376277943
AB  - This paper analyses the relationships between “race” and violent victimization, and between “race” and support for violent practices of social control in Brazil, using nationally representative survey data. I start from the premise that “race” is a set of relational practices rather than bounded “racial groups”. I operationalize this relational understanding of “race” methodologically by triangulating three measures of “race” – self-identified “census race”, interviewer-identified skin colour, and racial composition of the municipality – in conjunction with measures of class, gender and space. I find that whiter geographic spaces have lower overall levels of violent victimization, but that interviewer-identified darker-skinned individuals are disproportionately victimized in these whiter geographic spaces. Controlling for other variables, self-identified census race is not correlated with violent victimization. I find that public support for violent practices can best be understood by considering people’s simultaneous relationships to race, gender, class and spatial categories and hierarchies.

T1  - Health Without Papers: Immigrants, Citizenship, and Health in the 21st Century
AN  - 2427333151
AB  - Over the past several decades, citizenship status has become more important in immigrant lives and communities in the United States. Undocumented adults who arrived as children, the 1.5 generation, comprise a growing percentage of the immigrant population. Although they are similar to children of immigrants born in the United States (the second generation) they face a variety of barriers to integration due to their lack of legal status. Based on over five years of ethnographic fieldwork with mainly 1.5 and second generation Mexican-American men during a period of major healthcare reform, this paper addresses how citizenship status and embeddedness within multi-status communities impacts immigrant experiences in the healthcare domain. In particular, I argue that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has contributed to an institutionalization of the status differences and a further differentiation in the social integration of these groups of children of immigrants. The novel methodological approach and the data which emerges through fieldwork reveals important insights into the process whereby healthcare reforms have consequences for immigrant communities which I show through highlighting the status-signaling event that is generated through various forms of direct and indirect interaction with the ACA. The implications of this extend beyond healthcare, and I discuss its impact on issues including ethnic identity and psychological well-being. This paper makes contributions to both our understanding of intergroup dynamics in immigrant integration and the health implications of immigration policies more generally.

T1  - Understanding the impact of the Hajj: Explaining experiences of self‐change at a religious mass gathering
AN  - 2369760558
AB  - Previous research has shown that participation in the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca can lead to both more positive outgroup attitudes and increased commitment to Muslim identity. We describe a survey of pilgrims (N = 1,176) carried out at Mecca, during the Hajj, which tested explanations for these experiences of self‐change at the time of their occurrence. In line with contact theory, perceived cooperation among pilgrims indirectly predicted more positive outgroup attitudes (as well as enhanced Muslim identification), via identification with the crowd. In line with social identity and identity congruence explanations, positive emotional experience and the perception that the crowd embodied the Muslim value of unity predicted self‐change variables through identification with the crowd. The finding that participation in an all‐Muslim gathering increases positive views of other groups (including non‐Muslims) through identification with the crowd offers an alternative perspective to suggestions that such gatherings might encourage intolerance.

T1  - Making moral migrants? Exploring the educational aspirations of Black African and Caribbean boys in a New York City public school
AN  - 2299102264
AB  - Drawing on 48 in-depth interviews with Black immigrant and second-generation boys at Bridgewood secondary school in New York City, this article points out how the high educational aspirations expressed by Black African and Caribbean boys are strategically deployed as features of an ethnic project to counter anti-immigrant sentiments and anti-Black racism in US society. The findings indicate that in a context of rising xenophobia along with the historical and continual stereotypes of Black people in the US, participants' aspirations for elite higher education function as strategies to enhance their individual and ethnic reputations. High educational aspirations were also used to justify emigration to and worth within the US. At its core, this article illustrates how participants mobilized aspirations to represent themselves as moral migrants and 'worthy' ethnic minorities. Moral claims and ethnicity-based campaigns associated with aspirations are problematized because they reinforce the hierarchical racial order that informs US society.

T1  - A Crisis of Competence: Benevolent Sexism Affects Evaluations of Women’s Competence
AN  - 2174080475
AB  - People higher in benevolent sexism often outwardly endorse gender equality, but support men over women for challenging positions and experiences. Reflecting shifting standards (a tendency to evaluate stereotyped group members against within-category judgment standards), people higher in sexism may evaluate prominent women’s competence against a lower competency standard for women (who are stereotyped as less competent than men are), and not against a standard for men. Thus prominent women could be perceived as especially competent (versus other women), yet men might still garner ultimate support. Study 1 tested for this possibility using an ecologically valid example: the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Study 1 showed that benevolent (and not hostile) sexism predicted less opposition to Donald Trump’s candidacy and more positive attitudes toward the election outcome among 57 mostly female U.S. college students. Study 1 also showed that benevolent sexism positively predicted competence perceived in Hillary Clinton. To determine if this positive relationship reflected shifting standards, we manipulated the gender to which a prominent woman would be compared in Study 2 with 189 U.S. adults. Reflecting shifting standards, benevolent sexism related to evaluating women as more competent when they were evaluated against other women versus other men. Shifting standards also mediated a relationship between benevolent sexism and expecting lower female success. Using shifting standards may be one way that people higher in benevolent sexism might evaluate prominent women as especially competent, yet ultimately support men.

T1  - Racial Socialization Practices Among White American Parents: Relations to Racial Attitudes, Racial Identity, and School Diversity
AN  - 2117274895
AB  - This study examines racial socialization practices among White American parents (N = 154) of children aged 8 to 12 years, using both quantitative and qualitative measures, as well as the relations of racial attitudes, racial identity, and racial diversity of the schools that children attend to socialization practices. Responses on the qualitative socialization measure indicate that White parents are generally unlikely to discuss race or racism with their children in a direct, explicit fashion, even when the parents are responding to a situation in which racial bias is clear and salient. Parents with less biased racial attitudes were more likely to engage in color-conscious racial socialization and to present socialization messages that emphasized egalitarianism and the existence of racial discrimination. School diversity was generally unrelated to parents’ racial socialization strategies, with the exception of messages about preparation for bias against one’s own racial group.

T1  - Meritocracy dismissed
AN  - 1930435988
AB  - Undergraduates at elite universities in the US and UK are, according to Dr Warikoo, conflicted about the relation of racial diversity to meritocracy. In the US, white students view racial minorities as academically less qualified but as providing a diversity benefit; UK students view minorities as equal members of a meritocracy but turn a blind eye to racial disparities on and off campus. What Warikoo's narrative overlooks is the role played by differences between the US and the UK in the educational paths and testing regimes that produce these disparate mentalities. Although 40 per cent of America's colleges offer test-optional admissions, some like Harvard still require SAT/ACT scores. The SAT/ACT are predictively weak and biased, stigmatizing minorities as underperformers. Test biases and the predictive superiority of high school grades are not widely understood. Warikoo's proposal to blow up meritocracy with an admissions lottery is to be applauded.

T1  - Bringing “T” to the table: understanding individual support of transgender candidates for public office
AN  - 2571083524
AB  - Of central importance to groups is the representation of their interests in government. A direct strategy for representation is to elect officials that identify with the group. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) movement has increasingly been successful in fielding LGB candidates for local, state, and national offices, even though these candidates face barriers. But while many lesbian and gay candidates have achieved electoral success, few transgender candidates have run for office and even fewer have won. Our project examines the hurdles faced by transgender candidates and provides a predictive analysis of a unique 2015 national survey that queried American adult respondents about hypothetical transgender candidates for different political offices. We hypothesize that although transgender candidates are likely to be opposed by potential voters that would also oppose female, African-American, or gay or lesbian candidates, for transgender candidates, there is a stronger influence of respondent disgust sensitivity and gender nonconformity. The findings largely support our arguments. We conclude that transgender candidates are in a similar electoral position to gay and lesbian candidates, with likely supporters fitting a profile that is similar to the Democratic voter base. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of minority group symbolic representation and democratic citizenship more broadly.

T1  - Obviousness: the unexpected benefit of phenotypic dissimilarity
AN  - 1934043848
AB  - Ethnoraciality research consistently purports that phenotypic similarity to a reference majority benefits individual identification with a group; a notion reinforced by social identity theory. I present a counterpoint to this supposition. In-depth interviews with 101 white, black, Asian, Latino/a, and multiracial Jewish converts in three metropolitan areas show that converts who least resemble Jewish phenotypic stereotypes attain a sense of belonging within Jewishness most easily. Converts who are phenotypically similar to a Jewish prototype are tempted to pass as Jewish by birth, and those who engage in passing experience sustained anxiousness about being outsiders. Converts who are phenotypically dissimilar from the prototype do not see passing as an option, and thus bypass equivalently-sustained anxiousness and immediately work toward attaining a sense of belonging. Departing from the literature's expectations, this case suggests that, when it releases pressure to fit a group prototype, obvious phenotypic dissimilarity can have a beneficial identificational effect.

T1  - Marriage migration and integration: Interrogating assumptions in academic and policy debates
AN  - 1923538203
AB  - In both policy and academic debates in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, concern is increasingly expressed over the implications of spousal immigration for 'integration'. Continued practices of 'homeland' transnational marriage within some ethnic minority communities, in particular, are presented as problematic, and new immigration restrictions likely to particularly affect such groups are justified on the grounds of promoting integration. The evidence base to underpin this concern is, however, surprisingly limited and analysis is based on differing and often partial conceptualisations of integration. Through an examination of the evidence in recent studies, we interrogate the impact which spousal immigration can have within differing domains of integration. Exposing the complex processes at play we demonstrate the need for future research to deploy a nuanced, more comprehensive concept of integration if it is to avoid simplistic assertions that these forms of marriage migration have a single, direct impact on integration processes.

T1  - Moral Foundations, Intuitions of Justice, and the Intricacies of Punitive Sentiment
AN  - 1900042715
AB  - Research on punitive attitudes has, so far, focused largely on people's retributive attitudes toward offenders. However, a large theoretical body of research indicates that concerns about different types of offenses and victims may be just as important in structuring punitive attitudes. Particularly, Moral Foundations Theory suggests that distinct punitive attitudes may be based in intuitive moral concerns ("moral foundations") about offenses that victimize individuals, groups, and the "divine," referring to bodily purity or sanctity. In this study, I develop measures of what I term "victim-centered punitiveness," and use data from a nationwide survey of adult Americans (N = 915) to compare the sources of offender- and victim-centered punitiveness. As expected, different moral foundations shape offender- and victim-centered punitiveness in different ways, suggesting that they have distinct intuitive, moral bases. Other factors, including racial resentment, also have distinct effects on each type of punitiveness.

T1  - Predictors of Sexual Minority Youth's Reported Suicide Attempts and Mental Health
AN  - 1881438309
AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth (LGBY) report higher rates of mental health concerns compared to heterosexual youth due to minority stressors. This study examined the interpersonal and intrapersonal variables that predict psychological distress and self-reported suicide attempts in a sample of 61 LGBY in the Mid-South, which is a highly overlooked regional area for LGBY research. Youth who lost friends when coming out were 29 times more likely to report suicide attempts, and those who experienced psychological maltreatment from caregivers were 9.5 times more likely to report a suicide attempt. Internalized heterosexism, feelings of guilt or shame, and psychological maltreatment from caregivers were significant predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms. This study highlights the importance of creating affirming spaces for LGBY, particularly in areas of the country that experience greater political oppression of sexual minorities, such as the Mid-South.

T1  - Perceived racial discrimination, heavy episodic drinking, and alcohol abstinence among African American and White college students
AN  - 1933966454
AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that White college students are more likely to drink alcohol at a greater frequency and quantity compared to their African American counterparts. Examining race-related factors that structure alcohol use among college students remains an important area of research. In this study, we specifically examine perceived discrimination and its association with both heavy episodic drinking (HED) and alcohol abstinence among college students. Items that measured perceived racial discrimination in alcohol use contexts and demographic characteristics were used as independent and control variables. African American students were more likely to abstain from alcohol and less likely to engage in HED compared to their White counterparts. Results also suggest that students who believe their drinking will solicit race-based police bias have lower odds of engaging in HED and greater odds of alcohol abstention. We conclude that unsolicited policing, experienced by African Americans generally, and White Americans on campuses, explains effect sizes.

T1  - The Solitary Criminologist: Constructing a Narrative of Black Identity and Alienation in the Academy
AN  - 1891795689
AB  - This article uses a narrative approach to explore Black identity and alienation in the academy. It discusses the dearth of Black criminologists and the potential consequences of the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in higher education. The researcher uses critical race theory as a framework for understanding these challenges. The difficulties of navigating a tenure-track career in criminology and criminal justice while deconstructing the burden and responsibility of representing "Blackness" in a predominantly White field are also discussed. Narrative can be a useful approach for exploring racial identity, unearthing relevant challenges within the field, and increasing knowledge on the experience of Black scholars. It can also foster greater connectivity among minority faculty across institutions. It is recommended that support groups be used to address the needs of underrepresented minorities, build inclusive work cultures, alleviate feelings of alienation and the perceived responsibility of representing one's own race.

T1  - Unemployment and Immigrant Receptivity Climate in Established and Newly Emerging Destination Areas
AN  - 1880680732
AB  - This study examines whether the receptivity climate toward immigrants varies across traditional, new, and emerging Hispanic immigrant destinations in the U.S. and whether that climate is related to local unemployment rates and to the job-skill level of immigrants who settle in these places. We utilize unique, newly collected data to measure local labor market area immigrant receptivity climate based on content analysis of a random sample of all articles addressing immigrants/immigration which were published by local area newspapers from 1995 to 2010. The descriptive data show considerable diversity in local and regional immigrant receptivity patterns across the 380 U.S. labor market areas. Using annual labor market-specific unemployment rates, decadal measures of the educational attainment of immigrants and natives in the labor market area, and an annual summary measure of the immigrant receptivity climate, controlling for theoretically relevant labor market contextual characteristics, results from our regression models show that the immigrant receptivity climate is more negative where unemployment rates are higher. However, this relationship is evident only for new and non-destination areas compared with established immigrant destinations when control variables are considered. While a higher skill level of immigrants (a labor competition argument) is related to less negativity toward them, it does not explain the relationship between unemployment and immigrant receptivity climate. Overall, a high skill level of natives is the better explanation for a more positive immigrant receptivity climate.

T1  - The Context of Voting: Does Neighborhood Ethnic Diversity Affect Turnout?
AN  - 1866024301
AB  - With continuing immigration to Western countries, an important question concerns how these demographic changes impact natives' propensity to vote. In particular, the literature debates whether exposure to ethnic others in local contexts generates conflict that mobilizes individuals to vote (mobilization theory), diminishes social cohesion that in turn makes voters likely to withdraw from voting (marginalization theory), or does not impact turnout at all. This study is one of the first to investigate the question using individual-level longitudinal data, which adds substantially to the causal leverage of the analysis. In particular, we use a panel dataset with validated turnout data for 1.9 million Danish voters combined with detailed data regarding the ethnic composition of individuals' proximate residential neighborhood. The results suggest that increasing shares of immigrants does not affect natives' propensity to vote to any substantive extent, irrespective of how the size of the neighborhood is specified. This finding cannot be ascribed to lack of statistical power. Hereby, the study provides an important contribution to the existing knowledge regarding the democratic consequences of continuing immigration and increasing ethnic diversity.

T1  - Is There a Problem Officer? Exploring the Lived Experience of Black Men and Their Relationship with Law Enforcement
AN  - 1929868867
AB  - A study was conducted with the aim of identifying themes about the lived experiences of Black men in relation to law enforcement. An all-black male focus group was engaged in discussions on the topic "Do Black Lives Matter" at an annual conference on counseling racial and ethnic minorities. The group participants consisted of counselors, counselor educators, undergraduate students, graduate students, and a law enforcement representative. Data from the discussion were qualitatively analyzed to identify themes and to give voice to Black male experiences. This paper presents findings regarding these themes (anger, fear, training/re-education) based on the group discussion and group process observations as well as indications on how the findings can be used toward action and change.

T1  - True Finns and Non-True Finns: The Minority Rights Discourse of Populist Politics in Finland
AN  - 1833978490
AB  - This article analyses minority rights discourse in statements of the populist radical right party called the True Finns, which has become a major political force in Finland in the 2010s. A framework for the analysis is provided by research about the development of political approaches to multiculturalism in Western democracies. Kymlicka (2010) argues that a backlash against multicultural policies has mainly occurred in relation to the acceptance of ethnic-cultural diversity among immigrant groups. Support for a backlash is found in the minority rights statements of the party. However, the political rhetoric of the party is not mainly about policies relating to immigrants, but basic principles of group-specific rights for minorities are also disputed. The article argues that the populist rhetoric has to be understood as related to fundamental discourses about majority and minority rights in developed welfare states.

T1  - Examining the Effects of Scattered Site Supportive Housing on the Social and Economic Integration of Men Who Are Formerly Homeless and Primarily Black/African American
AN  - 1830031185
AB  - Housing dispersal strategies (scattered sites) have its roots in efforts to construct public housing in more ethnically diverse and affluent communities as a result of the overrepresentation of Blacks/African Americans living in public housing developments with concentrated poverty and racial segregation. Today, the use of scattered site housing is more indicative of nonprofit housing providers seeking to end homelessness. Comparable with the demographics of public housing residents, Blacks/African Americans are severely overrepresented in homeless populations across America. This study examined the impact of scattered site supportive housing, located in an affluent and predominately White/European American community to determine any reductions in social isolation and any levels of improved socio-economic status of men who were formerly homeless and primarily Black/African American. This study used five variables identified from earlier studies thought to influence socio-economic well-being: resident satisfaction, a sense of community, impact on income, neighbor opposition or not-in-my-own backyard (NIMBY) attitudes, and impact of scattered site housing on property values. The results showed that the respondents were, on average, more satisfied with the buildings where they lived than their landlord relations or external neighbors. Furthermore, the study found very little neighbor opposition based on race or class and no negative impact on property values from nearby scattered site developments. Based on these findings, recommendations to continue implementing housing dispersal strategies are offered. In addition, directions for future research are provided.

T1  - Building a Dignified Identity: An Ethnographic Case Study of LGBT Catholics
AN  - 1818354947
AB  - This ethnographic case study offers insight into religiously devout sexual minorities and the reasons behind their continued participation in an anti-gay religious institution, the Roman Catholic Church. I demonstrate how members of Dignity, an organization for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Catholics, strategically use their identity as gay Catholics to initiate action, to build community, and to destigmatize other religious sexual minorities. Members leverage this unique identity to push for change and equality within the Church. At the same time, this identity also allows members to see their continued participation in the anti-gay Roman Catholic Church as activism, a positive and affirming identity, thereby alleviating potential conflict and contradiction between their sexuality and their spirituality as Roman Catholics.

T1  - Blurring boundaries and negotiating subjectivities - the Uyghurized Han of southern Xinjiang, China
AN  - 1812458984
AB  - Negotiations of collective subjectivities among the Han living in ethnic minority areas of the People's Republic of China have so far received little attention. This article explores one such process among the 'Uyghurized Han' living in southern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, an area in which Han make up less than one-fourth of the population. Based on research material collected during long-term ethnographic fieldwork, this article suggests that Uyghurized Han creatively construct a sense of belonging in Xinjiang by positioning themselves at the interface of Han-ness and Uyghur-ness. They do so by engaging in contradictory but nonetheless simultaneous processes of blurring and fixing boundaries of identity vis-à-vis both Uyghur and other Han. The aim of the present article is to discuss the ways in which their collective subjectivities are produced in the process of boundary negotiation.

T1  - "Coming Out" of Prison: An Exploratory Study of LGBT Elders in the Criminal Justice System
AN  - 1812250715
AB  - This two-phase qualitative study explores the experiences of 10 formerly incarcerated LGBT elders' experiences prior to, during, and after release from prison. A core theme of self and the social mirror emerged from the data that represented LGBT elders ongoing coming-out process of unearthing their "true selves" despite managing multiple stigmatized identities or social locations, such as being LGBT, elderly, HIV positive, formerly incarcerated, and a racial/ethnic minority. These findings further our awareness of an overlooked population of LGBT who are older and involved in the criminal justice system. Recommendations that incorporate suggestions from formerly incarcerated LGBT elders for services and policy reform are presented.

T1  - Should ethnic Lao people be considered indigenous to Cambodia? Ethnicity, classification and the politics of indigeneity
AN  - 1799255036
AB  - The ethnic Lao are not well-known in Cambodia, despite constituting a substantial but unrecorded population there. Even though the Lao have lived in Cambodia for many generations, they were excluded from being considered 'indigenous peoples' when the category was legally introduced to Cambodia through the 2001 land law. Instead, they are not classified as 'ethnic Lao', except for the very few who were actually born in Laos. Here, I consider how the politics of identity in Cambodia has separated some highland ethnic minorities from the Lao. Many ethnic Lao in Cambodia quietly disagree with not being classified as indigenous. This contestation represents a similar dynamic to the differences of opinion between the Asian Indigenous Peoples Pact (AIPP) and the peasant organization, La Via Campesina, regarding advocating for indigenous and peasant rights, respectively. My objective is to demonstrate that the politics of indigenous categorization in Cambodia is complicated and fraught.

T1  - Interracial status competition and southern lynching, 1882-1930
AN  - 1801902639
AB  - This article provides theoretical grounds and empirical evidence that different types of lynching in the post-Reconstruction South were driven by social processes at different levels of analysis. County-level analyses based upon new detailed data on lynchings in Georgia and Louisiana from 1882 to 1930 reveal that 'private' lynchings, perpetrated by small groups outside the public purview without manifest ritual, were related to whites' interracial status and social identity concerns on the interpersonal level, whereas 'public' lynchings, involving larger mobs and ritualized violence, appear unaffected by such dynamics. These results validate relational and interactionist perspectives on violence, lend support to calls for disaggregation in the study of racial, ethnic, and nationalist violence, and shed light on the intertwining of racial identity formation with the generation of racial inequalities. They also carry implications for the study of contemporary ethno-racial hate crime.

T1  - Homonegativity in Italy: Cultural Issues, Personality Characteristics, and Demographic Correlates with Negative Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men
AN  - 1783663128
AB  - This study is an extension of earlier research that investigated the nature of homonegativity among Italian people (Lingiardi et al. 2005). We used the Modern Homophobia Scale (MHS), adapted to be more appropriate for the Italian social and cultural context. Associations were examined between homophobic attitudes, demographics, and personality characteristics and contact with lesbians and gay men. Gender issues were considered twice, from the viewpoint of both the agent and the target of the prejudice. The findings indicated that people at higher risk of possessing homonegative attitudes are older; less educated; more involved in religion and politically conservative; characterized by a more conforming, moralistic, and rule-bound personality, according to Cattell's personality factors; and have poor contact experience with lesbians and gay men. Males tended to have higher levels of homonegativity toward gay men but not toward lesbians. Proposals to reduce antigay bias in the Italian context will be briefly discussed.

T1  - Ethnic Speech and Ethnic Action as Ethnic Behavior: Part 1. Construction of the Brunel Ethnic Behavior Inventory
AN  - 1787542477
AB  - This article reports the construction of a new survey-specifically, the Brunel Ethnic Behavior Inventory (BEBI)-designed to measure ethnic speech and ethnic action as separate, yet related, aspects of individuals' ethnic behavior. Using Tajfel's social identity theory as a conceptual frame of reference, this study sought an answer to the research question of how many factors actually are measured by the BEBI, and tested the hypothesis that a two-factor model (i.e., Ethnic Speech and Ethnic Action as two correlated factors) would provide significantly better goodness of fit to the correlational data than would a one-factor model (i.e., Ethnic Behavior as one undifferentiated factor). Across one pilot sample (n = 101) and two main samples (n = 120 for Sample 1, n = 148 for Sample 2), the study found that not only did the BEBI measure two factors at most (i.e., Ethnic Speech and Ethnic Action) but, consistent with the hypothesis, the two-factor model yielded better goodness of fit than did the one-factor model. Implications for the conceptualization and measurement of Verkuyten's "ways of ethnicity" are discussed.

T1  - Skin Tone, Race/Ethnicity, and Wealth Inequality among New Immigrants
AN  - 1770384928
AB  - Immigrants' racial/ethnic status has profound implications for their lives in the United States, including its influence on their ability to improve their financial well-being. We examine a particular type of financial well-being -- wealth or net worth -- and consider how both skin tone and race/ethnicity contribute to wealth inequality. To assess these dual influences, we use the New Immigrant Survey and the recently developed preference for whiteness hypothesis to argue that darker-skinned immigrants will have lower levels of wealth and will be less likely to own certain assets. Results generally support the hypothesis with the strongest evidence apparent in the full sample and among Asian immigrants. Overall, the results illuminate how immigrants with a racial/ethnic minority status and a darker complexion encounter multiple forms of disadvantage relative to white and/or lighter-skinned immigrants.

T1  - Back to School in a New Country? The Educational Participation of Adult Immigrants in a Life-Course Perspective
AN  - 1760241855
AB  - While the education of the children of immigrants is a much-researched theme, we know very little about the participation of adult immigrants in education. And yet, lifelong learning is a common demand in highly industrialized societies. This article provides a first empirical analysis of adult immigrants' educational participation in Germany. It uses the novel German National Educational Panel Study with unique retrospective life-course data. By adopting a life-course perspective, both transnational continuities in the life-course as well as the ruptures caused by migration are captured. The analysis investigates in what ways participation in education is embedded in immigrants' transnational life-course. It can be shown that immigrants' participation in formal and nonformal full-time education is common. Hypotheses predict a central influence of (1) pre-immigration activities and (2) of legal immigration gateways. Sequence and cluster analysis detect two education-related incorporation patterns: one is marked by a dominance of educational activities and the other by phases in education alternate with employment and unemployment. The results of multivariate models underline the predictive power of pre-immigration activity, i.e., transnational continuity in immigrants' life courses. But we can also observe substantial disruption like the transnational transition from employment to education which can be the enforced response to nonrecognition or devaluation of foreign educational credentials. Institutional opportunities and dispositions linked to legal immigration gateways are even more powerful predictors of educational participation. Altogether, the article illustrates how the interaction of structural opportunities and individual agency plays out in the formation of different incorporation trajectories of adult immigrants.

T1  - 'How do you Say "Stop that!" in Slovakian?': A8 Immigration and Scotland's Race and Ethnic Diversity Narrative
AN  - 1808418382
AB  - 'How do you Say "Stop that!" in Slovakian': A8 Immigration and Scotland's Race and Ethnic Diversity Narrative. In 2004 8 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia) joined the EU in an expansion popularly known as the Accession, or A8. As part of this arrangement the Slovakian Roma community settled in Govanhill, a neighborhood in the South-Side of Glasgow, Scotland. Immediately, there was widespread outcry, followed by public debate, on the numbers involved and the impact on local services. One of the claims made was that, because of a 'unique' history of 'self-isolation', the Roma had altered local policing needs. There were widespread media anecdotes of anti-social behavior but also racist victimization. Using material available post-A8 Govanhill, this synthesizes the debate on Roma settlement against the wider canvass of Scottish reception and assimilation of immigrants. I claim that post-A8 phobia of the Roma is part of an unsustainable ideology of Scotland as a post-racial 'welcoming country' which has occluded a nuanced interrogation of the capacity of the country to welcome and successfully integrate immigrants.

T1  - Organizing entrepreneurial activity in the South of the Russian Far East: ethnic aspect
AN  - 1808418368
AB  - The paper presents results of interviews in summer 2013 with ethnic entrepreneurs living in the southern regions of the Russian Far East. It is shown that ethnic relations are important when entering new host society. Common ethnicity does not give any advantage in business operations even with fellow countrymen. Major driving force in business development is positive financial result. In most cases diaspora and ethnic entrepreneurs exist independently from each other. Some cooperation between entrepreneurs is possible while solving certain financial and organizational issues, but in general, diaspora does not affect business activities, so respondents. Ethnic entrepreneurship in the Russian Far East is not an enclave phenomenon targeted only at "narrow circle" of ethnic minority. Companies established here are focused on a wide range of consumers, including representatives of differing ethnic groups. An acute problem of business development at present is lack of specialists. Most respondents employ illegal migrants and see a deterioration of local workforce quality and a change in foreign workers employment. Main difficulties in business development at present are connected with quotas for immigrant labor.

T1  - Becoming a Viking: DNA testing, genetic ancestry and placeholder identity
AN  - 1751730965
AB  - A consensus has developed among social and biological scientists around the problematic nature of genetic ancestry testing, specifically that its popularity will lead to greater genetic essentialism in social identities. Many of these arguments assume a relatively uncritical engagement with DNA, under 'high-stakes' conditions. We suggest that in a biosocial society, more pervasive 'low-stakes' engagement is more likely. Through qualitative interviews with participants in a study of the genetic legacy of the Vikings in Northern England, we investigate how genetic ancestry results are discursively worked through. The identities formed in 'becoming a Viking' through DNA are characterized by fluidity and reflexivity, rather than essentialism. DNA results are woven into a wider narrative of selfhood relating to the past, the value of which lies in its potential to be passed on within families. While not unproblematic, the relatively banal nature of such narratives within contemporary society is characteristic of the 'biosociable'.

T1  - 'One Stone Is Enough to Drive Away a Hundred Birds': Peasants, Land and Resistance in Contemporary Afghanistan
AN  - 1749497039
AB  - Five books on the war in Afghanistan and contemporary Pakhtun life are reviewed from the perspective of the insights they provide into peasant resistance to the Afghan government and the United States. It is argued that while these books are important in improving our understanding of peasant resistance to the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, with the exception of the monograph by Ahmed they offer only a partial account of the dynamics of resistance, because they fail to adequately integrate the ontology of the Pakhtun into their accounts, and the material foundations of that ontology. The result is that important elements of peasant resistance in Afghanistan are obscured.

T1  - Druze Politics in Israel: Challenging the Myth of "Druze-Zionist Covenant"
AN  - 1752271710
AB  - Druzes in Israel have been accused of being completely loyal to the Israeli state since 1948. This study will challenge the so-called "Druze-Zionist covenant". The aim of the paper is to show that the Druze fought Zionism in 1948 and later accommodated the Israeli state as the only viable choice to survive in the land of their ancestors. For this purpose, the paper will investigate the role of the Druze community in the 1948 war, followed by the Druze struggle to preserve their Islamic and Arab identity in the face of the Israeli attempts of ethnicizing the Druze. The Druze religious establishment and some Druze elites who happen to adhere to Arab nationalism challenged the Israeli state by capitalizing on the historical ties of the Druze faith with Islam and Arabism. The policy of Israel is aimed at detaching the Druze from their Arab belongings, thus the introduction of mandatory military service to the community. The paper will conclude by explaining the Druze policy of accommodation toward the Israeli state and its relation to the concept of taqiyah (dissimulation) from a political perspective.

T1  - Mapping the meaning of 'difference' in Europe: A social topography of prejudice
AN  - 1933539589
AB  - This paper draws on original empirical research to investigate popular understandings of prejudice in two national contexts: Poland and the United Kingdom. The paper demonstrates how common-sense meanings of prejudice are inflected by the specific histories and geographies of each place: framed in terms of 'distance' (Poland) and 'proximity' (United Kingdom), respectively. Yet, by treating these national contexts as nodes and linking them analytically the paper also exposes a connectedness in these definitions which brings into relief the common processes that produce prejudice. The paper then explores how inter-linkages between the United Kingdom and Poland within the wider context of the European Union are producing - and circulating through the emerging international currency of 'political correctness' - a common critique of equality legislation and a belief that popular concerns about the way national contexts are perceived to be changing as a consequence of super mobility and super diversity are being silenced. This raises a real risk that in the context of European austerity and associated levels of socioeconomic insecurity, negative attitudes and conservative values may begin to be represented as popular normative standards which transcend national contexts to justify harsher political responses towards minorities. As such, the paper concludes by making a case for prejudice reduction strategies to receive much greater priority in both national and European contexts.

T1  - High outgroup entitativity can inhibit intergroup retribution
AN  - 1728660297; 201533971
AB  - Understanding the psychological processes that are involved in the perpetuation and escalation of intergroup conflict remains an important goal for intergroup relations research. In the present research, we examined perceived outgroup entitativity as a potential determinant of intergroup hostility. In intergroup conflict situations, high-entitative outgroups are perceived as particularly deserving of retribution; however, high-entitative outgroups are also perceived as efficacious and capable of retaliating successfully, suggesting that people may inhibit hostility against high-entitative (vs. low-entitative) outgroups that are in a position to retaliate. We tested this prediction in two studies. In Study 1, we manipulated intergroup provocation and outgroup entitativity, and found that higher negative mood predicted greater aggression against a low-entitative provoker outgroup, but failed to predict aggression against a high-entitative provoker outgroup that was plausibly in a position to retaliate. In Study 2, we held provocation constant while manipulating outgroup entitativity and the possibility of retaliation by the outgroup, and found that people acted in a retributive manner against a high-entitative provoker outgroup only when the outgroup was not in a position to retaliate. Implications for intergroup conflict are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Color-cognizance and Color-blindness in White America
AN  - 2406941593
AB  - This study estimates how many white Americans believe that white identity is connected to the treatment they receive and the life chances of their racial group, and it explores the extent to which color-cognizance and color-blindness are related to the racial policy preferences of whites. The analysis uses data from five nationwide public opinion polls fielded between 2000 and 2009. Contingency tables are used to determine the prevalence of perceptions of racial privilege, racial disadvantage, and racial irrelevance, and logistic regression models are used to predict the determinant value of these perceptions on policy support. This study finds that a minority of white Americans report benefits from being white. However, whites who perceive racial privileges are consistently more supportive of policies aimed at minimizing such advantages and are more intent on securing racially equitable treatment than are those whites who believe that white identity is a liability. The analysis also finds that privilege-reporting whites are more likely to support a diversity-driven form of affirmative action than are their racial counterparts who express color-blind beliefs. Finally, this study provides evidence that whites who espouse color-blind views are more likely to support racially progressive policies when compared with whites who report racial disadvantages. The discussion advises researchers to remain attentive to the dominant population’s articulated views of whiteness and the fissures that animate their internal political differences.

T1  - Transnational Entrepreneurship amongst Vietnamese Businesses in London
AN  - 1667948982; 201509415
AB  - This paper draws on research with Vietnamese businesses in London which seeks to challenge some of the traditional views of transnational entrepreneurship. These have focused primarily on entrepreneurs embedded in both home and host countries and the need for regular travel between the two to manage the business. In contrast, this study suggests that transnational entrepreneurship today is more fluid than previous studies have suggested and is often characterised by multi-polar (rather than bipolar) links. Travel is also less relevant in the current age of 'super-connectivity'. The research explores how Vietnamese entrepreneurs in London draw on various forms of transnational capital to further the development of their business, and develops a framework to measure the degree and extent of the transnational embeddedness and dependency of the business. The results suggest that transnational entrepreneurship amongst ethnic minority entrepreneurs today is better viewed as a continuum rather than a set of discrete business types.

T1  - NATIVE AMERICAN VOTE SUPPRESSION: THE CASE OF SOUTH DAKOTA
AN  - 1757047108
AB  - A central point of contention in the Supreme Court's recent Shelby County v. Holder (2013) ruling was the question of whether key provisions of the Voting Rights Act designed to make it easier for racial minorities to be elected to political office are still necessary. Although there is a large body of academic research on the relationship between African American representation in political office and provisions of the Voting Rights Act, there is almost a complete absence of research examining the impact of the Voting Rights Act on the ability of Native Americans to be elected to political office. In this research, we do an in-depth analysis of the impact of voting rights litigation on the electoral prospects of Native Americans in South Dakota, a state which has been described as "Mississippi of the North."

T1  - Group and intergroup parameters of gang activities: An introduction and research agenda
AN  - 1700674378; 201524915
AB  - In introducing this Special Issue on gangs, we overview the thrust of its papers, demonstrating how they assist in plugging research gaps from the dearth of psychological attention to gangs. The papers therein raise important theoretical considerations of group process effects, social identity, and communication influences in gangs. Also included are empirical examinations of how attitudes to formal organized crime groups may nurture progang views, how social networks bridge gang divides, the dehumanization and social dominance association with gang membership, and how membership longevity associates with gang members' attitudes to their group. We conclude with theoretical prospects and empirical vistas for future work. For instance, vitality theory may help explain members' immersion in gangs, discursive strategies could explain how youth are enticed into gangs, and examinations of community and law enforcement attitudes to gangs may provide insight into how oppositional attitudes are fostered on both sides of the gang divide.

T1  - A Passage to Canada: The Differential Migrations of South Asian Skilled Workers to Toronto
AN  - 1680152466; 201513944
AB  - Each year, Canada attracts thousands of skilled workers from 'South Asia'; yet, relatively little is known about the complex reasons for and processes of migration of this immigrant cohort. The situation becomes even more acute when research ignores the internal diversities within this complex group and portrays a homogenised picture. Focussing on the experiences of 80 South Asian households who have entered Canada as skilled workers, this paper concludes that migration experiences differ between and within national groups (Indian, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan). Various factors, including pre-migration political, economic and social contexts, transnational ties and social identities and hierarchies play an important role in motivating this highly mobile group and creating specific migration channels. In order to develop a wholistic and nuanced understanding of migration, the study advocates that, conceptually, it is imperative to move away from meta-narratives and models of migration, and methodologically, it is necessary to continue using mixed research methods.

T1  - The puzzling neglect of Hispanic Americans in research on police-citizen relations
AN  - 1660022388; 201505827
AB  - Most studies of police-minority relations in America focus on blacks, usually in comparison with whites. This pattern is particularly puzzling in light of the growing population of Hispanic Americans throughout the US, now outnumbering blacks and consisting of the majority in some major cities. Aside from the need for more empirical research on the policing of Hispanics per se, comparing Hispanics' relations with the police to other racial and ethnic groups offers some important insights into both the dimensions that are shared across groups and those that are distinctive to Hispanics. This article critically evaluates the small body of empirical research literature on this topic - highlighting both deficiencies in this literature as well as suggestive findings - and concludes by identifying a set of issues that should be addressed in future studies. The available evidence largely supports a racial-hierarchy perspective with regard to the policing of different racial and ethnic groups in the US. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Investigating the effects of knowledge and ideology on climate change beliefs
AN  - 1660023296; 201505465
AB  - The divergence of public opinion and climate science in the English-speaking world, particularly the United States and Australia, has attracted a variety of explanations. One of the more interesting accounts, from a psychological perspective, is the influence of ideology on climate change beliefs. Previous work suggests that ideology trumps knowledge in shaping climate change beliefs. However, these studies have typically examined the influence of proxy measures of knowledge rather than specific climate change knowledge. The goal of the present research was to provide some clarification on the different influences of knowledge and ideology on beliefs about climate change. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between specific climate change knowledge, hierarchical and individualistic ideology, and climate change belief in a national sample (N = 335) of the Australian public. Contrary to research involving proxy knowledge measures, we found that people who had greater knowledge of climate change causes were more willing to accept that climate change is occurring. Furthermore, knowledge of causes attenuated the negative relationship between individualistic ideology and belief that climate change exists. Our findings suggest that climate change knowledge has the potential to positively influence public discourse on the issue. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Essentialising Ethnic and State Identities: Strategic Adaptations of Ethnic Chinese in Kelantan, Malaysia
AN  - 1660024746; 201505768
AB  - This paper looks at how a heterogeneous minority group sustains its multiple identities in a politically challenging context. Focusing on the Chinese minority (3.4 per cent) residing in Kelantan, the paper highlights strategies used by the group to retain its rights and identity as a separate cultural community. The peculiarity of this group is attributed to its entity as a non-Muslim minority under orthodox Islamic rule, and secondly, as citizens of a state led by the opposition party. The fact that they are born in Kelantan and possess fluency in the Kelantanese Malay dialect has strengthened their identity as orghe Kelantan (dialect referring to people who were born and grew up in the state). These factors create a sense of 'oneness' between the Chinese and other Kelantanese beyond ethnic, religious and class boundaries. This paper demonstrates how the Chinese in Kelantan seek to be accepted through behaviours appropriate to the majority and simultaneously build in-group solidarity. The underlying interplay between essentialism and provincialism is showcased when the Chinese strategise linguistically to maintain their orghe Kelantan identification as an exclusive identity. The identity and the distinct dialect spoken have enhanced the 'provincial' image of Kelantan in the national political discourse. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Relational Self Versus Collective Self: A Cross-Cultural Study in Interdependent Self-Construal Between Han and Uyghur in China
AN  - 1718065990; 201530745
AB  - Although differences between independent and interdependent self-construals have been extensively investigated, few studies have considered intra-cultural variability in self-construal in China. In the present research, we aimed at exploring ethnic group differences in interdependent self-construal. We first compared self-reported importance of the private self, relational self, and collective self between the Uyghur and the Han-two ethnic groups in China. The results show that the Han viewed the collective self to be less important than the private self and the relational self, while the Uyghur exhibited a different pattern, rating the collective self as more important than the private self and the relational self (Study 1). Three follow-up self-referential memory experiments provided further support for the difference in interdependent self-construal between the Han and the Uyghur. Specifically, only the Han participants exhibited significantly better memories of mother-referenced information than famous-person-referenced information (Study 2). In contrast, only the Uyghur participants exhibited significantly better memories of group-referenced information (Studies 3 and 4). These marked ethnic differences in interdependent self-construal suggest that the Han privilege the relational self and the Uyghur the collective self, thus highlighting the intra-cultural variability of interdependent self-construal in Chinese populations.

T1  - Chinese descendants in Italy: emergence, role and uncertain identity
AN  - 1660022284; 201505710
AB  - The history of Chinese immigration in Italy is about a century old, but numbers have become consistent in the last decades and the emergence of new generations is a recent phenomenon. This article examines the growing role of Chinese descendants in the country (within Chinese enterprises and new forms of interaction with the mainstream society) and their processes of identity formation, focusing the attention on the role played by Italian society and the dominant prejudices about this ethnic minority. The study highlights the relevance of social exclusion and identity prescription, as well as the importance of class, in determining different feelings of belonging and processes of identification. While a minority of middle-class Chinese have identified with Italy and developed a new hyphenated identity, many Chinese from the lower class appear uncertain about their national identity and react to social exclusion by abandoning hope and dropping out of education. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Mix Revisited: Neighbourhood Institutions as Setting for Boundary Work and Social Capital
AN  - 1786772525
AB  - Policy makers tend to think that residential 'mixing' of classes and ethnic groups will enhance social capital. Scholars criticize such 'mixing' on empirical and theoretical grounds. This article argues that the critics may focus too much on neighbourhoods. Mixing within neighbourhood institutions might work differently, we argue, drawing on data from a mixed school in Berlin, Germany. While class boundaries are constructed, we also find class-crossing identifications based on setting-specific characteristics, highlighting the setting's importance and the agency of lower/working and middle-class parents. Parents create ties for exchanging setting-specific resources: child-related social capital. Institutional neighbourhood settings can hence be important for boundary work and social capital. Criticism of social capital and social mix should not overlook the role of networks for urban inequality.

T1  - The Role of Social Distress, Political Affiliation, and Education in Measuring Punitive Attitudes: Israel as a Case Study
AN  - 1748865069; 201600138
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the different factors that shape and facilitate punitive attitudes among Israeli public. Punitive attitudes were examined in respect to several demographic and environmental variables such as gender, level of religiosity, level of education, political affiliation, and victimization. In addition, social distress in respect to the political climate of the country was taken into consideration to examine the effect of 'historical' events on results reliability. Using a random selection, a sample of 471 Israeli respondents was examined at two different time periods (Wave I: 2008-2009 and Wave II: 2011). Results of the current study indicate that demographic characteristics as well as social distress are related to the manifestation of punitive attitudes among Israelis, and thus the study demonstrates the different factors that affect public attitudes toward crime and punishment in the Israeli context. Results are discussed in regard to policy, and recommendations are made for future studies. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Effects of race, visual anonymity, and social category salience on online dating outcomes
AN  - 1650148424; 201502120
AB  - This study investigates the two facets of the social identity model of deindividuation (SIDE) within the context of online dating and racial stereotyping; visual anonymity and salience of social categorization cues. Experiment 1 (N = 23) employed a 2 (stereotypic attributes) x 2 (gender) x 12 (repetition) within subject design where participants rated individuals as more attractive when their profiles were white-stereotypic compared to black-stereotypic. Experiment 2 (N = 178) employed a 2 (gender) x 2 (race) x 2 (stereotype congruence) x 3 (repetition) mixed-factorial design to investigate effects of stereotype congruence on evaluations of attractiveness, attitudes, and dating behavioral intentions (DBI). Heterosexual white participants (N = 126) had more favorable evaluations (attractiveness, attitudes, and DBI) of white profile owners with stereotype-congment profiles than others. Findings are discussed in relation to models of computer-mediated communication and racial bias. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Social exclusion and xenophobia: Intolerant attitudes toward ethnic and religious minorities
AN  - 1542000313; 201426763
AB  - The present research investigates the effects of social exclusion on attitudes toward ethnic and religious minorities. Native-born German participants who were socially excluded rather than included reported greater approval for stricter legislation regarding the naturalization of immigrants (Study 1), reported greater prejudice against openly observant Muslims (Studies 2 and 3), and stronger agreement with the view that immigrants are financial burdens to the state (Study 4). Social exclusion threatens the sense of personal control, which in turn leads to stronger rejection of stigmatized outgroups (Study 3). When perceived control was experimentally enhanced, the social exclusion effect disappeared (Study 4). The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Ethnic Identity During War: The Case of German American Societies During World War I
AN  - 1494751255; 201402175
AB  - Social, economic, and political transformations have traditionally complicated the balance between individual liberties and common good (or national needs). In times of war this balance appears more fragile and-given the role of philanthropy in the formation of identities-philanthropic studies as a field should pay more attention to these dynamics. Accordingly, in this article, the author investigates the impact of World War 1 on the German-American community. Through the historical case study of one German-American voluntary association based in Indianapolis, the author dismisses both ethnic disappearance and ethnic survival theories. In contrast, the author proposes a more nuanced approach to the processes of assimilation of minority groups. The author contends that German-Americans did not lose the battle for survival but for pluralism and suggests that in times of economic as well as social transformations homogenizing forces tend to silence alternative voices in American society.

T1  - A Primordial Anxiety: Ontological Trauma and Ethnic Solidarity in Malaysia
AN  - 1767329183; 201606032
AB  - Ethnicity is a turbulent factor in Malaysian politics and society. Through decades of inter-ethnic tension fostered by ideological engineering, itself building on a history of ethnic manipulation and polarisation in colonial times, racialised tension has remained at best dormant and at worst prone to erupt in riots reminiscent of the May 1969 riots. This study examines the discourse of ethnicity from Malaysia's colonial roots up to the mid-20th century and beyond, seeking to highlight how trauma and struggle were integral to the very formation of ethnic consciousness. This work will also explore how, despite numerous writers questioning the naive 'essentialising' of ethnicity, they no less mistakenly perceive ethnicity in terms which reduce it to a de-centred hybridised performance. The works of writers like Colin Abraham, Sumit Mandal and Maznah Mohamad will be surveyed to elucidate the traumatic element inherent to ethnicity itself. A Lacanian psychoanalytical framework will be used to argue, with a special focus on the Malays, that ethnic solidarity should rather be grounded in a constructive primordial frustration, i.e., it is a traumatic anti-essence which will ignite solidarity and a mutual longing for democracy among the various ethnic groups. Ontological trauma-not a universal essence, not cultural particulars, not deconstructed performatives and certainly not political ideology-could be the force that compels Malaysia's volatile ethnic groups to co-exist and work together in nation-building.

T1  - Interests Aren't Everything: An Exploration of Economic Explanations of Immigration Policy in a New Destination
AN  - 1399261797
AB  - Current debates around US immigration policy are playing out against a backdrop that has changed significantly in the past 20 years: immigrants have increasingly gravitated towards "new destinations"; a large and growing portion of immigrants are undocumented; and the federal vacuum in responding to the promise and problems of these new immigration trends has devolved policy to the states. As a result, we have seen innovation on the state level as policymakers seek to accommodate, welcome or resist immigration, with varying degrees of success. In this paper, we explore the case of Utah as a new immigration destination, seeking to understand its transformation from a state with very inclusive immigrant policies as late as 1999 to one currently adopting highly restrictive immigrant policies. To explain this trajectory, we test three prominent materialist theories of public policy: instrumentalism, structuralism and strategic-relational approaches. We draw on a decade's worth of primary data - including data on state-level legislation, key economic indicators, public statements concerning immigration from the private business sector and the LDS Church, and the editorial content of the state's two major newspapers regarding immigration - to examine the policy explanations that grow out of interest-based theories of the state. Whereas these theories provide robust explanations for a large and diverse array of public policies, we find that they fall short in explaining immigration policy. While conventional wisdom - and extensive scholarly research - suggests that economic interests drive policy, we find that the policies around immigrants challenge this economic reductionism, suggesting the need for more complex and ideational accounts of this important phenomenon.

T1  - The Role of Job Insecurity in Explanations of Racial Health Inequalities
AN  - 1429629576; 201335722
AB  - The literature documenting substantial health differences for racial minorities in the United States is well developed and has considered a multitude of explanations for such disparities. However, the literature seldom addresses the health effects for racial minorities produced in the workplace. This study bridges these two literatures in order to understand the mediating role of job insecurity in explanations of racial health disparities. Our central argument is that racial differences in job insecurity resulting from the marginalized labor market positions of racial minorities are partially responsible for racial disparities in health. This study utilizes adjacent category and partial adjacent category logit models of general health using data from the 2000 to 2010 General Social Survey in order to test this claim. Overall, the results from this study indicate that there are substantial racial differences in job insecurity, and both race and job insecurity are important predictors of general self-rated health. Additionally, racial differences in job insecurity help explain a portion of the racial disparities in health. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for the study of health disparities in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Terrorism and jihad in Indonesia: Questions and possible ways forward
AN  - 1417521919; 201331723
AB  - We critically examine the three papers on terrorism and jihad in Indonesia contained in this issue. First, we argue that thorough discussion and definition of key terms (including religious violence and jihad) would have led to a much stronger framework for understanding the voices of the activists and their supporters. Second, the authors could have engaged more systematically with the international literature on intergroup relations and conflict to discuss how psychological and social processes of radicalization are similar or different in the Indonesian context. Third, we highlight methodological and ethical shortcomings in the three papers that call into question a number of the conclusions drawn by the authors. We outline future research questions and provide suggestions to strengthen this important line of research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - NATIONAL ATTITUDES OF ETHNIC HUNGARIANS FROM ROMANIA, SLOVAKIA, SERBIA AND UKRAINE: A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE
AN  - 1413248627
AB  - The article comparatively analyses national identifications of Hungarian minorities living in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia (Voivodina) and Ukraine, their ethnic and national attitudes and intergroup relations, including the ethno-national minority - majority relationship, and attitudes towards Hungary and the Roma community. Of interest is the presence and extent of ingroup-outgroup differentiation, and possible cross-national differences and similarities in national attitudes, identity, and perceived social distance. I examined the following two research hypotheses: (1) The Hungarian community in a given country identifies closer with other Hungarian communities living in the diaspora than with Hungarians in Hungary, or the majoritarian population in their country of citizenship. (2) Members of the Hungarian minorities generally perceive a greater social distance in relation to the majority population of a particular country as compared to Hungary's population, but cross-country differences are likely. The empirical data source of my research is the Karpat Panel survey, first wave (2007), collected on multi-stratified random sample (N=2,915), representing the Hungarian communities in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Ukraine, as well as a control sample from Hungary. I used a variety of statistical techniques, including OLS regression and multidimensional scaling - Alscal method based on the average values of social distances towards different ethnic and national communities, as well as other social groups - to analyse the relations of interest.

T1  - 'The foreignness is still quite visible in this town': multiculture, marginality and prejudice at the English seaside
AN  - 1364704301; 201323332
AB  - In recent years it has become apparent that experiences of integration, conflict, conviviality and prejudice between different ethnic groups can be found not just in towns and cities but increasingly in peripheral, non-urban areas too. While a small, but significant, body of literature has addressed the impact of these trends in rural environments, studies of seaside and coastal areas remain scarce. Burdsey's article responds to this omission through an examination of inter-ethnic relations at the English seaside. The English seaside is portrayed habitually as a 'white' environment in the popular imagination, and racialized bodies are frequently marked as 'out of place'. The discussion here highlights challenges to these dominant world-views through growing multicultural settlement in coastal settings, and addresses the implications of these shifts for minority ethnic residents. This is provided through a case study-consisting of in-depth interviews with and observations of minority ethnic groups-in a particular seaside town in southern England. The data highlight the ambivalent positions of respondents in relation to this setting: feelings of affection and belonging alongside those of structural and spatial marginalization and, most significantly, experiences of racism. Burdsey argues that, theoretically, the geographical and cultural marginality of certain seaside towns helps to explain the type of racialized relations that exist within them. In doing so he reinforces calls for going beyond the dominant urban/rural binary found in much of the literature on race, place and identity towards analyses of 'out of the way' places.

T1  - Childhood according to relatives and educators: ethnicity and social class
AN  - 1641424315; 201500303
AB  - We observed social representations of childhood among parents/grandparents and educators, according to ethnicity and social class. We asked them what it is a child from birth up to six years old 'in general', what do they like/dislike in this child and how they could change her/him. We organized the answers in themes about individual, basic relations, interpersonal relations, power relations, moral values. Themes on individual, interpersonal relations and moral values were more associated to the question in general, while basic relations and power relations to like/dislike. Regarding dislike and how to change a child, we found regularities in power relations among Whites, Mixed and Black people from the middle class, while among Jews were on individual and interpersonal relations. Lower class Whites stressed basic relations, while Mixed and Black interpersonal relations. We discussed the dynamic of relations between assertive minority and majority groups with more socio-cultural traits recognition. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What Are We Fighting For?: The Effects of Framing on Ingroup Identification and Allegiance
AN  - 1559006617; 201431758
AB  - Two studies were conducted examining the impact of framing on ingroup identification and allegiance in the context of international conflicts. The first study was carried out among British students at the beginning of the war in Afghanistan (N = 69). Perceptions of the war were manipulated by varying the frame that determined whether the war was perceived as positive and just or negative. Participants provided with a positive frame on the war identified more with their ingroup (Britain), and displayed higher allegiance to the United States than when given a negative frame. These findings were replicated in a second study conducted in the context of the second Iraq war (N = 51). Discussion focuses on the way in which framing affects perceptions of intergroup relations and the relationship between self, ingroup and out-group(s). Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ideological Orientation of Professors and Equity Policies for Racialized Minorities
AN  - 1494751662; 201402104
AB  - This paper examines the extent to which university professors in Canada are supportive of policies that set targets for admission to colleges and universities and that help increase employment opportunities for racial and ethnic minorities in the wider market. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that support for equity legislation is primarily accounted for by professors' ideological orientation and less so by their collective or self-interest. Using a large study conducted in 2001, we showed that the most important explanation for support for race-directed equity legislation is rooted in the perception of discrimination and a left-oriented ideology which includes egalitarianism, union support, and strike militancy. As well, the analysis revealed that racialized minorities are more, and higher income individuals are less, supportive of race-targeted equity policies. The policy implication of results is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Labor Force Participation and Earnings Gap among African Immigrant Women in the U.S.A
AN  - 1322723517; 201310746
AB  - Research on the socioeconomic attainment of immigrants has increased in recent decades. But there is a lot to be discovered in this area, especially the labor force participation and earnings of African immigrant women in the U.S.A. In this article, we use the 5% Integrated Public Use Microdata Samples (IPUMS) to examine changes in size and composition of the female African immigrant population in the U.S.A. and differences in the labor force participation and earnings between black and white African immigrant women during the period of 1980-2008. The results show that the female African immigrant population increased by an annual average growth rate of 23% between 1980 and 2008, with a much higher growth among black female Africans (81%) than whites (5%). The racial composition shifted from a white majority (68%) in 1980 to a black majority (72%) in 2008. Multivariate analysis of the labor force participation and personal earnings showed that the white advantage echoed in previous research had disappeared in 2008 when black African women became more likely to be in the labor force participation and to earn higher income than their white counterparts, net of the effects of socio-demographic variables. Such results challenge the labor queue theory, which assumes that white people have an absolute advantage in American job market. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Policy, citizenship and governance: the case of disability and employment policy in Australia
AN  - 1541997141; 201426911
AB  - Current discussions regarding the relationship between welfare governance systems and employment promotion in disability policy appeal to a rejuvenated neo-liberal and paternalistic understanding of welfare governance. At the core of this rationality is the argument that people with disabilities not only have rights, but also duties, in relation to the State. In the Australia welfare system, policy tools are deployed to produce a form of self-discipline, whereby the State emphasises personal responsibility via assessment tools, 'mutual obligation' policy, and motivational strategies. Drawing on a two-year semi-longitudinal study with 80 people with a disability accessing welfare benefits, we examine how welfare governance subject recipients to strategies to produce productive citizens who are able to contribute to the national goal of maintaining competitiveness in the global economy. Participants' interviews reveal the intended and unintended effects of this activation policy, including some acceptance of the logic of welfare-to-work and counter-hegemonic resistance to de-valued social identities.

T1  - Collective regret versus collective guilt: Different emotional reactions to historical atrocities
AN  - 1315600217; 201307382
AB  - A distinction between guilt and regret in reactions to in-group atrocities is proposed. Four studies (total N = 1249) support the notion that guilt and regret are distinct emotional reactions. Whereas guilt is a self-focused, aversive emotional reaction following from appraisals of responsibility and associated with the intention to make amends, regret follows from an empathic victim perspective, is less aversive, and is more strongly associated with positive attitudes towards the victim groups and the intention to engage in intergroup contact. These findings suggest that less aversive emotions like regret are more likely to improve intergroup attitudes after a common history of conflict, but the aversive experience of guilt might be more potent in motivating reparations.

T1  - Reactions to a social dilemma as a function of intragroup interactions and group performance
AN  - 1125222605; 201240282
AB  - We examined how group performance (success or failure) and intragroup interactions (minimal or favorable) affected responses to a social dilemma. We predicted that group failure would result in less overall cooperation, but that favorable intragroup interactions would buffer this adverse consequence. We further predicted that this buffering effect would be mediated by group identity, which would, in turn, operate through two processes, normative expectations and goal transformation. We experimentally manipulated the extent to which groups (N = 80 four-person groups) experienced minimal or favorable intragroup interactions and succeeded or failed on an intellective task before facing, as isolated individuals, a social dilemma. Our main hypotheses were supported, and structural equation modeling and analyses of moderated mediation were largely consistent with our theoretical model. The results support a social identity approach to social dilemmas and shed light on the processes involved in intragroup cooperation.

T1  - Gender threats and men's antigay behaviors: The harmful effects of asserting heterosexuality
AN  - 1125220050; 201240264
AB  - Whereas recent work on gender role violations suggests that asserting their heterosexuality may diminish the harmful effects of gender threats (versus gender affirmations) on men's antigay reactions, predictions derived from social identity theory suggest that asserting heterosexuality can exacerbate the negative effects of a gender threat on antigay reactions. Two studies tested these competing hypotheses. In Study 1, gender threatened versus affirmed men sent more intense noise blasts at a gay partner, but only if they asserted their heterosexuality. In Study 2, men high in sexual prejudice who underwent a gender threat sat farther from a gay confederate than gender affirmed men, but only if they asserted heterosexuality. Discussion considers the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, and highlights directions for future research.

T1  - Minority Status and the Use of Computer-Mediated Communication: A Test of the Social Diversification Hypothesis
AN  - 1023030900; 201223919
AB  - Group differences in the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) were investigated, to test the diversification hypothesis that argues that minorities and immigrants will be more likely to use CMC to compensate for their lack of social capital. Data were gathered from a sample of Internet users reflecting the percentage of minorities in the general population (n = 1,264). The results provide support for the hypothesis, indicating that in multicultural societies disadvantaged groups show greater motivation to use CMC to expand business and occupational contacts, whereas members of the majority group are more motivated to use CMC to maintain existing family and friendships ties. Implications of the finding are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Ethnic concentration in the neighbourhood and majority and minority language: A study of first and second-generation immigrants
AN  - 1429630099; 201335858
AB  - Ethnic residential concentration is often found to hamper immigrants' majority language proficiency. However, there are still several gaps in our understanding of the relationship between ethnic concentration and ethnic minorities' language practices. This study examines the extent to which ethnic concentration also constrains immigrants' majority language use, whether contact with natives and co-ethnics mediates these relationships, and whether ethnic concentration relates to second-generation minorities' minority language proficiency. Structural equation models on data for people of Turkish and Moroccan origin living in the Netherlands (N = 2163) showed that ethnic concentration is indirectly related to weaker majority language proficiency and less majority language use through contact with natives and co-ethnics. For second-generation minorities, ethnic concentration is related to better minority language proficiency. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Exploring the Latino Paradox: How Economic and Citizenship Status Impact Health
AN  - 1023027312; 201223803
AB  - The authors examined the contributions of economic status (ES) and citizenship status to health differences between European Americans, Latino Americans, and noncitizen Latinos. The investigation was framed using social identity and comparison theories. Southern California residents (N = 2,164) were randomly selected to complete a telephone interview. Increases in ES predicted health improvements for European Americans across ES levels. For Latino citizens and noncitizens, ES improvements had no effect on objective health. For subjective health, the Latino paradox existed at the lowest ES level for Latino Americans and did not exist for noncitizens. For objective health, the paradox existed in both Latino groups at low ES and additionally for Latino Americans at mid-ES. The study findings suggested that compared to Latinos, improvements in ES have a stronger positive impact on the health of European Americans, which is likely due to the social comparisons being made by each cultural group.

AB  - Relying on in-depth interviews with higher education students and young graduates the study investigates the factors underpinning the participation patterns of second-generation Turks in the Dutch higher education system. The paper highlights how ethnic minority students accommodate the constraints faced by the Dutch educational system by rationalizing economics at professional colleges as a suitable alternative to studying medicine at university, an alternative that will meet both their aspirations for a more successful and secure life than their parents' while maintaining the traditional family ties in line with the work-life balance offered by a 'nine-to-five job'.

T1  - Constructions of collective Muslim identity by advocates of Muslim schools in Britain
AN  - 1283644083; 201303478
AB  - This paper considers how and why collective Muslim identity is expressed and mobilized by advocates of Muslim schools in Britain. This relates to broader questions about the conceptualization, construction and meanings of Muslim identities, and the problem of essentialism that can arise when reporting identity claims that emphasize intra-group unity. Analysis of data from interviews with stakeholders in the debate about Muslim schools in Britain revealed advocates commonly regarded separate schooling as a protective measure against threats to and/or attacks on Muslim identity. It is argued that interviewees invoked collective Muslim identity in ways that drew attention to common knowledge, values and practice, and/or shared life experiences relating to denigrated or discordant social identities. The commonalities expressed by respondents are interpreted as evidence of a convergence of identities and interests in particular social conditions, and are not claimed to be essential characteristics of collective Muslim identity.

AB  - While the subjugation and abuse of Palestinians living within Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories are well documented, what is less well known is how ingrained racism is in Israel, in that it not only extends to Palestinian Christians and Muslims, but also to Jews who come from ethnic minority backgrounds. This article documents how the Falasha, Ethiopian Jews who have been brought into Israel in several mass transfer operations, have found themselves relegated to an underclass. They are not only racially discriminated against in housing, employment, education, the army and even in the practice of their religion, but have also been unwittingly used to bolster illegal settlements.

T1  - Historical memory and present-day oblivion: The Mapuche conflict in post-dictatorial Chile
AN  - 1463010324; 201345892
AB  - The conflict between the Chilean state and the Mapuche ethnic minority, and the history of dispossession of land, discrimination and marginalization go back to the end of the nineteenth century. The Pinochet military dictatorship made matters worse by giving their land away to big forest and hydroelectric enterprises. The end of the dictatorship produced expectations that these historical injustices would be addressed. While the post-dictatorship governments have implemented social assistance and cultural recognition policies, they have continued the economic policies put in place under the dictatorship and have criminalized social protests by sections of the Mapuche community. Meanwhile, Chilean society more broadly has remained indifferent towards the plight of Mapuche because of the pervasive narratives that depict Mapuche as standing outside the nation. Neither the state nor non-indigenous society has resolved their relationship with the Mapuche minority. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

AN  - 1322718792; 201310841
AB  - Social and economic development of ethnic minorities in the North of Russia are being hampered by both government policies and a continuing loss of population and deterioration in the way of life. This trend could still be reversed, but will require more cooperation between local and national authorities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - School racial composition and race/ethnic differences in early adulthood health
AN  - 1018341085; 201212853
AB  - We investigate whether school racial composition is associated with racial and ethnic differences in early adult health. We then examine whether perceived discrimination, social connectedness, and parent support attenuates this relationship. Using U.S. data from Waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, we found that black adolescents attending predominantly white schools reported poorer adult health while Asians reported better health. Further research is warranted to understand whether there are qualitative differences in the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities within certain school contexts and how that differential treatment is related to adult health outcomes.

T1  - Place and Lifestyle Migration: The Discursive Construction of 'Glocal' Place-Identity
AN  - 1347783634; 201318929
AB  - International lifestyle migration is a rapidly growing worldwide phenomenon. Within Europe, increasingly large numbers of northern Europeans are moving south in search of what they perceive as a better quality of life. The typical representation of this form of migration suggests that it is consumption-led, tourism-related and leisure-based; it is to be located within late modern, global, elitist, borderless and highly mobile social practices. The question arises as to the role of local place in this type of migration process and in the construction of individual and collective social identities. Using data from advertising texts produced by a residential-tourism resort and from in-depth interviews with British residents in the Golden Triangle area of the Algarve, Portugal, this article explores the relationships between discourse, identity, g/local place and lifestyle migration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Housed Gypsies and Travellers in the UK: work, exclusion and adaptation
AN  - 1010632193; 201210604
AB  - Gypsies and Travellers are one of the most excluded black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in the UK across numerous domains. Despite the increased policy focus on levels of unemployment and economic inactivity among BME groups in recent years, little attention has been paid to the economic position of Gypsies and Travellers, not least because there is a lack of systematic data on the employment status and working patterns of these communities. Few of the programmes set up to tackle unemployment specifically target this population and, anecdotally, a mismatch exists in relation to mainstream back-to-work programmes and community needs. This article considers a series of related studies that explore the accommodation histories and adaptive strategies utilised by housed Gypsies and Travellers across four locations in southern England. One strand of these studies is concerned with employment opportunities and practices following the transition into housing. We draw on these findings to discuss the role of cultural adaptations in mediating the wider socioeconomic context and how recourse to collective responses helps to shape economic and labour market outcomes for members of this group.

T1  - Intraracial harassment on campus: explaining between- and within-group differences
AN  - 919903727; 201201737
AB  - Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF), we examine both between- and within-group differences in the odds of feeling intraracially harassed. Specifically, we investigate the effects of colleges' and universities' racial composition as well as the nature of students' associations with non-group members, including involvement in racially homogeneous campus organizations, ethnoracial diversity of friendship networks, and interracial dating. Our findings suggest that although college racial composition appears to have little effect on experiencing intraracial harassment, the nature of students' involvement with other-race students matters a great deal. For all groups, interracial dating increased odds of harassment. Among black and white students, more diverse friendship networks did as well. And among Asian and Latino students, involvement in any racially homogeneous campus organization was associated with increases in reports of intraracial harassment. Thus, we propose a baseline theoretical model of intraracial harassment that highlights the nature of students' associations with outgroups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Multicultural attitudes among adolescents: The role of ethnic diversity in the classroom
AN  - 919903940; 201201490
AB  - In this study predictors of multiculturalism at the individual and classroom level are tested in a multilevel model. Previous studies attempting to find predictors of multiculturalism focused only on the individual level, possibly risking an attribution error. Multiculturalism is presented in this study as a notion stressing equal opportunities and minimizing discrimination as well as the conviction that the access to other cultures enriches ones own life. Using a sample of 448 adolescents from junior vocational education it was found that more ethnic diversity at the classroom level is positively related to adolescents' support for multiculturalism. As such, this study supports the intergroup contact theory. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - "The Only Dykey One": Constructions of (In)Authenticity in a Lesbian Community of Practice
AN  - 907929203; 201124697
AB  - This article demonstrates how members of a lesbian community of practice make interactional moves that allow them to position themselves as "authentically lesbian." Through the use of discourse analysis and a sociocultural linguistics focus on indexicality, the speakers are shown to invoke broadly accessible stereotypes and ideologies and to rework them in order to create locally specific, meaningful identities. This is achieved via mutually negotiated stance taking toward group-constructed, oppositional personae. Specifically, the women in this group position styles deemed as "girly" as inauthentic and antithetical to their concept of a lesbian-the authentic "dyke.". Adapted from the source document.

T1  - History Museums and Social Cohesion: Building Identity, Bridging Communities, and Addressing Difficult Issues
AN  - 896181510; 201120174
AB  - Museums have the capacity to enhance social cohesion, which is the product of a trusting, connected community. History museums and historic sites, in particular, can serve communities by stimulating dialogue on difficult issues, accurately representing all the people of a nation, and creating forums for discussion among groups with disparate opinions. History museums promote social cohesion by solidifying the identities of their audiences-as members of communities, ethnic groups, nations, and the world. This article combines extensive research with firsthand experience in history museums to accurately portray the ways different museums affect social cohesion. It looks first at what social cohesion is, and the ways in which both civil society and educational organizations contribute to it. It makes the argument that museums share attributes of both civil society and educational organizations. This article then addresses the different ways museums contribute to defining identity, bridging community divides, and addressing society's most difficult issues. It does this with in-depth analysis of several Holocaust museums and the movement in Russia to memorialize sites of Stalinist terror. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Patterns of Racial-Ethnic Exclusion by Internet Daters
AN  - 881465951; 201116446
AB  - Using data from 6070 U.S. heterosexual internet dating profiles, this study examines how racial and gender exclusions are revealed in the preferences of black, Latino, Asian and white online daters. Consistent with social exchange and group positions theories, the study finds that whites are least open to out-dating and that, unlike blacks, Asians and Latinos have patterns of racial exclusion similar to those of whites. Like blacks, higher earning groups including Asian Indians, Middle Easterners and Asian men are highly excluded, suggesting that economic incorporation may not mirror acceptance in intimate settings. Finally, racial exclusion in dating is gendered; Asian males and black females are more highly excluded than their opposite-sex counterparts, suggesting that existing theories of race relations need to be expanded to account for gendered racial acceptance.

T1  - Post-urbanism, Incorporation, and Migration
AN  - 896197486; 201120166
AB  - This paper explores an emerging pattern of migration currently being written by the new wave of Mexican migrants in New Haven, Connecticut, a city with little to no history of Mexican migration. Using New Haven as a case study, this paper argues that local conditions shape immigrant experiences and thus frame the process of social and economic incorporation. By contrasting first-wave Italian migration and contemporary Mexican migration, we demonstrate that urban conditions both foster and impede the social and political integration of immigrant groups. Our analyses demonstrate that the presence of established ethnic communities pose challenges and benefits to the political and social incorporation of Italians and Mexicans in their respective urban eras. Moreover, we find that contemporary immigrants are entering settings that are more racialized and economically distinct than that of their first-wave immigrant predecessors.

T1  - Que Es Racismo? Awareness of Racism and Discrimination in Ecuador
AN  - 896182022; 201120105
AB  - In the national consciousness, Ecuador is a mestizo nation. However, it is also an ethnically diverse nation with sizable minorities of indigenous and Afro-descended peoples. In national surveys, there is also a considerable minority who self-identify as blanco (white). Although there is strong evidence of continuing discrimination and prejudice toward both indigenous and Afro-descended peoples, there is little public discussion or political action addressing such issues. The emergence of a powerful and resilient indigenous movement in the late 1980s gained international interest and acclaim in the 1990s, in part because of the peaceful mobilization efforts and effective bargaining tactics of the movement. However, indigenous leaders usually have not engaged in a discourse of racismo and/or discriminacion. There has been much less social movement solidarity and activism among Afro-Ecuadorians, but their leaders commonly employ a discourse of racismo and discriminacion. In August and September 2004, a survey of more than eight thousand adult Ecuadorians was conducted in regard to racism and related topics. In this research, we use several measures from this survey that focus on awareness of and sensitivity to issues of racism, prejudice, and discrimination. Self-identification respondents enables us to contrast the responses of whites, mestizos, Indians, and Afro-Ecuadorians to the measures. Other independent variables of interest are level of education, the region in which the respondent resides, and whether the respondent lives in an urban or rural area. Regression results show differences among the ethnic groups in levels of awareness of racism, but more powerful predictors are level of education and rural residence.

T1  - Cognitive Obstacles Against Organ Donation: The Influence of Negative Attitudes, Norms, and Traditional Beliefs on Chinese People's Intention to Donate Organs after Death
AN  - 856403563; 201106830
AB  - In China, the organ supply is severely insufficient to cover all people on the waiting list for donated organs, and numerous patients die awaiting transplant. To achieve a better understanding of cadaveric organ donation in Chinese culture, this study examined 300 Chinese adults, in both Fujian Province and Macao, regarding attitudes towards organ donation, subjective norms about organ donation and traditional beliefs about the body and death, examining the influences of these factors on respondents' donation intentions. Multiple hierarchical regression results suggest that more negative attitudes, unfavourable norms and traditional beliefs lead to lower donation intentions. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Prospects for a European Identity
AN  - 1081863322; 201236309
AB  - In several respects, the EU represents both a novel system of quasi-supranational governance and a novel form of political community or polity. But it is also a fragile construction for it remains a community still in the making with an ambiguous sense of identity and within which powerful forces are at work. This paper has three main aims: first, to stress the shifting nature of Europe's geographical frontiers and assess whether cultural frontiers have remained more stable throughout time. In particular, it examines the main criteria, which have traditionally been employed when having to decide who should be included and excluded from Europe. A different question concerns the requirements for EU membership and the monopoly of the adjective "European" by the EU, which somehow has become to be identified with Europe. Second, to explore the prospects for the emergence of a European identity. Here, I argue that European identity stands as a "non-emotional identity" in sharp contrast with traditional forms of national identity associated with intense nationalist feelings. Third, through the analysis of the most recent Eurobarometer (annual survey of EU's public opinion) to examine the views of Europeans regarding the EU at a time of a major global economic crisis. To conclude, the paper explores the main challenges to be faced by a still incipient European identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigration and the politics of social cohesion
AN  - 862595920; 201109656
AB  - According to the social cohesion argument for restrictive immigration policies, immigration causes ethnic diversity and ethnic diversity undermines social cohesion and thereby the sort of solidarity necessary to uphold the welfare state. Therefore, immigration must be (severely) restricted. I argue that this argument in fact encompasses a variety of different arguments that have importantly different implications for immigration policy, and relies on empirical and normative premises that are insufficiently motivated.

T1  - Prejudice among Peruvians and Chileans as a Function of Identity, Intergroup Contact, Acculturation Preferences, and Intergroup Emotions
AN  - 835111548; 201100491
AB  - A special Latin American acculturative context is currently developing in Chile in which native Chileans have contact with several immigrant groups, particularly newcomers from Peru. This study examines several intergroup variables including contact, national and Latino American identities, group distinctiveness, realistic threat, intergroup anxiety, and acculturation preferences as predictors of prejudice on the part of both Chilean natives and Peruvian immigrants. Three hundred Peruvian immigrants (194 females and 106 males) and 300 Chileans (199 females and 101 males) participated in the study. Acculturation preferences, perceived group distinctiveness, and especially intergroup contact were shown to be important predictors of prejudice toward out-group members. Intergroup anxiety and realistic threat mediated some of these effects. The pattern of these results also varied as a function of nationality. Theoretical as well as practical implications for further research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigrants' Perceptions of the Police
AN  - 818802101; 201072761
AB  - Despite a fast growing immigrant population and the recent intensive debate over immigration law enforcement, research on police-immigrant relations in general and immigrants' perceptions of the police in particular remains limited. This article comprehensively reviews existing literature on immigrants' perceptions of the police. It starts with the value and timeliness of studying immigrants' attitudes and expectations of the police in today's multi-racial, multi-cultural society. Then the article summarizes findings regarding how immigrants perceive the police and what factors shape their perceptions. Evidence about the effects of both universal factors and factors unique to immigrants on their perceptions of the police is presented. The article concludes with a brief discussion of future research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Transmigrant Indian Women: Creators of Diasporic Spaces
AN  - 862595385; 201109664
AB  - In this paper I look into social reproduction processes in the realms of family and household in the context of transnational families. These processes interweave with the economic enterprises, fluctuating global markets and state policies. My argument is that living in racially discriminiatory social worlds, transmigrant women of Indian origin become aware of the continuous presence of social tension and conflict and in order to cope with these situations of adversity they deploy simultaneous and multiple strategies which are by and large based on their old and new experiences. In-depth examination of their strategies helps me to analyse the extent to which transmigrant women contribute to the Indian ethnic minority communities' challenge of acquiring meaningful social spaces in their transnational settings.

T1  - Emotional Ambiguity: Japanese Migrant Women in Mixed Families and their Life Transition
AN  - 754039289; 201049749
AB  - Through the narratives of Japanese migrant women in Ireland, this paper focuses on their perceptions of 'home' and their emotional processes in the context of their life transition. In order to explore the interactive and relational nature of their emotional processes, three questions are examined. How do migrant women manage their emotions in the process of constructing motherhood as their main social identity? How do their emotional orientations complement or conflict other emotion rules? In changing social and familial settings, how are their feelings navigated? The narratives of two Japanese mothers illustrate their contradictory, inconsistent and ambiguous emotional experiences which are created through physical mobility and transnational family relationships. Through changing social roles, obligations and expectations, they participate in different 'feeling rules' to frame the lived experiences in which their relationships with their new country and home place are renewed. Through changing their life course, they also experience 'emotional resonance' or 'dissonance' with others, which affects their sense of belonging/non-belonging in different places. The context of motherhood provides examples of such dynamics of multiple, interdependent processes in which subjectivities and feelings emerge. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race, Gender, and the Invisible Hand of Social Capital
AN  - 754037856; 201049757
AB  - To better understand persistent race and gender inequality in the labor market, this article discusses the informal processes by which social connections provide individuals with access to information, influence, and status that help to further people's careers. Because social networks are segregated by race and gender, access to these social capital resources tends to be greater for white men than for minorities and women. To illustrate this point, research on the invisible hand of social capital is presented. In short, high-level job openings are commonly filled with non-searchers -- people who are not looking for new jobs -- thanks to their receipt of unsolicited job leads. Recent studies find that this process operates more effectively for white men than for minorities and women, demonstrating how the invisible hand of social capital helps to perpetuate race and gender inequality. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings and directions for future research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Impact of Crossgroup Friendships in South Africa: Affective Mediators and Multigroup Comparisons
AN  - 743067027; 201043371
AB  - Two cross-sectional survey studies among majority-status White and minority-status Coloured high school students in South Africa explored the effects of crossgroup friendships on prejudice, and the affective processes (intergroup anxiety in Study 1, and intergroup anxiety and affective empathy in Study 2) underlying these effects with respect to two target groups for each sample. Crossgroup friendships were negatively associated with negative action tendencies, and positively associated with positive outgroup attitudes and greater perceived outgroup variability for both samples, irrespective of the target group. The importance of intergroup anxiety and affective empathy as mediators of these effects was also confirmed. Multigroup comparisons showed significant differences in the structural models across the two samples in both studies, and confirmed prior findings in the contact literature that contact effects are stronger for majority than minority groups. These findings are the first of their kind within the South African context. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Moving On from Indices, Refocusing on Mix: On Measuring and Understanding Ethnic Patterns of Residential Segregation
AN  - 743055161; 201031686
AB  - In a recent special issue of JEMS, Peach challenged the authors' work on the measurement of ethnic segregation and the use of their proposed approach in studies of British cities. Peach argued for the continued deployment of single-number indices--especially those of unevenness (dissimilarity and segregation). This response highlights the major disadvantages of those and other indices, especially in the contemporary context where most members of ethnic minorities live in urban neighbourhoods with varying degrees of ethnic mix rather than in relatively exclusive areas where they are largely separated from the rest of the population. If mix is the dominant situation, methods are needed that identify rather than obscure it. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Self-focus and stereotyping of the self
AN  - 60370412; 201017452
AB  - A study tested the effects of mirror-induced self-focus on participants tendency to self-stereotype. Americans high and low in identification with their nationality rated themselves and the group 'Americans on traits that varied in stereotypicality and valence. Participants made these ratings under one of three conditions: (1) while facing a mirror, (2) while facing a mirror with an American flag visible, and (3) while not facing a mirror. High identifiers were more likely to endorse stereotypic traits and to rate themselves as similar to their national group when self-focused. In contrast, low identifiers were less likely to endorse stereotypic traits and to rate themselves as similar to their national group when self-focused. These patterns were limited to traits negative in valence. Correlational analyses indicated that self/group ratings were most similar when high identifiers were self-focused. Implications for the distinction between personal and social identity are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]
