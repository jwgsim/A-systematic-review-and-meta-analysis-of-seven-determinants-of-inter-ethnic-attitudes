T1  - Criminal Justice Students’ Perceptions and Awareness of Racism and Discrimination
AN  - 2635446142
AB  - The recent focus on the controversial deaths of minorities at the hands of police officers has led to increased attention on racial bias among the law enforcement community. However, this focus does not extend to criminal justice students. Instead, research examining undergraduates’ racial attitudes focuses on the general student body. In addition to reviewing literature related to criminal justice students’ attitudes toward a variety of criminal justice and social issues, the current study used multiple regression analyses to examine racial and gender differences in a Southwestern University’s criminal justice students’ perceptions of and sensitivity to racism. Findings from the study indicate that male criminal justice students in the sample and White criminal justice students are more likely to have lower perceptions of racism than their female and non-White counterparts, respectively. Additionally, findings for criminal justice students’ sensitivity to racism suggest that White male criminal justice students’ sensitivity to racism only statistically significantly differs from non-White females with White males more likely to be less sensitive than non-White females. Furthermore, the current research provides a benchmark for research related to criminal justice students’ perceptions of racism and discriminatory practices and their attitudes toward minorities. Results, study implications, recommendations, and future research are discussed.

T1  - Situer la conscience du droit sur le harcèlement de rue
TT  - Situating Legal Consciousness: Experiences and Attitudes of Ordinary Citizens about Law and Street Harassment
AN  - 2519433257
AB  - La conscience du droit des citoyens ordinaires face aux propos publics offensants et à leur régulation juridique est une question qui a fait l'objet de vifs débats, mais qui a été peu analysée par des études empiriques. À partir d'observations effectuées dans les espaces publics de trois collectivités du nord de la Californie et d'entretiens approfondis avec 100 sujets recrutés dans ces lieux, nous analysons, en fonction de la race et du genre, les différences dans les expériences vécues en matière de propos publics offensants et dans les opinions exprimées sur la manière dont ils devraient être traités par le droit. Parmi les personnes interrogées, les femmes blanches et les personnes de couleur sont beaucoup plus nombreuses que les hommes blancs à déclarer être la cible de propos publics offensants. Cependant, les femmes blanches et les personnes de couleur ne sont pas significativement plus favorables que les hommes blancs à leur prise en charge par le droit. Les personnes interrogées se prononcent majoritairement contre la pénalisation des propos publics offensants, mais tiennent des discours différents pour motiver cette opposition. Les mots utilisés par les sujets eux-mêmes font ressortir quatre paradigmes relativement distincts qui mettent l'accent respectivement sur la liberté d'expression, l'autonomie, l'impraticabilité et la défiance vis-à-vis des autorités. Les discours mobilisés tendent à varier en fonction du groupe racial et du genre. Ces différences semblent indiquer que la conscience du droit des citoyens ordinaires n'est pas un phénomène unitaire, mais qu'elle est plutôt située en fonction des types de lois, des hiérarchies sociales et des rapports au droit des différents groupes.Alternate abstract:The legal consciousness of ordinary citizens concerning offensive public speech is a phenomenon whose legal status has been vigorously debated, but which has received little empirical analysis. Drawing on observations in public spaces in three northern California communities and in-depth interviews with 100 subjects recruited from these public locations, I analyze variation across race and gender groups in experiences with offensive public speech and attitudes about how such speech should be dealt with by law. Among these respondents, white women and people of color are far more likely than white men to report being the targets of offensive public speech. However, white women and people of color are not significantly more likely than white men to favor its legal regulation. Respondents generally oppose the legal regulation of offensive public speech, but they employ different discourses to explain why. Subjects' own words suggest four relatively distinct paradigms that emphasize the First Amendment, autonomy, impracticality, and distrust of authority. Members of different racial and gender groups tend to use different discourses. These differences suggest that the legal consciousness of ordinary citizens is not a unitary phenomenon, but must be situated in relation to particular types of laws, particular social hierarchies, and the experiences of different groups with the law.

T1  - Comparing story reading and video watching as two distinct forms of vicarious contact: An experimental intervention among elementary school children
AN  - 2474519727
AB  - Research has shown that vicarious contact, that is observing an interaction between ingroup and outgroup members, can improve intergroup relations. Although vicarious contact has been operationalized in different ways, mainly via story reading or video watching, an experimental comparison of these different strategies is still missing. We conducted a school intervention with the aim of comparing the two most used forms of vicarious contact, namely story reading and video watching. Elementary schoolchildren without disabilities (N = 292) were assigned to one of three different conditions: reading a story; watching a video; control. In the two vicarious contact conditions, participants read or watched the story of a child with disability becoming friends with children without disabilities; in the control condition, participants only completed the dependent measures. Results revealed that, in general, both vicarious contact conditions were equally effective in improving outgroup attitudes and behavioural intentions. In addition, they operated with the same strength through the same underlying processes (IOS, ingroup norms). We discuss theoretical and practical implications in the context of vicarious contact as a prejudice‐reduction intervention.

T1  - Group‐based guilt and shame in the context of intergroup conflict: The role of beliefs and meta‐beliefs about group malleability
AN  - 2387129788
AB  - Group‐based guilt and shame are part of a wide range of moral emotions in intergroup conflicts. These emotions can potentially motivate group members to make compromises in order to promote conflict resolution, and increase support for reparations and apologies following moral transgressions committed by the in‐group. Thus, it is important to understand how to induce these emotions and the mechanisms for their effects. In the present paper, we examined the mechanisms underlying group‐based guilt and shame in four studies. Across the first three studies, conducted in the context of the Israeli‐Palestinian conflict, we found that group‐based guilt was mostly predicted by individuals’ implicit theories about groups (ITG). Specifically, we found that the more participants believed that groups are malleable, the more they experienced group‐based guilt. Group‐based shame, however, was found to be dependent upon individuals’ perception of other people’s perceptions about the malleability of groups (i.e., meta‐ITG), as the perceived damage to one’s in‐group image is a major component in experiencing shame. In Study 4, conducted in the context of gender relations, we differentiated between the two components of shame, that is, moral and image shame. As predicted, while group‐based guilt and moral shame showed similar patterns of results, meta‐ITG had a moderating effect on the association between ITG and group‐based image shame. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed in relation to promoting intergroup conflict resolution and reconciliation.

T1  - “A Golly was simply a toy. End of”: Inoculation, attention deflection, and attempted puzzle‐resolution in contesting racism in online discussions
AN  - 2384449210
AB  - In producing arguments against minority groups that are designed to avoid accusations of prejudice, speakers routinely deploy two discursive strategies. One strategy of “inoculation” seeks to ward off such accusations, while the other strategy of “attention deflection” directs attention away from the potential target group. Where despite use of one or both strategies accusations arise, the result is a puzzle that needs to be resolved through explanation. Here, in a discourse analysis of online discussions as to whether “blacking up” is to count as racism, we see contributors contest (a) whether absence of intention to offend inoculates individuals from accountability for potentially racist actions, (b) whether “blacking up” depicts toys/characters rather than people, and (c) whether attempted explanations of accusations of racism work to resolve the apparent puzzle that has arisen. Contributors do not reach any consensus. These findings point to the difficulties in attempting to challenge potential racism.

T1  - Cross-cultural and Interracial Fostering in South Africa: Challenges Faced By Non-relative Foster Parents
AN  - 2583617482
AB  - In South Africa, racial prejudices and cultural insensitivity affect and define relationships. These social forces constitute enormous challenges and present immense barriers to non-relative child fostering and protection. This paper reports findings of a doctoral study that adopted a qualitative approach to explore the experiences offoster parents caring for non-relative foster children in De Deur, Gauteng Province, South Africa. A sample of 20 non-relative foster parents who fostered children from another cultural or racial group was purposively selectedfrom the caseload of Vereeniging Child and Family Welfare Society, De Deur satellite office. Data was collected using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The findings indicated that the foster parents experienced stigmatisation and discrimination; undue external interference; rejection and isolation and care scrutiny and suspicion. The study concluded that negative public perceptions and attitudes towards non-relative foster parents are pervasive. They have not been properly dealt with in the South African context and undermine the concept of'Ubuntu'. These could result in resentment and hamper relationship building between foster parents and foster children. Deliberate positive government policy intervention and social engineering is recommended for attitude and behaviour change in this regard.

T1  - The Extended Contact Hypothesis: A Meta-Analysis on 20 Years of Research
AN  - 2203064978
AB  - According to the extended contact hypothesis, knowing that in-group members have cross-group friends improves attitudes toward this out-group. This meta-analysis covers the 20 years of research that currently exists on the extended contact hypothesis, and consists of 248 effect sizes from 115 studies. The aggregate relationship between extended contact and intergroup attitudes was r = .25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [.22, .27], which reduced to r = .17, 95% CI = [.14, .19] after removing direct friendship’s contribution; these results suggest that extended contact’s hypothesized relationship to intergroup attitudes is small-to-medium and exists independently of direct friendship. This relationship was larger when extended contact was perceived versus actual, highlighting the importance of perception in extended contact. Current results on extended contact mostly resembled their direct friendship counterparts, suggesting similarity between these contact types. These unique insights about extended contact and its relationship with direct friendship should enrich and spur growth within this literature.

T1  - When friendship is stronger than prejudice. Role of intergroup friendships among adolescents in two distinct socio-cultural contexts of immigration
AN  - 2230253866
AB  - Despite the structural characteristics of international migration in most European countries, the persistence of prejudice and negative attitudes towards immigrants represents an unsolved problem that erodes social cohesion. European institutions continue to be concerned about the spread of xenophobia, especially among young generations. This article aims to shed light on the crucial role of intergroup friendships, considered a key factor in reducing the hostility toward immigrant groups. In particular, the aim is to verify the effects of intergroup friendships on prejudice, using data derived from an international survey carried out in France and Italy, two emblematic European countries as regarding the experience of international migration. 1,642 French and Italian adolescents, selected by a rationale choice sample, were involved: multivariate analysis confirmed the hypothesis that adolescents who hold intergroup friendships show lower levels of prejudice. The influence of the intergroup friendships on the decrease of intolerance is evident especially on socioeconomic and security issues while for the identity matters its effects are moderated by the country of residence of the participants. Considering these results, positive contacts among local and immigrant populations are recommended in order to reduce social fragmentation and foster social cohesion.

T1  - Minority Stress and LGB-Inclusive Television Viewing Frequency Among LGB Adults: The Roles of Community Connectedness and Perceived Social Support
AN  - 2193681013
AB  - Using a cross-sectional, correlational design, the present study examined the moderating roles of perceived social support and community connectedness in the relationship between minority stress and viewing frequency of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)-inclusive television shows among LGB adults. Participants identified predominately as White and female, and the largest group identified as bisexual. Participants completed self-report measures of minority stressors, social support, LGB community connectedness, and viewing frequency. A multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the relationships among these variables. Findings revealed that perceived social support moderated the effect of prejudice events on viewing frequency, such that LGB viewers who reported high levels of prejudice events and low perceived social support endorsed the highest levels of viewing frequency. These findings provide further insight into the ways in which LGB individuals consume media content and may be informative for clinicians in understanding coping strategies for minority stress among LGB clients.

T1  - Using Media Literacy to Counter Stereotypical Images of Blacks and Latinos at a Predominantly White University
AN  - 2206009096
AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations.

T1  - Converging or Diverging: Shifting Ethnoracial Composition and the Urban-suburban Distinction in Attitudes toward Immigrants in Houston, 1995–2016
AN  - 2067681536
AB  - We examine the political position of the suburbs relative to the city by focusing on attitudes toward immigrants. Using 22 years of survey data for the Houston area, this paper addresses three questions. First, how has the attitudinal position of the suburbs relative to the city changed over time? Second, does the city-suburb distinction differ depending on the respondent’s race/ethnicity? Finally, do these results differ depending on the content of the question? Multivariate results indicate an overall increase in positive attitudes, but the increase is slower in the suburbs relative to the city. The resulting divergence is driven exclusively by non-Hispanic whites and is only evident when focusing on more contentious questions regarding immigrants in the United States. Our results suggest a persistent suburban cultural context despite recent demographic shifts, and they highlight the multidimensional nature of the (racialized) attitudes toward immigrants held by non-Hispanic whites in the United States.

T1  - It is not quite cricket: Muslim immigrants' accounts of integration into UK society
AN  - 1993908892
AB  - Recent events demonstrate the need for greater understanding of intercultural relations between Muslim minorities and majority of cultures in host societies. We examine British Muslims' descriptions of their experiences of acculturation. Data from interviews with first-generation Muslims were analysed by using discourse analysis. Participants' descriptions reflect the acculturation possibilities made available in local interactional contexts. Where invited to choose between assimilation and separation, participants provide 'trouble-telling' accounts that detail the difficulties involved. In contexts involving integration, participants account for their own efforts. By contrast, contexts that allow participants to introduce acculturation in their own terms lead to descriptions of acculturation success. Thus, participants' accounts of relations with British culture reflect not simply orientations towards acculturation but rather how acculturation is framed and negotiated in local contexts: The success or failure of intercultural relations reflects as much how the issues are presented as they do immigrants' acceptance or non-acceptance of British culture.

T1  - Race, Ethnicity, Risky Lifestyles, and Violent Victimization: A Test of a Mediation Model
AN  - 1934663620
AB  - Empirical studies have established that Blacks and Hispanics are two of the most violently victimized racial/ethnic groups in the United States, but the mechanisms that underlie these disparities in victimization risk are not well understood. This study tests a mediation model developed from criminal opportunity theories that may explain the disparities. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, the results show that Black and Hispanic adolescents were twice as likely as their White counterparts to be violently victimized, and these disparities remained after controlling for demographic characteristics and prior victimization. As to the hypothesized sources of these disparities, there was mixed evidence regarding the mediation model. Although risky lifestyles were significantly related to violent victimization and eliminated all disparities between Black and White youth, they failed to eliminate victimization disparities between Hispanics and White youth. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of theory and victimization prevention.

T1  - Methodological pitfalls of measuring race: international comparisons and repurposing of statistical categories
AN  - 1930436620
AB  - Official statistics are political creations more than theoretically guided concepts. The papers in this volume make this exceptionally clear, as does the work of many others (e.g. Loveman 2014; Nobles 2000; Prewitt 2013). This means that official measures of race in countries around the world are unlikely to be guided by theoretical concern for distinguishing the different dimensions that are all embedded under the umbrella term: “race”. Furthermore, categories created for official statistics or national censuses can take on a life of their own. They can be applied to new contexts and inform public debates beyond their original demographic or political purposes. Here, I argue that the need for theoretical clarity across dimensions of race is magnified by comparisons across national contexts. I also discuss, using the example of the Canadian measure of “visible minorities”, how the repurposing of statistical categories can create its own methodological pitfalls in measuring distinct dimensions of race.

T1  - Minority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health: A Study of Italian Transgender People
AN  - 1940950412
AB  - Transgender people often experience oppression because of gender nonconformity. They represent an extremely stigmatized population at high risk of developing mental health problems. The minority stress model is a theoretical model used to understand social stigma as a potential cause of mental health disparities faced by the transgender population. In Italy, studies applying this model to the transgender population are limited. The current study applied the minority stress model to a sample of Italian transgender people (n = 149), analyzing effects of prejudice events, expectations of rejection, and internalized transphobia, and their interaction with protective factors (resilience and social support), on mental health. The results suggest that exposure to everyday discrimination and internalized transphobia are associated with increased mental health problems, while perceived social support from family and resilience significantly reduced the strength of association between everyday discrimination and mental health. Findings have important implications for both social issues and policies.

T1  - Can Caring Create Prejudice? An Investigation of Positive and Negative Intergenerational Contact in Care Settings and the Generalisation of Blatant and Subtle Age Prejudice to Other Older People
AN  - 1855255674
AB  - Caring is a positive social act, but can it result in negative attitudes towards those cared for, and towards others from their wider social group? Based on intergroup contact theory, we tested whether care workers' (CWs) positive and negative contact with old-age care home residents (CHRs) predicts prejudiced attitudes towards that group, and whether this generalises to other older people. Fifty-six CWs were surveyed about their positive and negative contact with CHRs and their blatant and subtle attitudes (humanness attributions) towards CHRs and older adults. We tested indirect paths from contact with CHRs to attitudes towards older adults via attitudes towards CHRs. Results showed that neither positive nor negative contact generalised blatant ageism. However, the effect of negative, but not positive, contact on the denial of humanness to CHRs generalised to subtle ageism towards older adults. This evidence has practical implications for management of CWs' work experiences and theoretical implications, suggesting that negative contact with a subgroup generalises the attribution of humanness to superordinate groups. Because it is difficult to identify and challenge subtle prejudices such as dehumanisation, it may be especially important to reduce negative contact. © 2016 The Authors.

T1  - Social network development experiences of immigrants from Turkey to Canada
AN  - 1836613020
AB  - The concept of social capital has gained popularity in the field of migration studies in recent decades, yet we still know relatively little about how immigrants develop social networks in their host countries - despite the fact that networks constitute the core of social capital. This paper applies a Bourdieuian approach to migration research while examining the network development processes of immigrants from Turkey to Canada, all within the framework of social inequality based upon occupation and class. My findings demonstrate that network development with co-nationals, members of other immigrant groups, and native-born Canadians is a complex process in which such various factors as social class, ethnicity, habitus, and different forms of capital jointly shape the opportunities to access social networks, as well as the nature of such networks.

T1  - Examining the Effects of Scattered Site Supportive Housing on the Social and Economic Integration of Men Who Are Formerly Homeless and Primarily Black/African American
AN  - 1830031185
AB  - Housing dispersal strategies (scattered sites) have its roots in efforts to construct public housing in more ethnically diverse and affluent communities as a result of the overrepresentation of Blacks/African Americans living in public housing developments with concentrated poverty and racial segregation. Today, the use of scattered site housing is more indicative of nonprofit housing providers seeking to end homelessness. Comparable with the demographics of public housing residents, Blacks/African Americans are severely overrepresented in homeless populations across America. This study examined the impact of scattered site supportive housing, located in an affluent and predominately White/European American community to determine any reductions in social isolation and any levels of improved socio-economic status of men who were formerly homeless and primarily Black/African American. This study used five variables identified from earlier studies thought to influence socio-economic well-being: resident satisfaction, a sense of community, impact on income, neighbor opposition or not-in-my-own backyard (NIMBY) attitudes, and impact of scattered site housing on property values. The results showed that the respondents were, on average, more satisfied with the buildings where they lived than their landlord relations or external neighbors. Furthermore, the study found very little neighbor opposition based on race or class and no negative impact on property values from nearby scattered site developments. Based on these findings, recommendations to continue implementing housing dispersal strategies are offered. In addition, directions for future research are provided.

T1  - Smartness as cultural wealth: an AsianCrit counterstory
AN  - 1811355657
AB  - Historically, Asians have been defined by a range of negative and positive images that include the coolie, the deviant, the yellow peril, and the model minority. However, the negative images have been slowly and robustly replaced with ones that portray Asian Americans as high achievers, smart, and a model - especially when compared to other students of color. For many Asian American students, 'smartness' as a cultural practice and an imposed attribute has become synonymous with whiteness - impacting their academic, social, cultural, and language identities. Utilizing reflexive ethnography, I share what I name 'cultural wealth as smartness' as a Vietnamese refugee student growing up in a predominantly white community and the cultural capital gained and lost as a result. This article provides a counter-narrative to the Asian American experience and the deficit assumptions imposed upon immigrant families in the US.

T1  - Economic Crisis and Anti-Immigrant Sentiment: The Case of Andalusia/Crisis económica y sentimiento antinmigrante: el caso de Andalucía
AN  - 1833079974
AB  - This paper provides three interrelated reasons not to confound perceptions of economic group-threat with hostility toward people of foreign origin. Firstly, I argue that expansive notions of prejudice impede analyzing attitudes toward immigration and immigrants with sufficient precision. Secondly, the recent evolution in the Southern Spanish region of Andalusia illustrates divergent trajectories: anti-immigrant sentiment remained subdued despite surging unemployment and perceived conflict-of-interest. Thirdly, various factors are found to contain antiimmigrant sentiment amidst inauspicious economic circumstances and regardless of perceived group-competition. The study shows that attitudes towards immigrants hinge on a complex array of predispositions and perceptions, rather than economic facts and interests per se.

T1  - Bringing culture back in: the class origins and ethnoracial destinations of culture and achievement
AN  - 1817595774
AB  - Notably absent from assimilation scholarship are analyses that seriously engage, rather than dismiss, cultural explanations for differences in group outcomes. That dismissal has left the assimilation scholars ill-equipped to thoroughly respond to popular and quasi-academic explanations that rely on an all-encompassing view of culture to explain immigrant group differences in socioeconomic outcomes. Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou's The Asian American Achievement Paradox embraces the cultural explanation, but traces the root of an ethnoracial culture to its class origins. In so doing, Lee and Zhou force scholars to contend seriously with 'culture' as part of a larger explanation for group outcomes.

T1  - Talking Pieces
AN  - 1817459207
AB  - Archives are not neutral spaces; the memories and stories of minority communities are often overlooked and underrepresented. Narratives are symbolic representations of the past, and it is vital that a diversity of stories and memories is represented. Likewise, ephemeral artifacts, such as political buttons, are largely marginalized as objects of study because researchers tend to favor evidence found through written, textual documents. However, political buttons are significant because of their role as political memorabilia, marking a nation's socio-political past, and their role as a narrative tool. Behind every political button, there is a potential narrative or story that is not often told. This article will attempt to address the lack of literature on political buttons in a Canadian context as well as give voice to counter-memory of the women's movement in Canada and the experience of Blacks organizing for racial equality. Using a case study of selected political buttons from the archival collection of Jean Augustine, the first Black female Member of Parliament in Canada, stories of gender and racial equality rights activism in Canada, told by Jean Augustine, will be examined and contextualized. In particular, buttons representing stories about the National Black Coalition of Canada, the Congress of Black Women of Canada, and the anti-apartheid movement will be explored.

T1  - Vicarious Group Trauma among British Jews
AN  - 1812305019
AB  - Given that literature on the intra- and inter-generational transmission of traumas is mainly based on secondary literature and focuses on the transmission of trauma memory in terms of the historical knowledge of group trauma, this article develops the theory of vicarious group trauma and tests this theory by exploring vicarious traumatization in the everyday lives of Jews in Britain through the methods of observation and in-depth interviewing. Vicarious group trauma is defined as a life or safety-threatening event or abuse that happened to some members of a social group but is felt by other members as their own experience because of their personal affiliation with the group. The article finds that the vicarious sensation of traumatic group experiences can create anxiety, elicit perceptions of threat and, by extension, hypervigilance among Jews. The findings demonstrate that group traumas of the past interpenetrate and interweave with members' current lives and in this way can also become constitutive of their group identity. An institutional focus on threats to Jews can inform the construction and reinforcement of traumatization symptoms and accordingly vicarious group trauma. This article suggests an association between the level of involvement of group members in the collective's social structure and the prominence of vicarious group trauma among them.

T1  - How French Canadians became White Folks, or doing things with race in Quebec
AN  - 1804188373
AB  - As far as nineteenth century Anglosaxons were concerned, French Canadians were not quite white. This article considers the racial dimension of French-Canadian subjugation, long elided and ignored by historians. However, the descendants of French Canadians are no longer construed, and no longer construe themselves, as a racialized group, but rather as a modern, white, western nation. These changes in racial assignment still influence how French and English Canadians make sense of Canadian politics and identities today. Although Quebec's dual majority/minority status in Canada has been well studied, this article also taps into critical race and whiteness studies to examine how notions of evolution, civilization and progress continue to influence how to do things with race in Quebec.

T1  - Pakistani immigrant organisational spaces in Toronto and New York City
AN  - 1784151374
AB  - This study examines how 'contexts of reception' in two migrant cities shape the organisational infrastructure for Pakistani immigrant communities in Toronto and New York City (NYC). Previous research is divided into two epistemic camps, one focusing on locally oriented organisations promoting settlement/incorporation and the other on transnational organisations-thus obscuring the relationships between these organisations. The present study transcends this division by examining how the combined effect of state policies, socioeconomic incorporation, community characteristics and societal attitudes shape the composition and geographical orientation of an immigrant group's collective organisational space-comprised of local and transnationally oriented organisations. Data come from a newly constructed database of Pakistani non-profit organisations based in Toronto and NYC and from qualitative research conducted in both cities. Contrary to our expectations and previous research, we find that state-sponsored multiculturalism in Toronto is not associated with a larger or more transnationally oriented organisational space. Rather, it is the affluence of the Pakistani community in NYC that is associated with the larger and more transnational of the two Pakistani organisational spaces. Findings also reveal tensions between local and transnationally oriented organisations in both cities, reflecting a growing fragmentation between affluent cosmopolitan immigrant elites and the impoverished segments of Toronto and NYC Pakistani communities.

T1  - Mobilising mosques? The role of service attendance for political participation of Turkish and Moroccan minorities in the Netherlands
AN  - 1789874861
AB  - Religious service attendance has been identified as an important source of political participation among Christians and Muslims in the USA. In Europe, where religion is seen as a barrier rather than a bridge to Muslims' integration, the role of mosque attendance for the political participation of Muslims remains understudied. This study asks whether the politically mobilizing role of service attendance extends to Muslim minorities in Europe. We examine direct and indirect effects of the frequency of religious service attendance on organizational participation, political trust and voting intentions among large nationwide samples of Turkish and Moroccan minorities in the Netherlands using multi-group structural equation modelling. Our results show that service attendance relates positively to engagement in both co-ethnic and mainstream organizations. These two forms of civic engagement translate into a greater intention to vote among Turks, but not Moroccans.

T1  - The 2012 killing of Chinese citizens in Rome and the ambivalence of Italian journalism
AN  - 1784145627
AB  - Sredanovic discusses the killing of a father and daughter of Chinese origin in Rome in January 2012, and the portrayal of the case in Italian print journalism. He uses a qualitative analysis of a corpus of 193 articles from seven Italian newspapers with different political, market and geographic profiles. The frequency of generally negative and stereotypical portraits of migrants in crime news is well known; however, this specific case offers a number of less familiar insights. Sredanovic shows the multiple and changing frames and themes, both positive and negative, deployed to portray the event across the two-week period in which it was featured on the front pages of newspapers. He demonstrates in particular the ways in which stereotypes that are often used against migrants in crime news find place even in a case in which the migrants were the victims of the crime. He further illustrate how the representation of the perpetrators shifted from describing them as an exception (when it was thought they were autochthonous) to generalizing about their deviance when it was discovered that they were of Moroccan origin. Sredanovic locates this discussion in an anti-groupist theoretical frame, arguing that the stereotypes used cannot be adequately explained by majority-minority group interactions, and that the delimitation and definition of groups should be understood as ideological from the start. He also argues that aspects of the production routines of crime journalism can be added to the factors that explain the portrayal of the event. He concludes by arguing that Sinophobia is a form of prejudice that varies geographically and in time, and calling for non-reifying, practice-informed analyses that mix discriminating and non-discriminating discourses.

AN  - 1855325223
AB  - This special issue developed in part from co-operation within a research project, "Mobility and Inclusion in a Multilingual Europe" (mime), 1 embracing 20 research teams from across Europe and co-funded by the European Union. Among the authors of the articles in this special issue, László Marácz, Robert Dunbar and Balázs Vizi are members of the mime consortium, while Tove H. Malloy is a member of the mime Advisory Board. Doing research on minority language rights within the research consortium at the Institute for Minority Studies, Centre for Social Sciences of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has led to the initiative to collect various articles reflecting the great diversity of language policy approaches to territoriality and minority language rights in European countries. I am very grateful to the authors for their valuable contributions.

T1  - Linguistic Minority Rights in the Danish-German Border Region: Reciprocity and Public Administration Policies
AN  - 1855323844
AB  - Language equality is not public policy in Denmark or Germany, and neither country has adopted an official state language constitutionally. Both countries protect minority languages through regional and local statutes on culture and education and have signed relevant international standards on linguistic rights for minorities and protection of regional or minority languages. Neither system is very transparent, nor comprehensive. This has created consternation and dissatisfaction among the national minorities residing in the Danish-German border region resulting in recent tensions in the municipalities in Southern Denmark, whereas the government of Schleswig-Holstein decided in 2015 to address the issue with policy reforms for public administration. This article focuses on linguistic minority rights in the Danish-German border region with specific attention to minority languages in public administration and specifically to the on-going reforms in Schleswig-Holstein.

T1  - THE ASSESSMENT OF CULTURES AND THE AUTONOMY OF COMMUNITIES/Vrednotenje kultur in avtonomija skupnosti
AN  - 1830662454
AB  - Cultural rights are one response to the mistreatment of minorities by dominant groups. Their protection has become a litmus test for the liberal nature of democratic states. At the same time, criticisms of cultural rights abound in scholarship and popular discourse. These include concerns that cultural rights distort and essentialize culture, that cultural protections shield gender discrimination, and that cultural rights legitimize a false narrative about the capacity of Western states to act justly towards subjugated minorities and, in particular, indigenous peoples.The question addressed here is whether the protection of cultural rights, as defended by Kymlicka in his 1989 book Liberalism, Community and Culture, is still an important project today in light of these criticisms and against the background of recent political circumstances which find some political leaders distancing themselves from multiculturalism and where, once again, cultural difference is used to exclude minorities from the full rights of citizenship.

T1  - Natives of the former Soviet Union countries in contemporary Russia
AN  - 1823487498
AB  - The article analyzes the role of the natives of former republics of the USSR in the Russian population. Despite the fact that Russia is second only to the United States by the number of foreign-born in its population, only a small part of them are real international migrants. Among 11 million people not more than a third came to Russia after collapse of the Soviet Union and they are not repatriates and members of ethnic groups traditionally resident in Russia. Revealed are not only scale of resettlement (relocation), but also migrant stock (number of migrants) who remain to live in place where they settled for a long time. So the vast majority of immigrants from Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Abkhazia and South Ossetia live in Russia for more than 10 years continuously, and it is difficult to distinguish them from the locals. Besides that, the article reveales features of the transformation of major socio-demographic characteristics -- ethnicity, age structure, level of education.

T1  - Explaining the Association between Gender and Substance Use among American Indian Adolescents: An Application of Power-control Theory
AN  - 1752003030
AB  - This study evaluates the utility of Hagan's power-control theory for explaining substance use behaviors for a sample of American Indian (AI) adolescent males and females. Consistent with the theory, we found that patriarchal family form and the affective bond between father and daughter were significant predictors of female substance use behaviors. Compared with results from an analysis of non-Hispanic (NH) whites, these results reveal the importance of testing generalist explanations of deviant behavior across racial and ethnic groups. Our findings encourage a more in-depth consideration of the gendered nature of work, its association with socialization and control in AI families, and its impact on gender differences in substance use and delinquent behaviors.

T1  - Diversity within Women of Color: Why Experiences Change Felt Stigma
AN  - 1719468129
AB  - This commentary offers additional considerations for better understanding and studying how women of color detect and respond to prejudice in the United States. Building on the thoughts raised by Remedios and Snyder ( 2015 ), we highlight the importance of considering the socio-cultural and historic factors that differentially impact how sub-groups of women of color are perceived. Rather than generalizing work on stigma and discrimination across the diverse group of women of color, we discuss the importance and benefits of examining subgroups individually. In this commentary therefore, we pose research questions about three additional bodies of literature that add to Remedios and Snyder's ( 2015 ) ideas regarding experiencing stigma. First, we examine how stereotypes of subgroups of women of color differ. Next, we introduce other work in the field of intersectionality, e.g. gendered race, to argue that differences in the ways women of color are perceived may affect how they experience identity centrality, discrimination, and other identity-related processes. Finally, we provide empirical evidence highlighting the concept of intersectional invisibility as an additional form of felt discrimination.

T1  - I Don't Think You Like Me Very Much: Child Minority Status and Disadvantage Predict Relationship Quality With Teachers
AN  - 1703407761
AB  - Even when accounting for past performance, academic achievement can be influenced by teacher expectations, which are lower for disadvantaged and visible ethnic minority children. We use a Quebec (Canada) population-based sample (N = 1,311) to examine whether ethnicity and teacher-perceived signs of disadvantage in kindergarten predict child reports of their relationship with teachers in fourth grade. Results suggest that visible minority children were 50% less likely and perceived disadvantaged children were 32% less likely to report having a positive relationship with their teacher. The findings are discussed in terms of directing efforts toward reducing teacher prejudice and improving child academic success.

T1  - Group Position, Threat, and Immigration
AN  - 2406941859
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to move research on racial attitudes away from studying intraindividual attitudes toward studying broader structural factors that contribute to the attitudes and feelings of U.S. citizens. We focus on how interest groups and elite actors play a role in shaping the discourse on immigrants and the immigration debate in the twenty-first century. Herbert Blumer posed that over time, the dominant group develops certain feelings toward subordinate group members and that these feelings form the basis of racial prejudice. These feelings include notions of superiority, the alienation of other groups, proprietary claims over valued resources, and finally, a feeling that resources are threatened. While not dismissing the importance of interpersonal interactions, Blumer posed that elite entities within the dominant group play prominent roles in producing and managing these feelings among the masses because they have access to the public ear. To assess how the elite attempt to manage feelings toward immigration, we use qualitative data from 33 amicus briefs submitted in support of Arizona’s SB 1070 law in the Arizona v. United States case. Findings reveal that each of the feelings was prominently represented in all briefs, which supports the notion that elite entities use arguments that promote feelings Blumer associated with racial prejudice.

T1  - Examining the Value of Social Capital and Social Support for Black Student-Athletes' Academic Success
AN  - 1929901493
AB  - The purpose of this study is to understand how social capital and social support influence the academic success of Black student-athletes that attend predominantly White institutions of higher education (PWIHEs). Utilizing a qualitative approach, the authors conducted narrative interviews to understand the experiences of Black student-athletes (N=9) at a PWIHE in the southwestern region of the USA. Employing critical race theory, the Black student-athletes revealed their experiential realities as a racial minority within the academic environment. The findings revealed that their academic success was contingent upon their interactions with faculty as their status as Black student-athletes promoted positive and negative interactions. As such, Black student-athletes leveraged their social capital, or social networks consisting of parents and family, to provide social support. Acknowledging the unique "culture" of student-athletes, college and university athletic departments and their personnel may find it beneficial to create proactive avenues for parental engagement to aid in student-athlete adjustment and matriculation.

T1  - Who 'They' Are Matters: Immigrant Stereotypes and Assessments of the Impact of Immigration
AN  - 1700676385; 201525328
AB  - We investigate the relationship between stereotypes of immigrants and assessments of the impact of immigration on U.S. society. Our analysis exploits a split-ballot survey of registered voters in Ohio, who were asked to evaluate both the characteristics of one of four randomly assigned immigrant groups and perceived impacts of immigration. We find that associations between impact assessments and stereotypes of Middle Eastern, Asian, and European immigrants are weak and fully attenuated by control covariates. By contrast, this relationship for Latin American immigrants is strong and robust to controls, particularly in the areas of unemployment, schools, and crime. Our findings suggest that public views of the impacts of immigration are strongly connected to beliefs about the traits of Latin American immigrants in particular. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Importance of Peers: Assimilation Patterns among Second-generation Turkish Immigrants in Western Europe
AN  - 1667949164; 201509408
AB  - The dominant approaches to immigrant assimilation-segmented and 'new' assimilation theories-analyse differences in assimilation across immigrant groups. However, neither adequately addresses variation within groups because nearly all the variables usually used to explain variation are best at addressing between-group differences. The exception is family-level variables, specifically parents' educational attainment, income and occupational status. However, it is unlikely family effects on their own can explain assimilation outcomes for individuals. We argue peer effects are an important explanatory variable for cultural and economic assimilation. We examine data from The Integration of the European Second Generation survey, looking at second-generation Turkish immigrants across Western Europe. We find peers substantially affect cultural and economic assimilation, effects not predicted by either dominant theory of immigrant assimilation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social change and community cohesion: an ethnographic study of two Melbourne suburbs
AN  - 1680154677; 201513916
AB  - This paper looks comparatively at the process of social change and its impact on local community cohesion in two Melbourne suburbs, 'Northburb' and 'Greenburb'. The two localities are geographically close, part of the same local government area and both highly ethnically diverse, but considerably different in terms of their socio-economic and ethnic profiles. Based on ethnographic data collected through individual interviews, focus groups and participant observation in 2012-2013, the paper shows how the process of deindustrialization and the switch to service economy over the past decades took distinctly different turns in the two localities. Our data suggest that the processes of social change seem to have diminished local community cohesion in both localities. In Northburb, gentrification has contributed to socio-economic polarization, while Greenburb has lagged behind in socio-economic indicators and experienced ethnic fragmentation due to a considerable influx of new immigrant groups.

T1  - ALCOHOL-RELATED ATTITUDES OF HEAVY DRINKERS: EFFECTS OF AROUSAL AND VALENCE IN EVALUATIVE CONDITIONING
AN  - 1767330979; 201605429
AB  - We investigated the effects of 2 dimensions of affect in evaluative conditioning (EC) on changing alcohol-related attitudes in a sample of students whom we had identified as fitting set criteria to be classified as heavy drinkers. We divided participants into 2 EC groups (high-arousal EC condition, n = 18; low-arousal EC condition, n = 18) and measured their explicit and implicit attitudes toward alcohol. Comparison of results before and after EC indicated that participants reported a greater decrease in both explicit attitudes about positive alcohol expectancies and explicit cravings. However, in regard to implicit attitudes, the results showed that the high-arousal EC condition was associated with a stronger positive attitude toward alcohol after, rather than before, EC, whereas in the low-arousal EC group, implicit attitudes toward alcohol did not change. These results imply that high levels of affect arousal during EC can positively strengthen the implicit evaluation of alcohol in a student sample of heavy drinkers, while decreasing explicit attitudes about cravings and positive expectancies. Thus, based on attitude conditioning, it is important to consider the arousal as well as the valence of affect in treatment of alcohol addiction in order to change alcohol-related attitudes in heavy drinkers.

T1  - Making a difference without creating a difference: Super-diversity as a new direction for research on Roma minorities
AN  - 1700674105; 201525333
AB  - Academic and policy discourses recognise the diversity of Roma minorities, frequently using the word 'Roma' as an umbrella term that is meant to capture the inherent plurality of such populations. However, 'heterogeneity' can still prove to be an inadequate approach to diversity, as it categorises people and still positions them on an essentialising template of what it is to be 'Roma', which can discount their linguistic, cultural, socio-economic and identification hybridities, or 'super-diversity'. 'Super-diversity' is a relatively new concept that is seen as a way to better represent the types of diversities that are normal amongst contemporary populations. This article looks at the trajectory of research on Roma minorities and examines the opportunities and challenges for using super-diversity as a way of articulating a new direction.

T1  - Victimization Among Female and Male Sexual Minority Status Groups: Evidence From the British Crime Survey 2007-2010
AN  - 1660023924; 201505707
AB  - International surveys of victims show crime rates in England and Wales, including hate crimes, are among the highest in Europe. Nevertheless, sexual minority status is a less considered risk factor in general victimization research. This study used sexual minority status and sex to predict victimization across British Crime Surveys from 2007-2010. Logistic regression analyses showed sexual minority status groups were more likely than heterosexuals to be victimized from any and some specific crimes. However, bisexuals rather than lesbians or gay men were more consistently victimized, notably by sexual attacks and within the household. Implications for understanding victimization among these groups are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - WHEN ORGANIZATIONS MATTER
AN  - 1667951253; 201509486
AB  - Increasingly, scholars have argued that immigration politics are inseparable from racial politics, which implies that organizations and individuals who mobilize around racial group interests influence racial and immigration attitudes and behaviors. How does the racial-political context influence anti-immigration lawmaking? In what ways does this influence vary at different stages of lawmaking? To address these questions, we combine comprehensive datasets of racially conservative organizations and state immigrant legislation and use negative binomial regression to estimate the count of anti-immigrant bills and laws in the fifty states from 1991 to 2010. We find that the presence of racially conservative organizations encourages the introduction of exclusionary proposals, but only in contexts with a Republican-dominated government. At the approval stage, on the other hand, racially conservative organizations foster the passage of exclusionary laws, and this effect is heightened in contexts with a growing foreign-born population or where a majority of voters report anti-immigrant opinions or identify as conservative. This indicates that the institutionalization of the colorblind racial ideology (in the form of racially conservative organizations) resonates with lawmakers, but in a different manner when the stakes are higher. These findings have important implications and challenge previous research on the conditions under which advocacy organizations influence lawmaking and additional forms of group behavior.

T1  - What Can Migration Policymakers Learn From Legal Frameworks on National Minorities? National Minorities and Migration in Armenia and Belarus
AN  - 1650147814; 201502291
AB  - The dissolution of the USSR resulted in massive depopulation of the republics and unprecedented migration flows, including national minorities. Citizens of a once indivisible country were suddenly divided into 'those of our kind' (natives) and 'outsiders' (national minorities/ immigrants). The latter were often not guaranteed citizenship and were denied basic rights. Many national minorities became forced migrants and refugees, leaving neighbouring states because of discrimination or fearing violence. This article focuses primarily on the interconnection of minority and migration issues, two topics which are often discussed separately. It investigates the interrelation between migration and the minority regimes adopted by Armenia and Belarus, and the extent to which certain policies and rights for national minorities can be meaningfully extended to new migrant minorities. It also asks what lessons can be learnt from the treatment of national minorities as far as future migration legislation is concerned. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Integration Matrix Reloaded: From Ethnic Fixations to Established Versus Outsiders Dynamics in the Netherlands
AN  - 1660022553; 201505749
AB  - In the Netherlands, there is increasingly critical debate about the government's top-down ethnic categorisation procedures and the assumption that analyses of integration should be based on internally homogeneous (and dichotomous) ethno-cultural blocks. While concerns about the ageing approach mount, no unified alternative framework has emerged. Informed by Brubaker's work on 'groupism', we provide an account of the currently dominant approach and outline an alternative vision of social divisions, exclusion and inclusion. More specifically, we offer a framework that can help researchers consider easing away from ethnic reification (as well as from the attendant analytic promotion of highly subjective notions such as 'ethnic groups') and towards analyses founded on more objective, 'first-order' social scientific categories. Making use of Elias's work on established and outsider dynamics, and dealing substantively with education, we flesh out how an alternative approach to in- and exclusion in contemporary Dutch society might be put to use. The goal, in short, is to assist researchers interested in a path leading to more grounded, relational and processual approaches to integration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Personal Experience of Community Among Urban Gay Men, Lesbians, and Bisexuals: Melting Pot or Mosaic?
AN  - 1650148049; 201502170
AB  - 'Gay community' is often conceptualized as a 'melting pot' in which gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) persons are united and integrated into one sexual minority community. Evidence, however, indicates that GLB community may also be conceptualized as a mosaic of sexual minority communities with differing goals and ideologies. We test the validity of these conceptions of community with respect to two facets of the personal experiences of GLB individuals: socializing with GLB persons and GLB community cohesion perceptions. Analyses of the 2005 Sex and Love survey of New York City area GLB persons. GLB persons tended to socialize most with their own sexual identity group. Compared to gay men, only bisexual women reported higher perceptions of GLB community cohesion. Our findings indicate the presence of a mosaic sexual minority community. The extent of sexual-identity-group-specific socializing patterns suggests that personal perceptions of GLB cohesion may either be idealized rather than based on routine interactions or reflect assessments of within-group (not across-group) cohesion.

T1  - Evidence for the social role theory of stereotype content: Observations of groups' roles shape stereotypes
AN  - 1622294342; 201438394
AB  - In applying social role theory to account for the content of a wide range of stereotypes, this research tests the proposition that observations of groups' roles determine stereotype content (Eagly & Wood, 2012). In a novel test of how stereotypes can develop from observations, preliminary research collected participants' beliefs about the occupational roles (e.g., lawyer, teacher, fast food worker, chief executive officer, store clerk, manager) in which members of social groups (e.g., Black women, Hispanics, White men, the rich, senior citizens, high school dropouts) are overrepresented relative to their numbers in the general population. These beliefs about groups' typical occupational roles proved to be generally accurate when evaluated in relation to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Then, correlational studies predicted participants' stereotypes of social groups from the attributes ascribed to group members' typical occupational roles (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c), the behaviors associated with those roles (Study 2), and the occupational interest profile of the roles (Study 3). As predicted by social role theory, beliefs about the attributes of groups' typical roles were strongly related to group stereotypes on both communion and agency/competence. In addition, an experimental study (Study 4) demonstrated that when social groups were described with changes to their typical social roles in the future, their projected stereotypes were more influenced by these future roles than by their current group stereotypes, thus supporting social role theory's predictions about stereotype change. Discussion considers the implications of these findings for stereotype change and the relation of social role theory to other theories of stereotype content.

T1  - Muslims and the Mainstream in Australia: Polarisation or Engagement?
AN  - 1551000854; 201428943
AB  - Most studies of relationships encompassing Muslim minorities and Western societies examine Muslim and non-Muslim orientations separately. Here we investigate the patterns of similarity and difference involving Muslims and non-Muslims in Australia in terms of how they conceptualise the situation of Muslims in a secular society. We deploy Q methodology to study selected Muslims and non-Muslims in the same terms. Our results reveal three substantial positions. The first, 'Assertive Islamic Belonging', is mostly (but not exclusively) found among our Muslim subjects. The second, 'Exasperated Monoculturalism', is mostly (again not exclusively) associated with non-Muslims. The third, 'Reciprocal Engagement', has considerable presence in both sorts of communities. These results shed new light on the content of polarisation stressed in previous studies. They can also be deployed in the interests of productive dialogue across undeniable difference. The 'Reciprocal Engagement' position can act as a kind of discursive bridge, and the content of the two more polarised positions shows neither is beyond the reach of dialogue. We explore implications for dialogue across difference in a democracy and show how our findings can inform a deliberative democratic approach to multiculturalism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Symbolic Strategies in Migratory Contexts: Middle-Class Argentineans in Spain
AN  - 1752996124; 201600191
AB  - This article is aimed at exploring how migration has affected the class distinction of an immigrant group belonging to Argentine middle-classes in Spain, and the symbolic strategies that these immigrants have developed during the migratory process. With Pierre Bourdieu's theory as a reference, the ways in which agents leverage the cognitive dissonance between the classificatory schemes of origin and destination according to their habitus and previous social trajectories are examined. Based on a qualitative methodology, these strategies relating to two classification axes that tend to position migrant subjects: immigration status and class membership, are analyzed. One of the research findings was how these classifications impact on the perception of possibilities present in the social space of destination, redefining the subjects' migratory projects.

T1  - Belonging to the nation: generational change, identity and the Chinese diaspora
AN  - 1660022188; 201505555
AB  - This study reviews developments in the ethnic and national identity of the descendants of migrants, taking ethnic Chinese as a case study. Our core question is why, in spite of debates worldwide about identity, exclusion and rights, do minority communities continue to suffer discrimination and attacks? This question is asked in view of the growing incidence in recent years of 'racial' conflicts between majority and minority communities and among minorities, in both developed and developing countries. The study examines national identity from the perspective of migrants' descendants, whose national identity may be more rooted than is often thought. Concepts such as 'new ethnicities', 'cultural fluidity', and 'new' and 'multiple' identities feature in this examination. These concepts highlight identity changes across generations and the need to challenge and reinterpret the meaning of 'nation' and to review problems with policy initiatives designed to promote nation-building in multi-ethnic societies.

T1  - Size and socio-economic resources of core discussion networks in the Netherlands: differences by national-origin group and immigrant generation
AN  - 1559005704; 201432033
AB  - This study examines differences in the size and socio-economic resources of core discussion networks across national-origin groups and immigrant generation. The analysis is based on the Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (2008-10), a nationally representative, large-scale survey of the Dutch population that contains an over-sample of first- and second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Morocco, the two largest non-western immigrant groups in the Netherlands. Results show that Dutch majority members have larger and more resourceful core discussion networks than Turks and Moroccans. Second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Morocco have larger core discussion networks than their foreign-born parents. However, there is no clear evidence for intergenerational increase in resources. The larger and more resourceful core discussion networks of the Dutch are partly attributable to the Dutch being higher educated and employed more often. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Walking on the Edge: Towards a Sociography of Discrimination against the Buraku: Lectures on Discrimination in Letter Format
AN  - 1559006442; 201431994
AB  - This article demonstrates a new methodological approach to recognize, analyze and write about discrimination against the buraku, which is one form of social discrimination in contemporary Japan. The structural discrimination proposed in this study is based on the concept of relational discrimination, which is derived from fundamental criticisms of the conventional concepts of material and psychological discrimination. Relational discrimination occurs when we are placed in a certain type of relationship and may become accomplices to discrimination or cause it, regardless of whether or not there is any individual prejudice or discriminatory consciousness at work. From this perspective, this article tries to fundamentally re-examine the binary thinking assumed in conventional sociology that there are minorities (those who are discriminated against) and majorities (those who discriminate against the minority). I focus on the complex ways of being human, and in particular on the transformations that accompany changes in particular relations such as from a person who does not discriminate to one who discriminates against others; from a person who is discriminated against to one who discriminates against others and from a person who is not discriminated against to one who is discriminated against. By focusing on the meaning of the deep suffering of a man who made discriminatory remarks to people living in a buraku community, and of a woman who married into a family living in a buraku community, I try to understand life ethics for people who discriminate and who at the same time are discriminated against.

T1  - THE RACIALIZATION OF DISEASE: A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF RACE AND ETHNICITY IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
AN  - 1767329017; 201606165
AB  - For several years, there have been published guidelines covering the use of the terms race and ethnicity in biomedical research. When used inappropriately, the linkage of race or ethnic categories to cause and/or effect in biomedical research can have significant negative impacts on individuals and populations. Genetics research rejects any strong biological association/differences, between or within races. This research will determine to what degree the recommendations for the use of race and ethnicity within biomedical publications has been followed. Papers, retrieved through Pubmed were selected if they used of the terms race or ethnicity in the title or abstract. These selected papers were then examined to determine the basis for assigning population to racial categories (inclusion/exclusion), the reasons for selecting the group(s), the disease by organ system and the association made to medical outcome. The analysis of the publications revealed that none of 205 surveyed papers defined race, while 67% of the papers associated a medical outcome to racial or ethnic group.

T1  - The racialization of Kurdish identity in Turkey
AN  - 1512220229; 201408792
AB  - Until the 1990s, the Kurdish issue in Turkey largely involved the Turkish state, an ethnic group and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The 2000s witnessed community-level clashes between Kurds and Turks, signalling the Turkish population's rise as an actor in the issue. This paper makes two claims. First, communal clashes indicate that Kurdish identity is not an ethnic identity alone, but is experiencing a racialization process, based on four indicators: emphasis on physical characteristics in the definitions of Kurds; linking Kurdish identity with the absence of certain moral characteristics; the increasing assignment, rather than self-assertion, of Kurdish identity; and discourses of racial extinction. Second, the racialization of Kurdish identity corresponds to historical change in conceptions of diversity. Racialization became possible after a distinct Kurdish identity was recognized but normatively unwelcomed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Frictions as opportunity: mobilizing for Arab-Bedouin ethnic rights in Israel
AN  - 1551000517; 201429022
AB  - The question of how to advance justice for indigenous or marginalized ethnic groups leads to the heart of a polarized debate. We find a widely diffused 'right to culture' stance on one hand and a critical, constructivist one on the other. By taking up Tsing's metaphor of 'zones of friction', (2005) this article follows the way in which voices and imaginations about Bedouin culture and rights are produced in the conflict over a piece of land in the Negev desert, which is contested between the Israeli authorities and Bedouin representatives. As an imagined inhabitant of the area, ordinary citizens such as Mustafa are fashioned by activists and political tourists in highly culturalist or romanticized ways -- images that are distant from the shifting self-representations of Mustafa himself. This case shows how the current emphasis on the 'right to culture' creates both new sites of contestation and new spaces for collective action. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Needed but Not Liked -- The Impact of Labor Market Policies on Natives' Opinions about Immigrants
AN  - 1531932499; 201423247
AB  - This article builds on the notion that immigrants' integration into the labor market benefits migrants and shapes natives' opinions about immigrants. Using insights from the newest literature on labor immigration and drawing upon the literature on attitudes toward immigrants, the article explores in a multilevel design the impact that regulations in the EU member states concerning immigrants' access to domestic labor markets have on threat perceptions and on opinions about immigrants' economic role. It finds that labor market regulations have a positive effect on opinions about immigrants' economic role and reduce the negative relationships between precarious labor market status and opinions about the economic role. However, a robust effect of labor market regulations on threat perceptions was not found. Our results imply that labor market incorporation rules need to be accompanied by other measures to close the gap between natives and immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Piety in a Secular Society: Migration, Religiosity, and Islam in Britain
AN  - 1417520543; 201331978
AB  - While in the American context religion is seen to facilitate immigrant incorporation by providing both spiritual and socioeconomic resources, in Europe high levels of religiosity are theorized as a barrier for immigrant incorporation into the secular mainstream. This is particularly salient for Islam, Europe's largest minority religion. In this study, we use the 2008-2009 England and Wales Citizenship Survey to compare levels and predictors of religiosity between Muslim and non-Muslim first-generation immigrants and their native-born counterparts. Overall, Muslims are more religious than non-Muslims. The results show that among non-Muslims, the foreign-born are significantly more religious than the native-born; among Muslims, however, nativity has no impact on religiosity, indicating the native-born are as highly religious as the foreign-born. Additionally, although education is associated with reduced religiosity among non-Muslim immigrants and native-born, for Muslims it has no significant impact. Muslims across diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds show strong religious adherence. Results suggest that pathways to secular, mainstream norms do not operate in the same manner across Muslim and non-Muslim immigrant groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Impact of Ethnoracial Appearance on Substance Use in Mexican Heritage Adolescents in the Southwest United States
AN  - 1429629023; 201335668
AB  - Latinos are a multiracial ethnic group, and as such, within-group differences in ethnoracial appearance deserve to be studied and understood within the racialized American context and in connection to specific health and mental health outcomes. This article presents the findings of a study conducted with middle school Mexican heritage students (n = 1,150) in Phoenix, Arizona, and tested how non-White majority ethnoracial appearance predicted adolescent substance use, and whether the relationship differed by generation status and strength of ethnic identity. Logistic regression results revealed that generation status and ethnic identity moderate the relationship between ethnoracial appearance and substance use among Mexican heritage youth. The odds of using substances were significantly higher for third-generation adolescents who reported a less European appearance, but significantly lower for second-generation youth who were more indigenous in appearance. These findings indicate that a stronger indigenous ethnic appearance can be both a protective and risk factor for substance use for adolescents. Implications are discussed in terms of incorporating ethnoracial appearance content in prevention interventions for Mexican heritage and other Latino adolescents.

T1  - Worrier Nation: Quebec's Value Codes for Immigrants
AN  - 1373428921; 201328738
AB  - This article analyses the political and policy discourses of Quebec's integration toolkit for immigrants. With a focus on value codes for immigrants, I argue first, that recent debate on accommodation of immigrants and religious minorities resuscitates the dominant historical narrative of Quebec's fragility as a conquered settler colonial nation but where the major threat is defined as the cultural otherness of racialized immigrants and religious minorities. Second, such value codes instantiate a form of governmental strategy that combines neo-liberal and communitarian rationalities and insist on cultural assimilation as the price of entry into Quebec citizenship. Finally, the paper examines how Quebec's current national imaginary of the 'worrier nation' maps spatially onto the urban-rural divide. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1417527385; 201331779
AB  - Four studies examined whether thought suppression could enhance attitude accessibility and whether behaviours that are consistent with the more accessible attitudes would follow. Thinness was examined as the attitude object. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that suppression of positive thoughts about thinness increased the accessibility of the positive attitudes associated with thinness. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that suppression of positive thinness thoughts also elicited more health-promoting behaviours. The implications of the findings for attitude accessibility and the practical consequences of thought suppression are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigrant Entrepreneurship and the Opportunity Structure of the International Education Industry in Vancouver and Toronto
AN  - 1728661055; 201534149
AB  - This study is situated within a broad research field of immigrant entrepreneurship and pays particular attention to the international education businesses owned and operated by Korean immigrants. Seeking causal factors of disproportionately high rates of self-employment among immigrant groups, researchers in this field have developed two distinct streams of theoretical explanation. While social capital, class and ethnic resources are often identified as major factors of successful immigrant entrepreneurship, the political economic structure (i.e., a wide range of opportunity structures including business regulations and market conditions) is also seen as an important pre-condition for immigrant business ventures. Drawing upon the analytical framework of the mixed embeddedness model by Kloostermen and Rath (2001), this study examines how different institutional environments and the consumer demand base of the international education industry result in different opportunity structures for Korean immigrant entrepreneurs in Vancouver and Toronto, Canada.

T1  - Nordic (Minority) Autonomies and Territorial Management in Europe: Empowerment through Regionalisation?
AN  - 1347783860; 201318813
AB  - The participation of traditional minority autonomies is seldom discussed in relation to territorial management in Europe. Yet, several traditional minorities and indigenous people enjoying autonomous powers participate in regional co-operation efforts. This article discusses the involvement of Greenland, the Faroe Islands and the Aland Islands in the development and co-operation of macro-regions. Regional co-operation has long been a corner stone of Europe's integration project, and macro-regions is the latest concept in the effort to strengthen regions economically in the wake of the onset of globalisation and indeed global economic crises. In contradistinction to the perceived notion of traditional minorities as conflict prone troublemakers, it is argued that in the effort to maintain the peace and overcome persistent challenges common to both majorities and minorities, traditional minorities are increasingly pro-active and working for the survival of their autonomous regions. This is manifested, among other, in the manner in which they participate -- albeit unevenly -- in regional co-operation aimed at economic development and integration.

T1  - Faustian bargains for minorities within group-based hierarchies
AN  - 1417526271; 201332013
AB  - A dual-audience signaling problem framework provides a deeper understanding of the perpetuation of group-based inequality. We describe a model of underachievement among minority youth that posits a necessary trade-off between academic success and peer social support that creates a dilemma not typically encountered by nonminorities. Preliminary evidence consistent with the approach is discussed. Such strategic agent perspectives complement the psychological approach put forth by Dixon et al., but with minimal ancillary assumptions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What works to address prejudice? Look to developmental science research for the answer
AN  - 1417523881; 201331967
AB  - Developmental perspectives on prejudice provide a fundamental and important key to the puzzle for determining how to address prejudice. Research with historically disadvantaged and advantaged groups in childhood and adolescence reveals the complexity of social cognitive and moral judgments about prejudice, discrimination, bias, and exclusion. Children are aware of status and hierarchies, and often reject the status quo. Intervention, to be effective, must happen early in development, before prejudice and stereotypes are deeply entrenched.

T1  - Radicalisation: the journey of a concept
AN  - 1315599291; 201307608
AB  - Since 2004, the term 'radicalisation' has become central to terrorism studies and counter-terrorism policy-making. As US and European governments have focused on stemming 'home-grown' Islamist political violence, the concept of radicalisation has become the master signifier of the late 'war on terror' and provided a new lens through which to view Muslim minorities. The introduction of policies designed to 'counter-radicalise' has been accompanied by the emergence of a government-funded industry of advisers, analysts, scholars, entrepreneurs and self-appointed community representatives who claim that their knowledge of a theological or psychological radicalisation process enables them to propose interventions in Muslim communities to prevent extremism. An examination of the concept of radicalisation used by the industry's scholars shows its limitations and biases. The concept of radicalisation has led to the construction of Muslim populations as 'suspect communities', civil rights abuses and a damaging failure to understand the nature of the political conflicts governments are involved in.

T1  - Acculturation and Self-Rated Health among Latino and Asian Immigrants to the United States
AN  - 1266149436; 201300399
AB  - The ways in which immigrant health profiles change with shifts in acculturation is of increasing interest to scholars and policy makers in the United States, but little is known about the mechanisms that may link acculturation and self-rated health, particularly for Asians. Utilizing the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) and its data on foreign-horn Latinos (N = 1,199) and Asians (N = 1,323) (Pennell et al. 2004), we investigate and compare the associations between acculturation and self-rated health for immigrants to the United States from six major ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican). Using comprehensive measures of acculturation, we demonstrate that across ethnic groups, and despite the widely varying contexts of the sending countries and receiving communities, native-language dominance is associated with worse self-rated health relative to bilingualism, and measures of lower acculturation -- coethnic ties and remittances -- are associated with better self-rated health; and moreover, these associations are only partially mediated by socioeconomic status, and not mediated by acculturative stress, discrimination, social support, or health behaviors. We speculate that immigrants who maintain a native language while also acquiring English, as has been shown for other immigrant outcomes, attain a bicultural fluency, which also enables good health. Surprisingly, we do not find strong associations between duration of time in the United States or age at migration -- measures frequently used to proxy acculturation -- with self-rated health. Our findings illustrate the complexity of measuring acculturation and its influence on health for immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'SOCIALLY MIXED' PUBLIC HOUSING REDEVELOPMENT AS A DESTIGMATIZATION STRATEGY IN TORONTO'S REGENT PARK
AN  - 1531930902; 201423264
AB  - Over the last two decades decision makers have sought to address problems with large concentrations of poverty and minority ethnoracial groups in the cities of Western Europe and the Anglo-American world that are the direct result of the manner in which public housing was built in the early postwar era. The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia have developed programs that introduce 'social mix' into such public housing developments. These initiatives are designed to alter the social dynamics of places with high levels of concentrated poverty and ethnoracial minority groups that are believed to magnify the disadvantages of poverty and marginalization. In this paper, I argue that this is a destigmatization strategy, but not the same kind of destigmatization strategy that has been described in the literature. Using the example of Toronto's Regent Park, a large public housing development near downtown, I develop a research agenda for understanding the gap between a quasi-state agency's efforts to destigmatize public housing sites ('place destigmatization') and the everyday destigmatization practices and experiences of residents ('personal destigmatization'). The paper begins with a review of the putative mechanisms linking socially mixed public housing redevelopment and outcomes for residents, including social capital, social control, role modelling, and changes to the political economy of place. This review finds little evidence of these effects in the literature. Consequently, I argue for an inductive approach to the study of the outcomes of social mix, rather than the common practice of judging such outcomes against the benchmark of close, intimate relationships between new, middle-class residents and existing public housing residents. I further argue that the 'normalization' of the built form that is a major part of socially mixed redevelopment is a form of place destigmatization, and may alter both material practices and representational practices related to stigma, which have very real effects on the everyday experience of residents.

T1  - ALL RESPONSES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL
AN  - 1531930754; 201423237
AB  - This exploratory study makes a contribution to the literature on antiracism by analyzing how first-generation French Blacks of sub-Saharan African descent practice everyday antiracism. In doing so, it expands the demographic terrain of this research to highlight some particularities in the experience of everyday racism and antiracism for ethnoracial minorities of immigrant origins. In addition to experiencing forms of racism encountered by both immigrants and other native ethnoracial minorities, first-generation French Blacks (like other non-White first-generation Europeans), face symbolic exclusion from the national community and delegitimization of their claims to Europeanness. Examining their experiences sheds light on how race, immigration, and national identity intersect to generate unique experiences of racism and antiracism. This paper also contributes to our understanding of how social context shapes the range of everyday antiracist strategies at a person's disposal. Specifically, integrating Kasinitz et al.'s framework for categorizing incidents of racial discrimination and prejudice with Fleming et al.'s categorization of responses to stigmatization, I present an analysis of antiracist responses that takes into account both the nature of the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator of racism (i.e., impersonal vs. personal) and the social context in which the encounter occurs (e.g., school, work, public space, etc). In doing so, I highlight how the conditions of a given incident of racism or discrimination set constraints on the range of antiracist responses an individual can practically (or feasibly) employ.

T1  - Constructing "New" Minorities: An Evaluation of Approaches to Minority Protection in Post-Socialist Slovenia from the Perspective of Liberal Multiculturalism
AN  - 1125216975; 201240500
AB  - This paper deals with the construction of "new" minorities as opposed to "traditionally settled" minorities in Slovenia. Its aim is to conduct an evaluation of the foundations for minority protection in Slovenia from the perspective of liberal multiculturalism, as formulated by the political philosopher Will Kymlicka. The author argues that the distinction between "new" and "old" minorities in Slovenia, which takes for its basic criterion the principle of autochthony, cannot find any basis in the target approach of minority protection that is suggested by Kymlicka. The reason is that the members of former Yugoslav minorities were in most cases retroactively defined as immigrants, although most of them had settled in Slovenia before the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The paper also explores possible approaches to minority protection according to liberal multicultural policies in cases, where some minorities do not "fit" the traditional definition of old and new minorities.

T1  - Ethnicity vs. Citizenship in the Workplace Context: A Case Study of Macedonia
AN  - 1551001534; 201429002
AB  - The question of how ethnic diversity relates to economic development is important as multiethnic states move into the global market economy as in the case of ex-Yugoslavia. Understanding the role of ethnic relations in the workplace can help reveal how ethnic integration is experienced at the firm level. Macedonia's two main ethnic groups differ substantially on economic and social indicators. Our project examines relationships there among ethnic diversity, labour force integration and perceptions of nationalism vis-a-vis citizenship. Initial results indicate ethnically diverse communities and integrated workforces mitigate perceptions of nationalism and citizenship. Both the degree of ethnic diversification, as well as education, explain most of the variation observed. This has implications for the recent movement in Macedonia towards segregated education.

T1  - Categorical inequality, institutional ambivalence, and permanently failing institutions: the case of immigrants and barriers to health care in America
AN  - 1567049277; 201435159
AB  - I draw on the theories of Charles Tilly, Robert K. Merton, Eleanor Barber, Marshall Meyer, and Lynne Zucker to develop a three-part framework for understanding the organizational and institutional interface between social services like health care and disadvantaged minorities like immigrants. Tilly's theory of durable inequality is transposed to categorical inequalities in organizations and law. His vocabulary of motives is expanded to include categorical entrenchment, restitution, and compensation. These embedded inequalities lead to institutional ambivalence in the provision of services and to permanently failing institutions that work poorly, waste resources, or provide uneven quality, yet do not collapse but endure while resisting reform. One rationale for resistance is 'moral hazard' by individuals; but the theory of moral hazard is biased and partial, because provider moral hazard and insurer moral hazard are more prevalent. The specific manifestations of these concepts and dynamics between them warrant further research in different contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An 'Integrating Enclave': The Case of Al-Hayat, Germany's First Islamic Fitness Center for Women in Cologne
AN  - 1283640027; 201303456
AB  - Muslim minorities in Europe are often portrayed in Western discourses as either secularized and 'integrated' or religiously devout and 'segregated'. The article challenges this common dichotomization. It argues that some Muslim minorities manifest their Islamic identity by concurrently promoting certain aspects of European integration agendas while rejecting others. These individuals endorse active and constructive Muslim participation in majority non-Muslim societies, yet justify any such interactions using ideological or physical constructs that both reaffirm Islam as a binding religious-legal system regulating all aspects of life and fortify identities that are distinct from Western ones. The article examines various models for this duality in the field of sports and focuses on the case of Germany's first Islamic fitness center for women, Al-Hayat in Cologne, which opened in April 2007. Through a field study, the article explores how the gym, which the German media depicts as an example of Muslim segregation but which its owner and members believe to be a force for integration, simultaneously advances aspects of both integration and segregation.

T1  - The Legal Methodology of 'Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat' and its Critics: An Analytical Study
AN  - 1283639459; 201305456
AB  - 'Fiqh al-Aqalliyyat'--the jurisprudence of Muslim minorities--is a legal doctrine introduced in the 1990s by Taha Jabir Al-Alwani and Yusuf Al-Qaradawi which asserts that Muslim minorities, especially those residing in the West, deserve a special new legal discipline to address their unique religious needs that differ from those of Muslims residing in Islamic countries. Developed as a means of assisting Muslim minorities in the West, it deals with problems Muslims face in countries where they are minorities and focuses more on devising exceptional rulings pertaining to their unique circumstances. In light of this, this paper attempts to assess this doctrine--its purpose and its methodology--with emphasis on the legal Islamic tools of ijtihad and maslaha whilst also shedding light on its limitations. It argues that while attempts are being made by scholars and writers to make it a successful tool for jurisprudence, it will take a few more years to assess whether 'fiqh al-aqalliyyat' is effective in getting more members of Muslim minority societies to follow shari'ah such that it becomes a politically uniting force for Muslim communities in non-Muslim societies and most importantly, if it is effective in establishing an Islamic method that supports the peaceful coexistence of Muslims and non-Muslims within non-Muslim societies.

T1  - "Friendship of the Peoples" in the USSR: A National Project or an Instance of Spontaneous Interethnic Self-Organization?
AN  - 1081865390; 201235292
AB  - Why are Russians, twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, still unable to create new ethically acceptable models of interethnic relations? I will consider this problem from the socioanthropological viewpoint. It consists in the study of a polyethnic society as an entity that develops under the impact both of exogenous and endogenous factors. On the one hand, the members of society are subject to ideological brainwashing, and, on the other hand, the members of diasporas are under the influence of their "mother" ethnic groups. Ultimately, however, society is a self-organizing (often spontaneously) structure. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Nationalism versus multiculturalism: the minority issue in twenty-first-century Bulgaria
AN  - 1002672523
AB  - The paper negotiates ideas, views and beliefs of Bulgarians towards the ethnic minorities of their country published in the Bulgarian press during the period of 2005-2009. Through these aspects it becomes clear that three years after Bulgaria's accession to the European Union and despite various state attempts to integrate minorities -- mostly initiated and funded by the EU and various governmental and non-governmental organizations -- prejudice and racism have not been overcome, the Other is still differentiated and the way to multiculturalism is very long. The research field is limited to the Turkish and the Roma minorities, which are "visible" in the sense that they are officially recognized. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Data on discrimination in EU countries: statistics, research and the drive for comparability
AN  - 919904869; 201201757
AB  - This paper focuses on data collection and research methods on ethnic/racial discrimination, and more particularly on the question of 'ethnic statistics'. Taking the case of the European Union's Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), an international body whose tasks include providing European overviews of data on discrimination, the paper addresses the problem of the comparability of discrimination data. Drawing upon the experience of the FRA, the paper describes how the problem of comparability is addressed by working at three levels: the first is to produce reports mapping available data, highlighting gaps, and explaining when and why data are not comparable. The second is to initiate primary research -- such as the EU-MIDIS survey of migrants and minorities -- specifically designed to produce comparable data. The third level is to contribute to political and policy discussion to help raise awareness of the need for convergence in data collection practices between EU member states.

T1  - Museum and Migration: An Introduction
AN  - 1037881565; 201231079
AB  - This is a co-editors' introduction to the Fall 2011 issue of Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge, entitled "Contesting Memory: Museumizations of Migration in Comparative Global Context," including papers that were presented at a conference on "Museums and Migration" held on June 25-26, 2010, at the Maison des Science de l'Homme (MSH) in Paris. The co-editors were able to organize this event thanks to the support of MSH Director and President of the International Sociological Association, Michel Wieviorka. The focus of the present collection is on questions of representation and social agency of both migrants and museum officials. The purpose is to explore in a comparative perspective the complex and conflictive articulation between how migrants are represented by themselves and by museum institutions. The topic of migrants as social actors is one of the key issues explored in this collection. Migrants are not passive toward their lives and representations. They are social agents actively involved in their communities and socially vigilant of the way they are treated, perceived and represented by the host society. They produce also their own narratives and representations that are many times in conflict with Western hegemonic perceptions of their cultures and identities. Their strong presence in global cities and metropolitan societies today confronts the dominant society with issues of racial/ethnic discrimination and historical memory otherwise ignored by the hegemonic views in the mainstream of Western societies. Museums dealing with the history of slavery, the history of migration and the colonial history emerged as spaces of contestation. Moreover, the term "migrant" itself has been contested by "minority" groups that happen to have a long colonial history in the metropolitan society and are today formal metropolitan citizens born and raised in the metropoles but still perceived as "foreigners" and "immigrants.".

T1  - We Fall Down: The African American Experience of Coping With the Homicide of a Loved One
AN  - 907928348; 201124775
AB  - Rates of homicide among African Americans are much higher than those of other racial or ethnic groups. Research has demonstrated that homicide can be psychologically debilitating for surviving family members. Yet, exploring the experiences of homicide victims' surviving loved ones has received little attention. This study examined the coping strategies of African American survivors of homicide. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 8 African American family members (ages 18-82) of homicide victims. Survivors were recruited from the Massachusetts Office of Victim Services and from homicide survivor support, school, and community groups throughout the New England area. Interviews were conducted using open-ended questions derived from coping, support network, grief, and bereavement literatures. Results indicate that the primary coping strategies utilized by African American survivors of homicide victims are spiritual coping and meaning making, maintaining a connection to the deceased, collective coping and caring for others, and concealment. Implications for research and practice are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Environmental survey of segregated habitats of Roma in Hungary: a way to be empowering and reliable in minority research
AN  - 919903128; 201201670
AB  - Background: Roma people, the largest minority in Europe live in segregated communites in several countries. The size of the Roma population is based on estimations deriving from various sources, whereas only narrative accounts of their living conditions have been available. Methods: A comprehensive environmental survey of all settlements in Hungary (n = 3145) was carried out employing Roma field workers in order to locate and characterize segregated parts (colonies) of human habitats. Based on the collected data on environmental conditions and aggregate population numbers of the colonies, ranking of colonies and maps on their characteristics were prepared for all counties of Hungary. Results: Seven hundred fifty-eight colonies were identified with approximately 134 000 inhabitants. Ninety-four percent of all colonies are populated dominantly by Roma. Most frequent environmental problems in the colonies were found to be lack of sewage and gas mains, garbage deposits, waterlogged soil and lack of water mains. Conclusion: Census data cannot be used for policy design aiming at those Roma who are in greatest need of help; that is, living in segregated settlements (colonies). Colonies constitute disadvantaged living conditions of varying severity which can be quantified by a composite score based on indicators of access to services and presence of environmental dangers. The proportion of colony-dwelling Roma is approximately one-fifth to one-quarter of the estimated number of Roma people in Hungary. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic differences in discrepancies between self-reported and measured weight, height and body mass index
AN  - 919903101; 201201749
AB  - We investigated the association between Hindustani-Surinamese (South Asian), African-Surinamese (African) or Dutch (European) ethnicity and discrepancies in self-reported versus measured weight, height and derived body mass index (BMI). Using data from the population-based SUNSET study among 35- to 60-year-old subjects in The Netherlands, we found that discrepancies among Hindustani-Surinamese men, African-Surinamese women and Hindustani-Surinamese women for weight and BMI, but not height were smaller than their Dutch counterparts. Ethnic differences observed imply that self-reported anthropometric measures may be unsuitable for surveillance and for studies that seek to quantify the role of obesity in health outcomes in ethnic groups.

T1  - Transnational Ethnic Ties and the Incidence of Minority Rule in Rwanda and Burundi (1959-2003)
AN  - 919904186; 201201604
AB  - This article specifies a novel theoretical framework to explore how rival ethnic groups learn from threats to ethnic kin in a neighboring country and from threats made by nominal rivals at home. We argue that a combination of external and internal threats causes violence domestically. Violence causes casualties, increases interethnic animosity, and generates refugee flows. These outcomes, in turn, contribute to renewed violence, reinforce or undermine disparities in power, and shape patterns of ethnic domination. Among the range of outcomes generated by our framework are those that bear a strong resemblance to the trajectory of ethnic domination in the Rwanda-Burundi dyad. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Hillary Clinton effect: When the same role model inspires or fails to inspire improved performance under stereotype threat
AN  - 919903919; 201201488
AB  - If successful role models undo stereotype threat effects by providing reassurance that group members can "take care of themselves," then the same real-world role model might inspire those who think she deserved success, but fail to inspire those who think she did not. In a pilot study, some women participants listed Hillary Clinton high among women who deserved their success; others listed her high among women who did not deserve their success. The former participants, but not the latter, claimed her success came from internal and stable causes and would inspire them in difficult situations. In the main study, women rated how much Hillary Clinton deserved her success. One month later, they were placed under mathematics stereotype threat, read a factual biography of Hillary Clinton, and took a GRE-Q test. Those who had earlier claimed Clinton deserved her success scored as well as a test-only control group; those who had earlier claimed she did not deserve her success scored as poorly as a threat-only control group. The results are seen as contributing to theories of role models, stereotype threat, and attribution. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Challenges in conflict management in multi-ethnic states - the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and Serbia and Montenegro
AN  - 1081167627
AB  - This article examines the break-ups of post-communist Czechoslovakia and the Union of Serbia and Montenegro under consociationalism. According to Arend Lijphart, social divisions may be neutralized at the elite level with power-sharing mechanisms. Lijphart's theory has been abundantly criticized, particularly because, while its intention is to induce cooperation, consociationalism does not give leaders actual incentives to cooperate. Czechoslovakia and the Union qualified as consociations; however most favorable factors were absent. The states failed to overcome their divisions and broke apart. Both states were going through a democratization period, experienced differently in each republic. The article argues that the application of consociationalism at this time magnified the divisions. Stirring up the ethnic sensitivity of the population was the most reliable strategy for politicians to secure popular support. In this context, and with the EU enlargement prospect, the consociational structure, instead of bringing elites together, weakened the federal power and provided elites the opportunity to defend republican interests at the expense of the federations. Hence, while a consociation requires certain conditions and favorable factors, the context in which consociationalism is implemented, and particularly democratization periods, may have a decisive influence on the leaders' ability to cooperate, on their decisions, and thereby on the state.

T1  - Cross-cultural perception and power dynamics across changing organizational and national contexts: Curacao and the Netherlands
AN  - 914767019; 201200160
AB  - In this article we study the role of power and power differences in cross-cultural perception. We do so by way of exploratory case studies in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the police in the Netherlands and Curacao. We demonstrate how cross-cultural perception between two specific ethnic groups, European Dutch and African Curacaoans, changes depending on the amount of power imbalance in the various organizational and national contexts. With this article, we follow the call for research on the impact of power dynamics on cross-cultural perception, an approach that goes beyond the traditional, dimensional approach that is prevalent in organization literature.

T1  - Interpreting Muslim Religious Interest Groups in Spain: Frames, Organisation and Influence
AN  - 887499711; 201118171
AB  - Spain is characterised by its historical rejection of Muslims' cultural traditions and practices. Massive immigration in the last decade has increased such negative perceptions about "the Moors". It is common to associate Muslims with insecurity, delinquency and incivility. Therefore, the social and political integration of religious minorities is very limited. Institutional marginalization and social obedience are applied by the Spanish institutions. This article provides a review of all factors determining the structure of political opportunities of Muslim interest groups. Three conclusions can be highlighted: First, the Muslims have enormous difficulties in participating in politics as they find it difficult to find allies to carry out their initiatives. It is argued that this is a result of institutional and social rejection. Second, their lack of influence in Spanish politics is also due to poor organization and a hierarchical sense of Islamic idiosyncrasy that does not permit the establishment of cohesive, representative organizations. And third, despite its outsider position, their persistence over long term strategies is ultimately successful. This article analyzes the politics of Islamic cemetery in Granada, Spain, by reviewing its main events, the characteristics of the actors, the evolution of demands over time, and the relations of power among actors. The interviews, questionnaires and documents review have been conducted to support our argument. Moreover, the paper has applied social network analysis to the case study.

T1  - The social position of multiracial groups in the United States: evidence from residential segregation
AN  - 870433178; 201114241
AB  - I use multiple perspectives on the racial order in the United States to generate hypotheses about the social position of mixed-race groups. Perspectives that view the racial order as binary, ternary with an undifferentiated middle, or ternary with a stratified middle present different expectations for the social position of multiracial groups. I use a group's level of residential segregation as an index of social position. In 2000, multiracial persons lived in neighbourhoods that were more white than the neighbourhoods of single-race minorities, though more diverse than the neighbourhoods of whites. Thus, multiracial groups appear to occupy an intermediate social position relative to blacks and whites, a finding that supports contemporary arguments about shifting colour-lines in the United States and the emergence of a triracial system of stratification. Yet, findings also suggest that the social space between blacks and whites is, itself, racially stratified. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Product Involvement In The Link Between Skepticism Toward Advertising And Its Effects
AN  - 887494735; 201118014
AB  - Each year businesses spend millions of dollars on advertising to engender a positive attitude among consumers about a specific brand, eliminate any mistrust and suspicion about advertising, and rectify wrong attributions about products. In this research we focused on how doubt about advertisements impacts on their effectiveness, in regard to brand attitude and purchasing intention. We adopted the seemingly unrelated regression model to estimate the parameter, and the mutual relationships among several regression equations are taken into consideration. There were 337 participants in this experiment, and as indicated by the result, doubt about advertisements had a negative effect on brand attitude and purchasing intention. This negative effect will disrupt product involvement. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic social capital: Individual and group level sources and their economic consequences
AN  - 852898459; 201103298
AB  - Ethnic social capital shapes economic action by immigrants by providing information, training, and credit that is otherwise unavailable. However, prior research on the effects of ethnic social capital on economic attainment by salaried workers primarily relied on case studies of specific destinations or ethnic groups. Furthermore, prior research focused on group level effects of ethnic social capital while largely ignoring the effects of individual-level utilization of ethnic ties. This study addresses these limitations by combining data from the New Immigrant Survey and the 5% file of the 2000 US Census. This allows controlling for group differences in actual utilization of familial ties and for differences between groups in their demographic makeup, legal status, and human capital when estimating the effect of ethnic social capital. It also allows addressing the potentially divergent implications of ethnic social capital for individual and group economic attainment. Results suggest that, on both the individual and group levels, reliance on ethnic social capital is associated with lower earnings for recent legal immigrants to the US. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - The Trap of Transnationalism-Polish Organizations in Germany
AN  - 1322718084; 201310808
AB  - Often in the migration literature transnational relations of migrants and their institutions with the sending country are described as important factor strengthening or improving the situation of the migrants in the receiving country. The aim of the paper is to empirically prove that in some of the cases the set of multiple conditions affecting immigrant organizations may have the opposite effect. The example of Polish organizations in Germany shows that transnationalization may have as a consequence the limiting, and the degradation of immigrant organizations standing. The four analyzed factors determining the situation of Polish immigrant associational in Germany: the characteristics of immigrant group, the policy of the receiving country towards immigration and IOs, the diaspora policy of the sending country, as well as the bilateral relations between the sending and receiving country together constitute a combination that has a strong negative effect on the functioning of Polish organizations. This all produces an impression of falling into the 'trap of transnationalism.'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial Diversity and Sense of Belonging in Urban Neighborhoods
AN  - 1023025222; 201225344
AB  - This study examines the relationship between the racial composition of urban Canadian neighborhoods and national belonging and in-group belonging. The study employs multilevel data and an instrumental variable approach to estimate differences in sense of belonging between individuals from racially heterogeneous and racially homogenous neighborhoods. The study demonstrates that residential exposure to racial diversity has an independent effect on belonging, after adjusting for individual- and neighborhood-level variables that could confound this relationship. National belonging is strongest in heterogeneous neighborhoods, although this effect of diversity is nonsignificant for visible minorities. In-group belonging is weakest in heterogeneous neighborhoods, but this effect also reflects the attitudes of whites. The primary conclusions support intergroup contact theory, which suggests that exposure to racial diversity is an important mechanism for reducing intergroup antagonisms and promoting a cosmopolitan sense of belonging.

T1  - Affiliative ethnic identity: a more elastic link between ethnic ancestry and culture
AN  - 835111627; 201100505
AB  - This paper explains the development of affiliative ethnic identity: an individual identity rooted in knowledge, regular consumption and deployment of an ethnic culture that is unconnected to an individual's ethnic ancestry until that individual regards herself, and may be regarded by others, as an affiliate of a particular ethnic group. While ethnic culture remains identifiably linked to a particular ethnic ancestry, ideological, institutional and demographic changes have elasticized the link between ancestry and culture, making the formation of affiliative ethnic identity possible. Multiculturalism and its accompanying value of diversity have become institutionalized such that individuals regard ethnic difference as something to be recognized and celebrated. The prevalence of ethnic culture in schools, ethnically infused products of popular culture, demographic changes and growing interethnic contact allow individuals, regardless of ethnic ancestry, ready access to multiple ethnic cultures, providing the basis for the formation of affiliative ethnic identity.

T1  - Happiness in a Flux? The Instability Problem
AN  - 818797492; 201068699
AB  - In the recent discussion of happiness it has become popular to claim that being happy means having a certain positive attitude towards your life. This attitude involves both a judgement that your life measures up to your standards and a feeling of satisfaction with your life. In this paper, I am going to discuss a serious problem inherent in this account that has important ramifications for the normative question of how we ought to pursue happiness. If happiness is in part determined by your standards, how shall we determine whether you are happier in one life than in another when your standards change across these lives? Perhaps you will judge a life as a parent as better than a childless life, if you were to become a parent, but judge a childless life as better than a parenting life, if you were to remain childless. Which standard should determine the comparative happiness of the two lives? In this paper, I shall argue that some innocent-looking answers to this question will generate inconsistencies. To find an acceptable resolution, we need to make a difficult choice between what on the face of it look like two equally valid principles of happiness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Justice through consensus: Shared identity and the preference for a restorative notion of justice
AN  - 758124099; 201056841
AB  - We propose a concept of restorative justice as a sense of justice deriving from consensus about, and the reaffirmation of, values violated by an offence (in contrast to punishment-based retributive justice). Victims should be more likely to seek restorative justice (and less likely retributive justice) when they perceive to share a relevant identity with the offender. In Study 1, when the relevant identity (university affiliation) shared with the offender was made salient (vs. not), participants found a consensus-based response more justice-restoring. In Study 2, when the group (company) shared with the offender was cohesive (vs. not), participants more strongly endorsed a restorative justice philosophy and, mediated by this, responded in consensus-restoring ways. In Study 3, when the offender was an ingroup (vs. outgroup) member, participants more strongly endorsed a restorative justice philosophy, fully mediated by sadness emotions.

T1  - The power of racial scripts: What the history of Mexican immigration to the United States teaches us about relational notions of race
AN  - 758122480; 201057023
AB  - This article examines Mexican immigration to the United States after the passage of the 1924 Immigration Act to better understand the construction of racial categories. Unlike traditional studies of Mexican immigrants in the United States, this article focuses on how discourses about other racialized groups, principally Indians, African Americans, and Asians, were crucial in informing people what 'Mexican' meant at this time. The post-1924 Immigration Act period is significant in cementing negative cultural constructions of Mexicans that last into the present day and thus is a key place to look to understand these racial constructions. The article draws on immigration hearings, debates, correspondence, and newspaper articles on Mexican immigration demonstrating how immigration discourse was central in cuing people what 'Mexican' meant at this time.

T1  - The bonding and bridging roles of religious institutions for refugees in a non-gateway context
AN  - 743066559; 201043186
AB  - Contemporary research indicates that religious institutions can play bonding and bridging roles in the lives of immigrants, strengthening the bonds within immigrant groups while simultaneously connecting immigrants to the wider society. The majority of this research focuses on religious institutions in US cities with long histories of immigration and sizable immigrant populations. This article examines the role of religious institutions in the lives of refugees living in a city with a small, but rapidly growing immigrant population. Evidence from interviews with Catholic and Muslim refugees and participant observation at two houses of worship suggests that the functions of religious institutions differ for refugees from majority and minority religious traditions. Catholic refugees use their church for bonding and bridging purposes, while Muslim refugees use their mosque primarily for bonding purposes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Panethnicity, Ethnic Diversity, and Residential Segregation
AN  - 743049433; 201031693
AB  - The theoretical and empirical implications of the structural basis of panethnicity and of the layering of ethnic boundaries in residential patterns are considered while simultaneously evaluating the "panethnic hypothesis," the extent to which homogeneity within panethnic categories can be assumed. Results show a panethnic effect-greater residential proximity within panethnic boundaries than between, net of ethnic group size and metropolitan area-that is dependent on immigration. A lower degree of social distance between panethnic subgroups is observed for blacks, whites, and Latinos, and less for Asians, yet ethnonational groups continue to maintain some degree of distinctiveness within a racialized context.

T1  - Ethnic Environment During Childhood and the Educational Attainment of Immigrant Children in Sweden
AN  - 743045979; 201031584
AB  - We ask whether ethnic residential segregation influences the future educational careers of children of immigrants in Sweden. We use a dataset comprising a cohort of children who finished compulsory school in 1995 (n = 6,560). We follow these children retrospectively to 1990 to measure neighborhood characteristics during late childhood, and prospectively through 2003 to measure the number of years of education attained thus far. The largest immigrant groups came from Finland, Turkey, former Yugoslavia, Iran and Chile. Our empirical analysis reveals that immigrant children who grow up in neighborhoods with many young co-ethnics who have limited educational resources, obtain relatively low average grades from compulsory school, and on average, do not attain the same levels of education as do immigrant children who grow up elsewhere. For a minority of immigrant children who lived in neighborhoods with educationally successful young co-ethnics, we find a positive effect of growing up in an ethnic enclave. Also in this case, the effect of the ethnic environment on future educational attainment is mediated by school results in compulsory school. Adapted from the source document.
