T1  - Fighting stigma‐based bullying in primary school children: An experimental intervention using vicarious intergroup contact and social norms
AN  - 2688508254
AB  - In this theory‐driven experimental field intervention, we used vicarious intergroup contact, a popular prejudice‐reduction strategy, to fight stigma‐based bullying. We focused on the role of peer norms, manipulated by asking participants to work individually or collectively in reinforcing activities following vicarious contact (operationalized as story reading). Participants were 346 Italian 4th‐5th grade primary school children (48% females). Participants were allocated to a 2 (Target: outgroup vs. ingroup vicarious contact) × 2 (reinforcing activities: collective vs. individual) experimental design. Results revealed that outgroup (vs. ingroup) vicarious contact was indirectly associated with greater intentions to react to name‐calling and socially exclusionary behavior (two common forms of bullying) toward foreign children, only when participants collectively negotiated responses to reinforcing activities.

T1  - Gender/sex diversity beliefs: Scale construction, validation, and links to prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2669413162
AB  - Prejudice against or affirmation of gender/sex minorities is often framed in terms of beliefs about the ontology of gender/sex (i.e., what gender/sex is), or gender/sex diversity beliefs. We constructed the Gender/Sex Diversity Beliefs Scale (GSDB) to assess ontological beliefs about the nature of gender/sex, including essentialist and social constructionist beliefs, and validated the GSDB across a series of studies. In Study 1 (N = 304), we explored the factor structure of the GSDB and found evidence of associations with prejudice against transgender and/or nonbinary people. In Study 2 (N = 300), we assessed the stability of the factor structure of the GSDB and examined its criterion-related validity, including its relationship to feelings toward multiple gender/sex groups. In Studies 3a (N = 48) and 3b (N = 500), we established test–retest reliability. We conclude that gender/sex diversity beliefs are important for understanding contemporary attitudes about gender/sex, including prejudice against gender/sex minorities, and that the GSDB is a reliable and valid way to measure them.

T1  - Detecting changes between two strangers: Insight from a classic change blindness paradigm: GPIR
AN  - 2573357334
AB  - The current study aims to investigate what factors influence whether adults detect a change between social partners in a brief interaction. In two experiments, we examined whether locale diversity, a stranger’s marginalized minority status (e.g., minority race, minority religious affiliation), and race congruence (e.g., own or other race) influenced the likelihood of being differentiated. Using a change blindness paradigm, an experimenter approached pedestrians asking for directions, then surreptitiously changed places with a confederate. After the switch, we measured whether pedestrians noticed if the person had changed. In Experiment 1, noticing rates were significantly lower for confederates belonging to a minority race compared to White confederates, but only in the more homogenous location and not in the highly diverse location. In Experiment 2, pedestrians were least likely to detect a change when confederates belonged to a religious minority and a racial minority. We discuss the important implications for prejudicial behaviour and eyewitness identification, as well as the utility of performing psychological research outside of the lab.

T1  - Partisan ideological attitudes: Liberals are tolerant; the intelligent are intolerant.
AN  - 2553023352
AB  - In this article we examine intolerance toward ideological outgroups, conceptualized as the negativity of the attitudes of liberals and conservatives toward their ideological outgroup. We show that conservatives are more ideologically intolerant than liberals and that the more intelligent are more ideologically intolerant than the less intelligent. We also show that the differences between liberals and conservatives and the differences between the more and less intelligent depend on ideological extremity: They are larger for extreme than for moderate ideologists. The implication of these results to questions regarding the relationship between intelligence and ideological intolerance and regarding the relationship between ideology and prejudice are discussed.

T1  - Pride amid Prejudice: The Influence of LGBT+ Rights Activism in a Socially Conservative Society
AN  - 2507065234
AB  - How do mass publics react to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) advocacy efforts in socially conservative societies? We consider how the first-ever LGBT+ Pride in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina influences ordinary citizens’ attitudes and behavior regarding LGBT+ support. Using nationwide and local panel surveys, we find that support for LGBT+ activism increased locally after the Pride but did not diffuse nationwide, signaling how proximity mechanisms reinforce Pride effects. In survey experiments, we show that subjects are responsive to both mobilization and counter-mobilization appeals by local activists. We also find evidence from a behavioral experiment that the Pride had a positive effect on shifting the allocation of financial resources toward local pro-LGBT+ activists and away from opposition groups. Finally, in-depth interviews with local LGBT+ activists underscore the challenges facing LGBT+ activism in socially conservative societies but also point to the substantial possibilities of collective action on behalf of minorities at risk.

T1  - Racial Attitudes and Criminal Justice Policy
AN  - 2623521699
AB  - Empirical research on public policy preferences must attend to Whites’ animus toward Blacks. For a quarter-century, studies have consistently found that Kinder and Sanders’s four-item measure of “racial resentment” is a robust predictor of almost every social and criminal justice policy opinion. Racial animus increases Whites’ opposition to social welfare policies that benefit Blacks and their support for punitive policies that disadvantage this “out-group.” Any public opinion study that fails to include racial resentment risks omitted variable bias. Despite the continuing salience of out-group animus, recent scholarship, especially in political science, has highlighted other racial attitudes that can influence public policy preferences. Two developments are of particular importance. First, Chudy showed the progressive impact of racial sympathy, a positive out-group attitude in which Whites are distressed by incidents of Blacks’ suffering (such as the killing of George Floyd). Second, Jardina and others documented that Whites’ in-group racial attitudes, such as White identity/consciousness or white nationalism, have political consequences, reinforcing the effects of racial resentment. As the United States becomes a majority-minority nation, diverse in-group and out-group racial attitudes are likely to play a central role in policies—including within criminal justice—that the public endorses.

T1  - Moving beyond the gender binary: Examining workplace perceptions of nonbinary and transgender employees
AN  - 2464333619
AB  - This study is one of the first to experimentally examine the workplace prejudice faced by nonbinary employees, or those who identify outside of the man/woman gender binary. Participants (N = 249) were presented with a vignette which included a description of a fictitious co‐worker’s sex and gender identity, and asked to rate the co‐worker’s likeability and perceived job performance. Results revealed that the assigned sex and the gender of hypothetical employees interactively impacted interpersonal and workplace perceptions. For individuals assigned male at birth, identifying as a man led to the most positive ratings, followed by identifying as a transgender woman, followed by identifying as a nonbinary person. This work expands upon gender schema theory and highlights some of the unexplored challenges faced by nonbinary and transgender employees. We end with suggestions for future research, such as incorporating qualitative data to highlight the unique experiences of these gender minorities in organizations.

T1  - Could a rising robot workforce make humans less prejudiced?
AN  - 2453786249
AB  - Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences-including racial and religious differences-may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies (ΣN = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5–6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them.

T1  - Supporting Older Homeless Persons' Positive Relocations to Long-Term Care: Service Provider Views
AN  - 2451553432
AB  - Background and Objectives This study sought to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with supporting older homeless persons' relocations to long-term care (LTC) from the perspective of service providers. It aims to inform how to improve relocation processes for this vulnerable and growing subpopulation of older persons. Research Design and Methods This cross-sectional qualitative study employed semistructured face-to-face interviews with service providers from two Health and Social Service Centres in Montreal, Quebec. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed in five stages. Results A total of eight service providers reported on their experiences supporting over 40 relocations of older homeless persons (50+) in the last year. According to participants, older homeless persons' trajectories into LTC typically included a series of neglected medical issues followed by hospitalization and eventual relocation to LTC. Systemic barriers such as limited-time for proper planning, insufficient housing options for persons with minor functional limitations, disregard for preferred geographic location, multiple moves, and staff prejudices worked together to expedite premature relocation and challenge relocation processes. Discussion and Implications Older homeless persons appear to be at heightened risk of premature and challenging relocation processes. Expanding housing stock for persons with functional limitations, strengthening intersectoral collaborations, providing education and training to staff, and ensuring flexibility around rules and regulations in receiving LTC homes would both improve access to aging in place for this marginalized group of older persons and ensure conditions are in place to support positive relocations to LTC for those who require it.

T1  - Evaluation and Revision of an Instrument Measuring Attitudes toward the Amish
AN  - 2439231661
AB  - The attitudes non-members hold toward the Amish—or any ethnic, racial, and religious group—has consequences for that population, from criminal victimization to an ability to exercise human rights. Given their rapid growth and expansion in North America, an effective tool is needed to measure public attitudes toward the Amish. William McGuigan recently led the development of an Attitudes Toward the Amish (ATA) instrument, which was tested in northwestern Pennsylvania. In using the ATA in northeastern Missouri, we encountered problems with the instrument’s operational validity: no significant differences were found in the responses between a university undergraduate population of largely urban/suburban origin and the local rural population when we would otherwise expect differences. We revised the instrument and administered it to the same populations. Of the 16 items in the revised version, 14 were significantly different at the p < .05 level. A factor analysis revealed four components with face validity. Based on these results, we offer the Revised ATA (RATA) as an improved instrument and make recommendations for designing instruments intended to measure attitudes toward outgroups.

T1  - Attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities: A meta‐cognitive approach to persuasion
AN  - 2398196181
AB  - Attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities are becoming critical for promoting diversity and egalitarianism within organizations. The few interventions designed to promote positive attitudes toward people with disabilities have relied on changing either the direction and/or the amount of thoughts people generate with regard to this discriminated, understudied group. In the present research, we examine the impact of a different psychological process of attitude change based on meta‐cognition, or thinking about thinking. We used a meta‐cognitive approach to changing prejudiced attitudes because thoughtful processes are often overlooked or denied with regard to this particular group. Specifically, we explored the impact of thought confidence on attitude change across two studies designed to change attitudes toward the incorporation of people with disabilities in companies. In each study, participants first generated either positive or negative thoughts about the proposal (thought valence manipulation). Then, the confidence in those thoughts was measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). In concert with the self‐validation hypothesis, results showed that when thought confidence was relatively high (vs. low), thought valence had a greater impact on attitudes. Thus, thought valence was more predictive of attitudes when participants were confident in their thoughts. Specifically, confidence in thoughts enhanced persuasion for positive thoughts but reduced persuasion for negative thoughts. These findings provide insights into assessing effects of interventions aiming at improving attitudes toward the inclusion of minority groups in organizations.

T1  - Regulating emotions under exposure to negative out-group-related news material results in increased acceptance of out-groups
AN  - 2391192799
AB  - Negative emotions affect the acceptance of out-groups. Here, we investigated whether modifying negative emotions would affect perceptions of out-groups. We experimentally manipulated the use of two emotion regulation strategies: suppression of emotional expression and cognitive reappraisal, the latter involving reframing a situation to mitigate its emotional impact. Using a population-based sample (N = 317), we conducted an online randomized controlled trial. Participants regulated their emotions while reading threatening news about out-groups. Not only reappraisal, but also suppression increased immediate acceptance of out-groups. The effect of reappraisal was partly mediated by decreased disgust, suggesting unique effects of reappraisal on this emotion. In the suppression condition acceptance decreased at high levels of habitual emotion regulation, whereas reappraisal showed an opposite tendency. Previous research may have underestimated the importance of different emotion regulation strategies on prejudice, and that relatively simple interventions can affect prejudice. The findings are of interest to prejudice prevention programs.

T1  - A New Approach to the Study of Tolerance: Conceptualizing and Measuring Acceptance, Respect, and Appreciation of Difference
AN  - 2287210678
AB  - Previous empirical research on tolerance suffers from a number of shortcomings, the most serious being the conceptual and operational conflation of (in)tolerance and prejudice. We design research to remedy this. First, we contribute to the literature by advancing research that distinguishes analytically between the two phenomena. We conceptualize tolerance as a value orientation towards difference. This definition—which is abstract and does not capture attitudes towards specific out-groups, ideas, or behaviors—allows for the analysis of tolerance within and between societies. Second, we improve the measurement of tolerance by developing survey items that are consistent with this conceptualization. We administer two surveys, one national (Sweden) and one cross-national (Australia, Denmark, Great Britain, Sweden, and the United States). Results from structural equation models show that tolerance is best understood as a three-dimensional concept, which includes acceptance of, respect for, and appreciation of difference. Analyses show that measures of tolerance have metric invariance across countries, and additional tests demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity. We also assess tolerance’s relationship to prejudice and find that only an appreciation of difference has the potential to reduce prejudice. We conclude that it is not only possible to measure tolerance in a way that is distinct from prejudice but also necessary if we are to understand the causes and consequences of tolerance.

T1  - Systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis of teaching students developing classroom materials
AN  - 2298095756
AB  - Multimodality has been a growing research interest in the field of applied linguistics. With the actor-network theory as an analytic framework, the purpose of the present study was to explore how university students of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) take advantage of both material and non-material semiotic resources while being involved in the process of developing classroom activities. Furthermore, the semiotic resources of these students including their language, gaze, and gesture were analyzed using systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA). To do this, using an ethnomethodology, we videotaped the interaction of a group of 6 TEFL students developing materials, for the improvement of learners' intercultural competence, on the topic of food. The findings indicated that the participants developed these materials as they interacted with each other, as human semiotic resources, as well as their digital tools, as non-human resources. In addition, while mainly expressing their mental processes, they also conveyed positive attitudes and built negotiation expanding space using their gesture with both fast and slow graduation. Their gaze was also engaged, directed at both the group members and objects developing the classroom activities.

T1  - In search of an imaginary enemy: Catholic collective narcissism and the endorsement of gender conspiracy beliefs
AN  - 2297095353
AB  - Gender studies have often been criticized for undermining family and religious values. In this paper, we argue that these criticisms exhibit the characteristics of conspiracy theories. We define gender conspiracy beliefs as convictions that gender studies and gender-equality activists represent an ideology secretly designed to harm traditional values and social arrangements. In two studies conducted among Catholics in Poland (Study 1 N= 1019; Study 2 N= 223), we examined the prevalence of gender conspiracy beliefs and their psychological concomitants. We hypothesized that gender conspiracy beliefs should be associated with a defensive identification with one's religious group, captured by religious collective narcissism. In both studies, Catholic collective narcissism was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of gender conspiracy beliefs. We additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted outgroup hostility, and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs. We discuss the implications for gender-based prejudice.

T1  - Race, again: how face recognition technology reinforces racial discrimination
AN  - 2291306252
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore whether face recognition technology – as it is intensely used by state and local police departments and law enforcement agencies – is racism free or, on the contrary, is affected by racial biases and/or racist prejudices, thus reinforcing overall racial discrimination.Design/methodology/approachThe study investigates the causal pathways through which face recognition technology may reinforce the racial disproportion in enforcement; it also inquires whether it further discriminates black people by making them experience more racial discrimination and self-identify more decisively as black – two conditions that are shown to be harmful in various respects.FindingsThis study shows that face recognition technology, as it is produced, implemented and used in Western societies, reinforces existing racial disparities in stop, investigation, arrest and incarceration rates because of racist prejudices and even contributes to strengthen the unhealthy effects of racism on historically disadvantaged racial groups, like black people.Practical implicationsThe findings hope to make law enforcement agencies and software companies aware that they must take adequate action against the racially discriminative effects of the use of face recognition technology.Social implicationsThis study highlights that no implementation of an allegedly racism-free biometric technology is safe from the risk of racially discriminating, simply because each implementation leans against our society, which is affected by racism in many persisting ways.Originality/valueWhile the ethical survey of biometric technologies is traditionally framed in the discourse of universal rights, this study explores an issue that has not been deeply scrutinized so far, that is, how face recognition technology differently affects distinct racial groups and how it contributes to racial discrimination.

T1  - Protecting commonly targeted groups in the context of ‘new politics’: the case of Ireland
AN  - 2185149177
AB  - This article addresses the big ‘P’ politics of hate by examining the circumstances that produced an apparent radical and sudden shift among the parties of government in Ireland from long-standing resistance to the introduction of hate crime legislation to an expansive approach to protecting commonly targeted minorities. By means of a directed qualitative content analysis of parliamentary debate regarding the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016, we argue that four factors aid comprehension of this uncommon pattern - the range of the Irish political spectrum, the current balance of power in parliament, the approach to the protection of difference adopted by established parties and finally, the permeability of the Irish political system and the consequent influence of civil society organisations representing targeted communities on the parliamentary debate. We argue that, rather than underscoring the national influence of global trends and international good practice, recent developments in Ireland demonstrate the importance of attending to the peculiarities of the local context in interpreting the meaning and significance of responses to hate crime.

T1  - Understanding sexual prejudice: The role of political ideology and strategic essentialism
AN  - 2166665277
AB  - Despite the increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBTQ community, sexual minorities continue to face prejudice and discrimination in many domains. Past research has shown that this prejudice is more prevalent among those holding conservative political views. In two studies, we merge strategic essentialism and motivated ideology theoretical perspectives to empirically investigate the link between political orientation and sexual prejudice. More specifically, we examine how conservatives strategically use different forms of essentialism to support their views of gay individuals and their reactions to messages aimed at changing essentializing beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 220), we demonstrate that conservatives endorse social essentialism (i.e., the belief that gay and straight people are fundamentally different from each other) more than liberals do. In turn, they blame gay individuals more for their sexual orientation and show more prejudice toward them. At the same time, conservatives endorse trait essentialism (i.e., the belief that sexual orientation is a fixed attribute that cannot be changed) less than liberals do, which in turn predicts greater levels of blame and prejudice for conservatives relative to liberals. In Study 2 (N = 217), we additionally show that conservatives, but not liberals, are resistant to messages aimed at increasing trait essentialism and reducing prejudice toward sexual minorities. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

T1  - Negotiating Identity and Belonging through the Invisibility Bargain: Colombian Forced Migrants in Ecuador: IMR
AN  - 2266907650
AB  - This article argues that an “invisibility bargain” constrains migrants’ identities and political participation, demanding their economic contributions plus political and social invisibility in exchange for tolerance of their presence in the host country. In response, migrants negotiate their visible identity differences, minimize social distance from the host population, and build informal coalitions with non-state brokers to avoid citizen backlash against overt political activism. Examining Colombian forced migrants in Ecuador, the article challenges state-centric governance approaches, underscoring migrant agency in negotiating identity to influence social hierarchies, coexistence, and human security. Its findings advance the broader understanding of migration in the Global South.

T1  - Symbolic Racism, Institutional Bias, and Welfare Drug Testing Legislation: Racial Biases Matter
AN  - 2095253703
AB  - Since the devolution of welfare policymaking to the states after the passage of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, there has been contentious debate about drug testing welfare applicants. Beyond elite rhetoric and debate points about the implications of welfare drug testing, extant research remains limited insofar as providing theoretical understanding about what factors influence state proposal of legislation requiring welfare applicants to submit to drug tests. I develop and test expectations that derive from research on welfare attitudes, social construction theory, and policy design—specifically, hypotheses that the proportion of blacks on state temporary assistance for needy families caseloads, as well as state‐aggregate levels of symbolic racism, significantly influence state proposal of drug testing legislation. My multilevel analysis of every state proposal of welfare drug testing legislation from 2008 to 2014 yields strong evidence in support of these hypotheses and paints a more complete picture of the influence of racial attitudes on state welfare policymaking. Specifically, while much research finds evidence of institutional racial biases in the implementation of welfare policy, the evidence presented herein shows that these biases, as well as public biases, influence policymaking at the proposal stage. Implications of these findings are discussed in light of recent significant electoral gains made by Republicans in state legislatures.

T1  - Perceptions of instability and choice across sexual orientation groups: GPIR
AN  - 1989314623
AB  - Some have described gay and lesbian people as making a “lifestyle choice” while others assert that bisexuality is not a stable or valid identity. This paper examines the possibility that perceived instability and perceived choice, and their associations with prejudice, differ depending on both the sexual orientation of the participant and the target group. Participants varying in sexual orientation were randomly assigned to evaluate heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual targets. Results indicated that negative evaluation of the various target groups was more closely associated with perceived instability than it was with perceived choice. This relationship was moderated by both participant and target sexual orientation; for example, it was weaker for bisexual targets, whose sexual orientations were rated as unstable even among nonbisexual participants who evaluated them positively. A more nuanced understanding of the beliefs underlying prejudice against sexual minorities can be developed by considering targets and participants of many sexual orientations.

T1  - Subtle and Severe: Microaggressions Among Racially Diverse Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1984384877
AB  - In recent years, understanding prejudice and discrimination toward minorities has developed to include the investigation of microaggressions. Microaggressions are brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities. They are intentional or unintentional and communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights toward racial and sexual minorities. The purpose of this phenomenological study is to chronicle the prevalence and type of microaggressions experienced among a sample of 18 highly educated and racially diverse sexual minorities, 24-65 years of age. The impact of microaggressions on physical and psychological health is central to our investigation. Thematic data analysis was used to analyze 14 interviews and one focus group, which resulted in the following themes of microaggressions: (a) discomfort/disapproval with LGBT experience, (b) assumption of universal experience, (c) traditional gender role stereotyping, (d) denial of personal privacy, (e) exoticization, (f) ascription of intelligence, (g) policing bodies, and (h) assumption of criminality. Research findings may have implications for the development of interventions that can serve clinicians in their therapeutic work with microaggressed sexual minorities across racial diversity.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and the Potential for Post-Conflict Reconciliation: Studies in Northern Ireland and South Africa
AN  - 1961000947
AB  - With surveys of Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, and Whites and Blacks in South Africa, this research examines how both contact quality and exposure to intergroup conflict predict attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors relevant to intergroup reconciliation. Across both studies, contact of higher quality predicted more positive intergroup attitudes, trust, more positive perceptions of outgroup intentions in working toward peace, and greater engagement in reconciliation efforts. These effects were observed when controlling for exposure to conflict-related violence in one's neighborhood growing up, and the extent to which one has personally suffered due to the conflict. Implications of these findings for future work on intergroup contact and reconciliation efforts are discussed. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-07261-001]

T1  - County-level racial prejudice and the black-white gap in infant health outcomes
AN  - 1914203497
AB  - Objective: Black mothers are 60 percent more likely than white mothers to have preterm births and twice as likely to have a baby with low birth weight. We examine whether these black-white gaps in birth outcomes are larger in counties with higher levels of racial prejudice. Method: We use data from the restricted-use natality files in the United States, which provide information on birth weight, gestation, and maternal characteristics for over 31 million births from 2002 to 2012, combined with county-level data measures of both explicit and implicit racial prejudice from Project Implicit from over a million individuals who took the Implicit Association Test during this same period. We compare counties that are one standard deviation above the mean (high prejudice) with those that are one standard deviation below the mean (low prejudice) in terms of their average level of racial prejudice. Results: The black-white gap in low birth weight is 14 percent larger in counties with high implicit racial prejudice compared to counties with low prejudice. The black-white gap in preterm births is 29 percent larger in the high prejudice counties. The gaps are even larger when we use explicit measures of racial prejudice with high prejudice counties having a black-white gap that is 22 percent larger for low birth weight and 36 percent larger for preterm births. These relationships do not appear to be biased by the way the prejudice sample is constructed, since the racial gap in birth outcomes is unrelated to other county-level biases such as those based on gender or sexual orientation. Conclusion: The black-white gap in United States' birth outcomes is larger in those counties that have the highest levels of racial prejudice. This is true for both implicit and explicit racial prejudice, though the strength of the relationship is strongest for explicit racial prejudice.

T1  - East Asian religious tolerance versus Western monotheist prejudice: The role of (in)tolerance of contradiction: GPIR
AN  - 1867092468
AB  - Accumulated research has shown that Western Christian religiosity often predicts prejudice toward various kinds of outgroups. On the contrary, initial recent evidence indicates that East Asian religiosity predicts tolerance of various outgroups--except atheists. To understand these differences, we investigated cognitive (intolerance of contradiction) and emotional (disgust) mechanisms possibly mediating the link between religiosity and prejudice versus tolerance. In Study 1 (295 Westerners of Christian tradition), high disgust contamination and, to some extent, intolerance of contradiction mediated the relationship between religiosity and prejudice against ethnic (Africans), religious (Muslims), moral (homosexuals), and convictional (atheists) outgroups. However, in Study 2 (196 Taiwanese of Buddhist or Taoist tradition), religiosity was unrelated to disgust, and predicted low intolerance of contradiction, and thus tolerance of the same religious, ethnic, and moral outgroups--but still not of atheists. Cultural differences in cognition and emotion seem to explain East-West differences in religious prejudice.

AN  - 1862143851
AB  - The semantics of cultural diversity, based on the political discourses of immigration as they appear in integration and anti-racist policies in Andalusia, underline the sense of Otherness of immigrant groups. In this article, Castaño, Martínez and Periáñez focus on the most relevant texts in the Planes Integrales para la Inmigración en Andalucía (Comprehensive Plans for Immigration in Andalusia). To date, these texts have formed the most significant discursive framework for representations of the third sector, trade unions and public agencies involved in the management of diversity. The key ideas in the plans revolve around transnational political references in the context of the European Union (EU). They impose a sense of Europeanness on Andalusia that is in opposition to its historical heritage, endogenous diversity and cultural specificity, and thus steer the imaginary of Andalusia's identity towards a Eurocentric idea that enhances the region's peripheral position. Immigration is regarded in the hegemonic media discourse and the social imaginary as a risk and a social problem. Integration policies, despite being couched in anti-racist rhetoric, are specifically targeted at immigrants, further enhancing the idea of Otherness. The notion of interculturality is the leitmotiv of these policies. In practical terms, however, action is limited to empty measures in the field of education. These policies, in sum, neutralize, rather than reinforce, the sense of equality on which interculturality is based. The examination of the intertextuality of Andalusian, Spanish and European discourses reveals the conformity of the discourse of Andalusia's coloniality within the framework of the EU.

T1  - The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS): Establishing a New Interdisciplinary Self-Assessment for Health Providers
AN  - 1914571091
AB  - These three studies provide initial evidence for the development, factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS), a new interdisciplinary LGBT clinical self-assessment for health and mental health providers. Research participants were voluntarily recruited in the United States and United Kingdom and included trainees, clinicians, and educators from applied psychology, counseling, psychotherapy, and primary care medicine. Study 1 (N = 602) used exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic techniques, revealing an 18-item three-factor structure (Clinical Preparedness, Attitudinal Awareness, and Basic Knowledge). Study 2 established internal consistency for the overall LGBT-DOCSS (α = .86) and for each of the three subscales (Clinical Preparedness = .88, Attitudinal Awareness = .80, and Basic Knowledge = .83) and 2-week test-retest reliability (.87). In study 3 (N = 564), participant criteria (sexual orientation and education level) and four established scales that measured LGBT prejudice, assessment skills, and social desirability were used to support initial content and discriminant validity. Psychometric properties, limitations, and recommendations are discussed.

T1  - News Framing of Obama, Racialized Scrutiny, and Symbolic Racism
AN  - 1851145663
AB  - The current study examines the Barack Obama presidency through the lens of racialized news framing and symbolic racism. Racial prejudice often manifests as subtle symbolic racism in so-called postracial America by supporting beliefs that racial minorities have gained undeserved advantage and are no longer discriminated against. Even when counter-stereotypic leaders such as President Obama from racial/ethnic minority groups are elected to positions of authority, they are subject to tokenism, heightened visibility, and racialized scrutiny in the media in ways that reinforce cultural stereotypes. The current study uses a between-participants experiment (N = 168) to examine how exposure to positive versus negative news frames of Obama have differential effects on White participants' symbolic racist beliefs. From a priming perspective, exposure to negative frames of President Obama is likely to activate underlying prejudicial feelings that lead to biased evaluations of African Americans as a whole. Using path analysis, the present study builds a causal chain of relationships that reveals that exposure to negative news frames of Obama as compared to positive ones activates readers' anti-Black affect, which in turn increases their symbolic racist beliefs. Implications of the findings for race/ethnic studies, political communication and journalism are discussed.

T1  - Immigration, Christian faith communities, and the practice of multiculturalism in the U.S. South
AN  - 1843960233
AB  - Recent scholarship has declared multiculturalism to be in retreat, yet multiculturalist discourses and practices remain salient in many realms of social reproduction. This paper explores multiculturalism in predominantly white churches in the U.S. South, a region that has seen significant demographic transformations due to immigration. Church outreach to immigrants draws on theologies that reject racial prejudice and that call for the accommodation and celebration of cultural differences. Drawing on qualitative research with pastors and congregants, this article explores how multiculturalist practice is both re-working and reinforcing existing social relationships in Christian faith communities. Multiculturalist practices, we show, disrupt racialized hierarchies long embedded in white churches. But they simultaneously leave racialized distinctions and inequalities intact, in part by maintaining separation between immigrants and non-immigrants. This case illustrates the everyday politics of multiculturalism and the ways in which the boundaries of social membership take shape in ordinary, seemingly non-political spaces.

T1  - Spanish Validation of the Polymorphous Prejudice Scale in a Sample of University Students
AN  - 1829808737
AB  - The shortened version of the Polymorphous Prejudice Scale (PPS) analyzes new manifestations of prejudice toward gay men and lesbian women. Specifically, this instrument consists of 16 items distributed in four subscales: values gay progress, positive beliefs about gay men, positive beliefs about lesbian women, and resistance to heteronormative expectations. The aim of the current study is to add new evidence about the reliability and validity of the scale. The scale is administrated to 348 heterosexual university students from Spain with a mean age of 22.62 years (SD = 7.63). Reliability and factorial validity estimates are presented. A four-factor structure is supported using confirmatory factor analysis (short version). Our results can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual diversity.

T1  - 'You've got autism because you like order and you do not look into my eyes': some reflections on understanding the label of 'autism spectrum disorder' from a dishuman perspective
AN  - 1848149301
AB  - The psychiatrists and health professionals who 'updated' the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013 changed how 'autism' is meant to be interpreted. For example, Asperger's disorder merged into an overall collective of 'autism spectrum disorders', rendering Asperger's non-existent as a separate disorder. Yet the terms 'Asperger's', 'autistic' and 'autism', in general, are used on a daily basis by people who have been diagnosed/labelled in this way over the course of their lives, or indeed are used by people to label others in stereotypical and prejudicial ways that leads to their marginalisation. With this thought in mind, the author briefly reflects on his own experiences of being labelled with 'Asperger's' or as being 'autistic' (a label he rejects), whilst thinking from a 'dis/human' perspective, a viewpoint that seeks to unpack and challenge the dominant concepts of what it means to be human in the twenty-first century. While it is difficult to avoid being labelled in ways that lead to discrimination and rejection, a dishuman perspective offers a viewpoint against the narrow versions of what it means to be human, relating to how disability can trouble the notion of what it means to be human and indeed inform the very meaning of what it means to be human.

T1  - Student-parent attitudes toward Filipino migrant teachers in Indonesia
AN  - 1907275679
AB  - Using ethnographic data gleaned from a foreign-managed Christian school in Indonesia, this article situates the ethnic prejudices of Indonesian Chinese parents and students toward Filipino teachers within the organizational and cultural politics of private schooling. It is argued that the commoditization of education as a form of market consumption alongside the masculinized international curriculum help shape the feminization of teachers from the Philippines. Catering to the aspirations of the country's minority ethnic Chinese, privately managed schools actively recruit trained teachers from the Philippines, many of whom are female and are perceived by students and their parents as exhibiting negative symbolic capital. In the process of their employment, they encounter occasional moments of less than complete success and challenges in their jobs. This article situates this prejudice within the cultural politics of masculinized Chinese schooling in Indonesia, while seeking to shed light on the role of Filipino work migrancy in Indonesia's formal employment sector.

T1  - Friends or Foes: The Impact of Political Ideology and Immigrant Friends on Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
AN  - 1868554422
AB  - In recent years, an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment has been witnessed in the United States, particularly from politically conservative groups. According to intergroup contact theory, increased contact between in-group and out-group members, especially cross-group friendships, has been found to reduce intergroup prejudice. This study analyzed nationally representative U.S.-based data (n = 1,000) from the Transatlantic Trends Survey, 2013 to examine if having immigrant friends interacted with political ideology, such that having immigrant friends weakened the association between conservative ideology and anti-immigrant sentiment. Findings revealed that immigrant friends and political ideology each had a significant but opposite main effect on anti-immigrant sentiment, but that having immigrant friends did not moderate or buffer the effects of political ideology on anti-immigrant sentiment. Thus, aligning with a conservative political ideology is associated with anti-immigrant sentiment irrespective of having immigrant friends. Strategies to increase intergroup contact and promote cross-group friendships are made and directions for future research are offered.

T1  - Local Kids, 'Refugees' and Publics of Privilege: Children's Mediated and Intercultural Lives in a Regional Australian City
AN  - 1801919006
AB  - This paper considers contradictions and complexities around mediated and intercultural relationships between local children, primarily of Anglo-Australian descent, and 'refugees', in a regional Australian primary school community. It examines two different spaces in which local children engage with asylum seekers on a daily basis - the prolific 'speech communities' around refugees which circulate in public culture, and lived practices of 'everyday multiculturalism'. Young people are shown to draw on negative tropes around 'refugees' to anchor themselves in a local cultural order. These speech communities, however, differ significantly from the forms of everyday multiculturalism which take place between local children and asylum-seeker youth. This raises questions about how narratives around refugees, privilege and morality become embedded in local cultural identities, and what this might mean for children's attempts to belong within such contexts. These practices are discussed here through long-term ethnographic fieldwork, the importance of which is highlighted for making sense of young people's prejudices and racism towards refugees in economically insecure communities.

T1  - Media and the politics of belonging: Sudanese Australians, letters to the editor and the new integrationism
AN  - 1807164673
AB  - Nolan, Burgin, Farquharson and Marjoribanks focus on media as a significant site through which a politics of belonging is played out, focusing particularly on coverage of Sudanese Australians. To this end, they analyse letters to the editor that concern Sudanese Australians in three Victorian newspapers in 2007, a highly significant year in which this group became the focus of significant levels of (predominantly negative) media coverage. Through textual and thematic analysis, the authors demonstrate how such letters worked to reiterate and extend a politics of 'integrationism' that, without entirely departing from Australia's commitment to multiculturalism, has rearticulated the latter along neo-assimilationist lines. In doing so, they show how, in many letters, Sudanese Australians are problematized for their failure or refusal to 'integrate' in ways that involve an explicit or implicit process of racialization. In the process, the article also critically considers the important role performed by media in the politics of belonging, particularly through their reiteration and contestation of the politics of race and multiculturalism in Australia. Rather than simply a matter of reproducing a hegemonic politics, it shows how such processes, despite the marked limitations of their framing within a 'race debate', also serve to demonstrate significant fault lines in the politics of belonging.

T1  - Hailing Hitler with the Red Hand: The Link in Northern Ireland 1937-40
AN  - 1807164669
AB  - Loughlin's article assesses the activities of The Link, a British pro-Nazi organization promoting Anglo-German conciliation in Northern Ireland in the years leading up to the Second World War. It situates the Ulster branch of the movement within the context of the domestic politics of the region, the British state, Anglo-Irish relations and wider European developments. As a field of activity for The Link, Northern Ireland posed unique and complex problems. The regional branch's prospects for development were complicated, for instance, by how, for nationalists, the aggression of Nazi domestic and foreign policies was reflected in the Northern Ireland government's domestic policies, and also in the way in which Nazi policy towards religion alienated the region's Catholic and Protestant communities. Loughlin also illustrates how the government's approach towards the local Jewish community and Jewish refugees-in a region largely without the levels of antisemitism found in both British and southern Irish public opinion-was informed by a combination of sympathy and local political considerations. Perhaps most uniquely, he illuminates the singularity of the Ulster branch within The Link organization, especially the attitude of its chairman, Admiral Sir Barry Domvile, who regarded Northern Ireland as an obstacle to the establishment of an effective Anglo-Irish defence policy and wished to see the region united with Eire.

T1  - Preference for the Diversity Policy Label Versus the Affirmative Action Policy Label
AN  - 1789707707
AB  - Study 1 assessed associations with the labels "diversity policy" (DP) and "affirmative action policy" (AAP) and perceptions of potential policy components. Student and community participants (N = 143) completed a survey assessing associations with one of the policy labels. Both policies evoked similar associations such as "race/minorities" and "equality/equal opportunity," but the AAP was more often associated with "bias/inequality/discrimination," "unfairness," and "racism/prejudice." When rating potential policy components, reverse discrimination was considered more likely under the AAP. In Study 2 we explored the evaluation of equivalent policy components associated with different policy labels. Student participants (N = 126) rated the policy labeled as the DP more favorably than the AAP. Both studies suggest more favorable attitudes toward the DP label.

T1  - Pathway to peaceful resolution in Myanmar's Rakhine State
AN  - 1790567043
AB  - In 2012 communal violence erupted between Rakhine State's Muslim and Buddhist populations. The Muslims - known as 'Rohingya' - bore the worst of the conflict and continue to bear the brunt of the consequences. The ensuing 'solution' has involved actively separating Muslim and Buddhist communities and severely limiting Muslim rights. An estimated 140,000 people, mostly Muslims, remain in internally displaced people's (IDP) camps or trapped in the Aung Mingalar quarter of the state capital, Sittwe. Life for the state's Buddhist majority is also far from rosy. Rakhine State is the second poorest in Myanmar with a poverty rate of 78%, almost twice Myanmar's national average. When undertaking research in poor and urban communities in the north of the state in 2015, the authors had expected to find two communities wanting little or nothing to do with each other and having little or no respect for one another. What they found, however, was people ready to consider putting aside their prejudices and fears of the other.

T1  - Accent, Gender, and Perceived Competence
AN  - 1785501009
AB  - Those who use non-indigenous accented speech often experience prejudice and discrimination, and in the United States, those speaking with Spanish accents are likely to be impacted. In research on speaker perceptions by type of accent, however, the gender of the speaker or of the perceiver has received less attention. In the present study, the impact of accent (North American- vs. Spanish-accented English), gender of speaker, and gender of rater on perceptions of competence were investigated in a sample of U.S. undergraduates. Participants heard a recording by either a male or female speaker who spoke in English with either a North American or Spanish accent. As hypothesized, Spanish-accented speakers were more likely to be judged negatively, female speakers were more likely to receive negative assessments, and male participants were more likely to show bias related to accent. The neglect of gender in the study of accent bias is discussed.

T1  - The Influence of Defendant Immigration Status, Country of Origin, and Ethnicity on Juror Decisions: An Aversive Racism Explanation for Juror Bias
AN  - 1761128025
AB  - This study examined prejudicial attitudes toward immigrant defendants who vary on legal status, country of origin, and ethnicity. Three hundred twenty mock juror participants read a trial transcript that varied defendants' immigration status (documented or undocumented), defendant country of origin (Canada or Mexico), and defendant race/ethnicity (Caucasian or Latino). Dependent measures included verdict, sentencing, culpability ratings, and trait assessments. European American mock jurors found undocumented, Latino immigrants from Mexico guilty significantly more often, more culpable, and rated this defendant more negatively on various trait measures in comparison with all other conditions. Latino mock jurors did not demonstrate ingroup favoritism or outgroup bias. This study examines aversive racism as a factor of this bias. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

T1  - 'How long? Not long': Selma, Martin Luther King and civil rights narratives
AN  - 1784145400
AB  - Richard H. King's article begins by examining the way Ava DuVernay's recent film Selma deals with the relationship between Martin Luther King and previous accounts/representations of the Civil Rights Movement, and how other feature films such as Mississippi Burning and documentaries such as Stanley Nelson's Freedom Summer depict the movement. This in turn raises the question of what the dominant narrative of the Civil Rights Movement actually has been, and still is. King concludes that it is the King-centred 'From Montgomery to Memphis' narrative. He goes on to explore the ways in which this dominant narrative has been challenged by, for instance, the SNCC-related narrative found, most accessibly, in Nelson's documentary and, more broadly conceived, in Jacqueline Dowd Hall's influential 2005 article 'The Long Civil Rights Movement and the Political Uses of the Past'. Also, along the way, King discusses the relative strengths of feature films v. documentaries in illuminating the past. When comparing this with the written historiography of the Civil Rights Movement, he also explores the importance of the public v. private and the history v. memory debates for understanding the past. King's article concludes by examining the persistence of the Martin Luther King tradition in American politics and of Reverend King's reputation, as suggested by recent works such as David Chappell's Waking from the Dream.

T1  - Northern intellectuals and the ordeal of race: the first decade of Dissent, 1954-64
AN  - 1784144952
AB  - Founded in 1953-4, Dissent assigned itself the task of reviving the political criticism that socialism had been articulating for roughly the previous century and a half. Though the magazine largely abandoned Marxism by the end of the decade, Dissent would remain the most durable journal of democratic socialism in the English-speaking world. The first decade of its history coincided with the intensified momentum of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and the quarterly certainly expressed its sympathy and support for the struggle for racial justice. But, in retrospect, the infrequency of that endorsement in the articles that were published in Dissent is noteworthy. Perhaps the two most famous articles ever to appear in the magazine nevertheless addressed the issue of race, and yet they did so with an eccentricity that made 'The White Negro' and 'Reflections on Little Rock' uncharacteristic of the stance of co-founders and co-editors Irving Howe and Lewis Coser. In 1957 Norman Mailer ignored the Civil Rights Movement itself to locate the emergence of a new kind of underground man, a hipster, who drew from the extreme and even violent alienation of the black sensibility to valorize the sensual and emotional at the expense of the rational and the civic. In 1959 Hannah Arendt repudiated the effort of civil rights organizations like the NAACP to desegregate public schools in the South, arguing that the psyches of black children were damaged by seeking to join hostile white children. Public schools, she argued, ought to be regarded as social institutions that permit discrimination. Instead the champions of racial equality ought to concentrate their efforts at eliminating the prohibitions against intermarriage. By the mid-1960s Dissent added its voice to the mainstream of the movement against Jim Crow, even as Howe celebrated black writers who managed to reconcile literary art with the imperatives of political protest.

T1  - What Is Race? UNESCO, mass communication and human genetics in the early 1950s
AN  - 1752183480
AB  - What Is Race? Evidence from Scientists (1952) is a picture book for schoolchildren published by UNESCO as part of its high-profile campaign on race. The 87-page, oblong, soft-cover booklet contains bold, semi-abstract, pared-down images accompanied by text, devised (so it declared) to make scientific concepts 'more easily intelligible to the layman'. Produced by UNESCO's Department of Mass Communication, the picture book represents the organization's early-postwar confidence in the power of scientific knowledge as a social remedy and diplomatic tool. In keeping with a significant component of the race campaign, What Is Race? presented genetics as the route to an enlightened, scientific, non-prejudiced understanding of race. This article seeks to explain the book's management, aesthetics and framing in the context of postwar disciplinary and international politics. Viewing UNESCO's race campaign as a high point for an internationalist ideology of mass education, this article also analyses the visual and literary arguments of What Is Race? and proposes that the enduring image of genetics as technical and neutral knowledge was in part shaped by UNESCO's efforts to communicate scientific authority to an apparently 'popular' audience.

T1  - Prejudice Toward Gender and Sexual Diversity in a Brazilian Public University: Prevalence, Awareness, and the Effects of Education
AN  - 1722098489
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate how gender and sexual diversity prejudice (GenSex) expresses itself in a university, how prejudice varies in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, the effects of religious status, and how exposure to GenSex education affects levels of prejudice. Eight thousand one hundred eighty-four undergraduate students from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in southern Brazil, completed the revised version of the Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity scale. Data reflect a concentration of 'extreme' and 'high' prejudice in students enrolled in Engineering, Agricultural Sciences, and the Exact and Geological Sciences. 'Moderate' and 'low' prejudice was over-represented in these disciplines as well as in Health, Applied Social Science, and Biological Sciences student samples. Conversely, those who have 'very low' or 'minimal' prejudice tended to cluster in Humanities and Linguistics and Arts. Most students were unaware of ongoing discrimination, reporting to have neither seen nor heard of discrimination towards LGBT students at the university. Time spent at the university had a negligible effect in prejudice mean reduction. Although a large effect was found for previous GenSex training, overall there was substantial variation across disciplines. We recommend raising student awareness of prejudice on campus, in addition to better GenSex education policy for all students, regardless of discipline.

T1  - Multiculturalism on Its Head: Unexpected Boundaries and New Migration in Singapore
AN  - 1724872546
AB  - This study investigates how discourses of multiculturalism shape public debates surrounding new migration in Singapore. Singapore's immigration policies led to the influx of Chinese and Indian professionals, many of whom share race and class identities with local Singaporeans. However, Singaporeans of Chinese and Indian backgrounds rejected these presumed similarities, using discourses of multiculturalism to differentiate themselves from co-ethnic migrants. Based on a content analysis of news reports and online forums, this study shows how local actors portrayed new migrants as too prejudiced or bigoted to adapt to Singapore's multiracial society, thereby creating a paradoxical application of multicultural ideals. This example highlights how contemporary immigration is creating diverse forms of inclusion and exclusion within migrant-receiving nations, challenging models, and policies of multiculturalism based solely on ethnicity and race. This paper also demonstrates how individuals can utilize the discourse of multiculturalism in forwarding their own interests and concerns. Scholarly debates have often portrayed multiculturalism as an ideology or policy imposed by state institutions, where local actors are left to either resist or accommodate such ideas. In the Singapore context, individual Singaporeans transform discourses of multiculturalism, creating a counter-discourse that challenges state immigration policies.

T1  - The French secular hypocrisy: the extreme right, the Republic and the battle for hegemony
AN  - 1784145163
AB  - The success of the extreme right in France in the past two decades has not been limited to its electoral rise. A more long-lasting victory has taken place in the ideological field, where the discourse of the extreme right now occupies a prominent place in the mainstream liberal democratic agenda. Increasingly, its ideas are seen in the media and in the platforms of mainstream parties as 'common sense' or at least acceptable. The growing acceptance of this 'common sense' is the result of very carefully crafted strategies put in place by extreme-right thinkers since the 1980s. For over three decades now, in order to change perceptions and renew extreme right-wing ideology, New Right think tanks such as the French GRECE believed it was necessary to borrow the tactics of the left and, more specifically, the Gramscian concept of hegemony: cultural power must precede political power. With the use of contemporary examples, Mondon's article demonstrates the continuing impact these ideas have had on the Front national and French politics and society, and how this change originated in the association of populist rhetoric with the neo-racist stigmatization of the Other.

T1  - Equality and Diversity in the Classroom: A Comparison of Students' and Teachers' Attitudes in Six European Countries
AN  - 1619439582
AB  - Globalisation and increased mobility of people within the EU have led to increased immigration and greater diversity within many EU countries, which have affected the composition of workplaces and classrooms. This includes diversity in terms of nationality, as well as ethnic, racial and religious diversity. This article expands awareness of diversity issues in the workplace to classrooms. It is based on a crosscultural comparative study of the attitudes of secondary school students and their teachers in six European countries: Ireland, the UK, France, Latvia, Italy and Spain. The sample included 320 students and 208 teachers for a total of 528 respondents. The article compares and contrasts attitudes towards non-national students, ethnic and religious minorities and disabled students, as well as gender issues, bullying and general perceptions of equality and diversity. The findings demonstrate generally positive attitudes among young people towards the increasing diversity in their classrooms. Moreover, the study revealed that in countries where there is greater diversity, the perception of difficulties is lower than in countries with less experience of diversity, suggesting that greater diversity and intergroup contact is resulting in more inclusive attitudes in schools. However, results comparing students with teachers identified consistent gaps in perceptions, with teachers having greater estimates of difficulties posed by diversity, together with smaller estimates of bullying behaviour. The study demonstrated that there is a need for teachers to have enhanced skills and competencies to deal effectively with this new environment in order to facilitate a more inclusive classroom.

T1  - Shifting From Structural to Individual Attributions of Black Disadvantage: Age, Period, and Cohort Effects on Black Explanations of Racial Disparities
AN  - 1700676598; 201525311
AB  - Despite significant changes in American society, Blacks still lag behind Whites on several important socioeconomic indicators. Attributing this gap to structural reasons (e.g., racial discrimination) or to person-centered reasons (e.g., individual willpower) is highly correlated with the extent to which individuals feel that the government should implement policies to ameliorate racial disparities. Scholars have shown that Blacks have shifted their explanations of Black disadvantage from structural attributions to person-centered over the past three decades. Some suggest that this change is because all Blacks are becoming more conservative while others suggest that cohort replacement is undergirding the shift. I used a newly developed method, the intrinsic estimator, to determine whether period, age, and/or cohort effects are responsible for the shift. I find that, generally, Blacks are less inclined to suggest that discrimination is a credible explanation due to period effects, but the increase in person-centered attributions is primarily due to cohort variation.

T1  - Prejudice-reduction in Culturally Mixed Classrooms: The Development and Assessment of a Theory-driven Intervention Among Majority and Minority Youth in Finland
AN  - 1559006453; 201431839
AB  - The aim of this field experiment was to develop and assess an intervention promoting positive intergroup relations in culturally diverse schools. The intervention was based on extended contact and social learning and utilized behavioural journalism as its method. Intervention effects were assessed on out-group attitudes, perceived importance of future contact, perceived peer norms and intergroup anxiety among ethnic majority (N = 583) and minority (N = 214) youth in grades 7-9 in Finnish secondary schools (total N experimental = 388; total N control = 409). As a result of the intervention, both groups showed a tendency to perceive future intergroup contact as more important, and this effect was most notable for younger participants and girls. Prototypicality of in-group and out-group peer models contributed positively to intervention effects. However, unexpectedly, the intervention also increased experiences of intergroup anxiety among the oldest participants. The results are discussed taking into account the developmental stage of the youth studied. Besides critically assessing the effectiveness of the intervention, recommendations for improving theory-driven prejudice-reduction and for the development of future interventions in culturally diverse contexts are given.

T1  - Measuring Nonverbal Bias Through Body Language Responses to Stereotypes
AN  - 1680152544; 201514009
AB  - Although research has demonstrated the manifestation of racial bias by measuring overt attitudes and behaviors, there has been little examination of the subtle nonverbal cues that may also characterize such bias. The present study investigates implicit racial bias by analyzing nonverbal behaviors of individuals shown video of a criminal suspect whose ethnic identity is manipulated to be Black or White. Participants appeared significantly more uncertain about what they were saying when describing the White suspect than when describing the Black suspect. Participants were also more likely to display 'open' posture when describing the Black suspect but 'closed' posture (e.g., crossed arms) when describing the White suspect. The results indicate that biases in attitudes and beliefs might be reliably detected and measured through body language. The findings are discussed in terms of how nonverbal behaviors may reveal more subtle forms of prejudice and miscommunication. Contextual correlations between specific nonverbal behaviors and affective states are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How 'It Gets Better': Effectively Communicating Support to Targets of Prejudice
AN  - 1531933293; 201423354
AB  - What is said when communicating intergroup support to targets of prejudice, and how do targets react? We hypothesized that people not targeted by prejudice reference social connection (e.g., social support) more than social change (e.g., calling for a reduction in prejudice) in their supportive messages. However, we hypothesized that targets of prejudice would be more comforted by social change messages. We content coded naturalistic messages of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning teenagers from youtube.com (Study 1) and college undergraduates' statements (Study 2a) and found social connection messages more frequent than social change messages. Next, we explored targets' responses (Studies 2b-4b). Lesbian and gay participants rated social connection messages less comforting than social change messages (Study 3). Study 4 showed that only targets of prejudice distinguish social connection from social change messages in this way, versus non-targets. These results highlight the importance of studying the communication, content, and consequences of positive intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Expression of Ethnic Prejudice in Focus Groups from Agencies Affected by the 9/11 Attacks on the World Trade Center
AN  - 1660023781; 201505736
AB  - Members of Muslim and Arab-American communities were publicly targeted as suspects and perpetrators of this terrorism. One to two years after the attacks, 145 participants from 6 affected agencies in New York City participated in 22 focus groups to discuss post-disaster psychosocial issues. Ethnic prejudice was reflected in 2% of the comments emerging from these discussions, representing three major subthemes: (1) observations of prejudice toward self or others, (2) personal fear-based or prejudicial attitudes and opinions, and (3) defense of Muslims. The discussion involving prejudice that emerged in these focus groups parallels the upsurge in prejudice reported by other sources after 9/11. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigration and the Therapeutic Managerial Government
AN  - 1542001143; 201426868
AB  - Multiculturalism is an imprecise concept with a variety of different meanings, but no matter how multiculturalism is defined, nearly all of its advocates share the common objective of reconstructing Western society in order to protect minority cultural groups from intolerance. The multiculturalist coalition has been highly successful in this undertaking because members of the majority culture generally accept the moral diagnosis that their traditional way of life is backward, irrational, and inherently prone to various forms of prejudice. Adopting multiculturalism as official state policy has thus significantly increased the moral authority of the managerial government to therapeutically control and alter civil society. In addition to purging subject citizens of racism, sexism, and homophobia, the managerial government is authorized to rehabilitate and punish dissidents of multiculturalism who fail to demonstrate the appropriate level of veneration for protected cultural groups. Here, Drummond inquires into some of the complex consequences of multiculturalism, particularly in Europe. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - More Than Vulnerable: Rethinking Community
AN  - 1750223807
AB  - The aim of this paper is to disentangle some aspects of the link established between community and mourning. It will be done in order to highlight in which sense the community of mourners would be an impossible political community. In order to discuss the approach of thinkers such as Judith Butler on the possibility of setting a political community grounded on the recognition of our common precarious life, the paper will analyze the challenges posed by the film Hiroshima mon amour, directed by Alain Resnais with a screenplay by Marguerite Duras, under the light of the political theory of Hannah Arendt, especially from her articulation of the connection between mortality, politics, memory and judgment. This analysis allows us also to reveal some prejudices inherited by the theoretical proposal of Butler from the androcentric Modern paradigm, which she tries to criticize through her emphasis on vulnerability.

T1  - Public Attitudes Toward Immigration
AN  - 1629332397; 201440937
AB  - Immigrant populations in many developed democracies have grown rapidly, and so too has an extensive literature on natives' attitudes toward immigration. This research has developed from two theoretical foundations, one grounded in political economy, the other in political psychology. These two literatures have developed largely in isolation from one another, yet the conclusions that emerge from each are strikingly similar. Consistently, immigration attitudes show little evidence of being strongly correlated with personal economic circumstances. Instead, research finds that immigration attitudes are shaped by sociotropic concerns about its cultural impacts-and to a lesser extent its economic impacts-on the nation as a whole. This pattern of results has held up as scholars have increasingly turned to experimental tests, and it holds for the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. Still, more work is needed to strengthen the causal identification of sociotropic concerns and to isolate precisely how, when, and why they matter for attitude formation.

T1  - Attitudes towards Muslim Immigrants: Evidence from Survey Experiments across Four Countries
AN  - 1520341357; 201413510
AB  - There has been much negative focus on Muslims in public debates in the West and it is a matter of great interest to examine whether Muslims are particularly exposed to prejudice and hostility. Since it is known that immigrants tend to be exposed to prejudice, and practically all Muslims living in Western countries are either immigrants or are of immigrant origin, it is useful to analyse whether Muslims are viewed more negatively than immigrants in general. Using data from survey experiments conducted in Norway, Sweden, the USA and the United Kingdom in 2009, we find that Muslim immigrants were not more negatively viewed than immigrants in general. In the two countries that have experienced large-scale attacks by Islamic extremists, the USA and the United Kingdom, the expressed levels of anti-Muslim attitudes were actually lower than the levels of general anti-immigrant attitudes. We find that individual traits that influence general xenophobia also influence anti-Muslim attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Normalization of antisemitism, 1880-1900: the case of a Jesuit community in Rome
AN  - 1520331074; 201413236
AB  - The significance of the political antisemitism of the 1880s and 1890s for developments in the twentieth century remains controversial. Researchers have been divided as to whether the antisemitism of the nineteenth century, or even earlier, was one of the factors that made the Holocaust possible, or whether it was a phenomenon with little or no relevance for subsequent events. The decline of most antisemitic political parties at the beginning of the twentieth century appears to support the latter point of view. Yet some commentators, such as Shulamit Volkov and Peter Pulzer, have convincingly suggested that the importance of nineteenth-century antisemitism lies less in the political fortunes of antisemitic parties than in the way antisemitism came to penetrate civil society. Thus, they have argued, antisemitism came to form a component of a widespread conservative and anti-liberal world-view. Following Pulzer and Volkov, it might be desirable to investigate the processes by which antisemitism could have been transformed from an extremist political position into a common element in the outlook of broad portions of European society: mechanisms that have remained largely unexplored. Dahl's article studies the normalization of antisemitism in the two last decades of the nineteenth century through a scrutiny of shifts in the attitudes to Jews of a restricted group of Italian Jesuits. The analysis is based on a detailed study of La Civilta Cattolica, a Jesuit community in Rome that published a journal of the same name. Since its foundation in 1850 this institution has been an authoritative exponent of Catholic policy and is generally perceived as having been a protagonist in the formulation of a Catholic stance towards the 'Jewish question' in the later nineteenth century. Dahl shows that, while in the early 1880s, most members resisted or opposed the use of antisemitic propaganda, through the following two decades the attitudes of virtually all of them became tinged with antisemitism, supporting the hypothesis that antisemitism became part of a widespread 'culture'. In his analysis, Dahl does not focus on the wider circulation of ideas that influenced the Roman Jesuits, but on the dynamics within the institution that made possible the gradual acceptance of antisemitism, arguing that a debate over antisemitism among the Jesuits in the early 1880s was a crucial moment in this development. As they failed at this early stage to formulate an anti-antisemitic response, they allowed antisemitism to become part of the culture of their institution, and rendered its later rejection practically impossible.

T1  - Celebrating a Return to Jim Crow? A Reflexive Analysis and Methodological Query on Measuring Segregation
AN  - 1512220888; 201408811
AB  - Glaeser and Vigdor (2012) recently declared 'the end of a segregated century'. Because America has returned to 1910 segregation levels, it has allegedly achieved transcendence over racism. After all, the authors note, government no longer endorses housing discrimination, all-white neighborhoods are extinct, and white racial attitudes have liberalized. Despite the proclamation, many questions regarding segregation remain unanswered by Glaeser and Vigdor. Namely, how can segregation be conceptualized and its measurement improved, what might alternative methods for analyzing it yield, and why does it matter in the first place? To prompt an overdue substantive and methodological discussion, we undertake a case study analysis of Cook County, Illinois to address these questions. Our analytic goal is to illuminate how segregation is a much more complex matter than many analyses reflect, and when this is taken into account, it becomes readily apparent that any assertions of racial transcendence are quite premature.

T1  - Moral encounters: drawing boundaries of class, sexuality and migrancy in paid domestic work
AN  - 1512220809; 201408858
AB  - I examine how migrant-national encounters are morally framed through boundary making based on intersections of class, sexuality, ethnicity and migrancy. Encounters are a fruitful lens for the study of the everyday politics of diversity and belonging. By focusing on encounters it is possible to analyse whether close contact does in fact reduce prejudice, as has been argued in research on cosmopolitan urbanism. I present the notion of contact space as a conceptual tool for such analysis, as well as examples of contact spaces in the private and public spheres. I use ethnographic data on the employment of domestic workers in Naples, Italy, to show that close contact does not alleviate prejudices in societies that offer little possibility of social advancement for migrant workers.

T1  - The soundtrack of neo-fascism: youth and music in the National Front
AN  - 1494748634; 201402145
AB  - Shaffer examines youth involvement in the National Front and the development of neo-fascist music as a conduit for its ideas. Using rare publications and interviews with National Front members, he argues that youth had a profound impact on post-war British fascism by influencing fascist ideology and tactics. Following challenges from the Anti-Nazi League and Rock Against Racism, the National Front started its own youth outreach programmes that reshaped neo-fascism and how neo-fascists distributed their message. In adopting skinhead style and music, the organization spread 'nativist' culture not only to gain supporters, but to counter multiculturalism in popular music and politics. Shaffer's article explains how neo-fascist youth created their own publications, clubs, concerts and even a record company to provide entertainment, spread ideas, raise money, recruit and build associations with like-minded neo-fascists in other countries. With these new tactics, the young National Front members redefined British fascism, which had lasting impact on radical groups in Europe and North America. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Comment on Feagin and Elias
AN  - 1438561064; 201340225
AB  - Despite the centrality and significance that race continues to hold in shaping social life in the USA, theoretical analyses of race are surprisingly few and far between in sociology. Researchers have moved from models grounded in analyses of prejudice towards theoretical paradigms designed to focus more explicitly on the ways that race and racism are built into the social structure of US society. Omi and Winant's (1994) racial formation theory has long been regarded as a classic in this regard, and one of the most important foundational paradigms for making sense of contemporary race relations. Joe Feagin and Sean Elias have developed an interesting and pointed commentary of this theory, and provide useful points for critique and contention. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A time to make (and lose) friends: effects of soccer tournaments on German adolescents' attitudes toward foreigners
AN  - 1433108426
AB  - The present research examined the effects of one's national sports team defeats in international competitions on adolescents' out-group attitudes and the moderation of these effects by in-group identification. We conducted two longitudinal studies surveying German adolescents (Soccer World Championship 2006 and European Championship 2008). Both studies showed deterioration in adolescents' evaluations of people from the countries whose soccer teams defeated the German team (Italy and Spain). There was no generalization to other national groups. The deterioration in out-group evaluations was shown to be more pronounced for adolescents reporting a high in-group identification. The results are discussed in terms of macro-societal effects on adolescents' attitude development and the function that intergroup bias serves for social identity.

T1  - Do All Associations Lead to Lower Levels of Ethnocentrism? A Two-Year Longitudinal Test of the Selection and Adaptation Model
AN  - 1429641905; 201335740
AB  - Within the literature on the relation between membership in voluntary associations and tolerance, three theoretical perspectives can be distinguished. The socialization perspective assumes that the interaction within association leads to higher levels of tolerance; the self-selection perspective suggests that tolerant actors are more likely to join associations; while the selection and adaption model predicts that the group culture within an association will have a specific effect on members' attitudes. We use a two-year panel study among Belgian adolescents to ascertain the empirical merits of these three approaches. Results show that not all associations have an effect on the reduction of prejudice, but that this effect is limited to specific associations. A structural equation model furthermore suggests that socialization effects are significantly stronger than self-selection effects. As such, this analysis of panel data lends support to the selection and adaptation model. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Tracing Family, Teaching Race: Critical Race Pedagogy in the Millennial Sociology Classroom
AN  - 1464874890
AB  - The "millennial" historical moment presents fresh dilemmas for race-critical instructors. In addition to being well-versed in colorblind racial discourse, millennial students are socialized in a pop-cultural milieu that implies a more integrated, racially egalitarian world than exists in reality and includes claims that US society is now "post-racial". Millennials' enthusiastic consumption of race in an era of seeming progress leads them to assume an ever greater social distance between their generation and the relics of those they consider "real" racists, as well as between the former eras of de jure white supremacy, and the more racially meritocratic structure they presume exists today. In light of such obstacles, race-critical instructors must employ creative strategies to help students understand and identify their connections to larger, structural matters that create and sustain racial inequality at the systemic level. The author has introduced one successful approach, where students examine the social reproduction of racial inequality, by tracing their family histories of wealth and capital acquisition and transfer.

T1  - Roma People within the Global Process of Change
AN  - 1665202512
AB  - Although there is temptation to judge the Roma community as having a strong cultural constancy and stability in time, as surviving at the periphery of societies, outside the process of modernization, this paper aims to make an analysis of the factors which caused important changes in the socio-economic and cultural state of this community within the context of globalization. The prejudice that the Roma are a community closed within its traditional culture had and still has adverse effects on the perception which the majority population has about the Roma community and on the support policies for the marginalised segments of the Roma population too. In some ways, the Roma population doesn't have a different pattern from all the other populations, minority or majority. All the populations are engaged in a process of social change and reconstruction, of transition from traditional to modern cultural patterns imposed by a dynamic society undergoing fast modernization. It is true though, that modernization is not only an opportunity through the unavoidable commitment of the communities within the global flow of change, but also a process of new social differentiation. The division of work has generated new pressures of internal differentiation for all populations: some people advanced socially, others remained at the margin of the process. The popular history of the Roma, with the myths of any such history, includes also the intellectuals, prestigious politicians and successful people as main patterns of exiting the 'Gypsyhood'. But in spite of this, the paper underline that the concrete social and economic conditions put, in many cases, the Roma population, as ethnic group in a special social and cultural position different from that of other minorities. These papers bring a theoretical starting point for an empirical survey focusing on the successful Roma population. The survey was an exploratory research done by IQLR at the end of 2012, being centred on the Roma elite: intellectuals, political leaders and businessmen. The research has been identified three successful categories among the Roma people, mentioned above, as well as the factors associated to their success. The survey data are yet to be processed completely. However, they will certainly bring another perception/image on the Roma people, different from the one associated to severe poverty, as shown by the sociological research up to now.

T1  - The distinctiveness of Canadian immigration experience
AN  - 1551002383; 201429088
AB  - Canada's experience with immigration has been comparatively positive and mass immigration has considerable popular support within the country. The distinctive Canadian policy model-including large numbers with skill-based selection, multiculturalism and other policies aimed at promoting integration, and provincial autonomy-deserves international attention. However, Canada's success with immigration is only partly related to its policies and these may not be easily transferable to other contexts. Skill-based immigrant selection may be the most important feature of the Canadian model contributing to its success, and the effectiveness of this policy is clearly contingent on border control, which in the case of Canada is facilitated by geographical isolation. Canada's symbolic commitment to multiculturalism emphasizes the social integration of immigrants and this goal is also served by significant social services supporting settlement and language acquisition. The most significant distinctive feature of the Canadian approach to immigration may be the belief that immigration represents a positive opportunity to build the economy and develop the country. This belief represents a resource helping the country address some of the current problems confronting immigration, including reduced employment success of immigrants and evidence that racial divisions have significance particularly for certain groups. The belief in mass immigration as a positive resource and development opportunity underlies much of the positive discourse on immigration in Canada. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigrant and Native Romani Women in Spain: Building Alliances and Developing Shared Strategies
AN  - 1347780976; 201318910
AB  - Romani women, both immigrant and native, face a greater risk of social exclusion because of the prejudices that mainstream society has about the Roma, and especially because they are women and some of them immigrants as well. This paper analyses how Romani immigrant and native women are building pan-ethnic identities, sharing alliances and developing common strategies in Spain. Previous studies on Romani women have tended to see them as passive and not active agents. Thus, very few have focused on the specific case of Romani immigrant women and on their modes of incorporation in their new contexts of reception. Drawing on data from two qualitative studies of Roma immigrant women and Gitanas in Spain, the authors demonstrate how everyday-life interactions and shared interests at informal and formal encounters lead to building solidarity alliances and sharing transnational narratives, thus overcoming subgroup ethnic boundaries and stereotypes. The analysis is carried out from the 'other women' approach, taking into account the voices of all types of Romani women, illiterate and literate, in the whole research process.

T1  - Foreign Wars and Domestic Prejudice: How Media Exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Predicts Ethnic Stereotyping by Jewish and Arab American Adolescents
AN  - 1283637696; 201305725
AB  - This study was based on the theory that adolescents view scenes of violent ethnic conflicts in the mass media through the lens of their own ethnicity, and that the resulting social-cognitive reactions influence their negative stereotypes about similar ethnic groups in their own country. We interviewed 89 Jewish and 180 Arab American high school students about their exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, their social cognitive reactions to it, and their stereotypes toward ethnic groups. Beyond the effects of ethnic identity, the degree to which adolescents identified with Israelis and Palestinians in the media was a key variable linking exposure to media depictions of the conflict and the implicit ethnic stereotypes they displayed about Jewish Americans and Arab Americans.

T1  - Queering the Politics of Lambda Picture Book Finalists: Challenging Creeping Neoliberalism Through Curricular Innovations
AN  - 1373427524; 201328727
AB  - In many instances, adults serve as gatekeepers for what books children are permitted to explore. Unfortunately, this means that most children have limited access to picture books with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) characters. In this article, we use queer pedagogy and observations about neoliberalism to provide a qualitative analysis of LGBTQ characters in picture books which were finalists for a Lambda Literary Award during 2000-2005. We examined the ways in which LGBTQ identities and relationships are negotiated and how sexual prejudice is treated. While it is improbable that the books we analyze would be embraced by proponents of neoliberalism, we also briefly consider some ways in which they may be inadvertently consistent with that perspective. The article closes with recommendations regarding discussion questions, additional readings, and educational activities aimed at guiding children, and adults, to appreciate a diversity of multidimensional identities and family structures, to develop strategies to respond constructively to emotional and physical violence, and to promote the public wellbeing. We hope that this analysis will lead to more frequent, productive, and expansive discussions of this literature among adults and children. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Without intending any of the most undesirable features of a colour bar': race science, Europeanness and the British armed forces during the twentieth century
AN  - 1283644055; 201303369
AB  - In 1923 Air Ministry regulations explicitly excluded recruits who were not of 'pure European descent' from joining the Royal Air Force. Similar restrictions were placed on the British army and Royal Navy in the interwar period. Such rejection was present but occurred less systematically during the First World War. Kushner analyses the intellectual foundations of this discriminatory policy and the problems of definition it created before September 1939. He then explores how and why policy was changed during the Second World War, asking whether greater inclusivity was based on expediency or a change in attitudes due to the fight against Nazism. In particular, the role of race science is highlighted, explaining the persistence in exclusion of those deemed non-European well beyond 1945. Finally, he argues that the implementation of a wide-ranging colour bar has still to be acknowledged or subject to sustained memory work within the armed services and British society as a whole.

T1  - The Legacy of Racial Caste: An Exploratory Ethnography
AN  - 1023027766; 201223769
AB  - With the racial progress the nation has made over the past half century, including the growth of the black middle class and the election of a black president, many are now prepared to proclaim the United States a postracial society, where egalitarian values most often prevail; race is no longer a significant barrier to power, privilege, and prestige; and racial prejudice is mostly a thing of the past. When observed ethnographically, the lived experience of race relations suggests a different view and conceptual framework. As the legacy of racial caste, the color line persists in social interaction and is evident in racially determined perspectives and local working conceptions that order race relations and contribute to persistent racial inequality. Indeed, the claim of a postracial society is an ideological discourse that denies continuing patterns of race relations.

T1  - A Comparative and Exploratory Analysis of Socio-cultural Factors and Immigrant Women's Mental Health within a Canadian Context
AN  - 1010078721; 22223121
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of macro-level factors on immigrant and non-immigrant women's mental health status in a Canadian context. This study was part of a larger study examining women's quality of life in south eastern Ontario. Using survey research methods, data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 91 women of whom 66 identified their country of origin as other than Canada. Descriptive, bivariate and regression analysis of this data revealed that immigrant and non-immigrant women's macro-level predictors of mental health status vary. Overall, for immigrant women's perceptions of neighbourhood social cohesion was a stronger predictor influencing mental health status, while for non-immigrant women social support was more influential. Research with larger, representative samples should explore the findings to ascertain generalizability. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Race and capitalism redux
AN  - 1283644039; 201303422
AB  - Pitcher's article deals with a revival of interest in the relationship between race and capitalism. The old reductionist arguments that once held that capitalism was ultimately to blame for racism have been subject to a peculiar inversion, and now capitalism is being conceived as having anti-racist outcomes. Engaging with arguments that suggest that anti-racism similarly serves as an agent of neoliberal capitalism, Pitcher suggests it is necessary to rethink the terms of the imputed relation between race and capital. He goes on to interrogate some of the pieties of contemporary race politics, and argues that common blind spots in left critique constitute an obstacle to understanding the articulation of capitalism and race.

T1  - Models of integration in a settler society: caveats and complications in the US case
AN  - 1551002765; 201428961
AB  - The United States is a classic country of immigration that has long defined itself as having been built by successive waves of immigrants. Social scientists often speak of a multicultural or cultural pluralist 'model of integration' in the US that recognizes, sometimes even celebrates, diversity at the same time as it assumes and expects immigrants and their children to assimilate and become American. This article complicates the picture. It brings in history to show how national models of integration in the US are not stable but have changed over time. In fact, the very incorporation of earlier waves of immigrants in the past has contributed to these changes. It also considers local-level variation-that is, differences among US cities in policies as well as in widespread understandings about the integration of immigrants. Despite these complications, there are clearly ways that national models of integration matter in the US, which is the theme of the concluding section. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - In drawing from Herek's (2007, 2009) sexual stigma and prejudice theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among prejudice toward sexual minority coaches, religious fundamentalism, sexism, and sexual prejudice and to determine whether race affected these relationships. The authors collected data from 238 parents. Results indicated that Asians expressed greater sexual prejudice than Latinos and Whites, while African Americans expressed more religious fundamentalism than did Whites. There were also differences in the associations among the variables. For African Americans, sexism held the strongest association with prejudice toward sexual minority coaches. While for Asians and Whites, religious fundamentalism held the strongest association, contact with lesbian and gay friends was a significant predictor of prejudice for Asians, but not for the other groups. For Latinos, both religious fundamentalism and sexism were associated with sexual prejudice. The authors discuss the results in terms of theoretical and practical implications.

T1  - The 'German nation' and the 'black Other': social Darwinism and the cultural mission in German colonial discourse
AN  - 1531933803; 201423373
AB  - The construction of the 'black Other' can perhaps best be characterized as a politically motivated pattern of argumentation in colonial discourse. It was crystallized in the reality of German colonial rule in Africa between 1884 and 1914-18. The achievement of German colonial rule in Africa was considered a task of national importance; and colonial rule could be justified by employing an image of the Other. However, this deployment of the Other should not be seen as merely a political strategy in the context of the power politics of colonization. It also brought into focus widely held racist views of the world. The history of German colonization was characterized by the use of repressive violence in the name of 'culture' and 'civilization', concepts that had their origins in the Enlightenment. This cultural-missionary project declared colonial expansion to be a type of humanitarian intervention and an educational endeavour. This was in sharp contrast to the racism, based on social Darwinism, that claimed Germany's undeniable right to acquire colonial territories as a matter of the 'survival of the fittest'.

T1  - Consequences of the 2008 financial crisis for intergroup relations: The role of perceived threat and causal attributions
AN  - 1907332347
AB  - Why do societal crises often lead to intergroup conflict? We propose that the interplay of unspecific threat and causal attributions differentially predicts increases in ethnic prejudice and anti-Semitism. We tested this hypothesis in the context of the 2008 financial crisis. The results of Study 1 (N = 890) demonstrated on the basis of representative survey data that threat elicited by the financial crisis was related with ethnic prejudice once the cause was attributed to immigrants, whereas it was related with anti-Semitism once the cause of the crisis was attributed to bankers and speculators. In Study 2 (N = 157), we experimentally manipulated threat and type of causal attributions and replicated the results of Study 1. Moreover, we found that regardless of the threat manipulation, participants did not respond with increased prejudice against out-groups if a system-level explanation for the crisis, namely the economic system, was salient.

T1  - Patterns of intergroup attitudes in South Africa after 1994
AN  - 1030868398; 201227916
AB  - In the heterogeneous South African society, race has become not only the major organizing principle, but also the primary unit of social analysis. The concept "intergroup relations" has consequently predominantly been associated with racial relations and "intergroup attitudes" with "interracial attitudes". Interest in South African race relations has furthermore been enhanced by the tumultuous struggle against apartheid. A substantive body of research acquired during apartheid indeed points to interracial tension. The advent of a new political dispensation in 1994 has been accompanied with expectations that increased intergroup contact, in particular, would result in improved interracial relations. The current study investigates intergroup attitudes after 1994. Three countrywide surveys were conducted in 1998, 2001 and 2009 using representative samples of all major racial groups. The results indicate that overall attitudes were more positive among more affluent and urbanized communities. However, there are indications of prevailing negative relations, in particular between Blacks and Afrikaans-speaking Whites. While the attitudes of Afrikaans-speaking Whites seem to have become more positive, that has not been the case to the same extent for Blacks. Blacks also appear to be less positive towards English-speaking Whites than during apartheid. Overall, the results point to more positive intergroup attitudes in some instances, but also to potential emerging points of tension. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Revitalizing and de-territorializing fascism in the 1950s: the extreme right in France and Italy, and the pan-national ("European") imaginary
AN  - 964197845; 201207456
AB  - In this article Mammone explores a still relatively neglected story in the history of post-war neo-fascism, notably the attempts by some French and Italian right-wing extremists to revitalize fascist ideology after the war by means of two interconnected strategies, namely, radicalization (rejection of the democratic system) and "de-territorialization" (in the sense of converting narrow fascist nationalism into pan-European nationalism). Mammone describes these project(s), as well as the influence of thinkers such as Julius Evola and Maurice Bardeche, and their location in the wider ideological context of the extreme right in the 1950s. The immediate outcome of this "de-territorialized fascism" was the creation of an extreme-right international association, the Mouvement Social Europeen, in which French and Italian activists played a central role. Mammone breaks new ground regarding the non-national dimension of extreme-right thought, a topic too often studied within the boundaries of a given geographical territory and nationalist ideological landscape. By utilizing a transnational framework, he also shows the continuous connections and interactions between the Italian and the French extreme rights. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary: PROD
AN  - 1928282225
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - Whites' Racial Policy Attitudes in the Twenty-First Century: The Continuing Significance of Racial Resentment
AN  - 862596391; 201109733
AB  - A topic of long-standing interest in racial attitudes research is whites' support for principles of racial equality on one hand coupled with their intransigence on policies designed to redress that inequality on the other. Much has been written on possible explanations of this "principle-policy gap" and what the gap reveals about the state of contemporary American race relations. In this article, the authors provide air update and partial replication of their 1996 study of whites' views of racial policies in what has been referred to as our post-racial society. Using both General Social Survey and American National Election Survey data, the authors assess the current state of 'whites' racial policy attitudes and the factors that shape those attitudes and consider whether any meaningful change has occurred in recent decades. Among the explanations of the principle-policy gap that the authors examine, one stands out as especially powerful: racial resentment, a variant of stratification ideology that focuses on the role of racial individualism in shaping white resistance to meaningful policy change. Moreover, the authors find no evidence that whites' racial policy views have changed since the 1980s.

T1  - Cognitive Obstacles Against Organ Donation: The Influence of Negative Attitudes, Norms, and Traditional Beliefs on Chinese People's Intention to Donate Organs after Death
AN  - 856403563; 201106830
AB  - In China, the organ supply is severely insufficient to cover all people on the waiting list for donated organs, and numerous patients die awaiting transplant. To achieve a better understanding of cadaveric organ donation in Chinese culture, this study examined 300 Chinese adults, in both Fujian Province and Macao, regarding attitudes towards organ donation, subjective norms about organ donation and traditional beliefs about the body and death, examining the influences of these factors on respondents' donation intentions. Multiple hierarchical regression results suggest that more negative attitudes, unfavourable norms and traditional beliefs lead to lower donation intentions. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - The composition of the minority population as a threat: Can real economic and cultural threats explain xenophobia
AN  - 1018362276; 201212859
AB  - This article sets out to develop a classical theme of empirical research within group threat theory, namely the argument that the size of the minority population threatens the majority population. To be able to clarify the mixed empirical results within this version of group threat theory, the article focuses on the composition of the immigrant population. The article tests both objective sources of cultural threats (linguistic composition and the Muslim population) and economic threats (the proportion of working-class individuals and the unemployed among the immigrant population). The study concludes that, first, the composition of the immigrant population is of utter importance for the size argument to be valid for cultural threats (proportion of Muslim population), whereas for economic threats it does not matter. Second, compositional economic threats matter strongly to the group that genuinely competes for scarce resources -- the working class is more xenophobic when the immigrant working class is large. Third, the study brings some clarity with regard to the cultural composition of the immigrant population: it is shown that the relationship between Muslims and European majority populations mirrors the relationship between whites and African-Americans in the US.

T1  - Gender as catalyst for violence against Roma in contemporary Italy
AN  - 835111663; 201100576
AB  - Silvio Berlusconi's use of ethnicity and immigration as national security issues in his successful campaign for election to the Italian presidency in 2008 was by no means unique in contemporary Europe. What was surprising was the speed of his right-wing government's legislative restriction of migrants in the form of the so-called 'security package', first introduced just five weeks after the election. Woodcock explores the striking fact that this 'security package', and the intense wave of racist violence by Italians against Roma that it legitimized and encouraged, was proposed and justified in response to media reports of Italian babies being stolen by 'Zingari' from the 'nomad camps' and of Italian women being raped and beaten by Romanian men of 'Zingari' ethnicity. Gender and ethnicity are the twin constitutive discourses of modern European society, and racialized subjects are necessarily gendered. The stereotype of 'dangerous black men sexually threatening white women' has been mobilized in a vast range of European and colonial nationalist projects in order to justify the policing of both racialized masculine subjects and women as objects of the patriarchy. Similarly, the depiction of women as hysterical, sexually vulnerable objects in need of (white) masculine protection is an old story that the Italian media recognize as a fairy tale even as they reproduce the discourse. Woodcock explores what has not been mentioned thus far, namely, that gender stereotypes are vital to the mobilization of violent racism against the Roma in contemporary Italy, and how conservative gender binaries are strengthened and policed in a time of social crisis through the stereotyping of Roma as racial threat.

T1  - Constructing identities of "difference" and "resistance": the politics of being Muslim and British
AN  - 835111695; 201100553
AB  - A number of existing academic researches exploring experiences and attitudes amongst the UK's Muslim population have highlighted the varied forms of discrimination encountered as a "fact of life" of minorities in contemporary Britain. The combination of prejudice, discrimination and exclusion appears to have heightened emphatic self-definitions of religious identity, often ruling out any proximity to being British. An "identity of difference" through asserted religio-cultural distinctiveness is usually interpreted as a response to compound racism; the combined effects of colour and cultural racism. Further, whilst colour racism is generally declining, there is an empirical reality of pervading anti-Asian cultural attitudes resulting in an increasing "identity of unbelongingness". The assertion of "Muslimness" in opposition to a discriminatory hegemonic British identity provides a universal "belongingness" which further undermines the national identity. This paper will explore the construction of identities of difference and resistance amongst British Yemeni Muslims based on findings from research recently undertaken.

T1  - Intergroup contact and the projection of positivity
AN  - 822522022; 201072903
AB  - Three studies investigated whether intergroup contact reduces prejudice, in part, via the extension of positive attributes that define the self to the outgroup. Study 1 found that positive intergroup contact predicted self-outgroup overlap, and this overlap mediated the contact-attitude relationship. This mediational path was specific to outgroup, but not ingroup, attitudes. In Study 2 we found that it was the attribution of specifically positive, as opposed to negative, traits that mediated the contact-attitude relationship in a model that also included intergroup anxiety. In Study 3 an elaborated model was supported, in which perceived self-other similarity mediated the effects of positive contact on the attribution of positive self-traits. We discuss the findings in the context of recent advances in Intergroup Contact Theory. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Brain Gain to Brain Waste: Individual Biases, Prejudice, and Discounting of Migrant Skills
AN  - 852900428; 201103390
AB  - The present study replicated Esses et al. (2006) study on the role of prejudice in discounting of immigrant skills in the Australian context. It examined the effects of subtle prejudice on discounting of migrants' foreign acquired credentials. Eighty-one students at an Australian university participated in the study. Design incorporated three experimental conditions, manipulating location, and birth of prospective job applicants. The independent variables were modern prejudice score, place of birth, and location of training (Australia, UK, and Lebanon). Participants rated resumes of hypothetical applicants on the dependent variables (person-job and person-organization fit). Results partially supported the hypotheses, with the Lebanese applicant rated significantly less favorable than both the UK and the Australian applicant. Findings imply that foreign skills and credentials were used as an ostensibly legitimate basis for the discounting of the visible minority applicant supporting the theory of aversive racism. Results also provide evidence for suitability of the justification-suppression model as a framework for comprehending contemporary issues in Western society such discounting migrant skills.

T1  - The Effect of Question Framing and Response Options on the Relationship between Racial Attitudes and Beliefs about Genes as Causes of Behavior
AN  - 758123696; 201057912
AB  - Prior research suggests that the attribution of individual and group differences to genetic causes is correlated with prejudiced attitudes toward minority groups. Our study suggests that these findings may be due to the wording of the questions and to the choice of response options. Using a series of vignettes in an online survey, we find a relationship between racial attitudes and genetic attributions when respondents are asked to make causal attributions of differences between racial groups. However, when they are asked to make causal attributions for characteristics shown by individuals, no such relationship is found. The response scale used appears to make less, if any, difference in the results. These findings indicate that the way questions about genetic causation of behavior are framed makes a significant contribution to the answers obtained because it significantly changes the meaning of the questions. We argue that such framing needs to be carefully attended to, not only in posing research questions but also in discourse about genetics more generally. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'What did You Say, and Who do You Think You Are?' How Power Differences Affect Emotional Reactions to Prejudice
AN  - 758124347; 201056866
AB  - Three studies examine how power differences between targets and sources of prejudice affect targets' emotional reactions to prejudice. Study 1 first demonstrates that people do not expect powerful others to be prejudiced. Studies 2 and 3 then examine what happens when targets encounter prejudice, as a function of the source's power. Targets notice and recall prejudiced statements from powerful sources, irrespective of whether they are personally dependent on the source. However, results also demonstrate that personal dependency on the source determines how much targets attend to and are emotionally affected by prejudice. Emotional reactions to prejudice as a function of source power were mediated by negative expectations about future interactions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reading Mustafa Kemal Ataturk on the Armenian genocide of 1915
AN  - 758123584; 201057098
AB  - The debate on where Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey and universally known as the 'Father of the Turks', stood in regard to the colossal violence committed against Armenians during the First World War has become a fiercely contested part of the Turkish-Armenian reconciliation process, especially within the past few years. Ulgen aims to clear away the clouds of dust surrounding Kemal by delving into his texts and examining his role in the reification of Turkish denial of the destruction of Ottoman Armenians. Based on a textual analysis of his entire corpus, including Nutuk-the Great Speech of 1927 and the master-narrative of modern Turkish history and national identity-her article examines and documents how his charismatic leadership helped to consolidate both the myth of 'murderous Armenians' and that of the Turks as an 'oppressed nation' (mazlum millet), monumentalizing both in official Turkish historiography. Ulgen argues that Kemal's portrayal of Armenians and the Armenian Question was generally consistent across the years and in various political documents, as well as being consistent with contemporary Turkish representations of the events of 1915. What really tips the balance towards Turkish innocence in Kemal's representation of the conflict is not his framing of the issue per se but the stark difference in the rhetoric he deploys in depicting Armenian and Turkish atrocities and, hence, Armenians and Turks. The undeniable authority of this discursive regime is central to the resilience of Turkish denial today. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 758121435; 201056968
AB  - The present study compared effects of erotic and non-erotic depictions of male-male intimacy on the experience of anger in heterosexual men. Data came from three independent laboratory studies designed to elicit anger in response to erotic or non-erotic depictions of male-male and male-female intimacy. All participants completed a measure of sexual prejudice and anger was assessed before and after viewing the erotic or non-erotic video. Among high-prejudiced men, viewing erotic and non-erotic intimate behavior between two men elicited significant increases in anger relative to viewing comparable behavior between a male-female dyad. In contrast, among low-prejudiced men, viewing erotic, but not non-erotic, intimate behavior between two men elicited significant increases in anger relative to viewing comparable behavior between a male-female dyad. Implications for understanding heterosexual men's anger, and aggression, toward gay men were discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Circumventions and confrontations: Georg Simmel, Franz Boas and Arthur Ruppin and their responses to antisemitism
AN  - 743065997; 201043320
AB  - Focusing on Georg Simmel, Franz Boas and Arthur Ruppin, three prominent sociologists or anthropologists of German Jewish descent, Morris-Reich analyses their professional responses to antisemitism. He argues that there is a close relationship between their respective epistemic definitions of society and their suggested methods for the study of social phenomena, and the respective forms and registers of their responses to antisemitism. The three cases demonstrate a range of responses, from a strategy of circumventing antisemitism as a distinct phenomenon (Simmel), to one aimed at the transformation of antisemitism into a subset of a general category of prejudice (Boas), to a direct confrontation with antisemitism as a multifaceted phenomenon that possesses universal as well as particularistic aspects (Ruppin). The analysis implies that there is a negative correspondence between the respective responses and antisemitic discourses: Simmel's social theory did not engage with antisemitic writers directly; Boas attempted to undermine antisemitic writers by addressing the shortcomings of racist methodology; and Ruppin attacked antisemitic writers on what he viewed as empirical grounds, while sharing several of their epistemic assumptions.

T1  - The Moderating Roles of Gender and Anti-Gay Prejudice in Explaining Stigma by Association in Male Dyads
AN  - 964192147; 201207441
AB  - Using a convenience sample of 157 undergraduates, this study explored the likeability ratings of target characters from selected film clips who were described as gay or heterosexual as they associated with a gay-described foil character (i.e., a character against which the target is compared). As predicted, male respondents who strongly endorsed anti-gay prejudice viewed gay-described targets more favorably than heterosexual-described targets when each target was paired with a gay foil. Further, this pattern of biased ratings by high-prejudice male participants against our heterosexual target differentiated these participants from both low-prejudice male and high-prejudice female respondents. In contrast, but as hypothesized, high-prejudice female respondents compared to high-prejudice males rated heterosexual-described targets more favorably than they rated gay-described targets.

T1  - The self-regulation of prejudice: Toward understanding its lived character
AN  - 60361421; 201017591
AB  - Survey and laboratory studies provide support for the self-regulation of prejudice, but it is unclear whether people similarly self-regulate in'real life. Using a phenomenological approach, 153 non-Black participants recalled racial experiences in which they responded in ways they later wished had been different. Participants internally motivated to control prejudice reported discrepancies regardless of their external motivation, but even participants low on internal motivation reported prejudice-related discrepancies if they were externally motivated. Content analysis results are presented to summarize participants discrepancy experiences. Also, most participants discrepancies produced negative self-directed affect and the self-regulation of prejudice in the future. Findings suggest that self-regulation generalizes beyond the laboratory and occurs even among people who are not internally motivated to control their prejudice.

T1  - Willing and able: How internal motivation and failure help to overcome prejudice
AN  - 60354579; 201017461
AB  - Internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced reduces automatic and controlled prejudice. The present studies examined the impact of internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced on reactions to one s failure to behave nonprejudiced. In Study 1 higher levels of internal motivation led to more negative self-directed affect when failing to behave nonprejudiced, but not when failing in other domains. In Study 2 higher levels of internal motivation led to less prejudice after failure to behave nonprejudiced, but not in a non-failure condition. These findings suggest that failure to behave nonprejudiced plays a key role for highly internally motivated individuals in learning to regulate prejudice successfully.

AN  - 743055534; 201043260
AB  - Goldberg's essay is an extended response to five reviews of his recent book The Threat of Race contributed by Nadia Abu El-Haj, Susan Giroux, Kelly Gillespie, Nelson Maldonado-Torres and Peter Wade. Issues discussed range over the sadistic elements of racism's characteristic violence, the 'disappearance' or 'invisibility' of race and the impact on racisms, the distinction and relation between naturalism and historicism in racial articulation, and the connection to biologism and culturalism, racial epistemologies, racial coloniality and racial neoliberalism. The central theme of the book, the notion of racial neoliberalism, is elaborated and exemplified by reference to the characterization of Obama by some since he was elected president of the United States.
