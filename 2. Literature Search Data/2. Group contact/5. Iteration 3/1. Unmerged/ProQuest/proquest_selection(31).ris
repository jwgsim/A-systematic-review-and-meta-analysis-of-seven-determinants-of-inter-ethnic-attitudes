T1  - Heterosexual University Students’ Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Couples and Parents Across Seven European Countries
AN  - 2649844922
AB  - IntroductionThis research examined the general attitudes toward lesbian women and gay men (LG people), same-sex marriage (SSM), and LG parenting (LGP) in a large sample of young heterosexual European adults. We expected that one’s country of origin, gender role traditionalism, contact, and religiosity would predict their responses.MethodsWe conducted a large-scale study from April 2012 to November 2014. The sample consisted of 13,403 self-identified heterosexual students from Belgium, Italy, France, Portugal, Poland, Spain, and Greece (38.7% men and 61.2% women). The main research variables were general attitudes toward LG people, support for same-sex coupling and parenting, gender role traditionalism beliefs, frequency and quality of the contact with LG people, and religiosity.ResultsWe found that the attitudes toward these issues were significantly more negative in Poland and Greece than in the other countries included in the sample. In addition, these national differences were explained by psychological variables, mainly religiosity and general attitudes toward LG people. Although participants’ higher satisfaction levels regarding their contact with LG people and lower levels of gender role traditionalism were associated with positive attitudes toward SSM and parenting, these factors did not account for the attitudinal variability between these countries.ConclusionsAttitudes toward LG people are changing throughout Europe and are influenced by each country’s sociopolitical context. We highlight the societal importance of attitudes toward SSM and LG parenting and recommend facilitating positive social contact in universities and other settings to improve young adult heterosexuals’ attitudes.Policy ImplicationsThis study’s results can inform policies aiming to reduce inequality and develop more inclusive policies on same-sex parented families and couples.

T1  - Determinants of Individual Support for Independence: Evidence from Montenegro
AN  - 2658534049
AB  - This article investigates the determinants of individual support for independence in Montenegro. We outline five theoretically distinct groups of factors covered by the literature and evaluate their impact on individual preference for independence. Using observational data obtained from a nationally representative survey conducted in Montenegro in 2003–2004, we find support for several hypotheses, showing that identity, income, and partisanship significantly impact individual opinion about independence. We also investigate and discuss the relative effect size of different factors associated with preference for independence. Additionally, we test variables with hitherto unexplored implications for opinions on independence, including the impact of support for EU membership, as well as support for democratic principles. Our logistic regression analyses reveal that attitudes towards EU integration and minority rights are strongly associated with support for independence. By systematically analyzing existing and new hypotheses with data from an understudied case, our findings contribute to the nascent literature on individual preferences for independence.

T1  - Valuing diversity: An undervalued mediator of intergroup contact
AN  - 2654977240
AB  - Valuing diversity and intergroup contact predict less prejudice and discrimination, yet their relationship deserves closer attention. There is some evidence that valuing diversity and intergroup contact are associated, but it has not been tested whether the established effects of contact come about through changes in valuing diversity. We address this in two studies (total N = 2835) that consider valuing diversity as a mediator of intergroup contact. They show that valuing diversity mediates the relationships of intergroup contact with prejudice, bystander intervention intentions, policy support and approach intentions. Our results increase the understanding of pathways from intergroup contact to intergroup relations and offer a lever that contact interventions can target.

T1  - The Psychological Well-Being of Older Chinese Immigrants in Canada amidst COVID-19: The Role of Loneliness, Social Support, and Acculturation
AN  - 2694008228
AB  - This study examined the effects of loneliness, social support, and acculturation on psychological well-being, as indexed by general emotional well-being and life satisfaction, of older Chinese adults living in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 168 older Chinese adults, recruited via WeChat and the internet, completed an online study through a facilitated Zoom or phone meeting, or through a website link, individually or in a group. The testing package included demographic information, The UCLA Loneliness Scale, The Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale, Vancouver Index of Acculturation, The Satisfaction with Life Scale, and The World Health Organization’s Five Well-Being Index. The results showed that the psychological well-being (both general emotional well-being and cognitively perceived life satisfaction) was positively predicted by perceived social support but negatively predicted by loneliness. Acculturation was not predictive of both outcomes, and it did not moderate the predictive relationships of social support or loneliness. The results shed light on the importance of community services that target enhancing social support and reducing loneliness in promoting psychological well-being of older Chinese immigrants in Canada amidst and post the pandemic.

T1  - Health Service Accessibility, Mental Health, and Changes in Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Older Adults
AN  - 2649020697
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the access of older adults to health services. The two objectives of this study are understanding the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults’ access to health services and exploring how health service accessibility during the pandemic influenced older adults’ mental health and self-reported changes in behavior. This study included 346 older adults. Content analysis produced five themes: (1) decreased physical accessibility to health care providers (78%); (2) increased use of online health services and other virtual health care (69%); (3) growth in the online prescription of medication (67%); (4) difficulty obtaining information and accessing non-communicable disease and mental health indicators (65%); and (5) postponement of medical specialist consultations (51%). Regarding mental health, three themes emerged: (1) increased symptoms of anxiety, distress, and depression (89%); (2) the experience of traumatic situations (61%); and (3) the augmented use of alcohol or drugs (56%). Finally, the following changes in behavior were indicated: (1) frustrated behavior (92%); (2) emotional explosions (79%); and (3) changes in sleeping and eating behaviors (43%). Access to health services may have influenced the mental health and behavior of older adults, hence interventions in a pandemic must address their interactions with health services, their needs, and their well-being.

T1  - Effects of the Early Phase of COVID-19 on the Autistic Community in Sweden: A Qualitative Multi-Informant Study Linking to ICF
AN  - 2627552597
AB  - While the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, early outcome studies indicate severe and pervasive global effects of the pandemic and associated measures to prevent the spread of the virus. General population studies, as well as insight into the outcomes for particular groups, will be necessary in order to mitigate potentially long-term effects as well as to prepare for future epidemics or pandemics. The pandemic conditions have been marked by rapid and abrupt changes and unpredictability which are circumstances that leave the autistic population particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes following the distinctive features of the diagnosis. Studies are only beginning to delineate the outcomes of the global autism community and the present study adds to these findings by providing a local, multi-perspective, qualitative analysis of the lived experiences of the Swedish autism community. In this study, autistic youth and adults, caregivers of autistic individuals, as well as representatives of Swedish interest organizations were interviewed. Thematic analysis was performed on the population as a whole and patterns of results were formalized according to the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF-CY). Participants report wide-ranging adverse outcomes of the pandemic relating to mental health and access to support, participation in daily activities and socialization, education, and work as well as parental resources. However, participants also report positive outcomes relating to a reduction in specific social and everyday demands, and normalization of lived experiences. Additionally, interviews outlined some strategies used to cope during pandemic conditions. Implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - The Different Faces of Social Tolerance: Conceptualizing and Measuring Respect and Coexistence Tolerance
AN  - 2594368934
AB  - In the theoretical literature on tolerance a distinction is proposed between coexistence and respect tolerance. In three studies with four national samples of Dutch majority members, we demonstrate that these two forms of tolerance can be distinguished empirically in relation to different immigrant target groups. The findings of all studies further show that the more principled respect tolerance was negatively associated with prejudice towards immigrants, and positively associated with the acceptance of concrete minority practices, above and beyond prejudice. However, the positive association between respect tolerance and acceptance of practices was weaker for people who were more strongly concerned about the continuity of their national cultural identity. Overall, the more pragmatic coexistence tolerance was found to have no independent association with prejudicial feelings and with the acceptance of minority practices. The findings indicate that stimulating respect tolerance might be particularly helpful for improving intergroup relations in culturally diverse societies.

T1  - Formation and Benefits of Intercultural Friendships: The Role of Communication
AN  - 2686235427
AB  - This qualitative study provides novel insights into exploring factors that influence intercultural friendship formation and friendship benefits, focusing on the role of communication. A research gap has been addressed by focusing on Muslim women who wear the hijab and exploring what factors had influenced their friendship formation with people from culturally different backgrounds and what impact the friendship had on the self. Findings suggested that cultural, linguistic and religious similarity was deemed as not important for friendship formation. Instead, similar values, self-disclosure and respectful communication assisted intercultural friendship formation. Friendship barriers included cultural misconceptions and behavioral uncertainty. Clear evidence emerged that these intercultural friendships led to positive attitudinal changes of the individuals within and beyond the friendship. This included increased cultural understanding, acceptance and selfreflection. It was revealed that cultural misconceptions (and levels of Islamophobia) were eliminated and ethnocentrism was reduced.

T1  - A video intervention for every straight man: The role of preattitudes and emotions in vicarious-contact effects: GPIR
AN  - 2573357340
AB  - Research has shown that vicarious contact can help to reduce prejudice. We tested the effect of a controlled, video-based vicarious-contact intervention on straight men’s (implicit and explicit) attitudes toward gay men. Findings of Experiment 1 (n = 99 German participants) failed to show direct effects but were in line with the idea that negative (situation-specific) emotions mediate the intervention effect. Experiment 2 (n = 108 U.S. participants) expanded findings: straight men with antigay preattitudes reported less negative intergroup emotions toward gay men after watching the vicarious-contact video (compared to the control condition); and less negative intergroup emotions were related to more positive attitudes toward gay men. For straight men with positive preattitudes, findings were in line with the hypothesis that positive intergroup emotions toward gay men were the relevant mediator. We discuss the moderating role of preattitudes to explain processes underlying vicarious-contact effects.

T1  - Three clusters of content-audience associations in expression of racial prejudice while consuming online television news
AN  - 2554597182
AB  - It is well investigated that the expression of racial prejudice is often induced by news coverage on the internet, and the exposure to media contributes to the cultivation of long-term prejudice. However, there is a lack of information regarding the immediate effects of news delivered through television or television-like media on the expression of racial prejudice. This study provides a framework for understanding such effects by focusing on content-audience associations using the logs of an “online television” service, which provides television-like content and user experiences. With these logs, we found an association between the news-watching and comment-posting behaviors. Consequently, logs relevant to two distinct forms of racism, modern and old-fashioned racism, were extracted. Using mathematical modeling, which considers the different levels of program inducements to racist expression, personal inclinations of audiences to racism, and certainty of prediction of audience behaviors, we found three associative patterns between the news programs and audiences. The relevance of the topics covered to the basic beliefs of each form of racism was characterized into three clusters: expression as a reaction to news that is directly relevant to the basic beliefs of racism with weak inducements by non-bigots, minority abuse by distorting the meanings of news content indirectly relevant to the beliefs but with strong inducements by audiences with a strong bias, and racial toxic opinions independent of the news content by clear bigots. Our findings provide implications for inhibiting the expression of online prejudice based on the characteristics of these patterns.

T1  - 40 Years of Multiple Social Categorization: A Tool for Social Inclusivity
AN  - 2522250449
AB  - We review a 40-year corpus of research that we collectively name “Multiple Categorisation Theory” (MCT). From early illustrations using the minimal group paradigm, through a focus on how people cognitively represent social diversity, to recent models of outgroup “re-humanisation”, this work has revealed much about how we think about inclusivity, exclusion, and intergroup differences. We review research that assessed ways to reduce intergroup bias by attenuating the reliance on simple categorisation via “crossed categorisation”. We describe how this research evolved from a focus on intergroup differences to incorporate self-categorisation, through processes of decategorisation and increased social identity complexity. Finally, we consider contemporary models that reveal the generalised benefits of multiple categorisation in promoting outgroup “re-humanisation” through “cognitive liberalisation”. We conclude by highlighting the theoretical and practical implications of this research programme.

T1  - Direct and Moderating Effects of Sexual Minority Identity Dimensions on Mental Health
AN  - 2515169398
AB  - Sexual minorities experience minority stress, which is associated with mental health disparities. However, specific dimensions of identity may buffer against these disparities. While research in other stigmatized populations has found evidence for direct and moderating effects of identity on mental health, limited research has examined these dimensions in sexual minorities. We explored the potential direct and moderating effects of identity dimensions with regards to sexual stigma and mental health. Findings from 209 lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals revealed higher centrality of sexual orientation identity and more positive private regard predicted lower psychological distress and more positive private regard predicted higher self-esteem. Additionally, centrality moderated the effect of public stigma, such that those who reported higher centrality did not report decrements to self-esteem in the face of public stigma to the extent of those with low centrality. Findings suggest centrality and private regard contribute to the psychological wellbeing of sexual minorities.

T1  - Fundamentally uncaring: The differential multi-scalar impacts of COVID-19 in the U.S
AN  - 2533798587
AB  - 2020 in the United States was marked by two converging crises-the COVID-19 pandemic and the large-scale uprisings in support of Black lives. These crises were met with both a counterproductive and inadequate response from the federal government. We examine these converging crises at the individual, social, and political scales. The biological realities of COVID-19 impact different populations in widely varied ways-the poor, the elderly, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and those living with comorbidities get sick and die at the highest rates. Social distancing guidelines shifted millions of people to work-from-home and millions more lost their jobs, even as care laborers, preponderantly women, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, were asked to put their and their loved ones' lives on the line for the continuation of all of our lives. These biological, social, and economic crises have been punctuated by civil unrest, as millions took to the streets for racial justice, noting the unequal impacts of the pandemic. These converging crises have laid bare decades of neoliberal and neoconservative policies and ideologies, undergirded as they have been by racial capitalism, for their fundamental uncaringness. In this paper, we argue that this pandemic not only made a wider population more acutely aware of the necessity and importance of the need to care and for caring labors, but also that we stand at the precipice of potentiality-of producing a more caring society. To frame our argument, we draw on Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Margaret Lock's (1987) framework of three bodies-individual, social, and political-to unpack the multi-scalar entanglements in the differential impacts of COVID-19, questions of care, and their articulation in the current political-economic context.

T1  - Estimating Economic Losses Caused by COVID-19 under Multiple Control Measure Scenarios with a Coupled Infectious Disease—Economic Model: A Case Study in Wuhan, China
AN  - 2602078711
AB  - Background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic has caused an unprecedented public health crisis and drastically impacted the economy. The relationship between different control measures and economic losses becomes a research hotspot. Methods: In this study, the SEIR infectious disease model was revised and coupled with an economic model to quantify this nonlinear relationship in Wuhan. The control measures were parameterized into two factors: the effective number of daily contacts (people) (r); the average waiting time for quarantined patients (day) (g). Results: The parameter r has a threshold value that if r is less than 5 (people), the number of COVID-19 infected patients is very close to 0. A “central valley” around r = 5~6 can be observed, indicating an optimal control measure to reduce economic losses. A lower value of parameter g is beneficial to stop COVID-19 spread with a lower economic cost. Conclusion: The simulation results demonstrate that implementing strict control measures as early as possible can stop the spread of COVID-19 with a minimal economic impact. The quantitative assessment method in this study can be applied in other COVID-19 pandemic areas or countries.

T1  - Whose lives mattered? How White and Black Americans felt about Black Lives Matter in 2016
AN  - 2533412241
AB  - White Americans, on average, do not support Black Lives Matter, while Black Americans generally express strong support. The lack of support among white Americans is striking, and we argue that it matters why this racial gap exists. Using a nationally representative survey collected during the crest of the first wave of widespread attention to the movement, we explore four potential explanations for interracial differences in feelings toward Black Lives Matter. These explanations reflect competing claims made by advocates and opponents of the movement and have distinct implications for understanding the meaning of these racial differences. Two explanations focus on attitudes toward the police, and two focus on racial prejudice. The results suggest that interracial differences in contact with the police mattered to views of the movement, though in opposite ways for white and Black Americans. Support for the movement among Black Americans was not motivated by an animosity toward the police. Ultimately, the lack of white support for Black Lives Matter was best explained by anti-Black animus and racial resentment, reflecting a concern about the threat this contemporary civil rights movement presents to the racial status quo.

T1  - ‘They’re discriminated against, but so are we’: White Australian‐born perceptions of ingroup and immigrant discrimination over time are not zero sum
AN  - 2474519638
AB  - We examined whether zero‐sum thinking explains White Australian‐born people’s majority‐culture perceptions of discrimination towards their ingroup and an outgroup (immigrants), and the relationships among perceived discrimination and support for multiculturalism and immigration. Two correlational cross‐sectional studies were conducted among self‐identified White Australians (Study 1, N = 517), and White Americans (Study 2, N = 273), as well as an experiment among White Australians (Study 3, N = 121) in which we manipulated discrimination towards immigrants over time. Our findings did not support a zero‐sum account but revealed that perceptions of group discrimination were positively correlated: a case of ‘they’re discriminated against, but so are we’ rather than ‘if they gain, we lose’. Moreover, concerns about future discrimination of the ingroup were most predictive of opposition to multicultural policy and immigration. We argue our findings are more consistent with a competitive victimhood account of intergroup relations than a zero‐sum thinking account.

T1  - Naturalism's International Identity: Anti-Semitism, Alienation, and Women's Writing
AN  - 2556881135
AB  - The author's stance against anti-Semitism is somewhat counterbalanced, however, by assertions of biological determinism and racialist science. Zola claims that certain ethnic groups in this case, the Jews-have differently shaped skulls, reflecting at least in part the social Darwinist discourse of his day. This complicated response to the Jewish question is also at the core of American naturalist fiction. Donald Pizers seminal study Naturalism and the Jews (2008) examines the nativist representation of Jewish stereotypes in the work of Willa Cather, Theodore Dreiser, Hamlin Garland, Edith Wharton, and others. These authors, whose writings represent a wide range of regional settings, have become part of the naturalist canon (along with the literature of Kate Chopin, Stephen Crane, and Rebecca Harding Davis, among others). This "canonical" naturalism, Pizer argues, is identified with anti-Semitic rhetoric; specifically, he examines a prevailing negative attitude, in turn-of-the-century America, toward Jews living primarily in cities, and he shows how the language of naturalist novelists can perpetuate this racist ideology. Furthermore, Pizer looks particularly at the latter by giving attention to depictions of the Jew as an animal. While his work considers major naturalist authors, it does not extend to some of the period's less canonical voices.

T1  - Alone Together: Intimacy and Semi-Mobility during Ho Chi Minh City's Lockdown
AN  - 2488185532
AB  - In this article, based on my ethnographic experience of Ho Chi Minh City's lockdown, I argue that COVID-19 acted as an accelerator of intimacies, allowing people to negotiate alternative forms of sociality both within and outside the domestic space. On the one hand, by confining people at home it brought to light social and housing inequalities in urban Vietnam. On the other, it forced people to find imaginative ways to cope with social-distancing protocols. Since mobility during lockdown was limited, the normatively private space of the house became an incubator for social life, affording people – even those outside the circle of close friends and relatives – the opportunity to be alone together, sharing their temporary stuckness to challenge normative patterns of intimacy and sexuality.

T1  - Social Estrangement and Psychological Distress before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Patterns of Change in Canadian Workers
AN  - 2468581706
AB  - This article argues that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures intended to slow the rate of transmission of the virus resulted in greater subjective isolation and community distrust, in turn adversely impacting psychological distress. To support this argument, we examine data from the Canadian Quality of Work and Economic Life Study, two national surveys of Canadian workers—one from late September 2019 (N = 2,477) and the second from mid-March 2020 (N = 2,446). Analyses show that subjective isolation and community distrust increased between the two surveys, which led to a substantial rise in psychological distress. Increases in subjective isolation were stronger in older respondents, resulting in a greater escalation in psychological distress. These findings support a Durkheimian perspective on the harm to social integration and mental health caused by periods of rapid social change but also illustrate how a life course context can differentiate individual vulnerability to disintegrative social forces.

T1  - The effects of direct and indirect contact on prejudice: 2007 and 2017 results among Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots
AN  - 2466209165
AB  - In post-conflict and segregated societies, overcoming high prejudice between groups is essential for peaceful coexistence. In this paper, we explore the roles of direct contact (face-to-face contact and cross-group friendship) and indirect contact (extended cross-group friendship) in reducing prejudice between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots living in Cyprus. Moreover, this study further explores whether the effects of direct and indirect contact vary between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, as well as across a ten-year period. To explore these issues, we analyze data from different representative samples of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots at two different time points (years 2007 and 2017). The results suggest that all three forms of contact have significant effects on prejudice. However, they also exhibit some variations by community (but not year of data collection) in the effects of direct (but not indirect) contact on prejudice.

T1  - ‘When the walls come tumbling down’: The role of intergroup proximity, threat, and contact in shaping attitudes towards the removal of Northern Ireland’s peace walls
AN  - 2448123181
AB  - Institutional structures of segregation typically entrench social inequality and sustain wider patterns of intergroup conflict and discrimination. However, initiatives to dismantle such structures may provoke resistance. Executive proposals to dismantle Northern Ireland’s peace walls by 2023 provide a compelling case study of the nature of such resistance and may thus provide important clues about how it might be overcome. Drawing on a field survey conducted in north Belfast (n = 488), this research explored the role of physical proximity, realistic and symbolic threat, and past experiences of positive and negative cross‐community contact on Catholic and Protestant residents’ support for removing the walls. Structural equation modelling suggested that both forms of contact and proximity were significantly related to such support and that these relationships were partially mediated by realistic threat. It also suggested that positive contact moderated the effects of proximity. That is, for residents who had more frequent positive interactions with members of the other community, proximity to a peace wall had a weaker relationship with resistance to their removal than residents who had less frequent contact.

T1  - Unemployment and social stigma: Naming, blaming and shaming of educated youth in rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan
TT  - Unemployment and social stigma
AN  - 2416093008
AB  - PurposeThis article aims to highlight the stigmatization attached to the unemployment of educated youth in rural regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.Design/methodology/approachThe study explicates the subjective experiences of the youth as being unemployed and societal attitudes toward them through an in-depth qualitative approach. A total of 30 unemployed male individuals were interviewed through an interview guide.FindingsThe study reveals that unemployed individuals are stigmatized and discriminately treated. They experience the difference in social support from their family and friends during unemployment, which is a discouraging aspect. This finding is in contrast to the existing literature on the subject in which family and friends are described as a major source of social support. As the study is conducted in the rural context, it is observed that local factors coupled with the joint family system have intensified negative attitudes toward the unemployed youth. Subsequently, the negative societal treatment serves as a factor for psychological challenges in their lives.Originality/valueThis article serves the need of exploring the experiences of unemployed individuals precisely in the Pakistani context.

T1  - Stigma towards psychosis: Cross‐cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination in White British and South Asians
AN  - 2381929623
AB  - Public stigma towards people with mental health problems has been demonstrated in Western societies. Little is known about non‐Western cultures and whether cultures differ in their perceptions of people with mental health problems. Aim of this study was to examine cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination towards people with psychosis. Participants were from White British and South Asian backgrounds (N = 128, aged 16–20 years) recruited from two schools and colleges in the United Kingdom. They completed a cross‐sectional survey on affective, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions of stigma. Results revealed significant cultural differences on all three stigma dimensions. South Asians attributed higher anger (prejudice) and dangerousness (stereotypes) to people with psychosis than White British. They also reported lower willingness to help, greater avoidance, and higher endorsement of segregation (discrimination). The effects of ethnic group on helping intentions, avoidance, and segregation endorsement were mediated by anger and by dangerousness. Understanding cultural differences in stigma towards psychosis will be important for designing stigma interventions as well as treatments for people with different cultural backgrounds.

T1  - The Complexity of Policy Preferences: Examining Self-interest, Group-Interest, and Race Consciousness Across Race and Political Ideology
AN  - 2354925858
AB  - Research on attitudes toward racial policies has often been limited to a single racial group (e.g., either Whites or Blacks). These studies often focus on the role of self-interest, group-interest, and race consciousness, but this work has operationalized these concepts in different ways when studying White or Black respondents. Using data from a study in which Whites and Blacks living in Chicago were asked their attitudes toward affirmative action, we build on this body of research by using common measures of self-reported self-interest, group-interest, and race consciousness to predict support for affirmative action. We also examine whether the effects of these determinants are moderated by political ideology. We find that self-reported self-interest influences support for affirmative action among Black conservatives, but not among other respondents. Self-reported group-interest, however, has significant effects that differ between Blacks and Whites and across liberals, moderates, and conservatives. We also find that race consciousness affects respondents’ attitudes toward affirmative action, but that this effect is moderated by political ideology.

T1  - When integration policies shape the impact of intergroup contact on threat perceptions: a multilevel study across 20 European countries
AN  - 2376776526
AB  - There is ample evidence of the beneficial effects of intergroup contact in reducing negative attitudes towards immigrants. Although the valuable role of institutional support, one of the initial optimal conditions for contact, has been demonstrated, the impact of actual immigration integration policies, as a manifestation of institutional support, remains unknown. In the current study, we examine how country-level migrant integration policies, assessed by the MIPEX indicator, shape the relationship between everyday contact and threat perceptions associated to immigration. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted with European Social Survey Round 7 data from 20 European countries (N = 32,093 citizens). Everyday contact was related to less symbolic and realistic threat perceptions. Moreover, on the country level, tolerant policies (a high MIPEX score) were related to higher everyday contact and lower symbolic threat perceptions. Confirming that institutional support facilitates the effects of contact, a cross-level interaction revealed that the link between everyday contact and symbolic threat was stronger in high rather than low MIPEX countries. The pattern of results was partially replicated when contact quality and cross-group friendships were assessed, though integration policies did not moderate the effects of these intergroup contact measures. These findings extend the body of multilevel contact research and are crucial for application as they show that integration policies have the potential to guide national majority members’ perceptions regarding immigrants.

T1  - Voting Can Be Hard, Information Helps
AN  - 2319179267
AB  - Many U.S. elections provide voters with precious little information about candidates on the ballot. In local contests, party labels are often absent. In primary elections, party labels are not useful. Indeed, much of the time, voters have only the name of the candidate to go by. In these contexts, how do voters make decisions? Using several experiments, we find that voters use candidates’ race, ethnicity, and gender as cues for whom to support—penalizing candidates of color and benefiting women. But we also demonstrate that providing even a small amount of information to voters—such as candidate occupation—virtually erases the effects of candidate demographics on voter behavior, even among voters with high levels of racial and gender prejudice.

T1  - Challenges to Traditional Narratives of Intractable Conflict Decrease Ingroup Glorification
AN  - 2310600909
AB  - Conflict narratives are cornerstones of group identity, but often facilitate violence by framing the group’s actions in ways that foster defensive forms of group identification (i.e., glorification). Three experiments tested whether alternative narratives inclusive of the ingroup’s and the adversarial group’s suffering can reduce glorification. Israeli Jews (Study 1) and Americans (Study 2) reported less glorification after reading inclusive narratives rather than narratives that dismiss the outgroup’s suffering. Study 3 found that through reducing glorification, inclusive narratives indirectly weakened support for retributive justice and militaristic policies and strengthened support for reconciliation. These effects were specific to people high in both (preexisting) glorification and attachment—people identified by prior research as the strongest supporters of violent approaches to conflict. These findings suggest that alternative narratives can reduce glorification by challenging the myopic focus of traditional conflict narratives on ingroup victimization, helping societies move beyond intractable conflict toward lasting peace.

T1  - The Persuasive Power of Protest. How Protest wins Public Support
AN  - 2447242240
AB  - How do protest actions succeed in winning public support? In this paper, I theorize how features of protest can persuade citizens to support demonstrators. In particular, I argue that broadcasting an attractive collective identity by means of diverse, worthy, united, numerous and committed participants (dWUNC) triggers supportive reactions of observers through increasing identification with protesters. I test this argument by exposing respondents to manipulated television news items of a protest event in two video vignette experiments. Study 1 scrutinizes the effect of dWUNC displays in an asylum seeker demonstration on a sample of Belgian citizens. Study 2 replicates this design in the US for the Black Lives Matter issue of police brutality. Both studies show predispositions of citizens to strongly affect favorability towards protesters. On top of these potent receiver effects, however, also the dWUNC features prove persuasive. In both experiments, a consistent pattern of feature effects is found: demonstrations that mobilized more diverse participants, who behaved worthy and acted in unison, elicited more supportive reactions. Study 2 adds that these protest feature effects are in part mediated by increasing identification with the demonstrators. The heterogeneity of protest feature effects is explored.

T1  - 'We can't just put any belly-dancer into the program': cultural activism as boundary work in the city of Bratislava
AN  - 2261199466
AB  - Festivals are an increasingly more popular form of contemporary cultural activism. Countering prejudice through arts, using culture as a tool of communication, and creating an opportunity for marginalised groups to participate in public life, they represent a specific and novel means of civic activism. In this paper, I introduce a case study of the multicultural festival [fjúzn], aiming to enhance the public visibility of 'new minorities' and bring attention to the ethnic and cultural diversity in the city of Bratislava, Slovakia. Building on a festival ethnography and drawing on the perspective of boundary work [Jaworsky, B. Nadya. 2016. The Boundaries of Belonging: Online Work of Immigration-related Social Movement Organizations. Palgrave Macmillan], I show how the festival organisers work towards crossing and blurring symbolic boundaries in society. I offer a close interpretive reading of their attempts at capturing public places and cultivating a diverse language-scape, while showing how they simultaneously maintain, solidify, or even inscribe new boundaries. I conclude by raising critical points about the potential of activist cultural festivals to shift symbolic boundaries in the long run and serve as tools of social inclusion.

T1  - Patriarchy, Cultural Prejudices and Spousal Violence in the Ancient City of Benin of Southern Nigeria
AN  - 2292912965
AB  - This paper examines the persistence of patriarchy and traditional cultural practices which have adverse effects on women's rights and health as well as the growing incidence of spousal violence in Benin City, arising from obvious internal and external factors of social changes. Extant literature has documented shifts in family roles and general social transformations in many first world nations as a result of modernization. Efforts to capture such changes within the African space is very minimal as of now. This paper attempts to explore the Benin society of Southern Nigeria, against the backdrop of the cascading effects of human trafficking and international migration that has largely impacted on the contemporary social structure of the ancient West African city. It addresses the nature of patriarchy in relation to Benin society, discusses some of the customs and traditions that have put women in positions of inferiority. This paper concludes that patriarchy, and other cultural prejudices have the potentialities of further deepening the incidences of spousal abuse and family disorganization if efforts are not made to abolish all harmful cultural practices and enforce the legal provisions which protect women's rights and general wellbeing.

T1  - Examining the racial-ethnic continuum and perceptions of police misconduct
AN  - 2258621443
AB  - Some research suggests a racial-ethnic hierarchy exists as to perceptions of police, with African-Americans exhibiting the most negative attitudes, Whites the most positive, and Hispanics holding more intermediate attitudes. Other findings regarding Hispanics are less consistent and little study has been made of Asians. This study further tests the premise for such a hierarchy by examining the views of both Hispanics and Asians alongside those of African-Americans and Whites as they relate to police misconduct. Partial support for a hierarchy of attitudes was found, with Hispanics exhibiting the hypothesised intermediate attitudes. While race remained an important factor for explaining African-Americans' attitudes, other factors ultimately better explained Hispanics' attitudes. The attitudes of Asians were indistinguishable from those of Whites. These findings suggest the experiences of racial-ethnic groups widely vary and the premise of a racial-ethnic continuum may be too simplistic for understanding the attitudes of Asians and Hispanics.

T1  - Uncovering the Citizenship Effect: The Impact of Citizenship Status on Federal Sentencing Outcomes
AN  - 2426551259
AB  - Scholarly literature on racial disparíties has only recently begun to examine the interaction of race/ethnicity and citizenship status in the criminal justice system. Through the use of measures of ethnic threat, the current study expands the research on citizenship and sentencing by examining if outcomes differ according to the local population. Using federal sentencing and district-level data, we estimate the effect of the interaction between citizenship status and ethnicity on sentencing outcomes. Results indicate that individuals who are both Hispanic and non-U.S. citizens receive significantly harsher punishments than U.S. citizens, regardless of ethnic threat at the district level.

T1  - Plural Belongings: Mothering Co-resident Children Post-migration in the USA
AN  - 2266690833
AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new ‘here’. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers’ experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women’s mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers’ experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant’s needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms.

T1  - Persuasion and ballot initiatives: how persuasive were the televised campaign ads on same-sex marriage?
AN  - 2571083685
AB  - Initiative campaigns, unlike candidate-centered elections, are efforts to mobilize and persuade residents of state and local governments on specific policies. Previous studies have conflicting findings whether or not initiative campaigns can persuade voters. For issues like same-sex marriage, voters may be even more difficult to persuade because their attitudes may be crystallized. Four states voted on marriage equality in November 2012, which resulted in historic victories for the proponents of same-sex marriage. This led to a belief that the marriage equality campaigns won because of their strategic communications. I examine the effect of televised campaign ads on people’s attitudes toward same-sex marriage by combining market-advertising data from the 2012 campaigns and a rolling cross-sectional national survey. Media markets that spill over into neighboring states are analyzed as a natural experiment, isolating the effect of televised advertisements from other campaign efforts. The results suggest that people were greatly affected by campaign ads aired by the groups opposed to marriage equality, and the ads in favor of marriage equality were ineffective. When competing sides are framing the rights of sexual and gender minorities, those opposed retain an unequal advantage in changing the minds of the public through televised media.

T1  - Broadening the individual differences lens on party support and voting behavior: Cynicism and prejudice as relevant attitudes referring to modern‐day political alignments
AN  - 2171671235
AB  - Social‐cultural and economic‐hierarchical ideological attitudes have long been used to explain variation in political partisanship. We propose two additional, stable attitudes (political cynicism and ethnic prejudice) that may help in explaining contemporary political alignments. In a Belgian (N = 509) and Dutch sample (N = 628), we showed that party support can be segmented into four broad families: left, libertarian, traditionalist, and far‐right parties. Both studies revealed that social‐cultural and economic‐hierarchical right‐wing attitudes were negatively related to left party support and positively to libertarian, traditionalist and far‐right support. Importantly, additional variance was consistently explained by political cynicism (lower libertarian and traditionalist support), ethnic prejudice (lower left support), or both (higher far‐right support). Study 2 additionally demonstrated these patterns for self‐reported voting.

T1  - The formation of aggregate expectations: wisdom of the crowds or media influence?
AN  - 2178493778
AB  - The general elections of 2015 in Spain were elections of change. Two new parties for which voters had no previous historical reference points burst onto the parliamentary scene. Two (partially) opposed theories vie to offer an explanation as to how voters build their aggregate electoral expectations. In this paper, we investigate which mechanism has the greatest influence on the formation of expectations: published opinion or social interactions. Likewise, we also study if there is an ideological bias in the voters' perception of the future results of the electoral battle. Based on analysis of microdata from a survey (sample size = 14,262) conducted in Spain on the occasion of the general elections of 2015, we provide evidence: firstly, that the published surveys are the main source used by voters to configure their aggregate expectations; and secondly, that the interpretation and projection that voters make about reality is not neutral, but strongly influenced by their own beliefs and preferences.

These findings support the intergroup anxiety model, which suggests that following an anxiety-inducing threatening experience, outgroup evaluations can amplify emotional reactions and stress. In this study, we investigated whether threatened participants who derogated would show higher cortisol levels. Canadian undergraduates (N = 169) read either a threatening or favourable passage about Canadians. They then engaged in either a linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) or control task. Salivary samples were collected prethreat, postthreat, and posttask. The results suggest that ingroup threat was associated with increases in cortisol levels. Threatened participants who displayed LIB showed higher cortisol levels than those who were threatened and did not show LIB. These findings illustrate the importance of incorporating a neuroscientific approach.

T1  - Constructing Critical Conversations in Social Work Supervision: Creating Change
AN  - 2113981423
AB  - Clinical social work supervision is not immune to enactments of racial and social injustice, prejudice, power and privilege rampant in our social environment and institutions. These dynamics are active in all social interactions. Most often felt on impact, these remain underground and unevenly experienced—though predominantly by people representing intersecting marginalized identities. Such real enactments can be misunderstood or avoided in social work supervision. Negative consequences not only impede learning for the supervisee and supervisor, and affect clinical understanding of client care they also perpetuate injustice based on power and social locations. Social work supervision provides space for critical analysis to identify and alter dynamics of power, privilege, and social oppression. The critical conversations (CC) model provides a framework to illuminate and examine power dynamics in order to produce change with parallel insight and action—supervisee, supervisor, and client care. Supervisee and supervisor gain capacity to engage in reflection, examine personal and professional values, hold tension and tolerate ambiguity, use one self critically, articulate ideas and insights thoughtfully and effectively, as well as inform clinical understanding of clients. The need for critical dialogue in social work supervision regarding dynamics of sameness, differences, intersectional identities, power and privilege is emphasized. Theoretical grounding is offered to elucidate how complex structural forces of oppression and privilege, cultural patterns and narratives are internalized. A definition of CC, its theoretical underpinnings and the CC model are presented with a case scenario to illuminate the application of the CC model in clinical supervision.

T1  - Culturally aware but not yet ready to teach the “others”
AN  - 2151179051
AB  - PurposeIn this paper, the authors focus on a professional development programme in Cyprus aiming to enhance teachers’ intercultural understanding, awareness and competencies. This paper aims to focus on trainers’ and teacher trainees’ reflections upon a teacher professional development programme in the primary school in Cyprus with the largest number of Roma children.Design/methodology/approachThe training was provided by a small team of six trainers. Immediately after each training session, each trainer participated in an interview, while three of the trainers participated also in a focus-group interview at the end of the training. The trainers’ data were complemented by semi-structured interviews with a number of trainees either before or after the training. All interviews were transcribed, while interview questions comprised the framework for the qualitative analysis. The findings are presented by means of content analysis which formed the basis for emerging themes.FindingsThe authors claim that trainee teachers appeared culturally aware and sensitive, as well as knowledgeable about intercultural education; furthermore, they seemed to implement different teaching methodologies and curriculum interventions to support Roma children’s inclusion in the local school community. At the same time, they seemed to adopt instrumental approaches towards the content and purpose of the programme, seeking explicit instructional guidelines, plans and heuristics to deal with Roma inclusion. Considering the mis-recognition of teachers’ efforts by stakeholders outside the school and the expectations of the educational authorities – voiced via their school inspectors – teachers desperately asserted the need for tangible strategies to help them cope with difference in their classrooms.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors argue that such professional development programmes should aim at facing, deconstructing and bringing to the fore prejudices and discrimination against the Other/s by valuing teachers, first, as reflective individuals and, second, as professionals with their own cultural backgrounds and identities, on which any training programme, of the kind presented in this paper, could start from and build on.Practical implicationsEven though there is no tailored magic recipe to make teachers’ daily professional enterprise in multicultural settings easy, to help teachers master the necessary knowledge, skills and confidence, the authors suggest that training should be directly linked to classroom practice and acknowledge stress and helplessness that accompany work in multicultural school settings.Social implicationsThe inclusion strategy in many educational systems needs to become more comprehensive to cope with varying sources of social exclusion, faced by vulnerable groups of a different cultural background, such as Roma. Teacher training thus needs to meet the challenges of working in a diverse and multicultural environment in general and with Roma children in particular. In view of the multicultural character of local societies, a more critically oriented humanistic education is needed based on tolerance and understanding.Originality/valueThe limited participation of Roma in the school system could be related to teachers’ (mis)conceptions about the Roma culture and that the widely different ways in which Roma relate to schooling are often disregarded by the school.

T1  - SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS IN THE FRENCH TRENCHES
AN  - 2091590601
AB  - The First World War has been described as an exceptional moment of comradeship, so great that it was able to break even the strongest class barriers. Were social distances and class hierarchies temporarily forgotten or abolished for the millions of Frenchmen of diverse origins who were called to arms in defense of their country? The article is about this novel experiment, provoking encounters and contacts on a huge scale and often for the first time, between an overwhelming majority of manual workers and petty employees of humble extraction, and a small number of bourgeois and intellectuals. It tells the story of the discovery, by the French bourgeoisie of the Belle Epoque, of the ordinary people who fought in the trenches.

T1  - The Cultural-Cognitive Mapping of Scientific Professions
AN  - 2042481769
AB  - Even with widespread interest, public perceptions of science remain understudied and poorly theorized by social scientists. A central issue has been the persistent assumption that publics require a base of scientific knowledge for science to have broad cultural meaning. Yet, recent advances in cultural and cognitive sociology point to alternative research programs seeking to identify how publics come to understand complex and uncertain issues, when information is incomplete and asymmetric. We use this approach to analyze data on public perceptions of how scientific different fields are from the 2006 and 2012 National Science Foundation’s Science and Technology Survey. Our multivariate analyses allow us to approximate how mass publics map the social space of scientific professions, while accounting for individuals’ social location and cultural identity (e.g., race, class, gender, age, scientific sophistication, and political ideology). We then focus our attention on public perceptions of sociology and economics. Overall, we find that public perceptions, rather than being disorganized, map onto recognizable dimensions indicating how publics distinguish between scientific professions.

T1  - Development of Militaristic Attitudes Scale and Its Associations With Turkish Identity and Uninational Ideology
AN  - 2113778768
AB  - It is worthwhile to search the associations among militaristic attitudes, national identity, and uninational ideology empirically because they may be highly relevant to various issues such as support for military actions, using military to solve intergroup conflicts, and the willingness to join the army. The main purpose of the article was to empirically examine the associations among militaristic attitudes, national identity, and uninational ideology. To pursue this aim, we first developed a militaristic attitudes scale, covering attitudes toward military, militarization, and militarism (Study 1); and then explored the predictive powers of Turkish identity and uninational ideology on the militaristic attitudes (Study 2). University students (N = 339; 215 women and 124 men; Mdnage = 23, Mage = 23.84, SD = 4.44) completed an item pool of Militaristic Attitudes Scale and demographic information form in Study 1. Factor analyses of the scale resulted in 5 factors (attitudes toward followings issues: existence of the military [α = .95], value of the military [α = .89], militaristic system [α = .81], political position of military [α = .75], and compulsory military service [α = .87]). In Study 2, 583 university students (318 women and 265 men; Mdnage = 22, Mage = 22.09, SD = 2.32) completed the scales of militaristic attitudes, social identity, and uninational ideology as well as demographic information form. People who strongly identified with Turkish nationalism and supported uninational ideology had higher positive militaristic attitudes after controlling for demographic variables. These studies resulted in a reliable and valid scale to test militaristic attitudes at various levels such as institutional, system based, and ideological. Both studies provided some possible answers about who would support militaristic attitudes more within a society. These results may be useful for researchers who study militarism, militarization, identity, and nationalism.

T1  - The Politics of Religious Prejudice and Tolerance for Cultural Others
AN  - 2558485150
AB  - While some research argues that religious pluralism in the United States dampens conflict by promoting tolerance, other work documents persistent prejudice toward religious out-groups. We address this ambiguity by identifying a distinct cultural style that structures Americans’ attitudes toward religious others: support for public religious expression (PRE). Using data from a recent nationally representative survey, we find a strong and consistent relationship between high support for PRE, negative attitudes toward religious out-groups, and generalized intolerance. Addressing the previously overlooked public aspects of religion and cultural membership in the United States has important implications for studies of civic inclusion.

T1  - Competitiveness of the working youth on the basis of self-assessment (according to asurve in the Tyumen Region)
AN  - 2132681473
AB  - The article presents the results of a sociological survey of young people aimed at identifying factors and their significance for effective control of competitive processes. Building and development of competitiveness and competitive relations takes a special place in the processes of development of the next generation. The attitude of working youth to competition is being studied in situation of transition of Russian society to market relations. Competition is a universal social law that manifests differently in socio-economic formations, age groups, social and professional groups. In a market economy, competition affects the interests of each person. The study is aimed at determining the attitude of working youth towards competition. The technique of the bipolar scale of the semantic differential (graded scoring scale of 20 positive and negative characteristics) is used. In the respondents' assessments of the term "competition", mainly positive connotations predominate. Identified clusters show a positive mental disposition towards competitiveness, which creates breeding grounds for the developing of necessary qualities of a competitive personality. It is quite difficult to measure the process of accumulating personal competitiveness and assess its effectiveness. In the first approximation (for all subjectivity), this can be done on the basis of personal self-estimate of competitiveness. The article presents the results of the empirical sociological research of die level of competitiveness carried out by the authors: 57% of respondents consider themselves competitive, only 3% of respondents gave a negative assessment. With the total number of doubters - 40%, the ratio in favor of those who consider themselves "relatively successful" is almost five times higher than the number of those who doubt about their own competitiveness. Such high ratings are mostly due to the ambitiousness and small life experience of young people. The higher the social status of respondents, the more often they consider themselves to be competitive and successful people. The research results also show positive attitude of working youth towards competitive relations. The level of the competitiveness is largely determined by the different accents of young attitude towards the performed work.

T1  - Assessing the Political Distinctiveness of White Millennials: How Race and Generation Shape Racial and Political Attitudes in a Changing America
AN  - 2132246379
AB  - White Americans will soon lose their majority status—news that provokes group threat and a conservative response. Yet an alternative outcome focused on white millennials is also possible. This study examines whether young whites are distinct in their racial attitudes and how they react to demographic change. Using two nationally representative surveys from 2012 and 2016 and a nationally representative experiment from 2016, we find that race affects attitudes more than generation, and in no case are white millennials as racially liberal as nonwhites. Exposure to information about changing demography makes white millennials more conservative on some questions, but what matters more is whether respondents are Republicans and identify as white. White millennials are hardly immune to the power of race to shape their attitudes.

T1  - Professors-in-Training or Precarious Workers? Identity, Coalition Building, and Social Movement Unionism in the 2015 University of Toronto Graduate Employee Strike
AN  - 1979383717
AB  - In this article, I argue that graduate employees took on the political identity of precarious workers who face job insecurity and income insecurity, drawing attention to the casualization of work in the academic labor market in Canada, and the cost of undertaking graduate studies in Canadian universities. Their argument appealed to media, faculty, undergraduate students, and supportive media, which was key to building solidarity and public support for graduate employees' struggle. Building on social movement unionism literature, I show how this identity moved the debate away from the bargaining table and into broader coalition building, suggesting a broader social movement unionism among academic workers.

T1  - Multiple Baskets: Diverse Racial Frames and the 2016 Republican Primary
AN  - 1964169573
AB  - A strain of racist, xenophobic populism is sweeping through many democracies, jumping from the fringes of political discourse to the mainstream. Understanding how Donald Trump was able to take power while making explicitly racist appeals is vital to understanding this phenomenon. This article examines the 2016 Republican primary, drawing on data from the National Election Study pilot survey to explore how, and why some voters favored Trump over other Republicans. Were Trump voters reacting to the adverse economic effects of globalization, or the 2008 financial crisis? Were they traditional "Southern Strategy" Republicans? Were they white nationalists? While I find evidence that negative attitudes toward Hispanic-Americans, Muslim-Americans, and African Americans strongly predict favorability to Trump, I also find that hostile attitudes toward minority groups are not as strongly concentrated as a "white nationalism" interpretation would conclude. Rather than a single "basket" of racially anxious voters, Trump was able to appeal to a grab-bag of people with distinct anxieties. Insofar as one might be interested in defusing populism, there may not be a single solution, but rather multiple ones aimed at mobilizing diverse targets of racism.

T1  - Why the Poor Support Populism: The Politics of Sincerity in Metro Manila
AN  - 1982170556
AB  - Why do the poor respond to some populist appeals and not to others? Populist support is largely attributed to a leader's "populist style." Populist style is seen as consisting of tactics aimed at cultivating popular identification. This explanation, however, cannot tell us why the poor discriminate among leaders employing similar tactics. This article considers the question with respect to the Philippine populist Joseph Estrada. It finds that the poor support Estrada because they perceive him to be sincere, or someone who cares about them beyond electoral considerations. They see him as sincere because his political performance engages their expectations and has proven coherent over time. The collective nature of their belief in Estrada's sincerity helps account for its objectivity, durability, and diffusion. The empirical case presents an opportunity to develop a more sophisticated account of populist style and to show that it depends as much on the political savvy of supporters as on the skill of leaders.

T1  - "If You Don't Like Gay Marriage, Don't Get One!": A Qualitative Analysis of Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage in South Australia
AN  - 1969031779
AB  - Prejudice against sexual-minority groups has continuously declined in Australia over the past several decades, yet inequality in marriage policy that denies legal recognition of same-sex relationships remains. Social role theory suggests this may be due in part to traditional beliefs about gender roles that fuel concerns regarding the ability of same-sex couples to raise children because they violate these social norms and roles. The current study identified reasons behind support of, or opposition to, same-sex marriage. Data were collected from a community sample (n = 536) in South Australia through an open-ended question included on a larger survey. Content analysis suggested that gender role norms do play a part in negative attitudes toward same-sex marriage as well as perceptions of same-sex couples' ability to raise children. Our findings also revealed heteronormativity embedded in the responses of participants both for and against marriage equality. Implications for advocacy efforts focused on marriage equality, parenting by same-sex couples, and the focus for future research endeavours in this substantive domain are discussed.

T1  - Host or hostile? Attitudes towards asylum seekers in Israel and in Denmark
AN  - 1950777920
AB  - In this study, we focus on attitudes towards asylum seekers in two countries: Denmark and Israel. Both serve as interesting cases through which to study public sentiment of host populations for people seeking refuge. We examine the role of three core dimensions that have been relatively overlooked in previous studies: social contact with asylum seekers, the role of support for humanitarian policies and perceptions of legitimacy of the asylum seekers' claims. We also gauge the way perceptions of threat mediate the effect of these core dimensions on individuals' willingness to share their national benefits with those looking for refugee status in the two countries. For the analysis, we use multiple group structural equation modelling. On the descriptive level, findings suggest that respondents are considerably more hostile in Israel than in Denmark, although the mechanisms leading to the formation of exclusionary attitudes are partly similar. We conclude with some limitations of the study and closing remarks about similarities and differences across the two countries.

T1  - The language of conflict: The relationship between linguistic vitality and conflict intensity
AN  - 1939388419
AB  - Intergroup conflicts represent a risk of social instability and even violence. Understanding the reasons that push group members to adopt a certain level of conflict intensity is of the utmost importance. In the hope of shedding new light into this phenomenon, this paper explores how ethnic conflict intensity may be influenced by linguistic vitality, the social health of a language. The paper presents a theoretical model in which low and high levels of linguistic vitality are presented as being linked to lower conflict intensity than moderate vitality levels. The results of multilevel modeling lend support to this hypothesis for language-based ethnic tensions in a general context and, more precisely, within countries.

T1  - "Us Against Them" or "All Humans Are Equal": Intergroup Attitudes and Perceived Parental Socialization of Muslim Immigrant and Native Dutch Youth
AN  - 1978439991
AB  - Intergroup attitudes of Muslim immigrant youth and native youth in the Netherlands were examined in relation to perceived parental socialization. Our aim was to gain insights into parent-child (dis)similarity in antagonistic and egalitarian attitudes and to understand differences between these two groups in this respect. Data come from qualitative interviews with 22 Turkish Dutch, Moroccan Dutch, and native Dutch youth (aged 16-22) who were prone either to intergroup antagonism (i.e., held hostile and negative attitudes toward out-groups) or to egalitarianism (held egalitarian attitudes). Interviews were analyzed using the constant comparison method. Results show that in the majority youth group, egalitarianism as well as intergroup antagonism were quite comparable across two generations. The attitudes of Muslim minority youth diverged more from those of their parents and appeared to be related to the pedagogic relationship between parents and children. Minority youth prone to antagonism perceived a lack of adequate parental responses to their negative experiences in the context of Islamophobia. Egalitarian minority youth reported that their parents were quite sensitive to their communications about perceived exclusion and that they responded with advice and support. Findings are discussed with reference to the social learning theory and the ethnic socialization strategies identified by Hughes et al.

T1  - Ebola and Accusation: Gender Dimensions of Stigma in Sierra Leone’s Ebola Response
AN  - 1935785610
AB  - As Response and Resilience Team Anthropologist for Oxfam GB, my role was 
to support an inclusive, community-led Ebola response through a better understanding of 
gender dynamics in the context of the outbreak. This case study identified stigma and blame 
of affected people as key factors in the ongoing epidemic. Despite social mobilisation efforts 
to address these attitudes, they remained ingrained in the Ebola response at multiple levels: 
in Government of Sierra Leone quarantine policies, in community by-laws and in everyday 
social interactions. Negative attitudes put pressure on the roles of men and women in ways 
that produced barriers to acting on Ebola prevention and treatment advice or creating an 
inclusive Ebola response. Our findings prompted several improvements in Ebola response 
activities that Oxfam Sierra Leone carried forward in their work, demonstrating the key role 
applied anthropology can play in creating a reflexive process to improve the effectiveness of 
humanitarian aid.

We seek to assess the effect of self-interest, political values, and racial prejudice on the gun policy attitudes of whites, Latinos, and blacks. We also introduce a measure of prejudice difference in group violence--which has not been previously used in the literature on gun policy opinion. 
Methods 
We use data from a new survey (2015) and analyze whites, blacks, and Latinos separately. 
Results 
We find that many of the drivers of support for gun control found in the general population apply to minorities as well, but the substantive effects vary across groups. Similar to prior general population findings, we find that for all groups concern about crime is associated with more support for gun control, and that gun ownership, being the victim of a crime, and conservative political values are associated with less support. 
Conclusion 
In contrast, we find that racial prejudice is negatively correlated with support for gun control among whites and Latinos, while one type of racial prejudice--racial resentment--increases support for gun control among blacks.

T1  - Don't Read This: One Higher Education Administrator's Perspective on the Urgency of Emptiness and Social Justice
AN  - 2116060480
AB  - Mistler shared his perspective on the urgency of emptiness and social justice as a higher education administrator. He said that he was writing based on his own perspective and not speak for any group, r ace, class, gender or otherwise. He noted that he s till feel like an outsider himself even if he is readily identified by others as a member of the visible majority group. It is clear that issues faced by some groups are more dangerous, more pervasive and very urgent, while no group is immune to being the target of prejudice or unjust discrimination. He highlighted the need to cultivate the various practices of developing emptiness and receptivity toward voluntary giving away power and possession once a person realized that holding on to fractured/fracturing identities destroys environmental-peace, bodily-peace and inner-peace.

T1  - Repronormativity and the Reproduction of the Nation-State: The State and Sexuality Collide
AN  - 1900989389
AB  - This article seeks to explain the consistent margins between popular support for same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption/parenting. I posit that the paradigm of repronormativity explains these differences, in permitting only "legitimate," state-sanctioned, heteronormative reproduction. Through three case studies-Poland's strict abortion policies, France's law against lesbians utilizing artificial reproduction technologies, and Sweden's history of sterilizing trans individuals-I will demonstrate how not only does repronormativity select and enforce an inside/outside, in-group(s)/out-group(s) binary and legitimize only certain reproduction, it also tethers female sexuality to reproduction and creates an inevitability of reproduction.

T1  - Lay Belief in Biopolitics and Political Prejudice
AN  - 1873919784
AB  - Building on psychological research linking essentialist beliefs about human differences with prejudice, we test whether lay belief in the biological basis of political ideology is associated with political intolerance and social avoidance. In two studies of American adults (Study 1: N = 288, Study 2: N = 164), we find that belief in the biological basis of political views is associated with greater intolerance and social avoidance of ideologically dissimilar others. The association is substantively large and robust to demographic, religious, and political control variables. These findings stand in contrast to some theoretical expectations that biological attributions for political ideology are associated with tolerance. We conclude that biological lay theories are especially likely to be correlated with prejudice in the political arena, where social identities tend to be salient and linked to intergroup competition and animosity.

T1  - The making of a civic discourse on controversial historical past: from denial to parrhesia
AN  - 2124784019
AB  - Abstract: This contribution discusses the pragmatic effects of different rhetoric strategies conveying evidence of past ingroup violence after a long lasting social denial (Cohen, 2001). In particular, a case study is presented on the making of a civic discourse on controversial historical past: war crimes committed by the Italian Army during the colonial invasion of Ethiopia (1935-36). Although very well proved (Del Boca, 2005), these facts were only recently inserted in Italian history textbooks (Leone & Mastrovito, 2010; Cajani, 2013). In this same period, evidence of these crimes was officially presented during discussions of the Italian Parliament. In spite of these recent acknowledgments of the Italian responsibilities for these crimes, a social myth is still widely shared by the public opinion, representing Italians as good fellows (Italiani, brava gente: cfr. Del Boca, 2005), unable to be cruel both in everyday life and in wartimes (Volpato et al., 2012). This specific situation, denying even the reality of facts happened, has been defined literal social denial, i.e. the deepest among the three possible states of denial (literal, interpretive, implicative: cfr. Cohen, 2001). The issue of literal social denial of past ingroup violence is at the intersection among theories on narratives on national past (László, 2003), social representations of history (Liu et al., 2014), conflict ethos (Bar-Tal et al., 2012; Kelman, 2008), group-based emotions (Allpress et al., 2010; Leone, 2000) and intergroup reconciliation processes (Nadler et al., 2008). Namely, understanding how a social denial could break down implies the theorization of human mind’s reflexivity as grounded on historical awareness (Ortega y Gasset, 1930), and the notion of social change as primarily rooted in natality, i.e. the fact that each birth represents a new beginning (Arendt, 1958). Drawing on this theoretical background, we will present an ongoing research program (Leone, in press) on the literal social denial (Cohen, 2001) of war crimes committed by the Italian army during colonial period and on the pragmatic effects of different kinds of communication on this controversial past. In order to address this issue, we will particularly focus on the concept of parrhesia as defined by Foucault (1983): the communicative choice of &templt;frankness instead of persuasion, truth instead of falsehood or silence, [...] the moral duty instead of self-interest and moral apathy &tempgt; (Foucault, 2001, p.19). Studies we conducted in this line tested the change in beliefs and the emotional reactions of young citizens confronted with mild or parrhesiastic descriptions of socially denied war crimes (Leone & Sarrica, 2014, 2012). Empirical evidence will be discussed in order to reflect on our core idea: that a parrhesiastic communication is a risky tough necessary pragmatic move to break long lasting denial of ingroup wrongdoings, to trigger critical civic discourse in the place of social myths and to start reconciliation processes.Alternate abstract:Résumé: L'article traite des effets pragmatiques de différentes stratégies rhétoriques qui témoignent, suite à un déni social durable, de la violence perpétrée par un groupe social (Cohen, 2001). En particulier, une étude de cas est présentée sur la réalisation d'un discours civique sur un passé historique controversé, c'est-à-dire les crimes de guerre commis par l'armée italienne lors de l'invasion coloniale de l'Éthiopie (193536). Bien que très connus parmi les historiens (Del Boca, 2005), ces faits ne soient que récemment insérés dans les manuels d'histoire italienne (Leone & Mastrovito, 2010; Cajani, 2013). Dans cette même période, la preuve de ces crimes a été officiellement présentée lors des discussions dans le Parlement italien. Malgré ces reconnaissances récentes des responsabilités italiennes pour ces crimes, un mythe social est encore largement partagé par l'opinion publique, représentant les Italiens comme de bons camarades (Italiani, brava gente: cf. Del Boca, 2005), incapables d'être cruels à la fois dans la vie quotidienne et en temps de guerre (Volpato et al., 2012). Cette situation spécifique, en supprimant même la réalité des faits, a été définie comme un refus social littéral, c'est-à-dire le plus profond parmi les trois états possibles de déni (littéral, interprétatif, implicatif: cf. Cohen, 2001). La question du déni social littéral de la violence dont son groupe est responsable se pose à l'intersection des théories concernant les récits sur le passé national (László, 2003), les représentations sociales de l'histoire (Liu et al., 2014), l'ethos de conflit (Bar-Tal et al., 2012; Kelman, 2008), les émotions basées sur le groupe (Allpress et al., 2010; Leone, 2000) et les processus de réconciliation des groupes (Nadler et al., 2008). À savoir, comprendre comment un déni social pourrait s'écrouler implique une théorisation de la réflexivité de l'esprit humain qui soit fondée sur la conscience historique (Ortega y Gasset, 1930) et la notion que le changement social soit principalement enraciné dans la natalité, alors que chaque naissance représente un nouveau départ (Arendt, 1958). En nous appuyant sur ce contexte théorique, nous présenterons un programme de recherche en cours (Leone, sous presse) portant sur le déni social littéral (Cohen, 2001) des crimes de guerre commis par l'armée italienne pendant la période coloniale et sur les effets pragmatiques de différents types de communication sur ce passé controversé. Pour aborder cette question, nous nous concentrerons particulièrement sur le concept de parrhésie tel qu'il est défini par Foucault (1983): c'est-à-dire le choix communicatif de &templt;la franchise au lieu de la persuasion, de la vérité au lieu du mensonge ou du silence, [...] du devoir moral à la place de l'intérêt personnel et de l'apathie morale&tempgt; (Foucault, 2001, p. 19). Les études que nous avons menées dans cette ligne de recherche ont exploré le changement des croyances et des réactions émotionnelles des jeunes citoyens Italiens confrontés à des descriptions légères ou parrhésiastiques de ces crimes de guerre socialement démentis (Leone & Sarrica, 2014, 2012). Des preuves empiriques seront discutées afin de réfléchir à notre idée fondamentale: proposant que une communication parrhésiastique, tout en déclenchant des réactions dangereuses et difficiles à gérer, soit néanmoins la plus utile pour briser un déni durable des actes répréhensibles commis par le groupe, et soit l'unique solution viable pour provoquer un discours civique critique sur les mythes sociaux d'un passé idéalisé du groupe, favorisant le commencement des processus sociaux nécessaires pour une véritable réconciliation.

T1  - Using Groups to Measure Intergroup Prejudice
AN  - 1851015712
AB  - Implicit measures of racial attitudes often assess reactions to images of individuals to infer attitudes toward an entire social category. However, an increasing amount of research indicates that responses to individuals are highly dependent on context and idiosyncratic features of individual exemplars. Thus, using images of individuals to assess beliefs about a whole social category may not be ideal. Across three time points, we predicted that using images of groups would mitigate the influence of idiosyncratic features of individual targets and, thus, provide a better measurement tool to assess beliefs about a category to which all group members belong. Results revealed that an implicit measure that presented images of Black and White groups had greater construct validity, test-retest reliability, and predictive validity as compared with an implicit measure that presented the same exemplars individually. We conclude that groups provide a window into existing beliefs about social categories.

T1  - Sexual Orientation in the Labor Market
AN  - 1846272819
AB  - Most analyses of sexual orientation and earnings find that gay men face a wage gap, whereas lesbian women earn higher wages than similar heterosexual women. However, analyses rarely consider bisexual men and women as a unique group separate from other sexual minorities. I argue that such binary views of sexual orientation -- treating sexual minorities as a homogenous non-heterosexual group -- have obscured understandings of the impact of sexual orientation on labor market outcomes. Specifically, I predict that unequal outcomes for gay men and lesbian women are partly due to the influence of family arrangements and their effects on earnings. In contrast, I argue that bisexual men and women should be the most disadvantaged in the labor market, due to particularly disadvantaging stereotypes, perceptions of choice to their sexual orientation, and prejudicial treatment. Using data from the General Social Survey (N = 13,554) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 14,714), I show that family arrangements explain some of the observed earnings differentials for gay men and lesbian women. Bisexual men and women, in contrast, face wage penalties that are not explained by human capital differences or occupational characteristics. Perceptions of prejudicial treatment partially explain the observed wage gaps. [web URL: http://asr.sagepub.com/content/81/6/1132.abstract]

T1  - Religion and reducing prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 1830218242
AB  - Drawing on findings from the study of prejudice and prejudice reduction, we identify a number of mechanisms through which religious communities may influence the intergroup attitudes of their members. We hypothesize that religious participation could in principle either reduce or promote prejudice with respect to any given target group. A religious community's influence on intergroup attitudes will depend upon the specific beliefs, attitudes, and practices found within the community, as well as on interactions between the religious community and the larger social environment in which it is embedded. Basing our proposals on findings from the literature on prejudice formation and prejudice reduction allows us to outline useful directions for future studies of religion and prejudice.

T1  - What matters to the public when they call the police? Insights from a call centre
AN  - 1788247480
AB  - Contact with the police impacts upon public judgements of the police. The experiences of those who contact the public police by telephone concerning non-emergency issues have received little attention in the existing literature. This article presents findings from a qualitative examination of a police Constabulary's non-emergency call-handling processes, exploring some of the factors which shaped the contact experienced through this channel. Interviews were conducted with 70 members of the public who contacted the Constabulary through its call centre, with the police call-handlers who answered some of these calls, and with call centre supervisors and senior managers. Police call-handlers were positive about their jobs, despite acknowledging the somewhat repetitive nature of the work, as they believed they were helping the public by providing a valuable, worthwhile service. Callers were primarily concerned with how they were treated and noted that the most memorable and helpful components of their calls to the police were the ways in which call-handlers conveyed empathy, understanding, interest, sensitivity and politeness. Having a call answered in under 40 seconds, one of the quantitative performance targets used to measure performance in the police call centre, appeared to be less important to callers. The article concludes by arguing that quantitative targets are ill-suited to measuring and supporting the kind of emotional labour that call-handlers undertake and the emotional engagement that callers value. Providing high-quality service should be the priority for police call centres, as this is likely to generate positive judgements of the police.

T1  - CoBRAS as a Predictor of Attitudes toward Redistributing Resources to Improve Predominantly Black Schools
AN  - 1841956066
AB  - Research supports the use of the Color-Blind Racism Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS) as a measure of color-blindness, but relatively little is known about whether it is predictive of policy attitudes. This study adds to that literature by investigating the extent to which CoBRAS predicts attitudes toward resource redistribution as a method of addressing the Black-White achievement gap. Structural equation modeling performed on data from 215 participants revealed that CoBRAS is a useful tool in predicting attitudes toward redistributing resources to benefit predominantly Black schools, even after controlling for social dominance and attributions for "the gap. " Researchers are encouraged to continue exploring the properties of CoBRAS to achieve a thorough understanding of its empirical potential.

T1  - Taiwanese Immigrants' Medical Experiences: An Exploratory Study
AN  - 1789179827
AB  - Immigrants' medical experiences are an important and yet rarely studied topic. To fill this gap, this article provides an exploratory investigation concerning how immigrant status, gender, and race affect Taiwanese immigrants' health care choices, their per-ceptions of medical professionals, and their health behavior in the United States. Data are based on 16 in-depth interviews and participant observations in a Taiwanese immigrant community in a Midwestern urban area. Findings suggest that Taiwanese immigrants rely heavily on their coethnics for gathering medical information. The subjects' perceptions of a physician's gender convey stereotypes and reflect sexual body boundaries. While aware of their minority status and its impact on health care, the subjects show racial prejudice toward Black physicians. They also often contrast the two medical systems in the sending and receiving societies when describing their health care experiences. Implications of this study for scholars and health care providers are discussed.

T1  - The vicious circle of religious prejudice: Islamophobia makes the acculturation attitudes of majority and minority members clash
AN  - 1790523724
AB  - Public discourse often portrays Islam as the main obstacle for Muslim minorities' integration, paying little attention to the contextual factors hindering this process. Here, we focus on islamophobia as one destructive factor that hinders the mutual integration between Muslim minority and Western majority members, affecting both groups. In Study 1, the more islamophobic majority members were, the more they expected Muslims to give up their heritage culture and the less they wanted them to integrate. In Study 2, only when Muslims experienced substantial religious discrimination did religious identity negatively relate to national engagement and particularly positively relate to ethnic engagement. Together, the studies suggest that religious prejudice in the form of islamophobia is a major obstacle to Muslims' integration because it increases the incongruity between majority and minority members' acculturation attitudes.

T1  - One Size May Not Fit All: The Need for a More Inclusive and Intersectional Psychological Science on Stigma
AN  - 1719467689
AB  - In their review, Remedios and Snyder ( 2015 ) articulated how models of stigma fall short of explaining stigmatization of women of color, because they do not consider intersectionality of multiple stigmatized identities. Using the example of the intersection of race and gender, they reviewed literature on how targets of stigma detect and respond to prejudice (making prejudice attributions, the role of identity processes such as centrality), highlighting the complexity of these processes once multiple identities (namely non-prototypical categories of race and gender) are considered. In response, we provide more in depth discussion of the challenges to inclusion and intersectionality including current and traditional psychological science approaches and the perceived politicization of intersectional research, as well as the complexity of integrating multiple identities (social class, sexual orientation and gender diversity) into stigma research, including recruitment, measurement, and analysis. We offer practical suggestions in the areas of recruitment, measurement, and analysis, to facilitate more inclusive and intersectional research, given that such work would provide a more complete understanding of the experience of stigma.

T1  - The Collective Value of "Me" (and it's Limitations): Towards a More Nuanced Understanding of Individual and Collective Coping with Prejudice
AN  - 1710569316
AB  - Within the social identity tradition, individual and collective responses to social disadvantage are typically seen as mutually exclusive. This study (N = 120) provides a more nuanced understanding of individual and collective responses to social disadvantage by examining the ways in which women anticipate responding to "daily sexism." We test how responses are independently related to ingroup identification, disidentification, and perceived ingroup homogeneity. Results show that women favor confronting sexism over inaction, even if that involves disparaging the ingroup. Specifically, women expect to engage in both individual and collective strategies in response to a sexist statement. Identification with women was positively associated with both collective and individual (nongroup disparaging) responses, but only collective responses related to broader intentions to engage in collective action for social change. Finally, perceived group homogeneity uniquely increased agreement with the sexist statement, endorsement of inaction, and group-disparaging responses. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Extended contact through cross-group romantic relationships
AN  - 1709474886
AB  - Cross-group romantic relationships are an extremely intimate and often maligned form of intergroup contact. Yet, according to intergroup contact theory, these relationships have the potential to improve the intergroup attitudes of others via extended contact. This study combines the interpersonal and intergroup literatures to examine the outcomes associated with knowing a partner in a cross-group romantic relationship. Results suggest that cross-group romantic partners encounter greater disapproval toward their relationships than same-group partners and, as a result, their relationships are perceived more negatively. Nevertheless, extended contact with cross-group partners, controlling for participants' cross-group friendships and romantic relationships, predicts more positive attitudes toward cross-group dating and positive intergroup attitudes in general, mediated by perceived ingroup norms toward cross-group relationships.

T1  - Majority-minority acculturation preferences concordance as an antecedent of attitudes towards immigrants: The mediating role of perceived symbolic threat and metastereotypes
AN  - 1735657122; 201536997
AB  - Through an experimental design, we investigated the effects of majority-minority acculturation preferences concordance and immigrants' generational status on Italians' attitudes towards Albanian immigrants. The role of perceived threat and metastereotypes in mediating this relationship was examined. Participants (N = 178) were categorized into different levels of culture maintenance and intercultural contact concordance. Findings showed that discrepancies in the contact dimension affected majority members' attitudes towards immigrants. Both perceived threat and metastereotypes were found to mediate the relationship between contact discrepancies and attitudes towards immigrants. Culture maintenance concordance interacted with immigrants' generational status in influencing majority members' attitudes. This research confirmed the importance of taking into account the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between majority and immigrant acculturation preferences, confirming that the most positive attitudes were produced when immigrants were perceived to adopt the same strategy as the majority, especially with respect to intergroup contact.

T1  - Facilitating adaptation and intercultural contact: The role of integration and multicultural ideology in dominant and non-dominant groups
AN  - 1735656977; 201536982
AB  - Research on acculturation has documented that adaptation to a receiving society is affected by both the immigrants' acculturation strategies and the dominant group's expectations about how immigrants should acculturate. However, the acculturation expectations have received relatively less attention from researchers, and support for multiculturalism has rarely been examined from the perspective of immigrants. The present study used the framework of the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies (MIRIPS) project to investigate the acculturation experiences and intercultural relations in Hong Kong by incorporating mutual views of both the dominant and non-dominant groups. It also tested the mediating role of the dominant group's tolerance towards different cultural groups and the non-dominant group's perceived discrimination. Two community samples were recruited, including Hong Kong residents (N = 181) and immigrants from Mainland China (N = 182). Among Mainland immigrants, the integration strategy predicted both psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation. Multicultural ideology predicted psychological adaptation and played a significant role in intercultural contact with Hong Kong people through the mediation of lower perceived discrimination. Among Hong Kong residents, the integration expectation predicted psychological adaptation. Multicultural ideology indirectly affected intercultural contact with Mainland immigrants through the mediation of greater tolerance. These results suggest that the integration strategy and expectation are more important to intrapersonal functioning, whereas multicultural ideology may be more crucial in facilitating social interactions between members of the society of settlement and immigrants in culturally plural milieus. Future research should test the proposed models of dominant and non-dominant groups in other cultures. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - From Favourites to 'With No Return': Permanence and Mobility of Latin American Immigration in Spain during the 21st Century
AN  - 1635422336
AB  - Cet article a pour but, d'analyser d'abord les raisons qui sous-tendent la montée de l'immigration latino-américaine vers l'Espagne durant la période 2000-2013 et, ensuite d'expliquer pourquoi ce groupe persiste à rester dans ce pays malgré l'intensité de la crise économique et la destruction massive de l'emploi. Il démontre qu'autant les raisons de rester en Espagne que celles de se délocaliser, sont influencées, non seulement par le cycle économique, mais aussi le degré d'intégration accomplie par ce groupe, ainsi que par d'autres facteurs en rapport avec le contexte de leur pays d'origine.              Other international legal rules that kept that pre-eminence for certain chosen countries were added to the regularization policies favouring permanence of Latin Americans. That preferential choice was materialised in the establishment of bilateral agreements for annual quotas of workers'0 and in the imposition of visas. The aim was to select the nationalities settling in Spain and to control migration flows. When visas were imposed on Colombia and Ecuador (2001 and 2003), the inflow dropped, but the majority of immigrants had already entered into Spain, and the inertia of family regrouping completed the large stock. A similar case was that of the visas being imposed on Bolivians in 2007, when it was already impossible to control the inflow. In the case of Latin American immigration, the economic factors, such as the housing boom and the informal economy in the sectors of construction, agriculture, and above all, domestic work, were added to the weakness of external controls and the clear religious and cultural preference shown by public opinion towards these 'descendants and colonised,' as well as their fast rate of absorption (naturalisation, language, religion) and their make-up (féminisation and family), which favours integration. Neither social cohesion, nor public expense on integration was thought to be costly or difficult. The 'family centredness' and the Catholicism of Spanish society formed the cement and the foundation of social acceptance.              This is reflected in the attitudes and policies with respect to the copious immigration of the first decade of the 21st century. The most consistent opinion poll data show that Spain's social acceptance was greater in terms of cultural assimilation than in adequacy of employment. In more social-scientific terms, the majority of Spanish people cared more about religion, language, customs and the ethnic appearance of the immigrants than about their social class. It was not for nothing that the most popular question in the last surveys by the CIS (2001 and 2012) showed that the main requirement to facilitate immigrants' entry in Spain was that 'they are willing to adopt the country's way of life,' with an average of 8.0 on a scale of 0 to 10. The second most popular requirement for opening the doors to them was that 'they had a work qualification that Spain needed,' with an average value of 7.4 in 2011. And it is precisely in these historical and cultural preferences where Latin American immigration has a legal and social advantage. The different concentrations and settlement patterns of the immigrant communities show their adjustment to the community diversity in Spain. The 'Spanish' model of immigrant integration is not so much legal and political, but more geared towards fitting in within the diversity puzzle.

T1  - Ethnic Differences in the Attitudes and Practice of Consanguineous Marriage among Kurds and Turks in Uromiyeh District, Iran
AN  - 1667952376; 201511895
AB  - Despite the spread of modern familial values and norms and the rapid pace of modernization in Iran, kinship marriages remain a common practice among some ethnic groups, including Turk and Kurd. This study is informed by modernization and development idealism theories to examine factors associated with the practice and attitude of Kurdish and Turkish women to consanguineous marriage, utilizing data from a representative sample of 768 evermarried women residing in the district of Uromiyeh in Iran. The results indicated that consanguineous marriage was more prevalent among Kurds rather than Turks, and Kurdish rather than Turkish women held more positive orientations to consanguineous. Multivariate results showed that being a Kurd than a Turk was strongly associated with the likelihood of practicing kinship marriage and having positive attitudes to consanguineous marriage, while the levels of modernization and development idealism showed no or weak association. The results suggest that ethnic belonging can reinforce consanguineous marriage regardless of being modernized or holding modern development ideals. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social exclusion and xenophobia: Intolerant attitudes toward ethnic and religious minorities
AN  - 1542000313; 201426763
AB  - The present research investigates the effects of social exclusion on attitudes toward ethnic and religious minorities. Native-born German participants who were socially excluded rather than included reported greater approval for stricter legislation regarding the naturalization of immigrants (Study 1), reported greater prejudice against openly observant Muslims (Studies 2 and 3), and stronger agreement with the view that immigrants are financial burdens to the state (Study 4). Social exclusion threatens the sense of personal control, which in turn leads to stronger rejection of stigmatized outgroups (Study 3). When perceived control was experimentally enhanced, the social exclusion effect disappeared (Study 4). The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Contact and Attitudes Toward International Students in Australia: Intergroup Anxiety and Intercultural Communication Emotions as Mediators
AN  - 1520336524; 201412259
AB  - The current study investigated the impact of intercultural contact between domestic and international students on attitudes toward international students, and potential mediators of this relationship. A total of 247 Australian-born domestic undergraduates completed a survey of the quantity and quality of their contact with international students, levels of intergroup anxiety (IA) and intercultural communication emotions (ICE), and their attitudes toward international students. Positive quality of intercultural contact, less IA, and more positive ICE were all related to more positive attitudes toward international students. In addition, ICE mediated the relationship between positive quality of contact and attitudes, and between IA and attitudes. Quality of contact exerted both direct and indirect effects (via IA and intercultural communications emotions) on intergroup attitudes. Results highlight the importance of addressing communication barriers and the emotions associated with these when promoting positive interactions between domestic and international students. Suggestions are made for a theoretical integration of intergroup and communication-based perspectives when considering attitudes toward linguistically diverse outgroups like international students.

T1  - Effects of Sanskrit Schooling on Cognitive and Social Processes
AN  - 1520336764; 201417684
AB  - The article discusses effects of Sanskrit schooling, a traditional system of education in India, which has continued for several thousand years. Sanskrit schooling continues to be in operation in India, but has been pushed out to the margins after the introduction of formal Western-type schooling by the British. A set of studies demonstrating the influence of traditional Sanskrit and formal Western forms of schooling on children's cognitive and social processes is discussed. These specifically include studies of learning and memory, psychological differentiation, spatial language and encoding, dead reckoning, meta-cognition, social identity and prejudice, intergroup relationships and daily activities, practices and values. The article also discusses potential areas for cross-cultural collaborative research relating to psychological development of children.

T1  - Living in a multicultural world: Intergroup ideologies and the societal context of intergroup relations
AN  - 1644755402
AB  - In a relatively short time span, issues of ethnic, cultural, and religious diversity have become central topics of discussion in various nations. As a result, the role of broad ideologies that frame and structure relations between groups has received increasing attention by social psychologists. Of particular concern has been the role of these intergroup ideologies in promoting intergroup harmony and reducing prejudice. In this article, we appraise the evidence related to three main intergroup ideologies, assimilation, colourblindness, and multiculturalism. We argue that research in this area has paid insufficient attention to the social and political context. Intergroup ideologies have been studied and conceptualised as being located solely within individual minds. We suggest that the potentially vital aspect of these ideologies is that they are sometimes widely shared by members of a social group. Integrating sociological and political analyses, we discuss the fact that intergroup ideologies are institutionalised as policies and that, as such, they often vary across countries and across time. We present a series of studies to illustrate the theoretical implications of studying the shared nature of these intergroup ideologies, providing insights into the question of when and why national policies can shape individuals' intergroup attitudes and beliefs and improve intergroup relations.

T1  - The Contingent Effect of Race in Juvenile Court Detention Decisions: The Role of Racial and Symbolic Threat
AN  - 1728661383; 201535669
AB  - Race and racial stereotypes have long been recognized as influencing the formal social control of youth. Recent analyses have moved beyond identifying disproportionate minority contact (DMC) and toward assessing the contingencies under which race has a lesser or greater impact on juvenile court outcomes. While often confounded, the racial threat and symbolic threat perspectives offer conceptually distinct explanations for DMC. The racial threat perspective proposes that racial disparities in sanctioning are at least partly the result of perceptions among Whites that the minority group threatens their economic and political hegemony. Alternatively, the symbolic threat perspective proposes that intergroup inequality fosters perceptions that minorities are a threat to middle class norms, values, and standards motivating Whites to discriminate. The current study employs hierarchical generalized linear modeling to discern the salience of these two perspectives to understanding racial bias in preadjudication detention. To do this, we merge county-level Census data with data on nearly a decade's worth of delinquency cases in one Southeastern state. Our results offer limited support for the racial threat perspective but strongly support the symbolic threat perspective in indicating that the impact of race on detention is contingent upon interracial socioeconomic inequality in the community at large.

T1  - A time to make (and lose) friends: effects of soccer tournaments on German adolescents' attitudes toward foreigners
AN  - 1433108426
AB  - The present research examined the effects of one's national sports team defeats in international competitions on adolescents' out-group attitudes and the moderation of these effects by in-group identification. We conducted two longitudinal studies surveying German adolescents (Soccer World Championship 2006 and European Championship 2008). Both studies showed deterioration in adolescents' evaluations of people from the countries whose soccer teams defeated the German team (Italy and Spain). There was no generalization to other national groups. The deterioration in out-group evaluations was shown to be more pronounced for adolescents reporting a high in-group identification. The results are discussed in terms of macro-societal effects on adolescents' attitude development and the function that intergroup bias serves for social identity.

T1  - Race, Ideology, and the Tea Party: A Longitudinal Study
AN  - 1371428234
AB  - The Tea Party movement, which rose to prominence in the United States after the election of President Barack Obama, provides an ideal context in which to examine the roles of racial concerns and ideology in politics. A three-wave longitudinal study tracked changes in White Americans’ self-identification with the Tea Party, racial concerns (prejudice and racial identification), and ideologies (libertarianism and social conservatism) over nine months. Latent Growth Modeling (LGM) was used to evaluate potential causal relationships between Tea Party identification and these factors. Across time points, racial prejudice was indirectly associated with movement identification through Whites’ assertions of national decline. Although initial levels of White identity did not predict change in Tea Party identification, initial levels of Tea Party identification predicted increases in White identity over the study period. Across the three assessments, support for the Tea Party fell among libertarians, but rose among social conservatives. Results are discussed in terms of legitimation theories of prejudice, the “racializing” power of political judgments, and the ideological dynamics of the Tea Party.

T1  - In-group favouritism and out-group derogation towards national groups: Age-related differences among Italian school children
AN  - 1417521413; 201332182
AB  - Recently many researchers investigated intergroup attitudes among children, but only few studies analyzed developmental pathways of in-group favouritism and out-group derogation in considerable samples across broad age ranges. The present study aims at examining age-related differences in in-group favouritism and out-group derogation towards national groups among Italian children. Six hundred-seven children (305 males, 302 females), aged 6-12 living in Italy, were asked to answer an individual interview, making various evaluations of the national in-group and of 2 salient national out-groups (German and English). For research purposes 3 measures were used: number of positive traits applied to own and other national groups; number of negative traits applied to own and other national groups; and affect towards own and other national groups. Data analysis indicated that: (a) the effects of in-group favouritism are noticeable from the age of 6 years and persist through time; and (b) out-group derogation is a limited phenomenon that becomes slightly more evident at older ages with reference to the German group, in general negatively perceived among Italian children. These results are discussed in relation to the framework of Social Identity Development Theory. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Predicting Homophobic Behavior Among Heterosexual Youth: Domain General and Sexual Orientation-Specific Factors at the Individual and Contextual Level
AN  - 1285325607; 22956337
AB  - As a form of bias-based harassment, homophobic behavior remains prominent in schools. Yet, little attention has been given to factors that underlie it, aside from bullying and sexual prejudice. Thus, we examined multiple domain general (empathy, perspective-taking, classroom respect norms) and sexual orientation-specific factors (sexual orientation identity importance, number of sexual minority friends, parents' sexual minority attitudes, media messages). We documented support for a model in which these sets of factors converged to predict homophobic behavior, mediated through bullying and prejudice, among 581 students in grades 9-12 (55 % female). The structural equation model indicated that, with the exception of media messages, these additional factors predicted levels of prejudice and bullying, which in turn predicted the likelihood of students to engage in homophobic behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interrelated factors in efforts to reduce bullying, prejudice, and discrimination among youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Practitioner and Client Explanations for Disparities in Health Care Use Between Migrant and Non-migrant Groups in Sweden: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 1478096510; 22323124
AB  - To investigate variations in explanations given for disparities in health care use between migrant and non-migrant groups, by clients and care providers in Sweden. Qualitative evidence collected during in-depth interviews with five 'migrant' health service clients and five physicians. The interview data generated three categories which were perceived by respondents to produce ethnic differences in health service use: "Communication issues", "Cultural differences in approaches to medical consultations" and "Effects of perceptions of inequalities in care quality and discrimination". Explanations for disparities in health care use in Sweden can be categorized into those reflecting social/structural conditions and the presence/absence of power and those using cultural/behavioural explanations. The negative perceptions of 'migrant' clients held by some Swedish physicians place the onus for addressing their poor health with the clients themselves and risks perpetuating their health disadvantage. The power disparity between doctors and 'migrant' patients encourages a sense of powerlessness and mistreatment among patients. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AND SELF-ESTEEM: THE VARIOUS SOURCES
AN  - 1464753692
AB  - As a result of prejudice and discrimination, African American women are likely to experience adversity. We examined possible sources of self-esteem among 16 African American Women utilizing a mixed design (i.e., quantitative and qualitative). Quantitative data was gathered through objective measures (i.e., Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, Reflected Appraisal Scale, Revised African American Identity Scale, Womanist Identity Attitude Scale, and Feminist Identity Scale). Qualitative data was obtained through an unstructured interview. Results indicated that religion, specifically, having a good relationship with God influenced self-esteem. Family closeness related to self-esteem and role models enhanced identity development as well as self-esteem. Based on these findings, socialization factors may assist in maintaining self-esteem in dealing with adversity for African American women. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - On being peripheral and paying attention: Prototypicality and information processing in intergroup conflict
AN  - 1373429366; 201328473
AB  - Intergroup conflicts are ubiquitous -- they occur, for instance, between (work)groups, departments, organizations, political parties, or nations. Such conflicts are commonly addressed through negotiations, in which representatives negotiate on behalf of their constituency. Intergroup negotiations are complex, as representatives need to navigate between the interests of their own constituency and the other party. This implies that negotiation success requires careful processing of information about both parties' interests. Here, we examine how representative negotiators' motivation to engage in such thorough information processing is influenced by their position in the group. Whereas prototypical representatives feel secure about their membership, peripheral representatives have a less certain position. We propose that peripheral representatives are therefore more attentive and responsive to information that may be relevant to the negotiation than prototypical representatives, but only when they are accountable to their constituents. Data from 4 experiments showed that peripheral representatives reported higher information-processing motivation (Experiment 1), bought and recalled more information (Experiment 2), exhibited greater sensitivity to emotional expressions of the outgroup representative (Experiment 3), and attained more integrative ("win-win") agreements (Experiment 4) than prototypical representatives, but only when they were accountable. The findings are discussed in relation to theorizing on group dynamics, motivated information processing, emotion, and intergroup conflict, and practical implications are considered.

T1  - Good culture, bad culture...no culture! The implications of culture in urban regeneration in Bradford, UK
AN  - 1221412591; 201246366
AB  - This paper shows how regeneration policies in Bradford (UK) have over the years been modified following local, national and international events since 1997. It will be argued that policy makers reacted to public perceptions of the city itself and of its large Muslim community in three phases: celebration of local minority ethnic culture; pathologization of the same; exclusion of any cultural element from the city's self-projection. The paper suggests that these changes are at the same time reflexive of historical events and hegemonic discourses, and likely to be constitutive (as they have the potential to deeply affect social relations in the city). Further investigation is required to measure such constitutive long-term effects on minority ethnic groups and social relations in the city.

T1  - The Stranger Effect: The Rejection of Affective Deviants
AN  - 1364701213; 201323238
AB  - What happens when affective displays deviate from normative expectations? In this study, participants evaluated target individuals displaying flat, incongruent, or congruent expressions seemingly in response to pictures eliciting positive, neutral, or negative affect. Relative to targets who displayed normative reactions, those who violated affective norms (affective deviants) were rated more negatively on various dimensions of social judgment. Participants also preferred greater social distance from affective deviants, reported more moral outrage in response to them, and inferred that these targets did not share their moral values. Incongruent affect resulted in more negative social judgment than did flat affect, and this relationship was moderated by stimulus valence. Finally, the relationship between targets' affective expressions and participants' avoidant intentions was mediated by the extent to which participants thought the targets shared their moral values. These findings demonstrate the interpersonal costs of affective deviance, revealing the pervasiveness and force of affective norms. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gender threats and men's antigay behaviors: The harmful effects of asserting heterosexuality
AN  - 1125220050; 201240264
AB  - Whereas recent work on gender role violations suggests that asserting their heterosexuality may diminish the harmful effects of gender threats (versus gender affirmations) on men's antigay reactions, predictions derived from social identity theory suggest that asserting heterosexuality can exacerbate the negative effects of a gender threat on antigay reactions. Two studies tested these competing hypotheses. In Study 1, gender threatened versus affirmed men sent more intense noise blasts at a gay partner, but only if they asserted their heterosexuality. In Study 2, men high in sexual prejudice who underwent a gender threat sat farther from a gay confederate than gender affirmed men, but only if they asserted heterosexuality. Discussion considers the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, and highlights directions for future research.

T1  - Multiple Forms of Perceived Discrimination and Health among Adolescents and Young Adults
AN  - 1030869420; 201229768
AB  - Research on perceived discrimination has overwhelmingly focused on one form of discrimination, especially race discrimination, in isolation from other forms. The present article uses data from the Black Youth Culture Survey, a nationally representative, racially and ethnically diverse sample of 1,052 adolescents and young adults to investigate the prevalence, distribution, and mental and physical health consequences of multiple forms of perceived discrimination. The findings suggest that disadvantaged groups, especially multiply disadvantaged youth, face greater exposure to multiple forms of discrimination than their more privileged counterparts. The experience of multiple forms of discrimination is associated with worse mental and physical health above the effect of only one form and contributes to the relationship between multiple disadvantaged statuses and health. These findings suggest that past research may misspecify the discrimination-health relationship and fails to account for the disproportionate exposure to discrimination faced by multiply disadvantaged individuals.

T1  - Discrimination, Family Relationships, and Major Depression Among Asian Americans
AN  - 1010078718; 22083344
AB  - Depression represents a growing concern among Asian Americans. This study examined whether discrimination and family dynamics are associated with depression in this population. Weighted logistic regressions using nationally representative data on Asian American adults (N = 2095) were used to examine associations between discrimination, negative interactions with relatives, family support, and 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD). Discrimination (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.67, 2.71) and negative interactions with relatives (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.58) were positively associated with MDD. Family support was associated with lower MDD (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.89), and buffered lower levels of discrimination. Results suggest that discrimination may have negative mental health implications, and also point to the importance of family relationships for depression among Asian Americans. Findings suggest that providers may consider stress experienced at multiple ecological levels to address Asian American mental health needs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Intimate Partner Violence among Asian Americans: Risk Factor Differences across Ethnic Subgroups
AN  - 993079029
AB  - A limited number of studies have been conducted on intimate partner violence (IPV) among Asian Americans. This study aims to fill this gap by examining risk factors for IPV and ethnic differences within Asian American subgroups. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, using data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). This study found that while prevalence rates of IPV varied across ethnic groups, the differences disappeared when controlling for demographic, interpersonal, and sociocultural variables. The study findings also showed that risk for IPV was higher for US-born Asian Americans, and that perceived discrimination increased the risk.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Impact of Education on Intergroup Attitudes: A Multiracial Analysis
AN  - 952891995
AB  - How does education affect racial attitudes? Past studies focus almost exclusively on whites' attitudes toward blacks, neglecting important minority populations. This study extends previous research by analyzing the effects of education on beliefs about racial stereotypes, discrimination, and affirmative action policies among whites, Asians, Hispanics, and blacks. Results indicate that whites, Hispanics, and blacks with higher levels of education are more likely to reject negative stereotypes, but these effects are less consistent among Asians. And, although education has consistent positive effects on awareness of discrimination against minorities, a more advanced education is not associated with greater support for racial preferences among any respondent group. Education is, however, related to more favorable attitudes toward race-targeted job training. These results are partly consistent with a revised group conflict perspective positing that education unevenly promotes different elements of the dominant racial ideology among nonwhite minorities, depending on their position in the racial hierarchy.

T1  - Threat, Prejudice, and Stereotyping in the Context of Japanese, North Korean, and South Korean Intergroup Relations
AN  - 1417525187; 201331750
AB  - Integrated threat theory, realistic conflict theory, and group justification (based on social identity theory) were evaluated in the international context of Japanese prejudice toward North Korea and South Korea. Military threat emerged as an important addition to the four threats outlined by integrated threat theory. Three perceived North Korean threats (realistic [domestic] threat; intergroup anxiety; military threat) predicted prejudice toward North Korea. North Korean prejudice predicted negative stereotypes, supporting group-justification theory. Perceived North Korean realistic [domestic] threat predicted prejudice toward South Korea. Prejudice toward South Korea predicted negative stereotypes of North Korea, suggesting a mechanism by which prejudice generalizes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Collective narcissism and anti-Semitism in Poland
AN  - 1023028885; 201223683
AB  - Two studies examined the relationship between collective narcissism-an emotional investment in an unrealistic belief about the greatness of an in-group (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson, & Jayawickreme, 2009) -- and anti-Semitism in Poland. The results indicate that this relationship is simultaneously mediated by (a) a belief that the in-group is constantly threatened by hostile intentions of other groups (Polish siege beliefs; Bar-Tal & Antebi, 1992a, 1992b) and (b) a belief that the Jews are a particularly threatening out-group because they secretly aim to dominate the world (the conspiracy stereotype of Jews; Bergmann, 2008; Kofta & Sdek, 2005). These results confirm that collective narcissism predicts prejudice against social groups perceived as threatening. Collective narcissists' sensitivity to intergroup threat is composed of beliefs about vulnerability of the in-group and hostility of the out-group.

T1  - Third-person Effect and Hostile Media Perception Influences on Voter Attitudes toward Polls in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 896187990; 201120532
AB  - Focusing on the milestone 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, this study explores how perceived impact of polls is influenced by one's social comparison groups and perception of media hostility. Results, using survey data of 541 respondents, show that respondents perceived others as more vulnerable than themselves to the influence of election polls. Even though all of the published polls consistently indicated Obama's lead, some supporters of Obama and opponents of McCain reported that the polls were in favor of McCain. Most importantly, the third-person perception and the perceived poll bias were found to be associated with voters' attitudes toward restrictions on election polls and their intention to engage in campaign discourse.

T1  - Diversity Beliefs as Moderator of the Contact-Prejudice Relationship
AN  - 964196620; 201207188
AB  - Research on intergroup contact has recently begun to examine how individual differences moderate the reduction of prejudice. We extend this work by examining the moderating role of diversity beliefs, i.e., the strength of individuals' beliefs that society benefits from ethnic diversity. Results of a survey among 255 university students in the United States show that the relationship between contact and reduced prejudice is stronger for individuals holding less favorable diversity beliefs compared to those with more positive diversity beliefs. Likewise, the relationship between contact and perceived importance of contact is stronger for people with less favorable diversity beliefs. Together with previously reported moderator effects these results suggest that contact especially benefits people who are the most predisposed to being prejudiced. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Negativity and Outgroup Biases in Attitude Formation and Transfer
AN  - 919905251; 201201562
AB  - In an initial experiment, the behavior of one person had a stronger influence on implicit evaluations of another person from the same group when (a) the attitude was negative rather than positive and (b) the people were outgroup members rather than ingroup members. Explicitly, participants resisted these attitude transfer effects. In a second experiment, negative information formed less negative explicit attitudes when the target was Black than when the target was White, and participants were more vigilant not to transfer that negative attitude to a new Black person. Implicit attitudes, however, transferred to both Black and White targets. Positive information formed stronger positive explicit attitudes when the target was Black than when the target was White, and that evaluation transferred to another Black person both implicitly and explicitly. Even when deliberately resisting outgroup negativity in attitude formation and transfer, people appear unable to avoid it implicitly.

T1  - Intergroup contact and reduction of explicit and implicit prejudice toward immigrants: a study with Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises
AN  - 835111725; 201100074
AB  - A field study was conducted to test the effectiveness of intergroup contact (Allport, The nature of prejudice, 1954) as a predictor of explicit and implicit attitudes toward immigrants and to examine the processes driving its effects. Participants were Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises in Northern Italy who had daily contact with their immigrant workers. We tested a model in which contact ameliorated explicit attitudes, measured as support for social policies toward immigration, through reduced negative outgroup stereotypes. Furthermore, we predicted that contact would have a direct, unmediated effect on improved implicit attitudes toward immigrants, assessed with an Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., J Personal Soc Psychol 74:1464-1480, 1998). The results were fully consistent with predictions, thus providing strong support for the contact hypothesis at both an explicit and at an implicit level. The lack of correlation between explicit and implicit attitudes supports dual-process models, suggesting that the two types of attitudes are formed through different processes. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Does contact work in protracted asymmetrical conflict? Appraising 20 years of reconciliation-aimed encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians
AN  - 1915005494
AB  - In the past few decades, planned contact interventions between groups in conflict have played an important role in attempts at improving intergroup relations and achieving peace and reconciliation. This article focuses on such reconciliation-aimed intergroup encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians that seek to reduce hostility and increase understanding and cooperation between the two nationalities. Like other contact interventions conducted in settings of intergroup conflict, encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians represent a paradoxical project: this is a project that aspires to generate equality and cooperation between groups that are embedded in a protracted asymmetrical conflict. Though existing research teaches us valuable lessons on the effectiveness of contact conducted under optimal conditions, little is said about contact between groups involved in asymmetrical protracted dispute. The goal of this analysis is to examine the evolution of reconciliation-aimed contact interventions between Israeli Jews and Palestinians in the past 20 years. The research method is qualitative, relying on ethnographic data assembled during the relevant period of time. The findings identify and trace the evolution of four major models of Jewish--Palestinian planned encounters: the Coexistence Model, the Joint Projects Model, the Confrontational Model, and the Narrative-Story-Telling Model. The strengths and limitations of each model in transforming intergroup attitudes in asymmetric conflict are discussed.

T1  - Health Competence As Predictor of Access to Care Among Latinos in Baltimore
AN  - 199566986; 18060500
AB  - The goal of this study is to identify the underlying structure of Health Competence and its value as a predictor of access to care among the Latino population in Baltimore, Maryland. Data on a cross-sectional urban probability sample were collected from 330 foreign-born Latino men and women aged 21-75 years residing in Baltimore at the time of the survey. Principal components analysis yielded a two-component solution: the first component comprised "factors enabling" access to care; the second, "perceived barriers". When testing the predictive power of the Health Competence construct using model building and the log likelihood criteria the "enabling factors" added significantly (P < .005) to the power of the socio-demographic variables to predict access to care, making it an important tool for programs aiming to improve US Latinos' health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Discussing Depression with Vietnamese American Patients
AN  - 199541243; 19242803
AB  - Asian patients preferentially seek mental health care from their primary care providers but are unlikely to receive it. Primary care providers need culturally-informed strategies for addressing stigmatizing illnesses. Eleven Vietnamese American community members participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. The grounded theory approach was used for qualitative coding and thematic analysis. Vietnamese community members describe experiences with depression under four themes: 1. stigma and face, 2. social functioning and the role of the family, 3. traditional healing and beliefs about medications and 4. language and culture. Based on this data, we offer suggestions for improving culturally-informed care for Vietnamese Americans. Our study adds to the research aimed at improving communication and health care relationships between physicians and Vietnamese American patients. Physicians should learn to tailor their interviewing style to the increasingly diverse patient population.
