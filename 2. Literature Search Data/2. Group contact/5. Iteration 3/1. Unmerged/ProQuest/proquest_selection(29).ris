T1  - Stress and perceived discrimination among the Arab population in Israel: the mediation role of the perceived COVID-19 threat and trust in the healthcare system
AN  - 2694758705
AB  - During pandemics, minorities may experience high stress levels, which could harm their mental and physical health. However, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been examined among minorities in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study, therefore, explores stress among the Arab minority in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its association with the population’s perceived COVID-19 threat, trust in the healthcare system, adherence to preventative guidelines, and perceived discrimination.The study analyzed a cross-sectional online survey of 626 Israeli Arabs. Most participants (65%) reported moderate levels of stress, and 10% reported severe levels. The Bedouin population reported significantly higher levels of stress compared to other minority groups. The participants also reported a high degree of perceived threat, a moderate-to-high level of discrimination, a moderate level of trust in the healthcare system, and very high adherence to guidelines.Hierarchical regression analysis showed that age, religion, trust in the healthcare system, perceived threat, and adherence to guidelines were all significant predictors of stress [F(11,600), p < .001]. The model explained 24% of the variance in stress. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the participants’ perceived threat and trust mediated the association between their perceived discrimination and stress [indirect effect = 0.13, SE = 0.03 CI = (0.08, 0.18)], whereby discrimination was negatively associated with trust (β = −0.52), which, in turn, was negatively associated with stress (β = −0.10). Furthermore, discrimination was positively associated with perceived threat (β = 0.21), which, in turn, was positively associated with stress (β = 0.35). Discrimination is an important social determinant of health – especially during health emergencies when trust in healthcare systems and perceived threats are crucial. As such, our findings could assist policymakers in developing fair policies that are tailored to various population groups and that may reduce stress levels among minorities, thereby improving both their mental and physical health.

T1  - Pandemic threat and intergroup relations: how negative emotions associated with the threat of Covid-19 shape attitudes towards immigrants
AN  - 2695623549
AB  - Behavioural immune system theory predicts that attitudes towards immigrants become more hostile during times of increased threat from pathogens, as pandemic threat triggers aversive emotional responses, which in turn foster outgroup hostility. We test this notion in the context of the current Covid-19 crisis. Combining both original individual-level survey data of around 6,000 European respondents during the second Corona wave in winter 2020/2021 and regional data of pandemic threat in a multilevel design, we show that Covid-19 pandemic threat exposure in 105 European regions is indeed associated with more negative attitudes towards immigrants. Moreover, hierarchical path models indicate that Covid-19-induced anger fosters anti-immigrant attitudes, while we find no evidence that disgust as a pivotal avoidance-oriented emotion is crucial. In contrast to conventional wisdom, individuals reacting with fear to the pandemic hold more immigrant-friendly orientations. Taken together, our results indicate that the behavioural immune system (BIS) appears as a compelling obstacle to inclusive orientations. However, our findings challenge the notion that every emotion triggered by the BIS translates the pandemic threat into negative attitudes towards immigrants.

T1  - Looking at the ‘field’ through a Zoom lens: Methodological reflections on conducting online research during a global pandemic
AN  - 2661420697
AB  - For many social science scholars, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to re-think our approaches to research. As a result of new social distancing measures, those of us who conduct in-person qualitative and ethnographic research have faced significant challenges in accessing the populations and fields we study. Technology served as an incredibly useful tool for social interaction and research prior to the pandemic, and it has since become even more important as a way to engage with others. Although not all types of social research, or even all projects, lend themselves to online activities, digital communication platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Facebook have allowed many of us to continue our studies from a distance—in some cases, significant temporal and spatial distances away from our research sites. As such, it is important to consider how these different methodological approaches challenge our understandings of fieldwork. While the disadvantages of not physically accessing the places we study are clear, can mediated approaches offer (any) hope of the immersion we experienced with in-person fieldwork? If many of us are able to continue ethnographic research (in some form) without co-locating with our participants in our field sites, how are our studies fundamentally affected, as well as the ways we conceptualize the ‘field’ more largely? This paper explores these methodological and epistemological questions through reflections on conducting online research during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Partisanship, sexuality, and perceptions of candidates
AN  - 2691118456
AB  - Cultural debates over gay rights have prompted a great deal of scholarship assessing the nature and resiliency of citizen attitudes toward homosexuality in American political life. We posit, however, that more attention should be devoted to LGBT individuals themselves as potential office holders. Specifically, we argue that in an era of increased affective polarization and partisan sorting, party identification of candidates, as well as affectual and ideological attitudes of voters, must be integrated into analyses of the effects of sexuality as a voting heuristic. Drawing on social identity and subtyping theories, we contend that candidate sexuality will influence attitudes about some candidates, but not others. We then present the results of an original survey experiment in which candidate partisanship and sexuality are both manipulated. The data reveal substantial support of our theory: while sexuality is a relevant consideration in the candidate evaluation process, both partisanship of candidates and political attributes of voters can severely condition its effects.

T1  - Understanding the spatial variation of perceived threat outcomes in intergroup conflict: a case study of the ethnic and religious conflicts in Jos, Nigeria
AN  - 2652420947
AB  - In extant scholarship on intergroup conflict, perceived threat is portrayed as either positively linked with conflict occurrence or neutralizable by individuals’ internal psychological inhibitors, such as feelings about a past experience or encounter or pre-existing dovish disposition. Yet, conflict avoidance is possible even in the absence of such internal guardrails against destructive responses to threat. This comparative qualitative study of two similarly structured communities in Jos, Nigeria’s ethnic conflict hotbed, reveals that while perceived threat may create aggressive dispositions, as established in extant scholarship on intergroup conflict, conflict avoidance remains possible in the absence of both internal inhibitors and external coercion. The compared Jos communities, Angwan Doki and Dadin Kowa, are similar in terms of widespread fear of the outgroup and significant willingness to respond aggressively to threat. Yet, conflict avoidance was possible in the latter because its community leaders both wittingly and unwittingly confronted the underlying threat that drove people’s violent dispositions. Past variability analyses omit this dynamic of external malleability of perceived threat outcomes – aggression and violence. Generally, the findings show that low-tech threat management interventions are more effective at mitigating intergroup conflict in weak states than interventions that seek to forcefully suppress the threat.

T1  - The Politics of White Identity and Settlers’ Indigenous Resentment in Canada
AN  - 2641350800
AB  - This article introduces White identity as an understudied concept in Canadian politics and compares how White settlers’ ingroup attachments and their outgroup attitudes—specifically, White settlers’ anti-Indigenous attitudes—shape Canadian politics. We find that White identity is associated with greater support for government spending on policies that disproportionately benefit White Canadians, such as pensions, whereas Indigenous resentment is associated with greater opposition toward government spending on policies that are often perceived as disproportionately benefiting Indigenous peoples, such as welfare. In Canada outside Quebec, both White identity and anti-Indigenous attitudes are associated with voting Conservative. In Quebec, White identity mobilizes support for the Bloc Québécois, while White settlers’ negative attitudes toward Indigenous peoples are not associated with vote choice.

T1  - Challenges to identity integration amongst sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men
AN  - 2618223727
AB  - Since the Stonewall uprisings, there has been greater social acceptance of homosexuality within Western contexts. Nevertheless, those who are at the intersection of more than one minority identity continue to face prejudice and discrimination, including homophobia and racism. Though there has been increasing work regarding the experiences of sexual minority people of colour (POC), a lacuna remains regarding the experiences of sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men and the integration of sexual minority and religious identities, particularly within a context of increased societal acceptance towards sexual minorities and societal Islamophobia. In this study, 38 sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men were recruited via snowball sampling and interviewed. Data were examined via reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: degrees of “outness”, hegemonic Whiteness and the LGBTQ+ community, internalisation of White hegemony, distancing from the sexual minority religio‐cultural ingroup, and attempting to reconcile potential identity conflict between sexual orientation identity and religious and cultural identities. Respondents' experiences highlighted substantial social exclusion due to intersectional disadvantage as well as a lack of intra‐community social support, suggesting substantial isolation, psychological implications and a general eschewing of identity affiliation based on sexual attraction. This has implications on services predicated on identity affiliation which may potentially exclude the needs of hidden and intersectionally disadvantaged populations.

T1  - The Blurred ‘Blue line’: a cross-national comparison of the sources of public support for extralegal policing
AN  - 2575710786
AB  - Prior research addressing extralegal policing has focussed on the types of individuals most affected by these practices (i.e. disadvantaged minorities and police officers) as a means to improve conditions for these populations. Although these studies are critical for educating the public and informing criminal justice policy, there remains a noteworthy gap in the literature related to the types of political and sociocultural circumstances under which extralegal policing practices endure. The current study will mitigate this gap by addressing two theoretically-informed sources of public support (i.e. conflict and procedural justice theories) for police misconduct within the United States and Latin America. Analyses of three countries from the 2012 AmericasBarometer survey revealed a strong, ongoing presence of support for extralegal policing, with approximately one quarter of U.S. and Brazilian respondents and nearly half of Argentinian respondents expressing favourable views. While the analyses illustrated varying levels of support for conflict and procedural justice theory mechanisms, these findings highlight the importance of working to improve empirical understandings of public support for extralegal policing as a means to identify the contexts in which support is generated for both violent and non-violent police misconduct internationally.

T1  - The Trump Effect: An Experimental Investigation of the Emboldening Effect of Racially Inflammatory Elite Communication
AN  - 2543259531
AB  - This article explores the effect of explicitly racial and inflammatory speech by political elites on mass citizens in a societal context where equality norms are widespread and generally heeded yet a subset of citizens nonetheless possesses deeply ingrained racial prejudices. The authors argue that such speech should have an ‘emboldening effect’ among the prejudiced, particularly where it is not clearly and strongly condemned by other elite political actors. To test this argument, the study focuses on the case of the Trump campaign for president in the United States, and utilizes a survey experiment embedded within an online panel study. The results demonstrate that in the absence of prejudiced elite speech, prejudiced citizens constrain the expression of their prejudice. However, in the presence of prejudiced elite speech – particularly when it is tacitly condoned by other elites – the study finds that the prejudiced are emboldened to both express and act upon their prejudices.

T1  - Partisan ideological attitudes: Liberals are tolerant; the intelligent are intolerant.
AN  - 2553023352
AB  - In this article we examine intolerance toward ideological outgroups, conceptualized as the negativity of the attitudes of liberals and conservatives toward their ideological outgroup. We show that conservatives are more ideologically intolerant than liberals and that the more intelligent are more ideologically intolerant than the less intelligent. We also show that the differences between liberals and conservatives and the differences between the more and less intelligent depend on ideological extremity: They are larger for extreme than for moderate ideologists. The implication of these results to questions regarding the relationship between intelligence and ideological intolerance and regarding the relationship between ideology and prejudice are discussed.

T1  - When multiracial individuals are the numerical majority: Children's racial attitudes in the Dominican Republic
AN  - 2553021567
AB  - The Dominican Republic is a uniquely valuable context in which to study children's racial stereotyping and prejudice, in part because multiracial individuals comprise the majority of the population and race is viewed largely as a continuous rather than dichotomous construct. In two studies, we use developmental and social theories to ground an exploration of Dominican children's racial biases. In studies 1 (n = 54; ages 6–11) and 2 (n = 122; ages 6–11), children were given measures of racial identity, preference, stereotyping, and/or status. As expected, children identified their own race in a manner consistent with others (e.g., their teachers). Across a variety of tasks, children failed to consistently favor members of a specific racial group-as indicated by differing levels of racial stereotyping and associations of social status with different races. They did, however, sometimes systematically express greater liking of individuals of mixed racial heritage, a finding that was contingent on the modality of assessment (i.e., whether race was framed as a continuous vs. dichotomous category, and measured via nonforced vs. forced-choice methods). Implications for current theories of racial attitude development are discussed.

T1  - Whiteness, Anti-Blackness, and Trauma: A Grounded Theory of White Racial Meaning Making
AN  - 2547567729
AB  - This constructivist grounded theory study reveals nine interrelated components that describe white undergraduates' processes for making meaning of issues of race and racism in their environments. Findings also reveal how these processes perpetuate whiteness and anti-blackness. I present the theory as a composite counternarrative that draws upon data from 31 white undergraduate students and foregrounds Black students' experiences with racism on campus. The resulting juxtaposition highlights how whiteness and anti-blackness, on a spiritual level, function as pathologies that perpetuate trauma.

T1  - Reducing prejudice toward Syrian refugee children: A vicarious contact intervention among Turkish elementary school children
AN  - 2493134673
AB  - We conducted an experimental intervention to test the effectiveness of vicarious contact in the relationship between Turkish and Syrian elementary school children; the participants were Turkish children. We used a mixed‐methods approach, investigating effects by using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Participants in the experimental condition were asked to read stories on positive contact between Turkish and Syrian children over the course of six weekly sessions. The results revealed that vicarious contact, compared to a control condition where participants did not engage in any activity, led to greater intentions to help outgroup members. Importantly, effects only emerged among children who reported higher initial negative outgroup attitudes. Results from qualitative data revealed that vicarious contact produced richer, more positive, and complex representations of the relationships and friendships between groups. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

T1  - Humility and Bridging Differences: A Systematic Literature Review of Humility in Relation to Diversity
AN  - 2499393062
AB  - Psychologists' interest in humility has increased in recent years. This paper provides the first review on the role of humility in the context of diversity. The results of the nine studies reviewed here, which were identified through a systematic literature search, show a lack of agreement among researchers on the conceptualisation of humility and how it can be measured. Additionally, humility has been found to be associated with less prejudice towards Syrian refuges, sexual minorities and religious groups. It also seems to play a positive role in the context of religious conflicts, disagreements and conflicting views. These promising findings on humility in relation to various domains of diversity are discussed, and the limitations of this review and recommendations for future research are provided.

T1  - Assessing psychosocial conditions for social reintegration of former Maoist combatants and communities in Nepal
AN  - 2478753030
AB  - While the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration literature emphasises that social reintegration of ex-combatants is key to sustainable peace, few analyses exist, leading to limited understanding of reintegration dynamics and subsequently ad hoc programme design. We examined the psychosocial conditions faced by 223 ex-combatants from the People’s Liberation Army and 213 host community stakeholders in Nepal in 2012 and 2013, specifically investigating the relation between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), factional ties and Readiness to Reconcile in ex-combatants. Despite ex-combatants’ positive attitudes and perceptions of their host communities, many struggled to generate an income. Ex-combatants who were likely to suffer from PTSD reported lower readiness to reconcile with former enemies. Having factional ties did not impact willingness to reconcile, but was associated with reduced PTSD. Most community stakeholders positively regarded the arrival of these ex-combatants. However, a minority expressed alarm about political differences, war grievances and ex-combatants’ problematic behaviour. Critical activities identified to facilitate social reintegration are psychosocial trauma support and counselling, social interaction and peace education programmes and continued socio-economic support for both communities and ex-combatants.

T1  - Moving beyond the gender binary: Examining workplace perceptions of nonbinary and transgender employees
AN  - 2464333619
AB  - This study is one of the first to experimentally examine the workplace prejudice faced by nonbinary employees, or those who identify outside of the man/woman gender binary. Participants (N = 249) were presented with a vignette which included a description of a fictitious co‐worker’s sex and gender identity, and asked to rate the co‐worker’s likeability and perceived job performance. Results revealed that the assigned sex and the gender of hypothetical employees interactively impacted interpersonal and workplace perceptions. For individuals assigned male at birth, identifying as a man led to the most positive ratings, followed by identifying as a transgender woman, followed by identifying as a nonbinary person. This work expands upon gender schema theory and highlights some of the unexplored challenges faced by nonbinary and transgender employees. We end with suggestions for future research, such as incorporating qualitative data to highlight the unique experiences of these gender minorities in organizations.

T1  - The Afghan refugees of Lajpat Nagar: The boundaries between them and Delhi
AN  - 2484181310
AB  - The political and social implications of the refugee crisis have positioned refugee studies as a crucial discipline to understand politics in contemporary times. This article aims to contribute to the discipline by exploring the example of a community of Muslim Afghan refugees in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi, India, and studying their ‘refugee experience’ through the theoretical concept of ‘boundaries’ as developed by noted American sociologist Richard Alba. The article studies the various aspects of the segregation of the refugee community by focusing on the different constituents of the boundary separating them from the citizens. The article initially discusses legal boundaries, that is the legal marginalization of refugees in general and Muslim refugees in particular by the Indian state. Through the perceptual boundary, which involves the negative perception held among citizens towards the refugee community and vice versa, social distance between the citizens and the refugee community is widened. The spatial boundary, which is the de facto ghettoization of the refugee community to a certain geographical space, forces the citizens and refugee communities to maintain minimal contact with each other. Through the linguistic boundary, further conditions leading to reduced social contact are created. In the presence of so many intersectional boundaries, this article showcases how the boundaries are sometimes blurred, and how aspects such as food or commerce can help the process of boundary breaching. The study of boundaries, their formation, effect and permeability also throws light onto other important aspects of the lives of members of the refugee community – their perception regarding mainstream Indians, their daily problems and challenges, aspirations and demands.

T1  - The Attitudes of Deconverted and Lifelong Atheists Towards Religious Groups: The Role of Religious and Spiritual Identity
AN  - 2455774501
AB  - Increasing atheism, or the view that there is no God, is a major trend affecting the Western religious landscape. Scholarly interest in atheists has grown together with their number, but unanswered questions abound. In this study, we present survey data (N = 758) collected from deconverted and lifelong atheists in four countries (Australia, Finland, Germany, and Norway), and investigate the relationships between deconversion, religious identity, spiritual identity, and interreligious attitudes. We show that retaining a low level of religious or spiritual identity is more typical for deconverts than life-long atheists. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher religious or spiritual identity among deconverts is associated with more positive attitudes toward different religious groups (national religious majority, religious minorities in general, and Muslims specifically).

T1  - Could a rising robot workforce make humans less prejudiced?
AN  - 2453786249
AB  - Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences-including racial and religious differences-may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies (ΣN = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5–6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them.

T1  - Perceived Discrimination and Mental Distress Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From the Understanding America Study
AN  - 2449985975
AB  - Introduction This study examines COVID-19–associated discrimination regardless of infection status. It evaluates the contribution of various risk factors (e.g., race/ethnicity and wearing a face mask) and the relationship with mental distress among U.S. adults in March and April 2020, when the pandemic escalated across the country. Methods Participants consisted of a probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. residents aged ≥18 years who completed COVID-19–related surveys online in March and April (n=3,665). Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the probability of a person perceiving COVID-19–associated discrimination. Linear regression was used to analyze the association between discrimination and mental distress. Analyses were conducted in May 2020. Results Perception of COVID-19–associated discrimination increased from March (4%) to April (10%). Non-Hispanic Black (absolute risk from 0.09 to 0.15 across months) and Asians (absolute risk from 0.11 to 0.17) were more likely to perceive discrimination than other racial/ethnic groups (absolute risk from 0.03 to 0.11). Individuals who wore face masks (absolute risk from 0.11 to 0.14) also perceived more discrimination than those who did not (absolute risk from 0.04 to 0.11). Perceiving discrimination was subsequently associated with increased mental distress (from 0.77 to 1.01 points on the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire score). Conclusions Perception of COVID-19–associated discrimination was relatively low but increased with time. Perceived discrimination was associated with race/ethnicity and wearing face masks and may contribute to greater mental distress during early stages of the pandemic. The long-term implications of this novel form of discrimination should be monitored.

T1  - The development and validation of the Attitudes Towards Individuals Who Sell Sex Inventory (ATISS)
AN  - 2442807342
AB  - The attitudes of others towards individuals who sell sex (ISS) can have a significant impact on how the population is treated in interpersonal interactions and social systems. The current study outlines the development and validation of Attitudes Towards Individuals Who Sell Sex Inventory (ATISS), an instrument designed to reliably and validly assess attitudes towards ISS. The authors present three studies outlining the development and validation of the ATISS. Study 1 revealed a four-factor structure across 21 items including social distance, human value, impact on society, and parenting. Study 2a and 2b revealed sufficient construct, convergent, and discriminant validity for the ATISS including adequate test-retest reliability. Findings indicate that the ATISS is a psychometrically sound instrument to measure attitudes towards ISS.

T1  - Participation of People With Impairments in Seniors' Organizations: Conditions and Limitations on Inclusion
AN  - 2451553699
AB  - Background and Objectives While older adults' social participation has attracted sustained attention, the realities faced by seniors with impairments in this area are still understudied. Social representations are formed from socially constructed opinions regarding a given object and have four functions (knowledge, identity, orientation, justification). The purpose of this article is to document the social representations that exist within seniors' organizations regarding participation by older people with impairments. Research Design and Methods In this mixed-methods study, an exploratory sequential design was applied. First, a qualitative phase involved meetings with five focus groups to explore how participants would manage difficult situations in which the inclusion of an older person with impairments must be addressed. Second, a quantitative phase consisted of a questionnaire administered to 86 respondents to examine the components of social representations about the participation of older people with impairments. Results Results show that, although research participants acknowledge that all seniors have the right to participate, this right confronts a collective identity infused with aging model that demands a youthful, "un-disabled" appearance and activities. In terms of the orientation function, making participation a reality is seen as relying on the efforts of people with impairments, but when there is a failure of inclusiveness, the reasons offered to justify it concern the resources available, rather than possible prejudices. Discussion and Implications Interpretation of the results leads to recommendations for both implementing an inclusion philosophy and practices in seniors' organizations and revisiting the view of impairment in old age as otherness.

T1  - Ambivalent Homoprejudice towards Gay Men: Theory Development and Validation
AN  - 2410668403
AB  - Myriad social groups are targets of hostile and benevolent (i.e., ambivalent) prejudice. However, prejudice toward gay men is typically conceptualized as hostile, despite the prevalence of benevolence toward gay men in popular media. This article aims to compare gay men with other targets of ambivalent prejudice (i.e., women and elderly people) and draw on the stereotype content and microaggressions literatures in order to develop a theory of ambivalent homoprejudice. The resultant framework, comprising repellent, adversarial, romanticized, and paternalistic homoprejudice was investigated using seven focus groups of heterosexuals and gay men (N = 22), and the findings were consistent with stereotype content theory. Directions for future research into the deleterious effects of ambivalent homoprejudice and possible empowering interventions are discussed.

T1  - DEMOGRAPHIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN SUBORDINATES AND LEADERS AS PREDICTOR OF LEADERS' OBSERVED CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE
AN  - 2427545197
AB  - In post-apartheid South Africa, organisations strive to be gender, race and culturally neutral. However, the similarity-attraction and the in-group bias hypotheses acknowledge that individuals tend to judge those similar to them, or belonging to the same group, favourably compared to those who are members of out-groups. This research aims to measure the prevalence of in-group bias within the workplace through assessing whether subordinates who are similar to their leaders evaluate them as equally competent to engage in advantageous interaction across cultures, compared to leaders who differ from them in terms of demographic characteristics. Data was collected in South African organisations, typified a by a multicultural workforce and a history of racial segregation and gender discrimination. Cross-sectional data was collected on the demographics of subordinates and their leaders, as well as subordinates' perceptions of their leaders' cultural intelligence (CQ). Gender, race, as well as gender combined with race, were used to create in and out-groups. Analyses of variance were performed to compare the measured CQ of groups of leaders (segregated by gender and race), as perceived by similarly differentiated groups of subordinates. It was found that gender similarity did not result in in-group bias, but rather that race introduced in-group bias. In-group bias was found amongst Black employees, in general, and also in Black male and female employees separately, who rated their in-groups more positively than their out-groups. The same bias was not observed amongst White employees. Conclusion: In-group bias, based on race, continues to exist in post-apartheid South Africa, as assessed when considering the CQ of leaders. However, the presence of in-group bias amongst Black South Africans employees regarding CQ may be rooted in the fabric of the South African community, where Blacks may be culturally more intelligent, based on the fact that many Blacks are multilingual and most Whites bilingual, a circumstance that may directly affect the actual levels of CQ. This, however, does not explain the absence of bias within the White group.

T1  - Regulating emotions under exposure to negative out-group-related news material results in increased acceptance of out-groups
AN  - 2391192799
AB  - Negative emotions affect the acceptance of out-groups. Here, we investigated whether modifying negative emotions would affect perceptions of out-groups. We experimentally manipulated the use of two emotion regulation strategies: suppression of emotional expression and cognitive reappraisal, the latter involving reframing a situation to mitigate its emotional impact. Using a population-based sample (N = 317), we conducted an online randomized controlled trial. Participants regulated their emotions while reading threatening news about out-groups. Not only reappraisal, but also suppression increased immediate acceptance of out-groups. The effect of reappraisal was partly mediated by decreased disgust, suggesting unique effects of reappraisal on this emotion. In the suppression condition acceptance decreased at high levels of habitual emotion regulation, whereas reappraisal showed an opposite tendency. Previous research may have underestimated the importance of different emotion regulation strategies on prejudice, and that relatively simple interventions can affect prejudice. The findings are of interest to prejudice prevention programs.

T1  - Structural Encounters, Meaning Making, and Self-construction: The Reproduction of Chinese Petitioners from a "Normalization" Perspective
AN  - 2544275819
AB  - Existing literature on Chinas system of petitioning (xinfang) usually takes a perspective of institutional change or social problematization, understanding it as either a malfunctioning institution or an indicator of governance crises. This article utilizes a normalization perspective instead, seeing xinfang as an understandable, even rational practice of specific individuals. Based on participant observations in Dongzhuang Beijing, and in-depth interviews with petitioners in the neighborhood, this article aims to reveal the social mechanisms involved in the so-called normalized xinfang, suggesting that structure and agency are weaved together in this process of reproducing motives and perceived realities, which then leads to the continuation of xinfang practice. The article contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of how individual petitioners persevere through multiple crises in their encounters with structural socio-political realities via meaning making and self-construction. Our study helps uncover the somehow neglected micro foundation of the macro level dilemma of enduring xinfang in China.

T1  - Not Quite Monoracial: Biracial Stereotypes Explored
AN  - 2348215501
AB  - Stereotypes often guide our perceptions of members of social groups. However, research has yet to document what stereotypes may exist for the fastest growing youth demographic in the United States—biracial individuals. Across seven studies (N = 1,104), we investigate what stereotypes are attributed to various biracial groups, whether biracial individuals are stereotyped as more similar to their lower status monoracial parent group (trait hypodescent), and whether contact moderates these stereotypes. Results provide evidence of some universal biracial stereotypes that are applied to all biracial groups: attractive and not fitting in or belonging. We also find that all biracial groups are attributed a number of unique stereotypes (i.e., which are not associated with their monoracial parent groups). However, across all studies, we find little evidence of trait hypodescent and no evidence that the tendency to engage in trait hypodescent varies as a function of contact.

T1  - A View of the Disaster and Victory from below: Serbian Roma Soldiers, 1912–1918
AN  - 2511165640
AB  - The Kingdom of Serbia fought in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918. These events merged into a devastating experience of an all-out war, completely reshaping all aspects of contemporary life. As the first centenary of these events has recently shown, the memories of wartime still play a very prominent role in the Serbian national narrative. By 1915 around 20% of Serbian combatants belonged to some of the country’s minorities. Second class citizens on the social margins of society, the Serbian Roma constitute those whose wartime history is the least known to research and the public. However, the wartime diaries kept by Serbian soldiers are full of causal references to their Roma fellow combatants. This article provides an overview of the duties Roma soldiers played in the war, based on the perspective of Serbs who were fighting alongside them. The article tackles the general image and the position of the Roma population in the Kingdom of Serbia. In addition, the horrific challenges the war created for Serbian society are tackled from the perspective of those who were, already in peace time, in the most disadvantageous situation socially and economically. Overall, despite the unifying experience which the wartime suffering imposed on all citizens of the Kingdom, the old prejudices towards the Roma survived after 1918.

T1  - Personal and Societal Factors on Prejudice against Aboriginal People, Immigrants, Racial Minorities, and Refugees among Churchgoers in Australia
AN  - 2477271206
AB  - Psychology research on prejudice and religion has predominantly examined the personal factors associated with prejudice, with limited attention to societal factors. The present study analyzed data from the 2011 National Church Life Survey (NCLS) of churchgoers in Australia aged 15 years and over (N = 1,910; MAge = 54.3 years; SD = 19.2 years; range = 15 to 96; 61.0% women; 68.5% native-born) to determine the associations between personal and societal factors on prejudice against Aboriginal people, immigrants, racial minorities, and refugees. Findings showed that both personal and societal factors were associated with prejudice among churchgoers. For personal factors, the experience of church worship, Catholic denomination, and private religious commitment were negatively associated with prejudice. In addition, the immigrant status of the churchgoers was differentially associated with prejudice against Aboriginal people. Specifically, those born in other English-speaking countries were less prejudiced against Aboriginal people, compared to native-born churchgoers. In contrast, those born in non-English-speaking countries were more prejudiced against Aboriginal people than native-born churchgoers. For societal factors, the association between religious diversity and prejudice depended on the immigrant status of the churchgoers. Overall, religious diversity in the church neighborhood was negatively associated with prejudice against immigrants. Compared to the native-borns, immigrant churchgoers from both English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries were more prejudiced against immigrants, controlling for the religious diversity of the church neighborhood. Results are in line with the assertion that an integration of micro-level individual and interpersonal processes with macro-level societal factors represents a fruitful area for future research in prejudice.

T1  - The impact of religiousness on attitudes towards religious others
AN  - 2409875193
AB  - Based on data from the Austrian Social Survey 2018, this article analyzes to what extent attitudes towards religious others are influenced by one’s relationship with religion. Five aspects of religiosity and attitudes to religion are taken into account: church-related religiosity (religious belief and practice), spirituality (engagement with alternative spiritual methods), religious fundamentalism, positive or negative perceptions of the role of religion in society, and religious denomination. The key findings are: engagement with spiritual methods and viewing religion as beneficial for society correlate with positive ratings of religious others. People with fundamentalist religious convictions are less open to religious others. Members of religious minorities in Austria (Protestants, Orthodox Christians and Muslims) have more positive attitudes to religious others than members of the dominant Catholic Church. How members of different world religions are rated depends on whether the religion in question is perceived as undogmatic and peaceful or as fundamentalist and intolerant in the public discourse.

T1  - Do Latinos still support immigrant rights activism? Examining Latino attitudes a decade after the 2006 protest wave
AN  - 2377706263
AB  - The historic and primarily Latino 2006 immigrant rights protest wave occurred in response to proposed federal anti-immigrant legislation (H.R. 4437). Research on the unprecedented series of demonstrations suggests that the draconian and racialized nature of the bill helps explain why it incited large-scale collective action. Utilising a new survey with a considerable oversample of Latino respondents, the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), this paper investigates the role that collective identities, racialisation, and social networks play in Latino support for contemporary immigrant rights activism. To do so, we incorporate measures such as linked fate, perceptions of anti-immigrant sentiments, knowing undocumented people, and concerns about immigration enforcement policies. The results of our analysis indicate that some of the same factors that influenced Latino engagement in the 2006 mobilisations, such as identity and racialisation, concerns over enforcement, and social networks, continue to impact Latino support for contentious politics on behalf of the foreign-born. We also find evidence that political party and past protest activity, play a significant role in explaining levels of support for activism. Our results have important implications for understanding how anti-immigrant policies and racialized nativism influence Latino support for contentious politics.

T1  - The nation as the cradle of nationalism and patriotism
AN  - 2330941541
AB  - This paper argues against dismissing as ‘populist nationalism’ every positive view of one's nation and ignoring patriotism as its antithesis. The European nation exists in two senses: as a large ‘social group’, a community of real people, and as an abstract community of cultural values promoted by intellectual elites grounded in a humanities‐based education. The widespread prejudice that condemns every positive expression of one's relationship to the nation has proved counterproductive because it has prompted ever stronger spontaneous reactions in the form of primitive nationalistic egoism. This has weakened the commitment people feel towards their nation and the humanistic potential that the nation possesses as a cultural community of values. Consequently, anti‐national European intellectual elites bear some responsibility – along with those preaching neoliberal individualism – for the success of populist demagogues and the decline in patriotic values. Given the state of education today, a revival of humanist culture for national elites seems impossible, making the continued rise of primitive nationalism appear unstoppable.

T1  - When Can Exemplars Shape White Racial Attitudes? Evidence from the 2012 U.S. Presidential Campaign
AN  - 2431020183
AB  - Prior research finds that exposure to outgroup exemplars reduces prejudice, but it has focused on most-likely cases. We examine whether salient outgroup exemplars can reduce prejudice under more challenging conditions, such as when they are counter-stereotypical but not well-liked, and the audience is heterogeneous and holds strong priors. Specifically, we assess the impact of the Obama exemplar under the less auspicious conditions of the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Using panel data, we find that racial prejudice declined during the campaign, especially among Whites with the most exposure to Obama through political television. Liking Obama proved irrelevant to these effects, as did partisanship. Racial prejudice increased slightly after the campaign ended, but the effects remained largely intact weeks later.

T1  - Systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis of teaching students developing classroom materials
AN  - 2298095756
AB  - Multimodality has been a growing research interest in the field of applied linguistics. With the actor-network theory as an analytic framework, the purpose of the present study was to explore how university students of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) take advantage of both material and non-material semiotic resources while being involved in the process of developing classroom activities. Furthermore, the semiotic resources of these students including their language, gaze, and gesture were analyzed using systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA). To do this, using an ethnomethodology, we videotaped the interaction of a group of 6 TEFL students developing materials, for the improvement of learners' intercultural competence, on the topic of food. The findings indicated that the participants developed these materials as they interacted with each other, as human semiotic resources, as well as their digital tools, as non-human resources. In addition, while mainly expressing their mental processes, they also conveyed positive attitudes and built negotiation expanding space using their gesture with both fast and slow graduation. Their gaze was also engaged, directed at both the group members and objects developing the classroom activities.

T1  - A Crisis of Competence: Benevolent Sexism Affects Evaluations of Women’s Competence
AN  - 2174080475
AB  - People higher in benevolent sexism often outwardly endorse gender equality, but support men over women for challenging positions and experiences. Reflecting shifting standards (a tendency to evaluate stereotyped group members against within-category judgment standards), people higher in sexism may evaluate prominent women’s competence against a lower competency standard for women (who are stereotyped as less competent than men are), and not against a standard for men. Thus prominent women could be perceived as especially competent (versus other women), yet men might still garner ultimate support. Study 1 tested for this possibility using an ecologically valid example: the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Study 1 showed that benevolent (and not hostile) sexism predicted less opposition to Donald Trump’s candidacy and more positive attitudes toward the election outcome among 57 mostly female U.S. college students. Study 1 also showed that benevolent sexism positively predicted competence perceived in Hillary Clinton. To determine if this positive relationship reflected shifting standards, we manipulated the gender to which a prominent woman would be compared in Study 2 with 189 U.S. adults. Reflecting shifting standards, benevolent sexism related to evaluating women as more competent when they were evaluated against other women versus other men. Shifting standards also mediated a relationship between benevolent sexism and expecting lower female success. Using shifting standards may be one way that people higher in benevolent sexism might evaluate prominent women as especially competent, yet ultimately support men.

T1  - Sexual Identities and Racial Attitudes among Black, Latinx, and White Individuals
AN  - 2299052586
AB  - Some recent studies suggest that lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people are generally more racially progressive than heterosexuals. However, the findings of these "political distinctiveness" studies are up for some debate. Other studies find no sexuality gaps in racial attitudes, and these studies overlook the possibility of bisexual people having unique racial perspectives. These distinctiveness studies also ignore the possibility of racial and sexual identities influencing racial attitudes at the same time. In using the American National Election Survey of 2016 as a data source (N = 3,987), this work found limited and conditional support for a sexuality gap in racial attitudes. In most cases, heterosexual people and sexual minorities converge in their racial interpretations, but there are some cases of stark differences between heterosexual individuals and lesbian-gay counterparts. Finally, an analysis of intersecting identities displayed some instances where the impact of a sexual identity varied by a person's racial background. For example, Black and Latinx bisexual people did not perceive racism or internalize racial stereotypes at especially high levels, but Latinx bisexual individuals were more supportive of Black protests against the police than Black bisexual individuals.

T1  - Racialization and Black multiplicity: Generative paradigms for understanding Black immigrants
AN  - 2253666984
AB  - Black immigrants occupy a liminal space on the race ethnicity spectrum that defies traditional assimilation theories. The social distancing paradigm has emerged as one of the most influential theories to address this shortcoming in the field and explain the incorporation of Black immigrants. However, because this paradigm implicitly rests on an analogy to White immigrants, the articulation of Black ethnic options can often times be more derivative than generative. As a result, accounts of Black immigrant racialization reify provincialized notions of Blackness by relying on problematic comparisons to African American culture and outcomes. In this paper, I argue that moving away from these provincialized characterizations of Blackness requires building on theories of immigrant racialization that take Black multiplicities as its starting point. This review takes up that perspective in analyzing how narratives of Blackness emerge in segmented, classic, canonical, and neoclassical theories of assimilation. I then map out some theoretical and empirical trends that emerge across three waves of Black immigrant research agendas and outline the need to move beyond the White immigrant analogy in order to more aptly redefine Black immigrants for future research.

T1  - Contact theory in the workplace: The case of Jewish–Arab contact in Israel
AN  - 2187744612
AB  - Contact theory is a fundamental theory in social psychology, suggesting that contact between antagonistic groups can reduce prejudice and stereotypes. The current study applies former studies in evaluating a specific case of the connection between contact and attitudes toward minorities in work contexts. A survey was conducted using 873 Israeli Jews in order to assess their attitudes toward the Arab population in Israel and Arabs' work characteristics. The results indicated that the connection between intergroup contact and attitudes is complex. On the one hand, workplace contact between Israeli Jews and Arabs was significantly correlated with the willingness to meet Arabs in and outside the workplace and to perceive Arabs in a less threatening way. However, contact during work was not significantly correlated with the participants' general attitude toward the Arab population. In addition, contact during work was not found to be significantly correlated with the participants' perceptions about Arabs' personality traits or work characteristics. The results of this study also suggest that attitudes toward Arabs' work characteristics have a strong connection to other dimensions of attitudes toward Arabs, even more than the impact of contact during work.

T1  - Motivational Orientations and Organizational Citizenship Behaviors: The Moderator Role of Perceived Discrimination in the Brexit Context
AN  - 2546933920
AB  - The current study aims to explain how motivational orientations influence organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) through organizational identification considering the moderator effect of perceived discrimination. A sample of 286 Spanish immigrants in the United Kingdom was included. Main conclusions support that learning orientation shows a significant direct relation with OCB. Both performance and performance-avoid goal orientation have a statistically significant impact on OCB, and this impact is mediated by organizational identification and moderated by perceived discrimination. The practical implications of the study and its possible limitations are discussed.

T1  - Cross-Ethnic Self-Disclosure Buffering Negative Impacts of Prejudice on International Students' Psychological and Social Well-Being
AN  - 2188843694
AB  - Intergroup contact theory suggests that developing a close relationship with outgroup members ameliorates the negative impact of prejudice that individuals perceive from outgroup members. This article specifically investigates the moderating role of cross-ethnic self-disclosure in the link between international students' perceived ethnic/racial prejudice and depression as well as loneliness. One hundred and forty-three international students in Japan were asked to rate their perceived prejudice, depression, and loneliness as well as their self-disclosure to host nationals. The results showed that self-disclosure buffers the negative effects of prejudice on depression and loneliness such that international students who were more likely to disclose themselves to host nationals were less likely to be influenced by prejudice. Theoretical and practical contributions are considered.

T1  - Understanding sexual prejudice: The role of political ideology and strategic essentialism
AN  - 2166665277
AB  - Despite the increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBTQ community, sexual minorities continue to face prejudice and discrimination in many domains. Past research has shown that this prejudice is more prevalent among those holding conservative political views. In two studies, we merge strategic essentialism and motivated ideology theoretical perspectives to empirically investigate the link between political orientation and sexual prejudice. More specifically, we examine how conservatives strategically use different forms of essentialism to support their views of gay individuals and their reactions to messages aimed at changing essentializing beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 220), we demonstrate that conservatives endorse social essentialism (i.e., the belief that gay and straight people are fundamentally different from each other) more than liberals do. In turn, they blame gay individuals more for their sexual orientation and show more prejudice toward them. At the same time, conservatives endorse trait essentialism (i.e., the belief that sexual orientation is a fixed attribute that cannot be changed) less than liberals do, which in turn predicts greater levels of blame and prejudice for conservatives relative to liberals. In Study 2 (N = 217), we additionally show that conservatives, but not liberals, are resistant to messages aimed at increasing trait essentialism and reducing prejudice toward sexual minorities. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

T1  - Negotiating Identity and Belonging through the Invisibility Bargain: Colombian Forced Migrants in Ecuador: IMR
AN  - 2266907650
AB  - This article argues that an “invisibility bargain” constrains migrants’ identities and political participation, demanding their economic contributions plus political and social invisibility in exchange for tolerance of their presence in the host country. In response, migrants negotiate their visible identity differences, minimize social distance from the host population, and build informal coalitions with non-state brokers to avoid citizen backlash against overt political activism. Examining Colombian forced migrants in Ecuador, the article challenges state-centric governance approaches, underscoring migrant agency in negotiating identity to influence social hierarchies, coexistence, and human security. Its findings advance the broader understanding of migration in the Global South.

T1  - Racial Socialization Practices Among White American Parents: Relations to Racial Attitudes, Racial Identity, and School Diversity
AN  - 2117274895
AB  - This study examines racial socialization practices among White American parents (N = 154) of children aged 8 to 12 years, using both quantitative and qualitative measures, as well as the relations of racial attitudes, racial identity, and racial diversity of the schools that children attend to socialization practices. Responses on the qualitative socialization measure indicate that White parents are generally unlikely to discuss race or racism with their children in a direct, explicit fashion, even when the parents are responding to a situation in which racial bias is clear and salient. Parents with less biased racial attitudes were more likely to engage in color-conscious racial socialization and to present socialization messages that emphasized egalitarianism and the existence of racial discrimination. School diversity was generally unrelated to parents’ racial socialization strategies, with the exception of messages about preparation for bias against one’s own racial group.

T1  - Is social isolation a public health issue? A media analysis in Aotearoa/New Zealand
AN  - 2061801549
AB  - Recognition of the health effects of social isolation has led to the media framing it as a public health issue. In this paper, we examine how the media frame social isolation among older people and how the public respond to this framing. Using framing analysis, we analysed an online article, embedded video content and 369 comments posted in response to this article. The article used a recognisable public health framing to understand the causes of social isolation as structural, supported by a video which presented the private face of a public health problem. The online comments largely resisted this framing, arguing that social isolation reflected an individual deficit, best remedied through individual actions such as joining groups or having a positive attitude. Families were also viewed as responsible for the social lives of their members, and social isolation was attributed to neglectful families. Commenters also suggested that alleviating social isolation was the responsibility of neighbours and volunteers. These three arguments accounted for 88% of the comments. Much less commonly, social isolation was described as due to the march of Western civilisation. This analysis shows how the public are active in their response to, and largely rejection of, framing social isolation as a public health issue. Although the health impacts of social isolation were endorsed, this was insufficient for structural explanations to prevail. Public health campaigners need to understand how individualising accounts of health issues are used to undermine public health explanations so as to most effectively challenge them.

T1  - The Processes Underlying the Quality of Contact With the Primary Out-Group and In-Group Importance on Support for the Syrian Resettlement in a Post-Accord Context
AN  - 2110458557
AB  - The current sociopolitical climate of Northern Ireland presents an intriguing setting to examine how, following a 30-year period of sectarian violence, individuals in a society of protracted intergroup conflict respond to other victimized groups. Syrian refugees were identified as the novel out-group due to the 2,000 Syrians refugees to be resettled in Northern Ireland through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme. This article was interested in understanding if the perceptions one has about the primary out-group in Northern Ireland, generalize to a novel out-group entering the setting. It was hypothesized that higher quality of contact with the primary out-group would be positively related to support for Syrian resettlement in Northern Ireland, whereas high in-group importance would be negatively related to this outcome. Moreover, the authors wanted to identify potential mechanisms through which the predictor variables influenced support for the Syrian resettlement. Participants (N = 378; M = 27.40, SD = 11.31 years; 70% female; 58% Catholic, 42% Protestant) were recruited from community groups, local businesses, and universities. The results of the chain mediation models indicated the quality of contact with the primary out-group and in-group importance were related (positively and negatively, respectively) with support for the Syrian resettlement via perspective taking and intergroup attitudes. These findings highlight that interventions to improve intergroup attitudes may facilitate support prior to and during resettlement. Application and relevance to social policies related to refugee resettlement are discussed.

T1  - What Buffers Ethnic Homophily? Explaining the Development of Outgroup Contact in Adolescence
AN  - 2100383519
AB  - Although literature provides strong evidence for the beneficial role of outgroup contact, longitudinal knowledge regarding the formation and change of outgroup contact remains improvable. Using a longitudinal, large-scale data set including 6,726 majority and minority participants (Mage 14.98 years at Wave 1; 55% female) from 4 western European countries that were followed in 3 waves over 2 years, we systematically examined the development of outgroup contact during adolescence and tested the role of hypothesized predictors (i.e., intergroup attitudes and social identity) for explaining this development. In the majority, growth curve models revealed consistent patterns of ethnic homophily characterized by a continuous decline of outgroup contact, whereas this negative growth was buffered by a positive change of intergroup attitudes and a negative change of national identity during adolescence. In contrast, in the minority, outgroup contact was characterized by higher mean levels and a nonlinear development (i.e., no systematic decline or increase) of outgroup contact. Findings highlight the developmental importance of adolescence for promoting positive intergroup relations, especially for the majority, and emphasize the usefulness of contact interventions with adolescent students in school.

AB  - Johansson et al discuss the kind of social interaction in Twitter with the #jesuisCharlie and the opinions of users about the typical tweets on the Charlie Hebdo attacks using mixed methods. They analyze the functions of hashtags and tweets in breaking global news events, stancetaking from the perspective of modality, and the characteristics of opinions in tweets. They conclude that the globally networked audience was not unified or like-minded and participants shared views and understanding of the news events while some even shared values.

T1  - Improving outgroup attitudes in schools: A meta-analytic review
AN  - 2055207508
AB  - To provide information for educators, educational psychologists, school psychologists, and social psychologists, we conducted a quantitative meta-analytic test of n = 50 studies dating from 1995 to 2015 that evaluated the effects of in-school interventions on attitudes toward outgroup members (defined as members of different ethnic or religious backgrounds or different age groups, persons with either physical or mental disabilities, or persons with other distinctive features). Overall, the analysis revealed a mean effect size of d + = 0.36 with a 95% confidence interval that ranged from 0.17 to 0.55, indicating significant, moderate intervention effects, supporting the proposition that meaningful changes in outgroup attitudes can be obtained by applying anti-bias programs in schools. Results from our analysis did not provide evidence that teacher-led interventions produce positive outcomes, yet we found that interventions delivered by researchers promote positive attitudes toward outgroup members. Further, a closer examination demonstrated that one-on-one interventions are most effective at tackling intergroup attitudes. However, classroom-wide programs are more likely to be introduced into regular school activities because of their efficiency and the limited resources available for interventions.

T1  - Does intergroup contact affect personality? A longitudinal study on the bidirectional relationship between intergroup contact and personality traits
AN  - 2011520651
AB  - We conducted a longitudinal study to test whether, in addition to being predicted by personality, intergroup contact is longitudinally associated with personality traits. Participants were 388 majority (Italian) and 109 minority (immigrant) first‐year high school students. Results revealed a bidirectional relationship between contact and personality: Quality of contact was longitudinally associated with greater agreeableness and openness to experience, whereas agreeableness and openness to experience were longitudinal predictors of contact quality. An unexpected negative longitudinal association also emerged between quantity of contact and agreeableness. These effects were not moderated by group of belonging (majority vs. minority). Our findings highlight the importance of integrating research on intergroup contact with research on personality.

T1  - Attitudes Toward and Beliefs about Transgender Youth: A Cross-Cultural Comparison Between the United States and India
AN  - 1985282116
AB  - Using an internet-based survey, we examined attitudes toward transgender youth in the United States and India, two cultures with differences in conceptualizations of gender and treatment of transgender individuals in society, law, and religion. We found generally positive attitudes toward transgender youth in our U.S. (n = 218), but moderately negative ones in our Indian (n = 217), sample. Consistent with the literature on prejudice against transgender adults in many Western societies, general social conservatism in the form of religious beliefs and political ideology, gender-specific conservatism in the form of gender binary belief, and endorsement of environmental rather than biological causes of transgender identity were the best predictors of U.S. participants’ attitudes, although personal contact with gender and sexual minorities also played a role at the bivariate level. These findings suggest that the processes underlying prejudice against transgender youth are similar to those that foster adult-directed transphobia in that cultural context. In contrast, religion-based disapproval and environmental causal attributions were the best predictors of Indian respondents’ attitudes, whereas gender binary belief played only a minor role, and political conservatism and personal contact no role at all. Our regression analyses accounted for considerably more of the variability in U.S. than in Indian participants’ attitudes, highlighting the need for additional (qualitative) work to identify the factors that promote transprejudice in India. We discuss these findings in light of cross-cultural differences between the two countries in terms of our predictors and consider implications for efforts to reduce prejudice against transgender youth.

T1  - Subtle and Severe: Microaggressions Among Racially Diverse Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1984384877
AB  - In recent years, understanding prejudice and discrimination toward minorities has developed to include the investigation of microaggressions. Microaggressions are brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities. They are intentional or unintentional and communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights toward racial and sexual minorities. The purpose of this phenomenological study is to chronicle the prevalence and type of microaggressions experienced among a sample of 18 highly educated and racially diverse sexual minorities, 24-65 years of age. The impact of microaggressions on physical and psychological health is central to our investigation. Thematic data analysis was used to analyze 14 interviews and one focus group, which resulted in the following themes of microaggressions: (a) discomfort/disapproval with LGBT experience, (b) assumption of universal experience, (c) traditional gender role stereotyping, (d) denial of personal privacy, (e) exoticization, (f) ascription of intelligence, (g) policing bodies, and (h) assumption of criminality. Research findings may have implications for the development of interventions that can serve clinicians in their therapeutic work with microaggressed sexual minorities across racial diversity.

T1  - Bringing “T” to the table: understanding individual support of transgender candidates for public office
AN  - 2571083524
AB  - Of central importance to groups is the representation of their interests in government. A direct strategy for representation is to elect officials that identify with the group. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) movement has increasingly been successful in fielding LGB candidates for local, state, and national offices, even though these candidates face barriers. But while many lesbian and gay candidates have achieved electoral success, few transgender candidates have run for office and even fewer have won. Our project examines the hurdles faced by transgender candidates and provides a predictive analysis of a unique 2015 national survey that queried American adult respondents about hypothetical transgender candidates for different political offices. We hypothesize that although transgender candidates are likely to be opposed by potential voters that would also oppose female, African-American, or gay or lesbian candidates, for transgender candidates, there is a stronger influence of respondent disgust sensitivity and gender nonconformity. The findings largely support our arguments. We conclude that transgender candidates are in a similar electoral position to gay and lesbian candidates, with likely supporters fitting a profile that is similar to the Democratic voter base. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of minority group symbolic representation and democratic citizenship more broadly.

T1  - Tweetment Effects on the Tweeted: Experimentally Reducing Racist Harassment
AN  - 1928618790
AB  - I conduct an experiment which examines the impact of group norm promotion and social sanctioning on racist online harassment. Racist online harassment de-mobilizes the minorities it targets, and the open, unopposed expression of racism in a public forum can legitimize racist viewpoints and prime ethnocentrism. I employ an intervention designed to reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter. I collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use accounts I control ("bots") to sanction the harassers. By varying the identity of the bots between in-group (white man) and out-group (black man) and by varying the number of Twitter followers each bot has, I find that subjects who were sanctioned by a high-follower white male significantly reduced their use of a racist slur. This paper extends findings from lab experiments to a naturalistic setting using an objective, behavioral outcome measure and a continuous 2-month data collection period. This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced behavior.

T1  - Intergroup Contact: Using Storytelling to Increase Awareness of Lesbian and Gay Older Adults in Long-Term Care Settings
AN  - 1950061258
AB  - Due to societally imposed stigmatization, lesbian and gay (LG) older adults fear and prolong accessing long-term care (LTC) even though they need LTC at higher rates. Interventions that decrease negative attitudes toward LG older adults among LTC staff are a first step in addressing this problem. In this study, the influence of intergroup contact (IGC) on LTC staff members' attitudes toward LG was explored through the use of storytelling as a training mechanism. An embedded mixed-method approach was employed to collect and analyze responses of 60 LTC staff who participated in a storytelling event. Participants completed pretests, posttests, and participated in audio-recorded group discussions. The findings showed that storytelling had a significant (p =0.001) and positive effect (d =0.57) on participants attitudes toward LG. Qualitative analysis revealed 90 codes, 13 process codes, and 4 themes: making meaning of stories, seeking understanding, application to LTC setting, and debating. When guided by IGC theory, storytelling has potential for positively influencing attitudes of LTC staff members toward LG older adults. There is a need for longitudinal work to further test this model.

T1  - When Does Differential Treatment Become Perceived Discrimination? An Intersectional Analysis in a Southern Brazilian Population
AN  - 2406942163
AB  - Despite ideals of equality and “racial democracy,” high levels of social inequality persist in contemporary Brazil. In addition, while the majority of the Brazilian population acknowledges the persistence of racism, high proportions of socially disadvantaged groups do not regard themselves as victims of discrimination. This study seeks to shed light on this issue by investigating the processes through which individuals come to interpret their experiences of mistreatment as discrimination. We ask: (1) How frequently do respondents perceive being treated differently due to a variety of social statuses alone and in combination? and (2) What factors are associated with respondents interpreting this differential treatment as “discrimination”? Data come from an ongoing cohort investigation, which included a representative sample of adults living in the urban area of Florianópolis. Results show that 45 percent of respondents experienced mistreatment and attributed it to two or more factors, such as social class, age, gender, and race. Perceptions of mistreatment based on social class were positively correlated with perceived mistreatment due to gender, place of residence, weight, race, and the way one dresses. Regression analyses revealed that interpreting differential treatment as stemming from multiple social statuses was the strongest predictor of respondents classifying their mistreatment as discrimination. Our findings highlight the importance of disentangling perceptions of mistreatment from perceptions of discrimination and show that the relationship between the two is structured in large part by the ways in which individuals interpret their experiences at the intersection of multiple inequalities.

T1  - Dynamic Tuning of Evaluations: Implicit Racial Attitudes Are Sensitive to Incentives for Intergroup Cooperation
AN  - 1909307290
AB  - Three experiments tested the hypothesis that implicit preferences for racial ingroup members are reduced when external mechanisms are available to incentivize cooperation between individuals. Study 1 varied the presence (vs. absence) of a third-party punisher in a series of upcoming cross-group trust games. Studies 2 and 3 held the presence of a punisher constant, but varied the punisher's likely effectiveness at incentivizing cooperation by manipulating the punisher's group membership or whether the punisher's presence was common knowledge. The results of S1 and S2 showed that anticipating an effective third party punisher reduced racial bias on an intervening evaluative priming measure. S3 was more equivocal, but overall (and as indexed by a multilevel meta-analysis) the findings across studies provide evidence for situational tuning of rapid evaluative responses as a function of contextually variable cooperative affordances.

T1  - Talent identification and recruitment in youth soccer: Recruiter’s perceptions of the key attributes for player recruitment
AN  - 1889361548
AB  - Using the modified Delphi method, we aimed to understand the attributes youth coaches and recruiters perceive as important when identifying skilled youth performance at the entry level of representative soccer in Australia (i.e., Under 13 years). Furthermore, we also aimed to describe the current methods youth coaches and recruiters use to assess and identify these attributes in youth players. Australian regional youth technical directors and coaches (n = 20) completed a three stage process, including an initial interview and two subsequent questionnaires, whereby attributes and qualities associated with talent identification were rated and justified according to the importance for youth player performance and talent identification. Results indicate a hierarchy of attributes recruiters perceive as important for Under 13 soccer performance, including technical (i.e., first touch, striking the ball, one-versus-one ability, and technical ability under pressure), tactical (i.e., decision-making ability) and psychological attributes (i.e., coachability and positive attitude). In addition, the findings indicated attributes and qualities not emphasised within the talent identification process including, physiological, anthropometrical, sociological and several psychological attributes. It is suggested talent recruiters apply a holistic multidisciplinary approach to talent identification, with the current findings potentially providing initial evidence to suggest recruiters do consider numerous attributes when selecting and identifying youth players.

T1  - How Public Displays of Heterosexual Identity Reflect and Reinforce Gender Stereotypes, Gender Differences, and Gender Inequality
AN  - 1811056580
AB  - Heterosexual marking occurs when people behave in ways that are interpreted by others as evidence of heterosexuality. In an exploratory comprehensive study of this phenomenon, we conducted 12 focus groups with 57 individuals: four groups composed of heterosexual women, four composed of heterosexual men, and four composed of mixed-gender sexual minorities. In this article, we present our findings on participant conceptions of heterosexual marking that are related to gender stereotypes, gender differences, and gender inequality. Much of the heterosexual marking described by our participants reflects and reinforces stereotypes that equate gender conformity and heterosexuality. Our data suggest that heterosexual marking by men/boys and women/girls differs in several ways, including gender conformity, sexual prejudice, extent of marking, and types of marking. Furthermore, some aspects and types of heterosexual marking described by our participants reflect and reinforce gender inequality. As a result, our discussion notes some problematic implications of the heterosexual marking we describe, including rendering gender non-conformity among heterosexuals invisible and unacceptable, supporting discrimination against gender non-conformity, and more directly reinforcing gender inequality.

T1  - Perceived discrimination amongst young people in socio-economically disadvantaged communities: Parental support and community identity buffer (some) negative impacts of stigma
AN  - 1786772553
AB  - There is increasing acceptance that children are not unaware of when they are targets of discrimination. However, discrimination as a consequence of socio-economic disadvantage remains understudied. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of perceived discrimination on well-being, perceptions of safety and school integration amongst children growing up within socio-economically disadvantaged communities in Limerick, Ireland. Mediation analysis was used to explore these relationships and to examine the potential role of parental support and community identity in boys and girls in the 6th to 9th year of compulsory education (N = 199). Results indicate perceived discrimination contributed to negative outcomes in terms of school integration, perceptions of safety and levels of well-being. Age and gender differences were observed which disadvantaged boys and younger children. All negative outcomes were buffered by parental support. Community identity also protected young people in terms of feelings of school integration and risk but not in terms of psychological well-being. Findings are discussed in terms of the different role of family and community supports for children negotiating negative social representations of their community.

T1  - Amaya: Dialogic Literary Gatherings Evoking Passion for Learning and a Transformation of the Relationships of a Roma Girl With Her Classmates
AN  - 1751005687
AB  - Roma girls are one of the most invisible social groups within the educational system. Beliefs derived from social prejudice and from nonscientific perspectives suggest that they have little motivation and willingness to learn. However, successful educational actions based on scientific evidence developed in many schools demonstrate a very different reality. This is the case of Amaya, a 12-year-old Roma girl who lives in the poorest neighborhood of Tarragona (Spain) and who has suffered bullying perpetrated by her classmates. However, in the Dialogic Literary Gatherings (DLGs), Amaya found a place to enjoy reading books such as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or Twain's Tom Sawyer. This pleasure led to a radical transformation in her classmates' perceptions of her as well as in her own perception of her abilities. Through Amaya's biography, the author explore how the DLGs become a space where children's desire to continue their studies are strengthened and future dreams, such as Amaya's aspiration to become a doctor, are shaped.

T1  - Multiculturalism on Its Head: Unexpected Boundaries and New Migration in Singapore
AN  - 1724872546
AB  - This study investigates how discourses of multiculturalism shape public debates surrounding new migration in Singapore. Singapore's immigration policies led to the influx of Chinese and Indian professionals, many of whom share race and class identities with local Singaporeans. However, Singaporeans of Chinese and Indian backgrounds rejected these presumed similarities, using discourses of multiculturalism to differentiate themselves from co-ethnic migrants. Based on a content analysis of news reports and online forums, this study shows how local actors portrayed new migrants as too prejudiced or bigoted to adapt to Singapore's multiracial society, thereby creating a paradoxical application of multicultural ideals. This example highlights how contemporary immigration is creating diverse forms of inclusion and exclusion within migrant-receiving nations, challenging models, and policies of multiculturalism based solely on ethnicity and race. This paper also demonstrates how individuals can utilize the discourse of multiculturalism in forwarding their own interests and concerns. Scholarly debates have often portrayed multiculturalism as an ideology or policy imposed by state institutions, where local actors are left to either resist or accommodate such ideas. In the Singapore context, individual Singaporeans transform discourses of multiculturalism, creating a counter-discourse that challenges state immigration policies.

T1  - Acting White? Black Young Adults Devalue Same-Race Targets for Demonstrating Positive-but-Stereotypically White Traits
AN  - 1748865854; 201600155
AB  - Previous research suggests that Black Americans dislike same-race peers for 'acting White, ' but the phenomena associated with acting White are not well-understood. This experiment tested the 'acting White' hypothesis. Specifically, a general population sample of N = 154 Black young adults viewed one of four profiles that varied the race and interests of a fictitious target. The results indicated that participants preferred more social distance from the Black target with stereotypically White interests than they did other targets. One implication of this finding is that the acting White effect likely occurs because stereotypically out-group traits are associated with a salient out-group and are therefore perceived as 'unseemly.'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The influence of threatening parental primes on mothers' versus fathers' policy preferences
AN  - 2571040516
AB  - Citizens' personal identity groups exert a powerful influence over their preferences, particularly when their identity-related interests are perceived to be under threat. In American political rhetoric, parents are an identity group frequently targeted with fear and anxiety in the hopes of attracting support for particular policies. In this paper, we argue that these appeals to parental concerns do not influence all parents in the same way. With an experimental study of a large sample of parents, we find that threatening parental appeals exert a greater influence on fathers' policy preferences than they do on mothers'. To explain this difference, we rely on existing theories that mothers consistently incorporate parenthood into their preference formation, thereby minimizing their susceptibility to parental priming. For fathers, on the other hand, the relevance of parenthood for preference formation is dependent upon contextual factors, like identity primes. With a second experiment, we find strong support for this mechanism. This research has important implications for the distinct ways in which mothers and fathers incorporate their parental identity in political decision-making. More broadly, we offer insight into when identity primes might cause variability of response within identity groups.

T1  - Diversity and Out-Group Attitudes in the Netherlands: The Role of Authoritarianism and Social Threat in the Neighbourhood
AN  - 2076975923
AB  - Previous studies have obtained divergent findings for the association between ethnic diversity and majority members' attitudes towards immigrants, suggesting that this relationship is moderated by individual or contextual difference variables. In a community sample of Dutch citizens (N = 399), we investigated the role of two potential moderators: right-wing authoritarianism and social threat in the local neighbourhood. Moreover, we assessed diversity and social threat in the neighbourhood with both subjective and objective measures. The results indicated that diversity was negatively related to positive attitudes towards immigrants among high authoritarians and among people experiencing their immediate environment as threatening. Conversely, diversity was positively related to out-group attitudes among low authoritarian individuals and among people residing in more secure neighbourhoods. The theoretical and practical implications of these person-environment and environment-environment interactions are discussed.

T1  - Investigating the effects of knowledge and ideology on climate change beliefs
AN  - 1660023296; 201505465
AB  - The divergence of public opinion and climate science in the English-speaking world, particularly the United States and Australia, has attracted a variety of explanations. One of the more interesting accounts, from a psychological perspective, is the influence of ideology on climate change beliefs. Previous work suggests that ideology trumps knowledge in shaping climate change beliefs. However, these studies have typically examined the influence of proxy measures of knowledge rather than specific climate change knowledge. The goal of the present research was to provide some clarification on the different influences of knowledge and ideology on beliefs about climate change. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between specific climate change knowledge, hierarchical and individualistic ideology, and climate change belief in a national sample (N = 335) of the Australian public. Contrary to research involving proxy knowledge measures, we found that people who had greater knowledge of climate change causes were more willing to accept that climate change is occurring. Furthermore, knowledge of causes attenuated the negative relationship between individualistic ideology and belief that climate change exists. Our findings suggest that climate change knowledge has the potential to positively influence public discourse on the issue. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Prejudice-reduction in Culturally Mixed Classrooms: The Development and Assessment of a Theory-driven Intervention Among Majority and Minority Youth in Finland
AN  - 1559006453; 201431839
AB  - The aim of this field experiment was to develop and assess an intervention promoting positive intergroup relations in culturally diverse schools. The intervention was based on extended contact and social learning and utilized behavioural journalism as its method. Intervention effects were assessed on out-group attitudes, perceived importance of future contact, perceived peer norms and intergroup anxiety among ethnic majority (N = 583) and minority (N = 214) youth in grades 7-9 in Finnish secondary schools (total N experimental = 388; total N control = 409). As a result of the intervention, both groups showed a tendency to perceive future intergroup contact as more important, and this effect was most notable for younger participants and girls. Prototypicality of in-group and out-group peer models contributed positively to intervention effects. However, unexpectedly, the intervention also increased experiences of intergroup anxiety among the oldest participants. The results are discussed taking into account the developmental stage of the youth studied. Besides critically assessing the effectiveness of the intervention, recommendations for improving theory-driven prejudice-reduction and for the development of future interventions in culturally diverse contexts are given.

T1  - The Role of Social Distress, Political Affiliation, and Education in Measuring Punitive Attitudes: Israel as a Case Study
AN  - 1748865069; 201600138
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the different factors that shape and facilitate punitive attitudes among Israeli public. Punitive attitudes were examined in respect to several demographic and environmental variables such as gender, level of religiosity, level of education, political affiliation, and victimization. In addition, social distress in respect to the political climate of the country was taken into consideration to examine the effect of 'historical' events on results reliability. Using a random selection, a sample of 471 Israeli respondents was examined at two different time periods (Wave I: 2008-2009 and Wave II: 2011). Results of the current study indicate that demographic characteristics as well as social distress are related to the manifestation of punitive attitudes among Israelis, and thus the study demonstrates the different factors that affect public attitudes toward crime and punishment in the Israeli context. Results are discussed in regard to policy, and recommendations are made for future studies. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Cleanliness/dirtiness, purity/impurity as social and psychological issues
AN  - 1728662622; 201533987
AB  - The issue of cleanliness in its clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies definitely has a social and cultural dimension. Some daily cleaning practices are indeed quite common actions in every culture and society, even if some differences in the frequency and quality of the practices and in the value attributed to them do exist. In this article, we will discuss how cleaning practices and contamination fears sink their roots in the social context and in cultural practices. In particular, we will explore the connections between one's own sense of cleanliness and attitudes of prejudice and intolerance toward other groups. First, the issue of cleanliness over the centuries and the exaggerations of cleanliness referring to individual psychopathology will be examined. Then, the psychosocial meaning of cleanliness will be considered in revealing the impact of the clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies on day-to-day social interactions with others.

T1  - EFFECTS OF HIV/AIDS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR: INTERPLAY OF PERCEIVED THREAT AND SELF-EFFICACY
AN  - 1567048441; 201435049
AB  - We examined how perceived threat affected attitude and behavior toward condom use with main and nonmain partners, among at-risk young adults with varying levels of self-efficacy. Participants were 170 heterosexually active, single students at a northeastern university in the United States. Exposure to HIV/AIDS public service announcements was found to increase perceived susceptibility, which facilitated a positive attitude toward condom use with main partners but not with nonmain partners. High self-efficacy promoted a positive attitude toward condom use with main partners, and condom use with main and nonmain partners. The interaction effects revealed that high, compared to low, self-efficacy motivated more condom use with main and nonmain partners when perceived susceptibility was lower.

T1  - Predicting ethnic and racial discrimination: A meta-analysis of IAT criterion studies
AN  - 1416405629
AB  - This article reports a meta-analysis of studies examining the predictive validity of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and explicit measures of bias for a wide range of criterion measures of discrimination. The meta-analysis estimates the heterogeneity of effects within and across 2 domains of intergroup bias (interracial and interethnic), 6 criterion categories (interpersonal behavior, person perception, policy preference, microbehavior, response time, and brain activity), 2 versions of the IAT (stereotype and attitude IATs), 3 strategies for measuring explicit bias (feeling thermometers, multi-item explicit measures such as the Modern Racism Scale, and ad hoc measures of intergroup attitudes and stereotypes), and 4 criterion-scoring methods (computed majority-minority difference scores, relative majority-minority ratings, minority-only ratings, and majority-only ratings). IATs were poor predictors of every criterion category other than brain activity, and the IATs performed no better than simple explicit measures. These results have important implications for the construct validity of IATs, for competing theories of prejudice and attitude-behavior relations, and for measuring and modeling prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - The association between media exposure of interracial relationships and attitudes toward interracial relationships
AN  - 1433108267
AB  - From an extended contact hypothesis (ECH) framework, mass-media portrayals of interracial relationships may encourage positive attitudes toward such relationships. Caucasian participants (N=218) indicated examples of media portrayals of Black-White interracial relationships, attitudes toward Blacks, attitudes toward interracial relationships, degree of identification with Whites, and the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. Supporting our hypotheses, extended contact with Black-White relationships via media portrayals was associated with more positive attitudes toward Blacks and interracial relationships. These relationships were mediated by the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. This study furthers understanding of ECH by including representations of dyadic relationships and suggests an avenue for the creation of interventions for improving attitudes toward interracial relationships.

T1  - The use of traits and contextual information in free personality descriptions across ethnocultural groups in South Africa
AN  - 1417522855; 201331782
AB  - The present study investigates the differences between 3 ethnocultural groups in South Africa in the use of traits and contextual information for personality descriptions and the interaction of these differences with social distance from the target person and with personality domains. Semistructured interviews asking for self- and other-descriptions were conducted with 1,027 Blacks, 84 Coloureds and Indians, and 105 Whites, representing the country's 11 official languages. In Part 1 we found similarities in the total set of categories used most often for personality description across the 3 groups -- traits, behaviors, preferences, and perceptions (over 86%), which were context-free (over 66%) -- as well as substantial differences between the groups in the relative use of these categories. In Part 2 we found that distance from the target person plays a role in cross-cultural differences in trait use and contextualization. In Part 3 we found significant interactions of culture with the use of traits and contextual information across agency-communion and 9 indigenous South African personality clusters similar to the Big Five. The responses of Blacks confirmed expectations for collectivistic groups (fewer traits and more contextualization) and of Whites for individualistic groups (more traits and less contextualization), and Coloureds and Indians had an intermediate pattern. The results are discussed in the framework of the trait and cultural psychology perspectives on personality. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Tracing Family, Teaching Race: Critical Race Pedagogy in the Millennial Sociology Classroom
AN  - 1464874890
AB  - The "millennial" historical moment presents fresh dilemmas for race-critical instructors. In addition to being well-versed in colorblind racial discourse, millennial students are socialized in a pop-cultural milieu that implies a more integrated, racially egalitarian world than exists in reality and includes claims that US society is now "post-racial". Millennials' enthusiastic consumption of race in an era of seeming progress leads them to assume an ever greater social distance between their generation and the relics of those they consider "real" racists, as well as between the former eras of de jure white supremacy, and the more racially meritocratic structure they presume exists today. In light of such obstacles, race-critical instructors must employ creative strategies to help students understand and identify their connections to larger, structural matters that create and sustain racial inequality at the systemic level. The author has introduced one successful approach, where students examine the social reproduction of racial inequality, by tracing their family histories of wealth and capital acquisition and transfer.

T1  - Racial composition of social settings, interracial friendship, and whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage
AN  - 1347783254; 201321499
AB  - This study examines the effect that the racial composition of neighborhoods, workplaces, congregations, and friendships has on whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage with blacks, Latinos, and Asians. Utilizing survey data drawn from a national probability sample, ordered logit regression models are estimated in order to (1) determine the effect of the racial composition of neighborhoods, workplaces, and congregations on white intermarriage attitudes, net of sociodemographic and ideological controls and (2) test for a mediating effect of interracial friendship. Greater presence of blacks, Latinos, or Asians in neighborhoods and congregations of whites predicts favorable attitudes among whites toward interracial marriage with each respective racial group. A higher proportion of Latinos in the workplace also predicts support for racial exogamy with Latinos. Many of these effects, however, are reduced when interracial friendship is included in models, suggesting that the effect of interracial contact on intermarriage attitudes is mediated by whether or not whites develop interracial friendships within settings of cross-race interaction.

T1  - Living with Kin in Lowland Horticultural Societies
AN  - 1373426725; 201329164
AB  - Postmarital residence patterns in traditional human societies figure prominently in models of hominid social evolution with arguments for patrilocal human bands similar in structure to female-dispersal systems in other African apes. However, considerable flexibility in hunter-gatherer cultures has led to their characterization as primarily multilocal. Horticulturalists are associated with larger, more sedentary social groups with more political inequality and intergroup conflict and may therefore provide additional insights into evolved human social structures. We analyze coresidence patterns of primary kin for 34 New World horticultural societies (6,833 adults living in 243 residential groupings) to show more uxorilocality (women live with more kin) than found for hunter-gatherers. Our findings further point to the uniqueness of human social structures and to considerable variation that is not fully described by traditional postmarital residence typologies. Sex biases in coresident kin can vary according to the scale of analysis (household vs. house cluster vs. village) and change across the life span, with women often living with more kin later in life. Headmen in large villages live with more close kin, primarily siblings, than do nonheadmen. Importantly, human marriage exchange and residence patterns create meta-group social structures, with alliances extending across multiple villages often united in competition against other large alliances at scales unparalleled by other species.

T1  - Why does ingroup essentialism increase prejudice against minority members?
AN  - 1364702309; 201323253
AB  - A study with British participants (N = 90) tested a potential mediator of the effect of essentialist beliefs about the national ingroup on prejudice against immigrants. Essentialist beliefs were defined as beliefs in genetic determinism, a basic assumption that group membership is "written in the blood" and that the groups' boundaries and characteristics are determined by genetic and/or biological factors. Essentialist beliefs were expected to play an important role in the formation of prejudice. They were predicted to be associated with a reduction in the perceived possibility of immigrants' adopting the mainstream culture. Further, it was expected that essentialist beliefs would be positively associated with perceptions of intergroup threat, which in turn would be associated with a stronger demand for immigrants adopting the mainstream culture. Taken together, essentialist beliefs were predicted to be associated with a greater discrepancy between the demand for and perceived feasibility of culture adoption. This discrepancy was hypothesized to mediate the effect of essentialist beliefs on prejudice against immigrants. Structural equation modeling analysis and mediation analysis supported the hypotheses, showing that essentialism attributed to the national ingroup results in people demanding something seemingly impossible from immigrants, and that this situation in which immigrants have little chance of fulfilling majority members' expectations results in prejudice against them. Thus, results show that perceptions of the ingroup are associated with attitudes to the outgroup, and they outline an explanatory mechanism for the positive correlation between essentialism and prejudice which has been found in previous research. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Stigma and Status: The Interrelation of Two Theoretical Perspectives
AN  - 1347783842; 201318488
AB  - This article explicates and distinguishes the processes that produce status orders and those that produce stigmatization. It describes an experimental study in which participants were assigned interaction partners before completing a task where they had opportunities to be influenced by the partners and opportunities to socially reject the partners. Results show clear influence effects of educational attainment and mental illness but no effects for physical disability. Social distance effects are present for mental illness and physical disability but not for educational attainment. Results additionally show that stigmatizing attributes combine with task ability in affecting influence and also suggest that task ability may reduce social rejection. These results indicate that stigmatizing attributes combine with status markers in a way similar to previously studied status attributes. The findings extend traditions of research on status and stigma while also having potentially important implications for strategies to reduce inequalities based on mental illness.

T1  - Foreign Wars and Domestic Prejudice: How Media Exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Predicts Ethnic Stereotyping by Jewish and Arab American Adolescents
AN  - 1283637696; 201305725
AB  - This study was based on the theory that adolescents view scenes of violent ethnic conflicts in the mass media through the lens of their own ethnicity, and that the resulting social-cognitive reactions influence their negative stereotypes about similar ethnic groups in their own country. We interviewed 89 Jewish and 180 Arab American high school students about their exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, their social cognitive reactions to it, and their stereotypes toward ethnic groups. Beyond the effects of ethnic identity, the degree to which adolescents identified with Israelis and Palestinians in the media was a key variable linking exposure to media depictions of the conflict and the implicit ethnic stereotypes they displayed about Jewish Americans and Arab Americans.

T1  - Temporal Distance and Discrimination An Audit Study in Academia
AN  - 1322726279; 201312374
AB  - Through a field experiment set in academia (with a sample of 6,548 professors), we found that decisions about distant-future events were more likely to generate discrimination against women and minorities (relative to Caucasian males) than were decisions about near-future events. In our study, faculty members received e-mails from fictional prospective doctoral students seeking to schedule a meeting either that day or in 1 week; students' names signaled their race (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Indian, or Chinese) and gender. When the requests were to meet in 1 week, Caucasian males were granted access to faculty members 26% more often than were women and minorities; also, compared with women and minorities, Caucasian males received more and faster responses. However, these patterns were essentially eliminated when prospective students requested a meeting that same day. Our identification of a temporal discrimination effect is consistent with the predictions of construal-level theory and implies that subtle contextual shifts can alter patterns of race- and gender-based discrimination.

T1  - Making contact. Generating interethnic contact for multicultural integration and tolerance in Amsterdam
AN  - 1322718506; 201312378
AB  - Interethnic contact is considered a potent tool for the generation of interethnic understanding and tolerance. This faith has engendered countless social projects that seek to stimulate contact between members of different ethnic groups under 'optimal conditions'. However, the academic literature does not stipulate how, if at all, these optimal conditions can be realized in real world interventions. This article investigates how the organizers of a number of Dutch projects for 'contact under optimal conditions' conceived of such contact and how these conceptualisations informed how projects were set up, executed and experienced. The analysis demonstrates that organizers conceived of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' as a natural autonomous process. Optimal conditions for this natural process were assumed to be guaranteed when project workers interfered as little as possible with the contact between participants. The 'natural' processes thus engendered were assumed to lead to the recognition of fundamental sameness between two ethnic groups and/or the recognition of the superficiality of their differences. In practice, however, projects were set up in ways that privileged the exchange of uncontroversial information on personal tastes and ethnic differences. Moreover, the emphasis on the dual recognition of fundamental sameness and superficial difference produced a discursive context in which the exploration of conflicts of interest was foreclosed. These results suggest that the notion of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' may in practice have connotations that lead to practices that reinforce, rather than challenge, existing prejudices and misunderstandings.

T1  - A Comparative and Exploratory Analysis of Socio-cultural Factors and Immigrant Women's Mental Health within a Canadian Context
AN  - 1010078721; 22223121
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of macro-level factors on immigrant and non-immigrant women's mental health status in a Canadian context. This study was part of a larger study examining women's quality of life in south eastern Ontario. Using survey research methods, data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 91 women of whom 66 identified their country of origin as other than Canada. Descriptive, bivariate and regression analysis of this data revealed that immigrant and non-immigrant women's macro-level predictors of mental health status vary. Overall, for immigrant women's perceptions of neighbourhood social cohesion was a stronger predictor influencing mental health status, while for non-immigrant women social support was more influential. Research with larger, representative samples should explore the findings to ascertain generalizability. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Culturally based lay beliefs as a tool for understanding intergroup and intercultural relations
AN  - 1125218408; 201240700
AB  - Dialectical thinking represents a constellation of culturally based lay theories about the nature of the world in which social objects are viewed as inherently contradictory, fundamentally interconnected, and in constant flux. In this paper, we argue that dialectical thinking gives rise to cultural differences in numerous social cognitive phenomena (e.g., stereotyping) that are known to influence intergroup and intercultural relations. Specifically, we present psychological evidence relating dialectical thinking to cultural (East-West) differences in social categorization, causal attribution, group perception, stereotyping, ingroup/outgroup attitudes, cooperative/competitive behavior, and cross-cultural adjustment and competence. Dialectical thinkers are hypothesized, for example, to be less vulnerable to essentialistic, rigid thinking about social groups and more open to stereotype change and intercultural adaptation. We note important topics in need of further investigation and offer predictions regarding possible cultural differences in as yet unexplored social cognitive domains. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Prejudice Against Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Coaches: The Influence of Race, Religious Fundamentalism, Modern Sexism, and Contact with Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1266146192; 201301027
AB  - In drawing from Herek's (2007, 2009) sexual stigma and prejudice theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among prejudice toward sexual minority coaches, religious fundamentalism, sexism, and sexual prejudice and to determine whether race affected these relationships. The authors collected data from 238 parents. Results indicated that Asians expressed greater sexual prejudice than Latinos and Whites, while African Americans expressed more religious fundamentalism than did Whites. There were also differences in the associations among the variables. For African Americans, sexism held the strongest association with prejudice toward sexual minority coaches. While for Asians and Whites, religious fundamentalism held the strongest association, contact with lesbian and gay friends was a significant predictor of prejudice for Asians, but not for the other groups. For Latinos, both religious fundamentalism and sexism were associated with sexual prejudice. The authors discuss the results in terms of theoretical and practical implications.

T1  - My Culture Made Me Do It: Lay Theories of Responsibility for Automatic Prejudice
AN  - 1221407596; 201243949
AB  - The present research examined the effects of egocentric motivations on individuals' explanations for how their automatic racial prejudices came into being. The majority of participants reported experiencing biased thoughts, feelings, and gut reactions toward minorities which they found difficult to consciously control, and they attributed such biases to cultural socialization. Of particular interest, ego-threatened participants were significantly more likely to attribute their automatic racial biases to their culture and significantly less likely to attribute such biases to themselves. Results suggest that attributing one's racial biases to cultural socialization can be a defensive, motivated process aimed at diminishing personal responsibility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beware of National Symbols: How Flags Can Threaten Intergroup Relations
AN  - 1037886651; 201230850
AB  - The present research examined effects of exposure to the German flag on outgroup prejudice in Germany. In agreement with social identity theory, we demonstrated that exposure to the German flag increased outgroup prejudice among highly nationalistic German respondents. This finding seems to contradict prior research illustrating that exposure to the US flag reduced outgroup prejudice among highly nationalistic American respondents. This contradiction is considered the result of various concepts Germans associate with the German flag compared to concepts Americans associate with the US flag. Practical implications for flag exposure are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Stereotypes as Justifications of Prejudice
AN  - 1912095894
AB  - Three experiments investigate how stereotypes form as justifications for prejudice. The authors created novel content-free prejudices toward unfamiliar social groups using either subliminal (Experiment 1, N = 79) or supraliminal (Experiment 2, N = 105; Experiment 3, N = 130) affective conditioning and measured the consequent endorsement of stereotypes about the groups. Following the stereotype content model, analyses focused on the extent to which stereotypes connoted warmth or competence. Results from all three experiments revealed effects on the warmth dimension but not on the competence dimension: Groups associated with negative affect were stereotyped as comparatively cold (but not comparatively incompetent). These results provide the first evidence that--in the absence of information, interaction, or history of behavioral discrimination--stereotypes develop to justify prejudice.

T1  - A Psychodynamic Perspective on the Negotiation of Prejudice Among Immigrant Women
AN  - 964192697; 201209652
AB  - The negotiation of prejudice among immigrant women has largely been unaddressed in the psychotherapy literature. In an increasingly pluralistic society, such as the United States, it is especially important to address needs of specific subgroups of women who experience racial and ethnic prejudice. Immigrant women are in a unique position to simultaneously encounter prejudice related to multiple aspects of social identity, such as gender, race, and ethnicity, contributing to feelings of marginalization. This article addresses the role of attachment related conflicts in immigrant women's negotiation of racial and ethnic stereotyping and discrimination, from a psychodynamic perspective. Implications of these conflicts for women's identity development are discussed. A clinical case vignette illustrates the complexity of addressing attachment and prejudice within and outside the therapeutic relationship. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Influence of School Demographic Factors and Perceived Student Discrimination on Delinquency Trajectory in Adolescence
AN  - 907929535; 201126008
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of school demographic factors and youth's perception of discrimination on delinquency in adolescence and into young adulthood for African American, Asian, Hispanic, and white racial/ethnic groups. Methods: Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), models testing the effect of school-related variables on delinquency trajectories were evaluated for the four racial/ethnic groups using Mplus 5.21 statistical software. Results: Results revealed that greater student ethnic diversity and perceived discrimination, but not teacher ethnic diversity, resulted in higher initial delinquency estimates at 13 years of age for all groups. However, except for African Americans, having a greater proportion of female teachers in the school decreased initial delinquency estimates. For African Americans and whites, a larger school size also increased the initial estimates. Additionally, lower social-economic status increased the initial estimates for whites, and being born in the United States increased the initial estimates for Asians and Hispanics. Finally, regardless of the initial delinquency estimate at age 13 and the effect of the school variables, all groups eventually converged to extremely low delinquency in young adulthood, at the age of 21 years. Conclusion: Educators and public policy makers seeking to prevent and reduce delinquency can modify individual risks by modifying characteristics of the school environment. Policies that promote respect for diversity and intolerance toward discrimination, as well as training to help teachers recognize the precursors and signs of aggression and/or violence, may also facilitate a positive school environment, resulting in lower delinquency.

T1  - "We'd Be Free": Narratives of Life Without Homophobia, Racism, or Sexism
AN  - 887054103
AB  - Stigma and social inequality deprive disadvantaged social groups of a sense of social well-being. Stress researchers have focused on prejudice-related events and conditions but have not described more intangible stressors experienced by sexual minorities. We use narrative methods to examine how sexual minorities experience stigma and social inequality as we focus on the more intangible stressors that are both pervasive and difficult to measure. Three themes emerged in the narratives of our ethnically diverse sample of 57 adult sexual minority women and men: (a) stigma deprived them of access to critical possibilities and opportunities; (b) stigma deprives them of safety and acceptance; and (c) despite this, the experience of stigma is also related to the adoption of a positive and collective orientation towards their stigmatized identities. Recognizing these stressors and related resilience can direct policy makers toward interventions that go even beyond eliminating prejudice by including goals to strengthen minority communities.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Behavioral Immune System (and Why It Matters)
AN  - 914767474; 201200121
AB  - Like many other animals, human beings engage in behavioral defenses against infectious pathogens. The behavioral immune system consists of a suite of psychological mechanisms that (a) detect cues connoting the presence of infectious pathogens in the immediate environment, (b) trigger disease-relevant emotional and cognitive responses, and thus (c) facilitate behavioral avoidance of pathogen infection. However, the system responds to an overly general set of superficial cues, which can result in aversive responses to things (including people) that pose no actual threat of pathogen infection. In addition, the system is flexible, such that more strongly aversive responses occur under conditions in which perceivers are (or merely perceive themselves to be) more vulnerable to pathogen infection. Recent research reveals many provocative implications -- for the experience of disgust, for extraversion and social interaction, for xenophobia and other prejudices, and for the origins of cultural differences.

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary: PROD
AN  - 1928282225
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - Attributional processes underlying imagined contact effects
AN  - 902083904; 201122119
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that mentally simulating positive intergroup encounters can promote tolerance and more positive intergroup attitudes. We explored the attributional processes underlying these effects. In our study participants who imagined intergroup contact subsequently reported greater intentions to engage in future contact, a relationship that was mediated by participants' attribution, to themselves, of a more positive attitudinal orientation towards outgroup contact. Consistent with this attributional account, the perspective taken when imagining the encounter qualified this effect. Participants who imagined the encounter from a third-person perspective reported heightened intentions to engage in future contact relative to control participants, while this was not the case when the encounter was imagined from a first-person perspective. These findings suggest that attributional processes are key to observing the benefits that accrue from imagining intergroup contact. We speculate that these attributions may distinguish the approach from extended and actual forms of contact and help researchers to further capitalize on the benefits of mental imagery for improving intergroup relations.

T1  - Mediated Intergroup Conflict: The Discursive Construction of "Illegal Immigrants" in a Regional U.S. Newspaper
AN  - 1928170803
AB  - Using an intergroup communication framework, this article examines how a newspaper in southeastern Virginia discursively constructs the "illegal immigrant" as a metonym for Latino immigrants. This mixed methods study traces the development of this newspaper discourse about illegal immigrants from1994 to 2006 using quantitative lexical analysis. It then shows how two local news events further instantiate an illegal immigrant metonymy influencing perceptions of Latinos, subsequent media discourse about immigration, and local immigration policies using critical discourse analysis. The quantitative findings suggest that news discourse focusing on (illegal) immigration tended to use lexical items low in optimism and commonality, consistent with out-group negativity. The qualitative findings show how two incidents involving "illegal immigrants" attached negative stereotypes to this category, which then potentially influenced perceptions of Latinos more broadly. This analysis shows some of the ways that media discourse influences perceived intergroup threats at the local and national levels.

AN  - 856403563; 201106830
AB  - In China, the organ supply is severely insufficient to cover all people on the waiting list for donated organs, and numerous patients die awaiting transplant. To achieve a better understanding of cadaveric organ donation in Chinese culture, this study examined 300 Chinese adults, in both Fujian Province and Macao, regarding attitudes towards organ donation, subjective norms about organ donation and traditional beliefs about the body and death, examining the influences of these factors on respondents' donation intentions. Multiple hierarchical regression results suggest that more negative attitudes, unfavourable norms and traditional beliefs lead to lower donation intentions. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Prospects for a European Identity
AN  - 1081863322; 201236309
AB  - In several respects, the EU represents both a novel system of quasi-supranational governance and a novel form of political community or polity. But it is also a fragile construction for it remains a community still in the making with an ambiguous sense of identity and within which powerful forces are at work. This paper has three main aims: first, to stress the shifting nature of Europe's geographical frontiers and assess whether cultural frontiers have remained more stable throughout time. In particular, it examines the main criteria, which have traditionally been employed when having to decide who should be included and excluded from Europe. A different question concerns the requirements for EU membership and the monopoly of the adjective "European" by the EU, which somehow has become to be identified with Europe. Second, to explore the prospects for the emergence of a European identity. Here, I argue that European identity stands as a "non-emotional identity" in sharp contrast with traditional forms of national identity associated with intense nationalist feelings. Third, through the analysis of the most recent Eurobarometer (annual survey of EU's public opinion) to examine the views of Europeans regarding the EU at a time of a major global economic crisis. To conclude, the paper explores the main challenges to be faced by a still incipient European identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Attitudes Towards Transracial Adoption: Measures and Correlates
AN  - 1018353976; 201212795
AB  - Scholars know little about attitudes toward transracial adoption, how to measure them, or why people hold the attitudes they do. We measure implicit and explicit attitudes towards transracial adoption. Explicit measures generally find support; implicit measures do not. We also look at correlations between transracial adoption attitudes and racial attitudes. These correlations vary for implicit and explicit measures. Racial bias is associated with explicit reluctance to adopt a black child. Color blindness, which we might expect to be correlated with positive attitudes toward transracial adoption, is associated with negative implicit evaluations of transracial families.

T1  - Global support for the death penalty
AN  - 764426285; 201066182
AB  - The recently released Gallup International 2000 Millennium Survey Poll collected data from individuals residing in 59 countries. The focus of this research was to analyze these data to examine whether the abolition movement has ushered in a new 'collective sensibility' about the death penalty or whether global attitudes toward capital punishment are characterized by deep divisions. The research assumes that the long-term stability of abolition will be assured when the vast majority of the citizens of the world oppose the use of the death penalty. The findings reveal that there are deep cleavages in worldwide support for capital punishment. The article highlights five divides in support for capital punishment and then separately discusses the results from the human rights and minority group threat analyses.

T1  - Multicultural Challenges for Restorative Justice: Mediators' Experiences from Norway and Finland
AN  - 743056449; 201034513
AB  - Since today's civil society in the Nordic countries is multi-ethnic, participants and mediators in restorative justice procedures often have diverse cultural backgrounds. This can lead to miscommunication, misunderstandings, and at worst re-victimization of the victim. This article aims to discuss the applicability of restorative justice theory and practices in cross-culture mediation with a focus on migrant minorities such as immigrants and refugees in Finland and Norway. On the basis of case studies and interviews with mediators, administrative mediation staff, and project leaders in countries, relevant issues such as communication processes, prejudices and stereotypes, the role of the mediator and mediation models are discussed. The study explains advantages of restorative justice for minorities in Norway and Finland as well as the need of safeguards. It demonstrates that restorative justice theory is a concept of conflict resolution that is more easily accessible for minorities from certain ethnic groups than from others. Finally, the value of restorative justice for the social integration of minorities is critically discussed. The purpose of this article is to draw attention to problems of restorative justice for ethnic migrant minorities, not to provide 'handbook solutions'. In the course of this research project, it became clear that more systematic research is needed, including the perspective of participants in mediations, in order to enhance appropriate restorative justice practices for migrant minorities in the Nordic countries.

T1  - Using the stereotype content model to examine group depictions in Fascism: An archival approach
AN  - 743060786; 201032873
AB  - The Stereotype Content Model (SCM) suggests potentially universal intergroup depictions. If universal, they should apply across history in archival data. Bridging this gap, we examined social groups descriptions during Italy's Fascist era. In Study 1, articles published in a Fascist magazine - La Difesa della Razza - were content analyzed, and results submitted to correspondence analysis. Admiration prejudice depicted ingroups; envious and contemptuous prejudices depicted specific outgroups, generally in line with SCM predictions. No paternalistic prejudice appeared; historical reasons might explain this finding. Results also fit the recently developed BIAS Map of behavioral consequences. In Study 2, ninety-six undergraduates rated the content-analysis traits on warmth and competence, without knowing their origin. They corroborated SCM's interpretations of the archival data.

T1  - Imagining intergroup contact reduces implicit prejudice
AN  - 743053342; 201026419
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that imagining intergroup contact can be sufficient to reduce explicit prejudice directed towards out-groups. In this research, we examined the impact of contact-related mental imagery on implicit prejudice as measured by the implicit association test. We found that, relative to a control condition, young participants who imagined talking to an elderly stranger subsequently showed more positive implicit attitudes towards elderly people in general. In a second study, we demonstrated that, relative to a control condition, non-Muslim participants who imagined talking to a Muslim stranger subsequently showed more positive implicit attitudes towards Muslims in general. We discuss the implications of these findings for furthering the application of indirect contact strategies aimed at improving intergroup relations. Adapted from the source document.
