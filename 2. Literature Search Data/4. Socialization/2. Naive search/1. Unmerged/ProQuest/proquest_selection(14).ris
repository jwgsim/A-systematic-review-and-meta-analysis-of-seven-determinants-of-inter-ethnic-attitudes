T1  - The Association between Social Dominance Orientation, Critical Consciousness, and Gender Minority Stigma
AN  - 2403185329
AB  - Transgender people are exposed to great amounts of discrimination and violence, but research has yet to fully understand what drives stigma towards this community. In this study, we hypothesized that social dominance orientation would be associated with greater gender minority stigma (i.e., stigmatizing views of transgender people), with this association mediated by higher levels of trait aggression and lower levels of critical consciousness. Data were collected online from 254 cisgender individuals (158 women, 96 men; M age = 30.81 years). Social dominance orientation was associated with higher levels of gender minority stigma. Trait aggression was not a significant mediator of this association. However, there was a significant indirect effect via lowered critical consciousness (B = 0.10, SE = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.17). Approaches that increase awareness about social hierarchies and systems of privilege will likely prove fruitful in facilitating social change in attitudes towards transgender people.

T1  - Imagined contact and mental illness stigma in an Asian context: Bolstering the effect and examining the impact of factual information
AN  - 2400268190
AB  - Imagined contact can be effective at reducing social stigma. However, the effect may depend on the strength of the stigma held. We tested the robustness of imagined contact in an Asian setting where stigmatization of mental illness is stronger than in Western countries. In Experiment 1 (n = 167) with five conditions, only an enhanced version of positive imagined contact was able to decrease stigma towards people with schizophrenia through decreasing intergroup anxiety. Given the potential discrepancy between imaginations and reality about experiences with stigmatized groups, in Experiment 2 (n = 121), we tested the hypothesis that after presenting participants with factual information about a mental illness group, imagined contact might backfire, resulting in more negative perceptions. However, enhanced imagined contact alongside factual message about schizophrenia did not increase stigma. The backfiring hypothesis was therefore not supported. Nevertheless, providing realistic information did negate the positive effects of enhanced imagined contact on stigma reduction. In both experiments, we also showed that intergroup anxiety mediated the effect of enhanced imagined contact on various measures of stigma.

T1  - Transforming Diffifficulties into Possibilities: Family Training as an Action for Educational Success in Contexts of Poverty
AN  - 2391220705
AB  - This research focuses on the implementation of a series of actions and training workshops with families of a school located in a socially excluded area in the city of Cordoba, Spain. The study explores how the participants perceived the experience and the educational and social benefits of this formative process. The research methodology was based on a participatory action research approach, which involved successive cycles of research and action in different phases: planning and analysis of the problem, action, observation and reflection. Five key informants, selected according to the criterion of structural heterogeneity, participated in the research. Semi-structured interviews and field journals were used as research instruments and content analysis was the technique of choice to analyses the information. The results reveal that the participants found the workshops to be highly beneficial both personally and in terms of the image they project to their children. They also faced challenges regarding their continuity in the activity, such as prejudices or different communication codes. The discussion underlines the importance of conducting training activities with families in contexts of poverty as an educational action that can increase their interest and motivation towards the school and hence enhance their participation in school life.

T1  - Behavioural and socio-ecological factors that influence access and utilisation of health services by young people living in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Implications for intervention
AN  - 2389674043
AB  - Background 
Young people’s health service utilisation (the number accessing a facility) has been the focus of guidelines and health systems strengthening policies. This is due to young people being at an increased health risk because of inequitable access and utilisation of health services, which is more pronounced in rural settings with limited service availability. This is a major concern as globally, youth constitute a considerable and increasing part of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 Objective 
The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive approach for the exploration of health service utilisation by young people in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We examined barriers and facilitators conceptualised by the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, framed within a socio-ecological model.
 Methods 
Data were collected in January to June 2017 from two sites using in-depth interviews, spiral transect walks and community mapping with young people (aged 10 to 24 years), primary care health providers, school health professionals, community stakeholders and young people’s parents.
 Results 
Socio-ecological and behavioural factors influenced young people’s intention to use services. Barriers included perceived negative attitudes of health providers and perceived poor staff competencies. Facilitators included an appreciation of receiving health education and assumed improved health. At social and community levels, normative beliefs hindered young people from utilising services as they feared stigmatisation and gossip. At a public policy level, structural elements had a disempowering effect as the physical layout of the clinics hindered utilisation, limited resources influenced staffing, and facility opening times were not convenient for school goers.
 Conclusion 
We suggest that to fully appreciate the complexity of health service utilisation, it is necessary to not only consider factors and processes relevant to the individual, but also acknowledge and act upon, the disjuncture between community level cultural values, norms and national policies.

T1  - Who needs to solve the vegetarian men dilemma?
AN  - 2352170738
AB  - Rebranding men's dietary choices in the mind of the mainstream Australians to include more plant-based options, is a difficult task. Eating meat is a way to satisfy nutritional requirements but also has an embedded symbolism of power to which Australian men are accustomed. Vegetarian men are seen by the majority of the male population and the social discourse surrounding gendered food as betraying the social expectations about masculine behavior despite research showing the need for higher intake of fiber to reduce non-communicable diseases and improve planetary health. Those who have adopted vegetarian diets are exposed to ridicule and may face social isolation because of their unorthodox food choices. In order to reshape the meat consumption of men in Australia, we must recognize the gendered dynamics of dietary choices that associate meat consumption with masculinity.This research examines the power of the current food discourse and social constrains imposed on vegetarian men based on a 2019 survey in Sydney, Australia with 1053 male participants who have different frequencies of meat consumption. The participants were asked to express their opinion about vegetarian dietary choices, and the dominant view is that they provoke non-acceptance and various degrees of aversion. Instead of practicing overt dietary choices, those who embrace vegetarianism prefer to be unidentifiable as such to avoid social prejudice. While individual dislike may change over time, the current mass perception of vegetarianism is of unmanly behavior. A new role for institutions and policies related to public health, environmental wellbeing and use of resources in motivating a greater uptake of plant-based food choices, is also needed.

T1  - The social identity approach: Appraising the Tajfellian legacy
AN  - 2331728540
AB  - Since its original formulation, Tajfel’s Social Identity Theory (SIT) has broadened considerably from its original focus on intergroup relations and is now applied to a wide range of phenomena. Indeed, the ‘social identity approach’ has become one of the most widely used perspectives in contemporary social psychology. In this article, I examine the popularity of Tajfel’s writings on social identity and intergroup relations, especially over the last thirty years when they started to become more generally used. I offer a critical appraisal of the original SIT, both as a theory of intergroup relations and as a theory of identity, concluding that its real value lies in its success in offering an over‐arching perspective on the importance of groups in social life and its ability to stimulate new areas of research. I then widen the discussion to consider how the social identity perspective has been used in a number of other fields of enquiry.

T1  - All the lonely people, where do they all belong? An interpretive synthesis of loneliness and social support in older lesbian, gay and bisexual communities
TT  - An interpretive synthesis of loneliness
AN  - 2307086608
AB  - PurposeLoneliness is a phenomenon which affects people globally and constitutes a key social issue of our time. Yet few studies have considered the nature of loneliness and social support for older lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people; this is of particular concern as they are among the social groups said to be at greater risk. The paper aims to discuss this issue.Design/methodology/approachPeer-reviewed literature was identified through a search of Scopus, PsycINFO and PubMed. A total of 2,277 papers were retrieved including qualitative and quantitative studies which were quality assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme.FindingsIn total, 11 papers were included in the review and findings were synthesised using thematic analysis. The studies were conducted in five countries worldwide with a combined sample size of 53,332 participants, of whom 4,288 were drawn from among LGB communities. The characteristics and circumstances associated with loneliness including living arrangements, housing tenure, minority stress and geographical proximity.Research limitations/implicationsThe review suggests that among older LGB people, living alone, not being partnered and being childfree may increase the risk of loneliness. This cohort of older people may experience greater difficulties in building relationships of trust and openness. They may also have relied on sources of identity-based social support that are in steep decline. Future research should include implementation studies to evaluate effective strategies in reducing loneliness among older LGB people.Practical implicationsReaching older LGB people who are vulnerable due to physical mobility or rural isolation and loneliness because of bereavement or being a carer is a concern. A range of interventions including individual (befriending), group-based (for social contact) in addition to potential benefits from the Internet of Things should be evaluated. Discussions with the VCS suggest that take up of existing provision is 85:15 GB men vs LB women.Social implicationsFormal social support structures which were provided by voluntary sector agencies have been disproportionately affected by recent austerity measures.Originality/valueThe authors sought to interrogate the tension between findings of lower levels of social support and discourses of resilient care offered by families of choice.

AN  - 2430088371
AB  - In contemporary democracies, a political party typically needs good press to attract voters. A glum scenario for a party would be that news media systematically stigmatize it. To what extent does stigmatization lower its electoral support? This article examines voters’ reactions to news media coverage of the Dutch party PVV. Using a media content analysis linked to a 2014 panel survey of a sample representative of the Dutch electorate, we find that, among voters who held anti-immigrant attitudes, exposure to stigmatization lowered these voters’ perceived legitimacy of the PVV. This, in turn, decreased their propensity to vote for that party. This suggests that stigmatization can be a strong tool in the hands of those who intend to damage a party.

T1  - A Formative Qualitative Evaluation to Inform Implementation of a Research Participation Enhancement and Advocacy Training Program for Diverse Seniors: The DREAMS Program
AN  - 2234994400
AB  - This article reports on a formative qualitative evaluation conducted to identify potential barriers and facilitators prior to implementation of a two-part educational intervention designed to increase older adults’ participation in clinical research. We conducted focus groups with 35 older adults from diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds (Mean age = 74.5 ± 7.4 years), and six clinical researchers involved in aging research. Two older adult patient stakeholder advisors participated as members of the research team. Findings from thematic analysis showed that common barriers to research participation included older adults’ fear and mistrust of researchers and the medical community as well as misperceptions and negative attitudes about clinical research. A commonly held belief was that most clinical research is conducted by “greedy” pharmaceutical companies who are more interested in profits than finding cures for disease. Results provide useful insights regarding enrolling members of hard-to-reach older adult populations in clinical research.

T1  - Does Exposure to the Refugee Crisis Make Natives More Hostile?
AN  - 2213156781
AB  - Although Europe has experienced unprecedented numbers of refugee arrivals in recent years, there exists almost no causal evidence regarding the impact of the refugee crisis on natives’ attitudes, policy preferences, and political engagement. We exploit a natural experiment in the Aegean Sea, where Greek islands close to the Turkish coast experienced a sudden and massive increase in refugee arrivals, while similar islands slightly farther away did not. Leveraging a targeted survey of 2,070 island residents and distance to Turkey as an instrument, we find that direct exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives’ hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies. Since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility.

T1  - How the interplay of imagined contact and first‐person narratives improves attitudes toward stigmatized immigrants: A conditional process model
AN  - 2185683864
AB  - This article assesses the mechanisms whereby first‐person narratives featuring stigmatized immigrants improve outgroup attitudes and encourage intergroup contact among prejudiced individuals. We rely on a 2 (imagined contact vs. control) × 2 (similar vs. dissimilar message protagonist) experiment on a systematic sample of native British adults. Results show that encouraging imagined contact prior to reading a short testimonial featuring an immigrant protagonist who is similar to the recipients in terms of social identity enhances identification with the protagonist, thereby improving outgroup attitudes and encouraging intergroup contact, and especially strongly among those who are prejudiced toward immigrants (i.e., high on modern racism). Theoretical and practical implications of the findings for the work on imagined contact, narrative persuasion, and identification, as well as for public communication campaigns, are discussed.

T1  - Remediating Campus Climate: Implicit Bias Training is Not Enough
AN  - 2155524289
AB  - A common remedial response to a culture of racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of oppression on college campuses has been to institute mandatory implicit bias training for faculty, staff and students. A critical component of such training is the identification of unconscious prejudices in the minds of individuals that impact behavior. In this paper, I critically examine the rush to rely on implicit bias training as a panacea for institutional culture change. Implicit bias training and the notion of implicit bias it is grounded in is examined and the advantages and limitations of this approach is elaborated. An exclusive focus on implicit bias, it is argued, can protect ignorance rather than correct it. Similar to implicit bias, microaggressions is a concept that has played a role in campus diversity interventions. An examination of microaggression education demonstrates how it corrects for some of the pitfalls of relying on the concept of implicit bias to improve campus climate. The ambiguity that is characteristic of microaggressions, however, hints at the need to explore the type of “unknowing” that both implicit bias education and microaggression education attempt to remedy. Building on the recent scholarship around the idea of epistemic injustice, crucial insights can be gleaned about the significance of shifting the focus from lack of knowledge to a willful resistance to know. In the final section, some implications for improving campus climate are drawn out.

T1  - CONTESTED MEANINGS AND LIVED EXPERIENCES OF TWO-SPIRITNESS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE CANADIAN RESEARCH LITERATURE
AN  - 2448460557
AB  - The term "Two-Spirit" refers to Indigenous individuals embodying both male and female spirits. Two-Spirit individuals perform the social roles of medicine healers, priests, and shamans, who conduct spiritual rituals, in traditional Indigenous ceremonies and practices. While a few researchers conceptualize Two-Spirit individuals as a distinct social group with their own unique history of colonial oppression, most have considered Two-Spirit persons to constitute a trans or sexual minority subgroup. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of Canadian research conducted specifically on Two-Spirit people and their communities. The findings were categorized into themes, such as historical focus, transition to modern ideas, contemporary meanings of Two-Spiritness, discriminatory experiences of Two-Spirit people, and the Two-Spirit narratives of resistance in Canada. Two-Spirit identity emerged as a complex terminology, depending on the unique traditions of Indigenous cultures and individuals' subjective experiences of identity development, discrimination from home communities and mainstream society, and resistance. The strengths and limitations of this review as well as future research implications are outlined.Alternate abstract:Le terme "bispirituel" fait reference aux individus autochtones aux esprits et feminin et masculin. Ces individus bispirituels assument les fonetions de guérisseur, de prétre et de chamane, effectuant des rituels spirituels au cours de ceremonies et de pratiques autochtones traditionnelles. Si quelques chercheurs voient en ces individus bispirituels les membres d'un groupe social distinct ayant subí le colonialismo autrement que d'autres autochtones, la plupart voient en ces individus les membres d'un groupe minoritaire défini par une minorisation de ľidentité sexuelle. Cet article a done pour but d'offrir un coup d'oeil systématique sur la recherche canadienne portant sur les bispirituels et leurs communautés. On a categorise les conclusions en themes, teis que ľoptique historique, la transition vers les idées modernes, les sens contemporains du bispiritisme, les individus bispirituels face â la discrimination, et leurs traditions de resistance au Canada. Il en découle que ľidentité bispirituelle constitue une terminologie complexe dont la naissance depend des traditions uniques des cultures autochtones, de 1'experience et la variation identititaire variables de différents individus, de discrimation provenant des foyers ď origine de ces individus comme celle provenant de la société allochtone, et enfin de resistance. On donne un aper&ecedil;u des points forts comme des limites de eet examen de la recherche, et aussi des implications pour de futures recherches.

T1  - Teaching Clinical Psychology Trainees about Weight Bias
AN  - 2227903373
AB  - As an assistant professor who teaches clinical psychology trainees about social aspects of behavior, I devote one week to the topic of weight bias. In this class, I rely on the research literature to challenge common myths about "obesity," demonstrate the pervasiveness and harm of weight bias, and offer recommendations to trainees to apply to their own professional and personal lives. I encourage trainees to shift focus from weight and weight loss to health and well-being and to engage in self-reflection on the role of weight bias in their interactions with others. Here, I describe my weight bias seminar and outline common questions and my responses to them (e.g., Do you actually believe that "obese" people can be healthy?). Weight bias is a neglected topic in most clinical psychology training programs. Weight bias must be addressed in clinical psychology programs to produce culturally competent graduates who are aware of diversity issues.

T1  - Using Media Literacy to Counter Stereotypical Images of Blacks and Latinos at a Predominantly White University
AN  - 2206009096
AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations.

T1  - Black Female Pilot Communicative Experiences: Applications and Extensions of Co-Cultural Theory
AN  - 2206006412
AB  - The study investigates the ways in which Black female pilots experience and manage their elite status as airline transport pilots (ATPs) and as co-cultural group members. Accordingly, Orbe's (1998b) co-cultural theory is used as a frame to understand how women of color negotiate workplaces where White male cultural norms are omnipresent. Using a phenomenological approach, the communicative lived experiences of two Black female ATPs are analyzed to reveal specific co-cultural communication practices enacted. The study is offered here as a testament to engaged research-that which advances theory (i.e., extending co-cultural theorizing in a new setting) and provides pragmatic insight into important contemporary issues (i.e., increased diversity in a historically White male profession).

T1  - Introduction: European Social Policy and Society after Brexit: Neoliberalism, Populism, and Social Quality
AN  - 2161096834
AB  - The narrow referendum decision for British exit from the European Union (Brexit), and its explosive political consequences, has become a lens through which decades-long tensions in European society can be viewed. The result, which was expected to be a clear Remain victory, has been interpreted as various combinations of: the unleashing of xenophobic and racist anti-immigrant sentiment; a kick back against disinterested elites by ‘left behind’ people; the fermenting of nationalist populism by political and media actors; a clash of cultural values; a rejection of ‘market is all’ globalisation in favour of national borders; or as a reaction against austerity, inequality and insecurity (Corbett, 2016; Goodwin and Heath, 2016; Hobolt, 2016; Inglehart and Norris, 2016; Kaufmann, 2016; Pettifor, 2016; Room, 2016; Seidler, 2018; Taylor-Gooby, 2017). This British-made shock has parallels in and consequences for wider European society. In the Referendum, the EU became an emblematic representation of the distrusted, remote, technocratic elites, who are said to be responsible for an unbelievably large number of societal ills. Meanwhile across Europe there are varieties of Eurosceptic populism and distrust of elites on both the right and left (Ivaldi et al., 2017).

T1  - Four voices of refugee solidarity along the Balkan Route: An exploratory pilot study on motivations for mobilisation
AN  - 2148529954
AB  - Scathing critiques of the European response to what has been widely called a 'refugee crisis' are not in short supply. However, as many activist mobilisations and solidarities emerged along the Balkan Route, this is only one facet of the European response to forced migration. Having interviewed four migration activists from four countries along this route - Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary - this exploratory pilot study sought to investigate possible motivational factors for mobilisation in light of the fact that the participants had no prior experience in activism nor interest in the politics of migration prior to the European migration crisis. Through content analysis of interview transcripts, two factors emerged as having potential implications for mobilisation: media coverage and visibility of refugees. Hence, theories about the media effect and intergroup contact are used to explicate the findings. Possible future research avenues are proposed.

T1  - Changing public support for welfare sanctioning in Britain and the Netherlands: A persuasion experiment
AN  - 2049616962
AB  - During the last few decades, welfare sanctioning has come to play an increasingly central role in the institutional design of, and the philosophical and political approach to, most welfare states. Although much attention has been given to the morality and effectiveness of such policies, there is limited research that examines their social legitimacy. In this article we map public support for welfare sanctioning for unemployed people who do not want to accept jobs with wages or skill levels lower than their previous jobs. Our main contribution to the literature lies in the aim to discover how the social legitimacy of this policy can be increased or reduced by providing moral and economic counterarguments in a persuasion experiment. We use five waves of panel data administered in 2014–15 among approximately 9,000 respondents in Britain and the Netherlands. We show that support for welfare sanctioning is high in the two countries. Findings indicate that arguments opposing the policy reduce support to a greater extent than arguments in favor of the policy are able to improve its social legitimacy. We found moral arguments, considering the well‐being of unemployed people, to be more effective than economic arguments focusing on the effects of the policy on welfare spending. In Britain, people are more persistent in their support than in the Netherlands, which could be because the debate on this topic is more polarized in Britain. Also, people with higher political interests, higher education, and men are less likely to change opinions after being confronted with counterarguments.

T1  - 'Don't just look for a new pet': the Vietnamese airlift, child refugees and the dangers of toxic humanitarianism
AN  - 2031358145
AB  - The Kindertransport remains the most common historical point of reference in contemporary debates over the present position of refugees in Europe. Taylor's article instead focuses on a very different emergency movement of children-the airlift of ninety-nine 'orphans' from Vietnam before the fall of Saigon in April 1975-as a historical point of entry into Britain's relationship with child refugees. Although superficially a one-off event, and an example of 'toxic' humanitarianism, in fact it is suggestive of some of the key themes of modern refugee history. These include the tendency of humanitarianism to hollow out political contexts from the objects of their concern; the prominent, and sometimes problematic, role of voluntary organizations in the movement, reception and resettlement of refugees; and the place of expressions of spontaneous compassion by individuals who become involved in refugee operations. Taylor's article suggests that all these themes could fruitfully bear greater historical attention.

T1  - Truly, madly, deeply ... nostalgically? Britain's on-off love affair with refugees, past and present
AN  - 2031357047
AB  - Britain's response to the recent refugee crisis is marked by its absence. Kushner's article explores how constructions of the past have been instrumentalized by defenders of government restrictionism and those demanding that more should be let in. His particular focus is on child refugees and the comparisons drawn (and rejected) to the Kindertransport. Through discussion in parliament, the media, cultural productions and among ordinary people, he shows the importance of 'history' and how references to the Second World War and the Holocaust have tended to help justify rather than query the exclusion of today's refugees, thereby providing a very different example to Germany. He also explores the role of sentimentalism in positive responses to refugees and how this encourages empathy but can also limit effective entry policies and treatment of the forcibly displaced.

T1  - Stereotype Content: Warmth and Competence Endure
AN  - 2022453279
AB  - Two dimensions persist in social cognition when people are making sense of individuals or groups. The stereotype content model (SCM) terms these two basic dimensions perceived warmth (trustworthiness, friendliness) and competence (capability, assertiveness). Measured reliably and validly, these Big Two dimensions converge across survey, cultural, laboratory, and biobehavioral approaches. Generality across place, levels, and time further support the framework. Similar dimensions have emerged repeatedly over the history of psychology and in current theories. The SCM proposes and tests a comprehensive causal theory: Perceived social structure (cooperation, status) predicts stereotypes (warmth, competence), which in turn predict emotional prejudices (pride, pity, contempt, envy), and finally, the emotions predict discrimination (active and passive help and harm). The SCM uncovers systematic content and dynamics of stereotypes, which has practical implications.

T1  - A Closer Look at Racism and Heterosexism in Medical Students’ Clinical Decision-Making Related to HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP): Implications for PrEP Education
AN  - 1965733773
AB  - Social biases among healthcare providers could limit PrEP access. In this survey study of 115 US medical students, we examined associations between biases (racism and heterosexism) and PrEP clinical decision-making and explored prior PrEP education as a potential buffer. After viewing a vignette about a PrEP-seeking MSM patient, participants reported anticipated patient behavior (condomless sex, extra-relational sex, and adherence), intention to prescribe PrEP to the patient, biases, and background characteristics. Minimal evidence for racism affecting clinical decision-making emerged. In unadjusted analyses, heterosexism indirectly affected prescribing intention via all anticipated behaviors, tested as parallel mediators. Participants expressing greater heterosexism more strongly anticipated increased risk behavior and adherence problems, which were associated with lower prescribing intention. The indirect effect via condomless sex remained significant adjusting for background characteristics. Prior PrEP education did not buffer any indirect effects. Heterosexism may compromise PrEP provision to MSM and should be addressed in PrEP-related medical education.

T1  - Fighting ageism through nostalgia
AN  - 2011520343
AB  - Two experiments tested whether nostalgia is a resource for fighting ageism. In Experiment 1, younger adults who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) encounter with an older adult showed a more positive attitude towards older adults, mediated by greater inclusion of older adults in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, these findings were replicated and extended with a subtle nostalgia manipulation. Younger adults identified an older, familiar adult, before writing about an encounter with this person that was characterized by either central (e.g., keepsakes and childhood) or peripheral (e.g., wishing and daydreaming) features of the construct of nostalgia (i.e., prototype). Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported greater social connectedness, which predicted increased IOGS. In turn, increased IOGS was associated with a lower desire to avoid older adults. Several alternative explanations for the intergroup benefits of nostalgia were ruled out. The research established that nostalgia qualifies as a resource for combatting ageism.

T1  - Interventions Highlighting Hypocrisy Reduce Collective Blame of Muslims for Individual Acts of Violence and Assuage Anti-Muslim Hostility
AN  - 1999028580
AB  - Collectively blaming groups for the actions of individuals can license vicarious retribution. Acts of terrorism by Muslim extremists against innocents, and the spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes against innocent Muslims that follow, suggest that reciprocal bouts of collective blame can spark cycles of violence. How can this cycle be short-circuited? After establishing a link between collective blame of Muslims and anti-Muslim attitudes and behavior, we used an “interventions tournament” to identify a successful intervention (among many that failed). The “winning” intervention reduced collective blame of Muslims by highlighting hypocrisy in the ways individuals collectively blame Muslims—but not other groups (White Americans, Christians)—for individual group members’ actions. After replicating the effect in an independent sample, we demonstrate that a novel interactive activity that isolates the psychological mechanism amplifies the effectiveness of the collective blame hypocrisy intervention and results in downstream reductions in anti-Muslim attitudes and anti-Muslim behavior.

T1  - Outgroup members’ internal criticism promotes intergroup openness: The role of perceived risk
AN  - 2008940929
AB  - Research suggests that hearing an outgroup member voice internal criticism increases individuals’ openness to the outgroup's perspective. We replicate and extend these findings in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israeli participants exposed to a Palestinian official voicing internal criticism reported more openness to the Palestinian narrative of the conflict, an effect that was mediated by an increase in participants’ perception that Palestinians are open‐minded and a subsequent increase in their hope for more positive relations between the two groups. In our extension of these findings, we examined a complementary mechanism contributing to the effectiveness of the criticism manipulation, specifically the extent to which participants perceive that the Palestinian official took a risk voicing criticism of Palestinians. Positive messages from a hostile outgroup may be received with suspicion, but if they are articulated under great risk to the speaker, greater credibility may be granted. Across two studies, we demonstrate that the criticism conveys risk to the speaker and that this risk is predictive of the perceived credibility of the speaker, and participants’ subsequent openness to the outgroup's perspective.

T1  - Risk a Lot to Save a Lot: How Firefighters Decide Whose Life Matters,
AN  - 1972217556
AB  - Firefighters make life-or-death decisions based on shared understandings of whose lives matter. Drawing on three years of participant observation as a volunteer firefighter and 30 semistructured interviews, I examine tensions surrounding the value firefighters place on their own lives and the lives of the public they serve. There is a tension between firefighters and their officers over the value of a firefighter's life. Firefighters tend to be cavalier in their willingness to endanger their own lives in high-risk situations, while fire officers feel responsible for protecting the lives of their crew. A second tension exists between prejudiced individuals and an institutional culture of public service. Some firefighters harbor individual prejudices, which are at odds with an institutional culture of egalitarian service. Fire service, state, county, department, crew, and peer cultures suppress individual prejudices. This case study suggests that deep integration into an institutional culture of public service mitigates discriminatory behavior. Instead of evaluating discrimination among first responders as an individual-level trouble, bias and its associated dysfunctions can be reframed as a social issue to be ameliorated through cultural reform.

T1  - Negative emotions versus target descriptions: Examining perceptions of racial slurs as expressive and descriptive: GPIR
AN  - 1943426016
AB  - There is a debate about whether racial slurs operate primarily as descriptives (of the ethnicity of targets) or expressives (of negative emotions toward targets). In three studies (overall N = 471), we examined whether different racial slurs used in different situations led to slurs being perceived as descriptive versus expressive, and whether this distinction was related to the perceived offensiveness of the slurs. Our results showed the descriptive and expressive natures of racial slurs are directly related to their perceived offensiveness. Specifically, as the perceived offensiveness of slurs increase in intensity, the slurs are perceived as more negatively expressive, more descriptive, less positively expressive, and comparatively less descriptive and more expressive.

T1  - From Colorism to Conjurings: Tracing the Dust in Beyoncé's Lemonade
AN  - 2049666014
AB  - Colorism creates relentless tension and pressure in the lives of Black women. Pop-star Beyoncé Gisele Knowles-Carter is an interesting case in the discussion of colorism because her career has expressed a rich intimacy to Southern Black culture and female empowerment while also playing into tropes of the mulatta "fancy girl," whose relative proximity to whiteness adheres social value within mainstream culture. Finding aesthetic and thematic parallels between Beyoncé's recent project Lemonade (2016) and Julie Dash's cult-classic film Daughters of the Dust (1991) I draw a critical connection between Yellow Mary Peazant and Beyoncé, the prodigal child and the licentious "post-racial," pop-star to argue that while Lemonade may not present the same critique of exclusionary Black womanhood present within Daughters of the Dust, reactions to the Beyoncé's visual album and the "Formation" music video inadvertently demonstrate the longevity of harmful colorist prejudices and the disparaging of Black female sexual and creative agency within the Black community. This article engages conflicting reactions between the "Formation" music video and Lemonade visual album, as well as some of Beyoncé's earlier works, to consider the continued role of colorism, as it intersects with racism and sexism, to construct exclusionary notions of Blackness that attempt to restrict the expressivity of those considered "outside" of Blackness. Through a barrage of specifically Black feminist conjurings, Lemonade draws upon the legacy of Daughters of the Dust to break through the colorist barriers placed upon the Black female body while practicing diasporic melancholia to link the trauma of the past and the struggles of the present to articulate grievances and express desires for improved Black future.

T1  - Biased Elites, Unfit Policies: Reflections on the Lacunae of Roma Integration Strategies
AN  - 1946330478
AB  - In this article, I argue that policymakers employed unconscious biases and racist beliefs in the formulation and the implementation of the current EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies ('EU Roma Framework') and its corresponding national strategies. Using Critical Race Theory, I explore how these policies have reinforced the commonly held belief in the need to civilize and otherwise change the habits of the Roma, and consequently have further reinforced the power imbalance between the Roma and the dominant majority groups (hereinafter used interchangeably with 'non-Roma'). I analyse examples of Roma versus universal policies comparatively, emphasizing biases in formulation, implementation, and discourse. I show that the objectives of the EU Roma Framework and national Roma strategies toward Roma education involve ethnic presuppositions and are far less ambitious than the avowed Europe 2020 strategy; this policy mismatch will likely lead to further educational discrepancies post-2020. Finally, I conclude that policies focused on the Roma are doomed to fail if no prior and concurrent actions are taken to change prejudiced attitudes and the behaviours of non-Roma, in particular those biases influencing policy formulation and implementation.

T1  - Intergroup contact throughout the lifespan modulates implicit racial biases across perceivers’ racial group
AN  - 1917953895
AB  - Few researchers have investigated how contact across the lifespan influences racial bias and whether diversity of contact is beneficial regardless of the race of the perceiver. This research aims to address these gaps in the literature with a focus on how diversity in childhood and current contact shapes implicit racial bias across perceivers’ racial group. In two investigations, participants completed an Implicit Association Test and a self-report measure of the racial diversity of their current and childhood contact. In both studies, increased contact with Black compared with White individuals, both in childhood (Study 2) and currently (Studies 1 and 2), was associated with reduced implicit pro-White racial bias. For Black individuals (Study 2) more contact with Black compared with White individuals also was associated with reduced implicit pro-White racial bias. These findings suggest that diversity in contact across the lifespan may be related to reductions in implicit racial biases and that this relationship may generalize across racial groups.

T1  - BEHAVIOURAL INTENTION AND PERCEPTION OF ETHNIC GROUPS AMONG NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE CORP MEMBERS IN NIGERIA
AN  - 1926455573
AB  - Nigeria like many other African countries is an arbitrary manmade national entity amalgamated from numerous ethnic groups. Stereotypic belief proliferates as the number of these ethnic groups. This study therefore examines if stereotype is used in intra ethnic perception and inters ethnic perception; and measures the behavioral intention towards intra ethnic social distance and inters ethnic social distance. 78 (50%) male and 78 (50%) female members of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) from Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba ethnic groups were purposively selected as participants. The participants have non-competitive common goal and equality of demographics such age range of 22-30 years, educational status and income. Standardised ethnic perception rating scale and social distance scale were utilized and data collected were analysed using t-test for independent groups. The findings show that the participants did not use stereotype in intra ethnic perception and inter ethnic perception. However, there is significant difference in intra ethnic social distance and inter ethnic social distance. Inter ethnic social distance is higher than intra ethnic social distance. Implication for behavioural intention and willingness to interact with other ethnic groups in different social relations is discussed in line with intergroup contact as it extends to Africa.

T1  - LIGHT SUPREMACY VIS-À-VIS NON-WHITE IMMIGRANTS: THE IMPLICATIONS OF SKIN COLOR IN PURSUIT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
AN  - 2119849994
AB  - Globalization brought increased U.S. immigration. Unlike earlier immigration phases, many of today's immigrants come from third-world sovereignties. Similar to working class Europeans their concepts of ethnic worth are evidence suggesting White racism. As pertains to racism Caucasians are regarded as superior via light skin by non-White immigrants. The term "light" is a racial descriptor constructed for purposes of designating proximity to Caucasian populations. The term light supremacy then refers to both White and non-White racial populations who by virtue of having light skin is evidence of superiority. The pathology of light supremacy is more potent and sustaining than the oppression brought by White racism because it is much more stealth and ubiquitous. Its resolution will divert animus and accommodate immigrant access to the American Dream. Resolution of light supremacy will thus enable civil accord between the various factions of mankind such that supremacy will cease to exist becoming socially and biologically obsolete.

T1  - Contact, Political Solidarity and Collective Action: An Indian Case Study of Relations between Historically Disadvantaged Communities
AN  - 1855255752
AB  - Research on the contact hypothesis has highlighted the role of contact in improving intergroup relations. Most of this research has addressed the problem of transforming the prejudices of historically advantaged communities, thereby eroding wider patterns of discrimination and inequality. In the present research, drawing on evidence from a cross-sectional survey conducted in New Delhi, we explored an alternative process through which contact may promote social change, namely by fostering political solidarity and empowerment amongst the disadvantaged. The results indicated that Muslim students' experiences of contact with other disadvantaged communities were associated with their willingness to participate in joint collective action to reduce shared inequalities. This relationship was mediated by perceptions of collective efficacy and shared historical grievances and moderated by positive experiences of contact with the Hindu majority. Implications for recent debates about the relationship between contact and social change are discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Global identification predicts gay–male identity integration and well‐being among Turkish gay men
AN  - 2067639513
AB  - In most parts of the world, hegemonic masculinity requires men to endorse traditional masculine ideals, one of which is rejection of homosexuality. Wherever hegemonic masculinity favours heterosexuality over homosexuality, gay males may feel under pressure to negotiate their conflicting male gender and gay sexual identities to maintain positive self‐perceptions. However, globalization, as a source of intercultural interaction, might provide a beneficial context for people wishing to create alternative masculinities in the face of hegemonic masculinity. Hence, we tested if global identification would predict higher levels of gay–male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well‐being, via alternative masculinity representations for gay and male identities. A community sample of 219 gay and bisexual men from Turkey completed the study. Structural equation modelling revealed that global identification positively predicted gay–male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well‐being; however, alternative masculinity representations did not mediate this relationship. Our findings illustrate how identity categories in different domains can intersect and affect each other in complex ways. Moreover, we discuss mental health and well‐being implications for gay men living in cultures where they experience high levels of prejudice and stigma.

T1  - Understanding defensive and secure in-group positivity: The role of collective narcissism
AN  - 1855326941
AB  - Integrating psychoanalytic ideas of group idealisation with social identity and categorisation theories, this article discusses the distinction between secure and defensive in-group positivity. Narcissistic in-group positivity captures a belief in in-group greatness that is contingent on external validation. It reflects defensive in-group positivity, insofar as it stems from the frustration of individual needs, and predicts increased sensitivity to threats as well as undesirable consequences for out-groups and the in-group. Secure in-group positivity-that is, in-group positivity without the narcissistic component-is a confidently held positive evaluation of one's in-group that is independent of the recognition of the group in the eyes of others. It stems from the satisfaction of individual needs, is resilient to threats and has positive consequences for the in-group and out-groups. I review evidence for these two distinct ways people relate to their social groups and discuss theoretical and practical implications for understanding intra- and intergroup relations.

T1  - Changing people's views of outgroups through individual-to-group generalisation: meta-analytic reviews and theoretical considerations
AN  - 1855326547
AB  - Through individual-to-group generalisation, information about individual members of stigmatised social groups changes the outgroup judgment. This article reports meta-analytic reviews of over 30 years of experimental, lab-based research on individual-to-group generalisation (107 independent tests; 5393 participants). In a first meta-analysis, a positive, medium-size generalisation effect was detected (r = .28, p < .001), reflecting significant generalisation of outgroup exemplar information to the outgroup judgment. This effect was moderated by the number of exemplars and exemplar typicality, with more moderately atypical exemplars maximising generalisation effects. Several other design parameters-including type of control condition, generalisation measures, mode of information provision, type of target outgroup and origin of study-did not moderate the positive generalisation effect. A second meta-analysis investigated the interplay between metacognitions and generalisation and found assimilation effects with metacognitive triggers encouraging exemplar inclusion, and contrast effects with metacognitive cues encouraging exemplar exclusion. These results demonstrate that the same outgroup exemplar can lead to bias reduction or bias exacerbation, depending on available meta-cognitive cues. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for intergroup psychology, generalisation theory and bias reduction interventions.

T1  - Lower-track students' sense of academic futility: Selection or effect?
AN  - 1844819169
AB  - Given the importance of students' judgement of the future rewarding character of studying for their willingness to deliver effort at school, we propose the concept of sense of academic futility to understand track differences in achievement. As research is inconclusive in this matter, this study examines whether negative attitudes such as sense of futility follow from track enrolment. Based on new and unique Flemish data of 4500 first grade secondary school students clustered in 119 tracks in 57 schools, gathered in 2012 and 2014, this study shows by means of multilevel analysis (HLM7) that students' higher sense of academic futility in technical and vocational tracks versus academic tracks exists irrespective of background features and prior feelings of futility. Furthermore, it suggests a higher increment in sense of futility in vocational tracks compared with academic tracks, establishing the usefulness of this concept for tracking research.

T1  - Templates and exclusions: victim centrism in Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Indian residential schools
AN  - 1842817113
AB  - In this article I use an ethnographic approach to consider the causes and consequences of a focus on 'survivor' experience in Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) on Indian residential schools. In this Truth Commission, the interconnected concepts of 'survivor', 'cultural genocide', 'trauma', and 'healing' became reference points for much of the testimony that was presented and the ways the schools were represented. Canada's Truth Commission thus offers an example of the consequences of 'victim centrism', including the ways that 'truth-telling' can be influenced by the affirmation of particular survivor experiences and the wider goal of reforming the dominant historical narrative of the state through public education. Canada's TRC was limited by its mandate to a particular kind of institution and scope of collective harm. It was at the same time active in its creation of narrative templates, which guided the expression of traumatic personal experience and affirmed the category of residential school 'survivor' as the focal point for understanding policy-driven loss of language, tradition, and political integrity. [web URL: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.12497/full]Alternate abstract:L'auteur utilise ici une approche ethnographique pour examiner les causes et conséquences de l'accent placé sur le vécu des « survivants » au sein de la Commission de vérité et réconciliation canadienne sur les pensionnats autochtones. Dans cette commission, les concepts interconnectés de « survivant », de « génocide culturel », de « traumatisme » et de « guérison » sont devenus des points de référence pour une grande partie des témoignages présentés et pour la manière dont ces écoles ont été représentées. La commission constitue ainsi un exemple des conséquences du « victimo-centrisme », notamment dans la manière dont le fait de « dire la vérité » peut être influencé par l'affirmation d'expériences particulières de survivants et par le but plus large de réformer le récit historique dominant de l’État par l’éducation publique. Le mandat de la commission de vérité et réconciliation était limité à un type particulier d'institution et au préjudice collectif. Dans le même temps, elle a activement créé des modèles narratifs qui ont guidé l'expression des expériences traumatisantes personnelles et assis la catégorie de « survivant » des pensionnats comme point focal de la compréhension de la perte de la langue, de la tradition et de l'intégrité politique à la suite des politiques menées.

T1  - Does Closeness to Someone Who Is Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Influence Etiology Beliefs About Homosexuality?
AN  - 1831273196
AB  - Research suggests that contact with sexual minorities and etiology beliefs regarding the origins of homosexuality are associated with antigay bias; however, factors related to etiology beliefs have received little empirical attention. Our primary research question is: Does closeness to someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual influence etiology beliefs? Students (n = 851) from four U.S. universities completed an anonymous survey, and regression results indicated that contact and closeness were not significantly associated with etiology beliefs. Because both contact and relationship closeness were associated with antigay attitudes, and closeness demonstrated the largest effect, we tested three alternative structural equation models to determine if contact and closeness mediated etiology beliefs. Results suggested that contact and the degree of closeness are indirectly associated with students' etiology beliefs through antigay bias.

T1  - The Impact of Unpunished Hate Crimes: When Derogating the Victim Extends into Derogating the Group
AN  - 1812607487
AB  - Just world research has shown that observers derogate victims more for their misfortunes if the perpetrator is not harshly punished (Lerner in J Personal Soc Psychol 1(4):355-360, 1980 ). However, few studies have investigated minority group derogation as a just world preservation strategy after instances of intergroup harm-doing. This study is among the first to demonstrate the derogation of both individual victims and of the victim's minority group experimentally, using the context of a racist hate crime in Australia. In the present experiment, participants (N = 110) read a news article describing a hate crime against an Aboriginal Australian teenager and were informed that the perpetrator was harshly or leniently punished (secure vs. justice threat condition). Our results show that in the justice threat condition, participants not only derogated the individual Aboriginal Australian victim more after his death, they also expressed greater racism toward the victim's group. An indirect effect of the justice threat condition on modern racism via individual victim derogation was observed, along with moderating effects of individual differences in belief in a just world. These findings provide support for the alarming hypothesis that racist hate crimes are not only the manifestation of a racist society, but may also bolster racial prejudices if leniently treated. The results highlight the important role of political and judicial authorities, whose response or non-response to a hate crime can exacerbate or ameliorate existing prejudices.

T1  - Hijra Communities of Delhi
AN  - 1807662748
AB  - This article explores Hijra communities, attempts to understand what it means to take on the Hijra role, and describes the process involved in becoming a Hijra. It is based on an ethnographic study of the Hijras living in Delhi, India and investigates the birth of a Hijra as a social body. The Hijra community has always been on the fringes of society, dwelling in abject poverty and excluded from the process of normalization. Being victims of various forms of prejudices and intolerance, the Hijra community lives in fear and isolation, often in clandestine, ghettoized locations. The problems confronting these groups of people have not been adequately explored, primarily as a result of the hidden nature of the community. By addressing exclusionary practices, the article draws out intersections between identity politics and the reproduction of social difference triggered by existing inequalities and inequities of class, gender and sexuality.

T1  - Negotiating Blackness
AN  - 1824565977
AB  - This article explores the experiences of young British people with African and Caribbean heritage during a volunteer tourism trip to Zimbabwe. It gives an ethnographic account of how racialized identifications and geographies surfaced - and were negotiated - through emotional encounters and embodied performances. Young volunteers contended with the racialized imaginaries of charity that painfully positioned their blackness as 'mis-fitting' in the performances of virtue central to volunteer tourism. However, they performed their blackness in ways that asserted value, variously invoking a proud 'authentic' bond with 'Africa' and forging connections around diasporic African cool. Volunteers' claims of authentic 'Africanness' often problematically homogenized Africa, but celebratory affects around transnational popular culture contained possibilities for disrupting denigrating hierarchies. This account illustrates the potential for youth studies to engage further with the 'more-than-representational' ways in which racialized difference comes into force, but that this approach can and should sharpen our analysis of enduring racialized prejudices.

T1  - The Nouvelle Droite in Portugal: a new strategy for the radical right in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy
AN  - 1807164657
AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

T1  - W E B DuBois on the history of empirical social research
AN  - 1789067596
AB  - This review of The Scholar Denied by Aldon D. Morris emphasizes the importance of DuBois for the start of American empirical social research. A.D. Morris correctly shows why W.E.B. DuBois was rejected, forgotten and suppressed by white sociologists for almost 100 years. Racial prejudices and scientific racism among American sociological elites prevented both Du Bois and his work from receiving the attention they rightly deserve. But my paper accentuates the role of Du Bois in the development of sociology as an empirical social science discipline. He created and published a programme of research on the African-American population. Publishing 'The Philadelphia Negro', he provided an excellent example of how to do such research. He also headed the first school of sociology on the American continent at the Atlanta University from 1898 to 1910.

T1  - Instilling Hope for Peace During Intractable Conflicts
AN  - 1816872214
AB  - A set of studies explored the possibility to instill hope for peace in the context of intractable conflicts. The first study examined Jewish-Israelis' hopes for peace following a message from an out-group communicator. Results show that participants' hopes increased after viewing a Palestinian conclude that the conflict was solvable. This held true regardless of whether the Palestinian communicator identified as a militant or a peace activist. However, Jewish-Israelis' hopes for peace were not altered when an article, ostensibly written by conflict experts, concluded that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was resolvable. In order to explore whether these trends are unique to group members involved in intergroup conflict, we replicated the study on uninvolved third-party participants. The article offers a comparison of belief malleability between those who experience conflict first hand and those who observe it from afar and presents strategies that may instill hope for peace in group members immersed in protracted violent conflicts.

T1  - 'If I climb a wall of ten meters': capoeira, parkour and the politics of public space among (post)migrant youth in Turin, Italy
AN  - 1786265026
AB  - Rather than being seen as citizens, the children of immigrants are portrayed as a population to be controlled and contained across Europe. In Italy today, debates about cultural 'authenticity' and renewed nationalism accompany waves of moral panic that depict a country under siege by illegal and unwanted immigrants. Specifically in cities, immigrants and their children are imagined and portrayed as alien and out of place. Drawing on fourteen months of ethnographic research in Turin, Italy, with children of immigrants aged between 16 and 21, De Martini Ugolotti and Moyer illustrate how these youth make use of their bodies through capoeira and parkour practices to contest and reappropriate public spaces, thereby challenging dominant visions about what constitutes the public, how it should be used and by whom. They analyse the 'body in place' to understand how the children of immigrants navigate unequal spatial relations and challenge dominant regimes of representation, while also attempting to improve their life conditions and reach their personal goals.

T1  - Clergy Perceptions of Sexual Assault Victimization
AN  - 1777964657
AB  - Although congregants often turn to clergy for help in dealing with personal difficulties, including marital problems, substance abuse issues, and mental illness, survivors of sexual assault do not commonly turn to clergy for support or guidance. This study utilized a mixed-methods approach, online survey, and semi-structured interviews to determine how clergy perceive sexual assault victimization. The results of this study showed that more blame was assigned to the victim as the relationship with the perpetrator became closer, with the exception of marital rape. This study also found that hostile sexism was a predictor of negative attitudes toward rape victims. [web URL: http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/22/5/588.abstract]

T1  - An Underexamined Inequality: Cultural and Psychological Barriers to Men's Engagement With Communal Roles
AN  - 1730766745
AB  - Social psychological research has sought to understand and mitigate the psychological barriers that block women's interest, performance, and advancement in male-dominated, agentic roles (e.g., science, technology, engineering, and math). Research has not, however, correspondingly examined men's underrepresentation in communal roles, traditionally occupied by women (e.g., careers in health care, early childhood education, and domestic roles including child care). In this article, we seek to provide a roadmap for research on this underexamined inequality by (a) outlining the benefits of increasing men's representation in communal roles; (b) reviewing cultural, evolutionary, and historical perspectives on the asymmetry in status assigned to men's and women's roles; and (c) articulating the role of gender stereotypes in creating social and psychological barriers to men's interest and inclusion in communal roles. We argue that promoting equal opportunities for both women and men requires a better understanding of the psychological barriers to men's involvement in communal roles.

T1  - The intertwining of second couplehood and old age
AN  - 1710050744
AB  - Second couplehood in old age is a growing phenomenon alongside increases in life expectancy. Lately, a shift has occurred in that individual diversity of ageing is perceived to depend on the physical and social contexts in which older persons experience change. Thus, the purpose of the study on which this paper reports was to examine second couplehood in the context of old age and old age in the context of second couplehood using an existential-phenomenological theoretical orientation. Twenty couples were recruited using criterion-sampling: men aged 65+ and women aged 60+, with children and grandchildren from a lifelong marriage that had ended in widowhood or divorce, living in second couplehood - married or not - in separate houses or co-habitating. Forty individual semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed according to phenomenological tradition. Five sub-themes emerged, demonstrating couplehood and old age intertwining: (a) enjoying life while still possible; (b) living with health-related issues; (c) relationships with adult children: autonomy versus dependency; (d) loneliness: living as a couple is better than living alone; (e) self-image: feeling young-feeling old. Findings support the existence of positive and negative aspects of old age. Our discussion suggests the need to replace perceptions of old age as either a negative burden or a positive asset towards a period of balancing between gains and losses. Furthermore, we acknowledge the role of second couplehood in older peoples' wellbeing on the personal-micro level through love, the familial-mezzo level through care-giving and the social-macro level by reducing prejudice.

T1  - Binge drinking vs. drunkenness. The questionable threshold of excess for young Italians
AN  - 1871602179
AB  - The use of a standard definition of 'binge drinking' can potentially offer the advantage of 'objectifying' the concept of excessive drinking. Nevertheless, the term has become somewhat confusing, as it is often used as a synonym of drunkenness, making cross-cultural comparison difficult. The present study investigates the meaning Italian young people attribute to binge drinking, to explain the gap between self-reported rates of drunkenness and episodes of binge drinking found by comparative youth drinking surveys. About 134 face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted, targeting adolescents (aged 15-17) and young adults (aged 22-24) who had admitted to drinking excessively. In addition, an online forum was created, using a video clip as a stimulus and asking for web users' comments (132 were analysed). Results show how in the view of Italian bingers, binge drinking does not necessarily entail drunkenness, but only being tipsy. This is what they aim at when they drink, while they have negative attitudes and expectations regarding intoxication and its effects. This boundary establishes the concept of excess and marks the threshold between socially acceptable and unacceptable drinking. In conclusion, the concept of binge drinking cannot be used as a synonym of drunkenness, which young people in Italy judge severely.

T1  - A National Prospective Study of Pornography Consumption and Gendered Attitudes Toward Women
AN  - 1695135473
AB  - Whether consuming pornography leads to gendered attitudes toward women has been debated extensively. Researchers have primarily studied pornography's contribution to gendered sexual attitudes such as rape myth acceptance and sexual callousness toward women. The present study explored associations between pornography consumption and nonsexual gender-role attitudes in a national, two-wave panel sample of US adults. Pornography consumption interacted with age to predict gender-role attitudes. Specifically, pornography consumption at wave one predicted more gendered attitudes at wave two for older--but not for younger--adults. Gender-role attitudes at wave one were included in this analysis. Pornography consumption was therefore associated with interindividual over time change in older adults' gendered attitudes toward women. Older adults' attitudes toward nonsexual gender roles are generally more regressive than those of younger adults. Thus, this finding is consistent with Wright's (Commun Yearb 35:343-386,  2011 ) script acquisition, activation, application model (^sub 3^AM) of media socialization, which posits that attitude change following media exposure is more likely for viewers' whose preexisting behavioral scripts are less incongruous with scripts for behavior presented in mass media depictions. Contrary to the perspective that selective exposure explains associations between pornography consumption and content-congruent attitudes, gender-role attitudes at wave one did not predict pornography consumption at wave two.

T1  - Does Anti-Hispanic Bias Motivate Opposition to Non-English Languages?*
AN  - 1696068658
AB  - Contemporary political debates about language policy in the United States focus on three primary policy issues: bilingual education in public schools, English-only legislation, and the access of non-English speaking citizens to political rights. Using the "Multi-Ethnic United States" module from the 2000 General Social Survey (GSS), this article tests multiple attitudinal, behavioral, demographic, and contextual hypotheses for how Anglos and African Americans view bilingual policy issues. We examine the role of linguistic contact, self-interest, group threat, and discriminatory views of Latinos, finding that the latter--as measured by the "Three Ds" (Derogation, Disrespect, and Distance)--are the strongest predictors of attitudes toward bilingualism. Distance (social distance from Latinos) is consistently significant, disrespect (doubts about Latino contributions to the United States.) is mostly significant, and derogation (Latino stereotypes) is occasionally significant. Also, political ideology and knowledge of a non-English language play important roles in the formation of favorable bilingualism opinions. However, the self-interest and group threat variables were largely insignificant. Taken together, these findings indicate the importance of understanding how policy views may be structured by opinions about out-group individuals and cultures. Language can serve as a proxy for immigrants themselves, as negative attitudes toward Latinos are associated with negative attitudes toward bilingualism.

T1  - By name or by deed? Identifying the source of the feminist stigma
AN  - 1669826383
AB  - Prejudice and discrimination against feminists were explored across two contexts, a workplace and a social setting. We examined university students' reactions to a woman who called herself a feminist, behaved like a feminist by challenging sexism, did both, or did neither. In Study 1, participants (N=177) evaluated a job candidate less favorably when she called herself a feminist after controlling for perceived assertiveness and participants' feminist self-identification. However, our results showed no evidence of hiring discrimination. In Study 2, participants (N=184) evaluated a peer less favorably and were less willing to befriend and date her when she called herself a feminist, controlling for perceived assertiveness. Participants were also less willing to befriend her when she behaved like a feminist. The contextual nature of the feminist stigma and the influence of perceived assertiveness are discussed.

T1  - Anti-Islam or Anti-religion? Understanding Objection against Islamic Education
AN  - 1667948923; 201509651
AB  - Opposition against the accommodation of Islam in Western societies is often attributed to a prejudice against Muslims. This overlooks the possibility that opposition against Islam could also be caused by a more general aversion towards religion and a desire for a stricter separation between the state and religion in general. Based on the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) of 2012, the current study investigated the non-Muslim majority's attitude towards religious education preferences in German public schools. By applying a multinomial logit model, we examined to what extent Islamophobic, xenophobic and religious attitudes predict whether people (i) support the provision of Islamic education, (ii) prefer only Christian education or (iii) opt for no religious education at all. Results show that Islamophobic and xenophobic attitudes are relevant indicators of objection against the provision of Islamic education in particular, while religiosity and religious style determine whether people support having religious education in general. Furthermore, the effect of Islamophobia and xenophobia depends on religious style. With these results the current study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance towards accommodating Islam in the public sphere. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - It takes three to dialogue: considering a triadic intergroup encounter
AN  - 2105049918
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to present findings from a research project that examined the contribution of a third partner in an encounter among three groups: Palestinian/Arab–Israelis, Jewish–Israelis and Germans. In recent decades, planned intergroup encounters have played an important role in conflict management, reconciliation and peace-building. Nearly all models use a dyadic structure, based on an encounter between two rival groups mediated by a third party. Design/methodology/approach – The study was based on a year-long academic collaboration and two encounters between social work students from Israel and Germany (15 each). The central issues addressed were personal and collective identity; personal, familial and collective memory; and multicultural social work practice that were present in the encounter with the “other”. Participants were heterogeneous in terms of gender, ethnic background and religion, inviting exploration of personal and professional meanings. Using 15 in-depth interviews with Israeli participants, we identified and analyzed the personal and interpersonal processes occurring during these encounters. Findings – Jewish and Arab participants positioned themselves vis-à-vis the German group in two main configurations (singular identities and multiple multifaceted identities), which alternated according to the contexts to which the larger group was exposed, and in congruence with the developmental stage of group work. Originality/value – The findings suggest that a “third” partner can significantly contribute to an intergroup encounter by reflecting on the relationship created between rival parties to a dyad, thereby helping them deconstruct their binary “us-versus-them” relationship.

T1  - Minority Stress in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults in Australia: Associations with Psychological Distress, Suicidality, and Substance Use
AN  - 1680152258; 201516318
AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other same-sex attracted young people have been shown to be at a higher risk of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance abuse, compared to their heterosexual peers. Homophobic prejudice and stigma are often thought to underlie these disparities. In this study, the relationship between such experiences of social derogation and mental health and substance use in same-sex attracted young people was examined using Meyer's minority stress theory. An online survey recruited 254 young women and 318 young men who identified as same-sex attracted, were aged 18-25 years, and lived in Sydney, Australia. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that internalized homophobia, perceived stigma, and experienced homophobic physical abuse were associated with higher levels of psychological distress and self-reported suicidal thoughts in the previous month. Furthermore, perceived stigma and homophobic physical abuse were associated with reporting a lifetime suicide attempt. The association between minority stress and substance use was inconsistent. While, as expected, higher levels of perceived stigma were associated with club drug dependence, there was an inverse association between internalized homophobia and club drug use, and between perceived stigma and hazardous alcohol use. The findings of this study provide support for the minority stress theory proposition that chronic social stress due to sexual orientation is associated with poorer mental health. The high rates of mental health and substance use problems in the current study suggest that same-sex attracted young people should continue to be a priority population for mental health and substance use intervention and prevention.

T1  - An assessment of health-care students' attitudes toward patients with or at high risk for HIV: implications for education and cultural competency
AN  - 1567047149; 201436988
AB  - Stigma perpetuated by health-care providers has been found to be a barrier to care for vulnerable populations, including HIV-infected, people who inject drugs (PWIDs), and men who have sex with men (MSM) in multiple clinical contexts and remains unexamined among professional health-care students in Malaysia. This cross-sectional, anonymous, and Internet-based survey assessed the attitudes of medical and dental students toward HIV-infected, PWID, and MSM patients. Survey invitation was emailed to 3191 students at 8 professional schools; 1296 (40.6%) responded and scored their attitudes toward these patient groups using a feeling thermometer, indicating their attitudes on a sliding scale from 0 (most negative) to 100 (most positive). Compared to general patients (mean = 76.50), the mean scores for HIV-infected (mean = 54.04; p < 0.001), PWID (mean = 37.50; p < 0.001), and MSM (mean=32.13; p < 0.001) patients were significantly lower and significantly different between each group comparison. Within group differences, most notably religion, ethnicity, and personally knowing someone from these populations were associated with significant differences in attitudes. No differences were noted between pre-clinical and clinical year of training. Health-care students represent the next generation of clinicians who will be responsible for future HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Our findings suggest alarmingly negative attitudes toward these patients, especially MSM, necessitating prompt and effective interventions designed to ameliorate the negative attitudes of health-care students toward vulnerable populations, specifically HIV-infected, PWID, and MSM patients in Malaysia.

T1  - The Rules of Implicit Evaluation by Race, Religion, and Age
AN  - 1916124469
AB  - The social world is stratified. Social hierarchies are known but often disavowed as anachronisms or unjust. Nonetheless, hierarchies may persist in social memory. In three studies (total N > 200,000), we found evidence of social hierarchies in implicit evaluation by race, religion, and age. Participants implicitly evaluated their own racial group most positively and the remaining racial groups in accordance with the following hierarchy: Whites > Asians > Blacks > Hispanics. Similarly, participants implicitly evaluated their own religion most positively and the remaining religions in accordance with the following hierarchy: Christianity > Judaism > Hinduism or Buddhism > Islam. In a final study, participants of all ages implicitly evaluated age groups following this rule: children > young adults > middle-age adults > older adults. These results suggest that the rules of social evaluation are pervasively embedded in culture and mind.

T1  - Subordination in Home Service Jobs: Comparing Providers of Home-Based Child Care, Elder Care, and Cleaning in France
AN  - 1738477302; 201539405
AB  - Home-based service jobs have developed considerably across Western societies. In fact, chances are high that a working-class woman in France today will, at some point in her life, be a house cleaner, home-based child care provider, or home aide for the elderly. Going against political, scholarly, and everyday discourses that, saturated with the double prejudices of gender and class, treat all these home service occupations, which require little prior training, the same, this article illuminates the variability of the forms of subordination experienced by women practicing these occupations in France. Comparing these jobs with the ensemble of low-skill jobs and with each other exposes what is specific to the particular form of subordination each job type entails, in terms of the extent of job supervision and the nature of the home where it is practiced, the presence or absence of relations with coworkers and/or a 'public,' and the nature of this 'public.' It mobilizes nationwide statistical data in a new way to shift attention to these numerous ordinary work situations, which are much less studied than those of the domestic workers of the wealthiest cities of the Western world.

T1  - No Blacks Allowed: Segregated Gifted Education in the Context of Brown v. Board of Education
AN  - 1650131314
AB  - This article examines the under-representation of Black students in gifted education, asserting that social inequalities (e.g., prejudice and discrimination) contribute to segregated gifted education programs. Under-representation trends are presented for gifted education, along with methods for calculating under-representation and then inequity goals. Philosophically, this article is grounded in disparate impact discourse, where outcome is more cogent than intent. Denying access to gifted education based on race is immoral and illegal. Pragmatically, under-representation is couched under the larger and more comprehensive achievement gaps and inequities in school settings with implications for de jure segregation. We discuss the under-representation of Black students in gifted education with Brown v. Board of Education as the legal foundation and then focus briefly on a recent court case in gifted education (McFadden v. Board of Education for Illinois School District U-46) for a contemporary point of discussion. Recommendations for desegregating gifted education for Black students regarding attitudes, instruments, and policies and procedures are provided.

T1  - The Laws Have Changed, But What About the Police? Policing Domestic Violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina
AN  - 1692290094; 201524156
AB  - Despite having received gender sensitivity and domestic violence (DV) education in the post-war reformation era, anecdotal evidence from across Bosnia and Herzegovina indicates that most police officers view DV as a private family affair and continue to hold negative attitudes toward women and DV victims. This study assessed these claims by examining gender and DV attitudes held by 137 Bosnian police officers. It was hypothesized that officers who received DV training would be less likely to hold sexist attitudes toward women or view DV as justifiable compared with untrained officers. Results, as well as policy implications and suggestions for future research, are presented. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Explorations of Intercultural Communication Barriers among the Students of College of Social Sciences and Law at Jimma University, Oromiya, Ethiopia
AN  - 1703413207
AB  - The exploration of intercultural communication barriers among the students of college of social sciences and law at Jimma University was conducted from October 2009 to 2011. The study based on qualitative descriptive one. The data collection methods were focus group discussion and in-depth interview. The research found that the barriers for intercultural communications among the students from various linguistic and cultural backgrounds were ethnocentrism, prejudice, past historical back drops, linguistics and socio cultural variations. Sometimes misunderstanding occurs due to cultural completion and political and social reality existing in at the national level at this time of the study. Lack of opportunities created by university structure was also considered as the proximate barriers for intercultural communication. Thus, the promotion of tolerance for diversity and multicultural competency has been recommended to be implemented to various level of schooling. Among these, the necessity of learning Afaan Oromo as a course starting from primary school was recommended by students. Moreover, continuous awareness creation program aimed at promoting diversity and tolerance has been expected from university.

T1  - What Makes a Young Assertive Bystander? The Effect of Intergroup Contact, Empathy, Cultural Openness, and In-Group Bias on Assertive Bystander Intervention Intentions
AN  - 1543801794
AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: "empathy," "cultural openness," "in-group bias," and "intergroup anxiety." British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed.              [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Factors That Impact Support Workers' Perceptions of the Sexuality of Adults with Developmental Disabilities: A Quantitative Analysis
AN  - 1531930620; 201425213
AB  - Adults with developmental disabilities (DDs) are often discouraged from expressing their sexuality and from learning about their sexual rights. As a consequence, they experience high rates of sexually transmitted diseases and sexual abuse, as well as negative attitudes toward their own sexuality. Support workers' attitudes towards such issues are critical since individuals with DDs rely on support workers for information about sex. The following study involved the distribution of a self-administered sexuality questionnaire to university students with support worker experience. The results from the study indicate that support workers with no religious affiliation and those who are more advanced in their educational careers are more likely to have liberal attitudes towards the sexuality of adults with DDs. Analyses also indicated that while support workers were not biased against homosexuality among individuals with DDs, they considered anal sex to be the least acceptable form of sexual expression for this population. Implications of these findings are explored in terms of support worker training and education. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mixing bodies and minds: race, class and 'mixed schooling' controversies in New Orleans and Atlanta, 1874-87
AN  - 1520331128; 201413173
AB  - Educational access was central in the racial inscription of class identities in the late nineteenth century. In Atlanta and New Orleans, white newspapers, politicians and ordinary citizens launched vigorous campaigns against integrated schools, which resulted in limited access to elite public schooling for upwardly mobile Blacks. Jewell's study analyses these cases to explore social reproduction as a link between race and class as social structures. Whites in both cities used the concept of miscegenation, or racial mixing, to define Blacks' access to elite cultural knowledge and social networks as a violation of the colour line. Jewell argues that analyses of racial formation should give attention to discursive links between race and class in struggles over social reproduction because maintaining racial hierarchies in periods of social change requires constructing new cultural narratives that reproduce economic dominance over racial minorities.

T1  - The Suburban Idea and Its Enemies
AN  - 1494299690; 201403376
AB  - Late in the twentieth century public opinion began to turn against the Australian suburb, as its enemies began to outnumber its friends. For more than 150 years, Australia was itself a mental suburb of England, taking many of its ideas ready-made from the world's metropolis, London. This article identifies the main ideological strands of the suburban idea as it first appeared in England-Evangelicalism, Romanticism, Sanitarianism, and Class Prejudice-and examines how they were reproduced, with occasional variations, in the colonial city. Critics of the suburban idea, it is argued, shared many of the tacit assumptions of its friends, differing only in the value they assigned to each component. Anti-suburbanism, even in its contemporary forms, continues to reproduce many features of its nineteenth-century antecedents. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Assessing the stigma toward chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus: development and validation of a Chinese college students' stigma scale
AN  - 1433108293
AB  - According to rigorous guidelines of instrument development, a 17-item chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus-related stigma scale (HBV-SS) in college students, including 4 domains (labeling, stereotype, separating, discrimination), was developed with data from 717 college students in China. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of HBV-SS was .85. Four common factors were extracted in accordance with the conceptual model. Students with HBsAg positive/ever-positive (vs. negative), with HBsAg ever-positive (vs. never positive/did not know), and students who had any family member, friend, or acquaintance as a chronic carrier of HBV (vs. had not/did not know) had significantly lower scores. Research has shown that the scale is reliable, valid, and sensitive and is recommended for application of HBV-SS to assist public health practice.

T1  - Systematic review of instruments measuring homophobia and related constructs
AN  - 1427817633
AB  - Since its conceptualization, the construct of homophobia has been the subject of many speculations about its specificity, reach, and possibility of empirical assessment. Several instruments have been created aiming to measure the prejudice against homosexuals. Peer-reviewed articles of studies using measures to assess homophobia and related constructs were systematically reviewed in 4 databases (Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, JSTOR). The articles were classified as they displayed evidence of the instrument's validity, reliability, or both. Finally, the instruments were rated according to that evidence. Out of 1076 results, 115 studies between 1993 and 2010 were identified as relevant. Those studies used 47 different instruments. This review focused in 5 instruments that concentrated the majority of the citations. Psychometric properties were acceptable.

T1  - An Intersectional Approach to Black/White Interracial Interactions: The Roles of Gender and Sexual Orientation
AN  - 1357005952
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Although researchers have long advocated taking an intersectional approach in order to better understand how race, gender, and other social identities influence social experiences, this approach is only beginning to take hold in the interracial interaction literature. This paper describes the importance of considering gender (as well as other social identities, such as sexual orientation) in addition to race in the context of Black/White interracial interactions in the United States. The role of prior experience is discussed (i.e., encounters with prejudice at the intersection of race and gender, gender differences in the content of racial stereotypes, and the sometimes-conflicting messages of racial and gender socialization). The ways in which gender and racial identities interact with situational aspects of interracial interactions are also considered. Finally, the current representation of gender in the interracial interaction literature is reviewed, and recommendations for future research are provided, including techniques for recruiting racial minority participants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'A veritable Janus at the gates of Jewry': British Jews and Mr Arnold White
AN  - 1322723527; 201310775
AB  - Historians of British antisemitism consider Arnold White (publicist, author, journalist, campaigner) a key exponent of racially orientated anti-Jewish sentiment in the United Kingdom in the period before the First World War. These attitudes were repeatedly demonstrated by his vehement opposition to East European Jewish immigration and underscored by a large literary output on the topic. In the late 1880s, White frequently clashed with leading Anglo-Jewish figures on immigration yet, in general terms, there was often difficulty in assigning him definitively to the antisemitic camp. This was the result of his work for Baron Maurice de Hirsch and the Jewish Colonization Association, which led to a more flattering interpretation of White's contribution to solving the so-called 'Jewish question'. Indeed, at times, he was actually regarded as a 'friend of the Jews'. Johnson's study examines the problems Anglo-Jewish society had in analysing and negotiating the White world-view. For instance, an appreciation in the Jewish Chronicle described him as a 'veritable Janus at the gates of Jewry', essentially a two-faced troublemaker whose true attitude was not easy to determine. For almost three decades, the question of whether White was friend or foe was asked by various individuals and publications. Ultimately, Johnson considers what White and his Anglo-Jewish encounters reveal about the nature of the Jewish-Gentile relationship and how antisemitic ideology was confronted in Britain in the period before the outbreak of the First World War.

T1  - Romaphobia Among Serbian Adolescents: The Role of National In-group Attitudes and Perceived Threat
AN  - 1283642562; 201303381
AB  - This study employed the integrated threat theory to examine Serbian adolescents' attitudes towards the Roma. The sample consisted of 687 secondary school students (mean age 17), of whom 53% were females. In a survey-based study, we assessed adolescents' national in-group attitudes (i.e., nationalism), their feelings toward the Roma, and their perception of economic and symbolic threat. Findings suggest that perceived threat to either real resources or worldviews of the dominant group was related to more negative attitudes towards the Roma minority. Further, Romaphobia was positively related to adolescents' nationalism and this relationship was partially mediated by perceived economic and symbolic threat. The theoretical and educational implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Understanding and addressing the stigma of mental illness with ethnic minority communities
AN  - 1313192774
AB  - Higher income societies have moved from institutional to community-based care for people experiencing mental illness. However, stigma and discrimination persists and undermines help-seeking, recovery and life chances. This study examines beliefs, stigma and the effectiveness of existing national mental health campaigns with Pakistani, Indian and Chinese heritage communities in Scotland, UK, using community based participatory research. Community organisers were trained and supported to co-facilitate focus groups with 87 people using a range of languages. Whilst diversity within and between communities was apparent, important trends emerged. People with mental illness experience high levels of stigma from communities. Families experience significant associated stigma. This shame combines with culturally inappropriate services to reduce help-seeking from mental health services, friends and families. Existing anti-stigma campaigns have failed to reach or engage with communities due to a combination of practical issues such as the use of inappropriate language, imagery and media, but also due to assuming western medical concepts of illness.

T1  - Mothers Affected by Domestic Violence: Intersections and Opportunities with the Justice System
AN  - 1288117070
AB  - Secondary analysis from two qualitative studies was used to explore the interactions of mothers exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) with the justice system. Results were categorized according to three key themes: (a) negative interactions within the justice system, (b) positive interactions within the justice system, and (c) recommendations for an improved justice system response to domestic violence. Overall, findings suggested that mothers affected by domestic violence are confronted with negative attitudes and ineffectual practices within convoluted bureaucratic criminal justice systems, leaving many feeling revictimized. Despite the negative aspects of the legal system, women in both studies cited positive examples of feeling comforted, validated, and even empowered by the actions of the specific service providers. The findings of both studies underscore the need for greater efficiencies within the justice system and mandatory training for service providers, making it easier for women who have left their abusers to access appropriate support services, as well as the importance of affirmational support particularly when it can be provided by a peer with shared experiences. Future research is needed to guide the development of interventions that will limit the impacts of IPV exposure on child developmental outcomes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Gender and Binegativity: Men's and Women's Attitudes Toward Male and Female Bisexuals
AN  - 1322723238; 201313102
AB  - This study assessed the influence of gender on attitudes about bisexuals. A total of 164 heterosexual female and 89 heterosexual male undergraduates completed the Biphobia Scale (Mulick & Wright, 2002), rewritten to refer to bisexual men and bisexual women and thus re-named the Gender-Specific Binegativity Scale. A mixed-design ANOVA revealed an interaction between rater's sex and target's sex: women equally accepted bisexual men and bisexual women, but men were less accepting of bisexual men than bisexual women. A mediation analysis indicated the relationship between rater's sex and greater acceptance of bisexual women was partially explained by eroticization of female same-sex sexuality. Finally, participants also responded to two open-ended items, which provided additional information about the content of binegativity: participants described male bisexuals negatively, as gender-nonconforming, and labeled them "really gay," whereas participants described female bisexuals positively, as sexy, and labeled them "really heterosexual." These findings suggest multiple underlying beliefs about bisexuals that contribute to binegativity, particularly against bisexual men. Results also confirm the importance of considering gender (of both the target and the rater) when assessing sexual prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Maternal employment and gender role attitudes: dissonance among British men and women in the transition to parenthood
AN  - 1125224232; 201240904
AB  - This study examines how changes in gender role attitudes of couples after childbirth relate to women's paid work and the type of childcare used. Identifying attitude-practice dissonances matters because how they get resolved influences mothers' future employment. Previous research examined changes in women's attitudes and employment, or spouses' adaptations to each others' attitudes. This is extended by considering how women and men in couples simultaneously adapt to parenthood in terms of attitude and behavioural changes and by exploring indirect effects of economic constraints. Structural equation models and regression analysis based on the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2007) are applied. The results suggest that less traditional attitudes among women and men are more likely in couples where women's postnatal labour market participation and the use of formal childcare contradict their traditional prenatal attitudes. Women's prenatal earnings have an indirect effect on attitude change of both partners through incentives for maternal employment.

T1  - ALL RESPONSES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL
AN  - 1531930754; 201423237
AB  - This exploratory study makes a contribution to the literature on antiracism by analyzing how first-generation French Blacks of sub-Saharan African descent practice everyday antiracism. In doing so, it expands the demographic terrain of this research to highlight some particularities in the experience of everyday racism and antiracism for ethnoracial minorities of immigrant origins. In addition to experiencing forms of racism encountered by both immigrants and other native ethnoracial minorities, first-generation French Blacks (like other non-White first-generation Europeans), face symbolic exclusion from the national community and delegitimization of their claims to Europeanness. Examining their experiences sheds light on how race, immigration, and national identity intersect to generate unique experiences of racism and antiracism. This paper also contributes to our understanding of how social context shapes the range of everyday antiracist strategies at a person's disposal. Specifically, integrating Kasinitz et al.'s framework for categorizing incidents of racial discrimination and prejudice with Fleming et al.'s categorization of responses to stigmatization, I present an analysis of antiracist responses that takes into account both the nature of the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator of racism (i.e., impersonal vs. personal) and the social context in which the encounter occurs (e.g., school, work, public space, etc). In doing so, I highlight how the conditions of a given incident of racism or discrimination set constraints on the range of antiracist responses an individual can practically (or feasibly) employ.

T1  - On critical thinking
AN  - 2598119808
AB  - This paper begins by defining critical thinking and setting out a personal history of the author's journey toward becoming a critical thinker It considers two common barriers to critical thinking: cultural disapproval of critique; and confusing critical thinking with criticism. In response, it argues that rigorous thinking offers benefits-and not only risks- to cultures as well as individuals. It considers where cultural resources supportive of critique might be found. Further it argues that critical analysis should be understood (and undertaken) as a process of collaborative support for rigorous thinking rather than as a form of hostile criticism. Some dimensions of critical thinking are outlined, together with questions which might allow readers to apply them to specific contexts. The paper closes with some reflections on the process of writing in which some of these dimensions of critical thinking are applied to the paper itself.

T1  - How (not) to resurrect the body politic: the racist bias in Carl Schmitt's theory of sovereignty
AN  - 1531932712; 201423332
AB  - Carl Schmitt's 1927/1932 definition of the political domain as one based on the distinction between 'friend' and 'foe' (Freund v. Feind) has exercised political scientists, philosophers and historians to this day, not least on account of Schmitt's role before and during the Third Reich and his alleged influence on post-war German and West European political thought. In his 1938 book The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes, which built on Hobbes's version of the ancient body politic concept, Schmitt tried to underpin this distinction with a depiction of the 'political physiology' of the state. However, as his subtitle Meaning and Failure of a Political Symbol indicated, he was forced to admit that such a notion-and thus also its theoretical or practical 'resurrection' in the twentieth century-was not feasible. Musolff argues that Schmitt's friend-foe distinction, his emphatic notion of national sovereignty and his pronounced antisemitism are integral parts of a thought-system steeped in body imagery. However, rather than providing a basis for a new 'concept of the political', the state-body metaphor reveals the blind spot of Schmitt's vision of the sovereign nation state, which made it vulnerable to totalitarian interpretations.

T1  - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Physicians' Experiences in the Workplace
AN  - 1283641472; 201303310
AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) physicians in the workplace. There is little formal education in medical school about LGBT issues, and some heterosexual physicians have negative attitudes about caring for LGBT patients or working with LGBT coworkers, setting the stage for an exclusive and unwelcoming workplace. The current study used an online survey to assess a convenience sample of 427 LGBT physicians from a database of a national LGBT healthcare organization, as well as a snowball sample generated from the members of the database. Although rates of discriminatory behaviors had decreased since earlier reports, 10% reported that they were denied referrals from heterosexual colleagues, 15% had been harassed by a colleague, 22% had been socially ostracized, 65% had heard derogatory comments about LGBT individuals, 34% had witnessed discriminatory care of an LGBT patient, 36% had witnessed disrespect toward an LGBT patient's partner, and 27% had witnessed discriminatory treatment of an LGBT coworker. Few had received any formal education on LGBT issues in medical school or residency. It appears that medical schools and health care workplaces continue to ignore LGBT issues and operate in discriminatory fashion far too often. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Opposing Islamification or promoting Islamophobia? Understanding the English Defence League
AN  - 964197837; 201207380
AB  - The emergence and growth of the English Defence League (EDL) in the past two years as a socio-political mass movement are unprecedented in the British setting. Initially dismissed and duly condemned as a racist and Islamophobic far-right organization, little is known about the EDL. Allen's article begins by tracing the development of British far-right political groups that were trail-blazers in campaigning against the alleged threat posed by Muslims and Islam since 2001. The rise -- and subsequent fall -- of the British National Party is considered as a vehicle for understanding the climate in which hostility to Muslims has become increasingly apparent. It is in this context that the messages and discourse of the EDL are explored, as well as in regard to the organization's roots in the English football hooligan fraternity and specific events in Luton in the spring of 2009. Allen looks at the EDL's innovative use of social networking -- in particular its use of Facebook -- to support its street marches and protests, as well as its recognition of the economic impact it has had, given the costs associated with policing its marches and protests. Having established how the EDL is supported both actively and passively, not least through a somewhat unique coalition that brings together sometimes disparate groups on the basis of "the enemy of my own enemy is my friend" -- including groups that have historically been discriminated against by the far right -- Allen considers the the arguments for recognizing the EDL as a multicultural movement. He concludes that the messages of the EDL are indeed Islamophobic -- understanding Islamophobia as an ideological phenomenon -- in that they create a form of order that clearly demarcates Islam as the Other.

T1  - Straight Allies: What Predicts Heterosexuals' Alliance With the LGBT Community?
AN  - 1545066639
AB  - Despite their prominence in civil rights movements, out-group allies have been understudied. The current research examined out-group alliance, focusing on predictors of heterosexuals' advocacy for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights. Heterosexuals who were recruited through an online panel of research participants completed a survey containing measures of empathy, out-group contact, gender, education, and attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Additionally, participants indicated whether they had engaged in several allied behaviors (e.g., donating money for LGBT causes). Women, educated individuals, and those with gay and lesbian friends were more likely to be allies. Additionally, alliance was greatest among individuals lower in prejudice and simultaneously higher in positivity toward gays and lesbians. Implications regarding intergroup relations and future research are discussed.

T1  - Is anal sex a marker for sexual risk-taking? Results from a population-based study of young Croatian adults
AN  - 1030869079; 201229645
AB  - Background: There is evidence that anal sex is becoming increasingly popular among heterosexual women and men. Several studies carried out in especially vulnerable populations (e.g. sex workers and low-income youth) suggested that anal sex may indicate a more general propensity to sexual risk-taking. Methods: To assess whether this epidemiologically important finding holds in the case of young adults from the general population, we analysed data from a cross-sectional probability survey carried out in 2010 on 1005 Croatian women and men aged 18-25. Results: Anal intercourse was reported by 36.5% of 86l sexually experienced participants (42.7% of men and 29.8% of women). About one-third of them (34%) used a condom at most recent anal intercourse. The experience of anal sex was significantly associated (P< 0.001) with all four indicators of sexual risk-taking (condom use at most recent vaginal intercourse, number of sexual partners in the past year, concurrent sexual relationships and anonymous sex in the past year), as well as with negative attitudes and beliefs about condom use (P< 0.01). Sexual sensation-seeking mediated the relationship between anal sex and some of the sexual risk-taking behaviours. Conclusion: According to the findings, heterosexual anal sex is directly and indirectly associated with increased behavioural risks of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STI). Sex education and STI prevention programs should focus on the importance of using protection when practicing anal sex. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - HIV Risk Profiles Among HIV-Positive, Methamphetamine-Using Men Who Have Sex with Both Men and Women
AN  - 902084046; 201123588
AB  - This study examined demographic characteristics, sexual risk behaviors, sexual beliefs, and substance use patterns in HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) (n=50) as compared to men who have sex with men only (MSM) (n=150). Separate logistic regressions were conducted to predict group membership. In the final model, of 12 variables, eight were independently associated with group membership. Factors independently associated with MSMW were acquiring HIV through injection drug use, being an injection drug user, using hallucinogens, using crack, being less likely to have sex at a bathhouse, being less likely to be the receptive partner when high on methamphetamine, having greater intentions to use condoms for oral sex, and having more negative attitudes about HIV disclosure. These results suggest that, among HIV-positive methamphetamine users, MSMW differ significantly from MSM in terms of their HIV risk behaviors. Studies of gay men and HIV often also include bisexual men, grouping them all together as MSM, which may obscure important differences between MSMW and MSM. It is important that future studies consider MSM and MSMW separately in order to expand our knowledge about differential HIV prevention needs for both groups. This study showed that there were important differences in primary and secondary prevention needs of MSM and MSMW. These findings have implications for both primary and secondary HIV prevention among these high-risk populations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS AND TREATMENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR REGARDING REPRODUCTIVE TRACT INFECTIONS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IN LAO PDR: A QUALITATIVE STUDY
AN  - 857656859; 21211093
AB  - Summary              Creating community awareness of reproductive tract infections (RTI), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and how to prevent them is essential to minimize their spread. Data on people's views about RTI/STI are entirely lacking in Laos. The aim of this study was thus to explore people's perceptions, treatment-seeking behaviour and understanding of information about RTI/STI, in urban and rural communities in two provinces in Laos. Fourteen focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with 76 women and 56 men, selected purposively to provide diversity of socio-demographic backgrounds. Qualitative content analysis was employed for the data analysis. The major finding was that both male and female participants had a variety of misconceptions about the causes and symptoms of RTI/STI and their cure, and a reluctance to seek health care, which could cause delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The most common treatment-seeking behaviour was self-medication through private pharmacies, following advice mostly given by friends and drug sellers. The main reasons for not going to health facilities were fear of social discrimination or shyness of genital examination. Complaints were also made about clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'. Although condom use was mentioned as a way to prevent RTI/STI, an unwillingness to use condoms was commonly expressed. The main media sources of RTI/STI information were radio and television, and access to health information was more difficult in rural areas. The health messages provided were mostly  understood, except for some technical terms. The findings indicate that strengthening health education and promotion through interventions at the community level is recommended to improve quality of RTI/STI management. Health education messages should be more accessible in rural areas. There is also an urgent need to improve communication between RTI/STI patients and clinicians. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Improving intergroup relations through direct, extended and other forms of indirect contact
AN  - 902083821; 201122121
AB  - The benefits of direct, personal contact with members of another group are well established empirically. This Special Issue complements that body of work by demonstrating the effects of various forms of indirect contact on intergroup attitudes and relations. Indirect contact includes (a) extended contact: learning that an ingroup member is friends with an outgroup member, (b) vicarious contact: observing an ingroup member interact with an outgroup member, and (c) imagined contact: imagining oneself interacting with an outgroup member. The effects of indirect contact not only occur independently of direct contact, they often involve distinct psychological mechanisms. The present article briefly reviews work on direct intergroup contact and then discusses recent theoretical and empirical developments in the study of extended contact, vicarious contact, and imagined contact. We consider the similarities and distinctions in the dynamics of these forms of indirect contact and conclude by identifying promising directions for future research.

T1  - Prologue: the riddle of race
AN  - 902082820; 201122214
AB  - Bernard explores the myth of racelessness as it is currently circulating in American social discourse. The election of the first black American president has unleashed the term across the cultural landscape, from the mainstream media to the classrooms in which she teaches African American literature. Students use the term as a twenty-first-century incarnation of the civil rights-era concept of colour blindness. But racelessness does not represent an aspiration for equality as much as it represents an ambition to turn away from the realities of difference. It is code for a common ambition to avoid the realities of institutional racial inequalities, as well as personal experiences of cultural difference. The myth of racelessness intersects uncomfortably with current academic discourse that promotes the view of race as a social construction. Scientifically proven and irrefutably true, this discourse does not allow any room for the social experience of race and racial difference as it is lived by everyone every day, whether we like it or not. The election of President Barack Obama is a portal on to this current confusion about the concept of race, specifically, and blackness, in particular. Many pundits have speculated that Obama would not have been electable if he had had dark skin, if he were irrefutably black, in colour and culture. The fact that he himself has elected to call himself 'black' serves as the platform of Bernard's essay on the case of race in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Teaching Obama: history, critical race theory and social work education
AN  - 902082817; 201122245
AB  - Barack Obama's first autobiography, Dreams from My Father (1995), explores themes of race and identity up to the late 1980s in the life of the first African American president. The book emphasizes Obama's personal struggle as the son of an interracial couple, and the social and environmental context that shaped his growth and transformation. Using the tools of critical race theory, Freeman illustrates how Obama's autobiography can be used in the classroom to explore an individual's developing racial consciousness in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a prism through which students can understand what it means to live in the post-civil-rights-movement era. Obama's life history illuminates how the ideas and meanings of racial progress in the United States are contested and struggled over on a daily basis at both the micro and macro level.

T1  - Rape Myth Acceptance, Sexual Trauma History, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
AN  - 764429643; 201066799
AB  - The prediction of false rape-related beliefs (rape myth acceptance [RMA]) was examined using the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (Payne, Lonsway, & Fitzgerald, 1999) among a nonclinical sample of 258 male and female college students. Predictor variables included measures of attitudes toward women, gender role identity (GRI), sexual trauma history, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. Using linear regression and testing interaction effects, negative attitudes toward women significantly predicted greater RMA for individuals without a sexual trauma history. However, neither attitudes toward women nor GRI were significant predictors of RMA for individuals with a sexual trauma history. PTSD did not moderate RMA's relationship with attitudes toward women and GRI. This study has clinical implications for treatment as well as for the development of rape myth-dispelling programs.

T1  - Patient Characteristics That Impact Tattoo Removal Resource-Allocation Choices: Tattoo Content, Age, and Parental Status
AN  - 1866473413
AB  - This study assessed characteristics that affect decisions about receipt of a tattoo-removal procedure among members of stigmatized groups. Two experiments, each with different participants, assessed how changes in characteristics of hypothetical patients described as having a tattoo that reduced employment prospects affected how participants allocated access to the procedure. Patient characteristics assessed were parental status, age, and tattoo content. Participants ranked prospective patients (all described as having an undesirable tattoo, and varied with respect to the aforementioned characteristics) on the priority for receipt of removal. Young patients with children, and with specific tattoo contents, were favored. Implications for prejudice against certain groups are noted.

T1  - African American Male Leaders in Counseling: Interviews With Five AMCD Past Presidents
AN  - 758658734
AB  - [...] there were eight themes that were found in each of the five interviews and these constituted the most significant findings.\ng., family, mentors; (f) they conveyed a sense of modesty; (g) they were courageous and filled with emotional and physical energy for fighting prejudice and injustice in their lives; (h) each was empowered and supported by a community of family and friends; (i) they expressed the values of collectivism and spirituality; (j) they felt they were part of a multiculturalist community; (k) they embodied multiculturalism in that they could negotiate and appreciate multiple cultures and see richness in diversity; and (1) they each had channeled painful experiences of discrimination into positive action and "appear to have an inner tranquility, peace, and a secure self- and group-actualized identity . . . and seem to be involved in an ongoing process of further personal and professional growth and challenges" (Ponterotto, Jackson, et al., 2001, p. 159) .  [...] one can see that the paths these African American men took through college and graduate school and into AMCD were similar to one another and corresponded with leadership development literature (Bennis, 2009): They had success experiences in college and in their jobs; they moved from lower to higher positions, often being trained for those positions and mentored within AMCD; and they came to a place where they embraced their status.

T1  - The Presumptions of Resulting Trust and Advancement in Singapore: Unfairness to The Woman?
AN  - 754042427; 201055314
AB  - The article examines the resurgence of the modified twin presumptions of resulting trust and advancement in family cases in Singapore, comparing the Singapore position with the current UK law as elucidated in Stack v Dowden. It analyses the impact that the heavily factbased inquiry enjoined by the Singapore Court of Appeal has on the woman in the relationship. The operation of the presumption of resulting trust gives rise to a real possibility of undermining joint tenancies in favour of a tenancy-in-common in equity, proportionate to the respective contributions of the couple. This tends to generate prejudice towards women as statistics reveal that their average income is still far less than that of men if they work at all. Additionally, the burden is on the woman to prove the presumption of advancement and its strength -- a daunting and complex task. The article also discusses a qualitative study undertaken by the author, which involved interviewing a sample of conveyancers regarding, inter alia, how they advise the woman about the implications of joint tenancies and manner of holding. Current conveyancing practice is then analysed though the lens of legal and sociological theory. The article concludes with suggestions for reform on two grounds: refining the conveyancing process to ensure that women are better equipped to make decisions that safeguard their rights and modifying the law to ameliorate the unfairness caused to women by the current Singapore version of the twin presumptions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Parochial geographies: Growing up in divided Belfast
AN  - 1928193238
AB  - This article explores the ways in which teenagers occupy and manage space in one divided community in Northern Ireland. Drawing on stories, maps and focus group discussions with 80 teenagers, from an interface area in Belfast, the article reveals their perceptions and experiences of divided cities, as risky landscapes. Teenagers respond to these risks in various ways, at times reiterating traditional sectarian prejudices and at times demonstrating resilience in coping with growing up in a risky location. In the process, young people develop strategies of resistance, which at times support, and at times undermine, the wider ideologies underpinning ethnic conflict in Northern Ireland.

T1  - Public Support for a Ban on Headscarves: A Cross-National Perspective
AN  - 863244215
AB  - This paper compares a psychological explanation of support for a ban on headscarves in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands. This study examines how perceptions of threat posed by Muslims and Islam and the overall attitude towards Muslims explain support for a ban on headscarves. In addition, cross-national comparisons are made to study how these relations are affected by contextual differences. Analyses are based on the 2005 survey on Islamic extremism by the Pew Research Center. Results show that the countries have a large influence on whether someone supports the ban on headscarves, indicating that contextual differences matter. In addition, having a negative attitude towards Muslims makes it more likely to support a ban on headscarves. In general, perceived threat contributes to stronger support, although there are slight differences in effect between the countries. Finally, perceived threat equally influences support for the ban on headscarves among prejudiced and non-prejudiced people. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Theorizing identity: beyond the 'us' and 'them' dichotomy
AN  - 754039062; 201049831
AB  - Yuval-Davis discusses three interconnected questions relating to identity. She first examines whether and in what ways the notion of identity should be theorized, on the one hand, and empirically researched, on the other, focusing on the opposing views of Stuart Hall and Robin Williams. She then examines the contested question of what is identity, positioning it in relation to notions of belonging and the politics of belonging, and in relation to several influential schools of thought, especially those that construct identity as a mode of narrative, as a mode of performativity or as a dialogical practice. Her third interrelated question concerns the boundaries of identity and the relationship between self and non-self. She explores both social psychological and psychoanalytical approaches to that question, and deals with questions such as reflexivity, identifications and forced identities. The last part of the article explores several types of relationships between self and non-self, such as: 'me' and 'us'; 'me/us' and 'them'; 'me' and other 'others'; 'me' and the transversal 'us/them'. Yuval-Davis's basic argument here is that dichotomous notions of identity and difference, when theorizing boundaries of individual and collective identities, are more misleading than explanatory. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Relationship Between Recent Life Events, Social Supports, and Attitudes to Domestic Violence
AN  - 743043669; 201030245
AB  - The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between recent life events, attitudes to domestic violence (DV), and DV behaviors among perpetrators of DV in China. A total of 600 participants were assessed for recent life events, psychological functioning, social support, and attitudes to DV. Results demonstrated that recent negative life events (NLE) and attitudes to DV were predictive factors for DV among perpetrators of DV, after controlling for demographic variables, psychological functioning, and social supports. The findings suggest that recent life events are potential factors contributing to behaviors of DV. The importance of changes of negative attitudes to DV among perpetrators was highly emphasized. Intervention and prevention programs based on psychological functioning and social support in relation to perpetrators of DV may be useful to control DV in China.

T1  - The Impact of Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression Bias on African American Students
AN  - 884044966
AB  - This article discusses sexual orientation and gender expression bias as they impact the educational experience of African American students. Sexual orientation and gender expression bias have a unique presentation in Black educational settings. The climate in such settings can be metagrobolized by the combination of distorted notions of Black sexuality and of homosexuality. The legacy of internalized racism as it impacts sexuality is examined in this article. Homophobia, heterosexism, and the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning (LGBTQ) students are also discussed. Implications for school safety, academic achievement, and student mental health are elucidated along with recommendations for policy, practice and advocacy-based interventions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
