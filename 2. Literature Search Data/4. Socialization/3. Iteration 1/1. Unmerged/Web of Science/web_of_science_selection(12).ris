AB  - The study explores how the eponymous novel Our Lady of Alice Bhatti (2011) by Mohammed Hanif takes the stance of rediscovering the multifaceted strains of sexual violence as on the backdrop of sainthood. The protagonist (Alice) executes saintly miracles with her unnerving gifts for which superficially she is perceived as a divine human being if not worshipped. But nothing, not even her supernatural skill set, can restrain her from being a victim of sexual violence. Rather spiritual holiness is shattered by the intimidation of the body. Alice's mystic powers are treated like a witch's necromancy than a curer's touch for which she is prejudiced as an easily accessible flesh. This preoccupation of terror is not merely the creed for sex but the greed for violence (hence power). Finding common grounds between two religions on the basis of humanity and nature the paper sounds true to its venture of the issue of sexual violence along with its turnovers in the social, political and cultural dynamism of sainthood.

AB  - There is growing international interest in young people's post-compulsory education pathways. In contexts of widening participation' as university is increasingly normalised', how do young people choose alternative routes into training and employment? While in Britain apprenticeships are a key aspect of government strategy, there are many challenges still associated with these schemes including low pay and inconsistent training. Drawing on longitudinal data from our qualitative research with young people on apprenticeship schemes in London, we use narrative analysis, informed by Goffman's theory of stigma, to explore how young people narrate and navigate the tensions between apprenticeships as opportunities to learn while they earn' and university degrees as the prevailing gold standard' of achievement and future success. Our findings show that while these young people were aware of the challenges associated with apprenticeships, they used specific rhetorical devices to reclaim the normalcy of their training pathways as sensible' and mature' choices.

AB  - Affective and social political polarizationa dislike of political opponents and a desire to avoid their companyare increasingly salient and pervasive features of politics in many Western democracies, particularly the United States. One contributor to these related phenomena may be increasing exposure to online political disagreements in which ordinary citizens criticize, and sometimes explicitly demean, opponents. This article presents two experimental studies that assessed whether U.S. partisans' attitudes became more prejudiced in favor of the in-party after exposure to online partisan criticism. In the first study, we draw on an online convenience sample to establish that partisan criticism that derogates political opponents increases affective polarization. In the second, we replicate these findings with a quasi-representative sample and extend the pattern of findings to social polarization. We conclude that online partisan criticism likely has contributed to rising affective and social polarization in recent years between Democrats and Republicans in the United States, and perhaps between partisan and ideological group members in other developed democracies as well. We close by discussing the troubling implications of these findings in light of continuing attempts by autocratic regimes and other actors to influence democratic elections via false identities on social media.

AB  - Social categorization is the foundation of stereotype activation, and the process from social categorization to stereotype activation is rapid. However, the time from social categorization to stereotype activation is unknown. This study involves a real-time measurement of the time course of gender-stereotype activation beginning with gender categorization using event-related potential technology with a face as the priming stimulus. We found that 195 ms after a face stimulus was presented, brain waves stimulated by male or female gender categorization showed a clear separation, with male faces stimulating larger N200 waves. In addition, 475 ms after a face stimulus appeared or 280 ms after the gendercategorization process occurred, gender-stereotype-consistent and gender-stereotype-inconsistent stimuli were distinct, with gender-stereotype-inconsistent stimuli inducing larger N400 waves. These results indicate that during gender-stereotype activation by face perception, gender categorization occurs approximately 195 ms after seeing a face stimulus and a gender stereotype is activated at approximately 475 ms.

AB  - ObjectiveThe marriage equality debate is becoming increasingly prominent in Australian political and media discourse. Moreover, as policy that would legislate marriage equality continues to be debated in political circles, public opinion on the topic appears to be becoming increasingly divided. This article presents a cross-sectional study exploring predictors of support for marriage equality.
   MethodA sample of 137 Australians (66% females) responded to a series of demographic items, a measure of attitudes towards gay men and lesbian women, and a forced-choice question asking whether or not they would support marriage between two peopleregardless of their gender.
   ResultsThe results revealed that support for marriage equality in this sample was predicted by religious affiliation, political orientation, and sexual prejudice. More specifically, individuals in support of marriage equality were more likely to be non-religious, politically liberal, and have more positive attitudes towards gay men (attitudes towards lesbian women were unrelated to support for marriage equality). Age and gender did not predict support for marriage equality.
   ConclusionsSupport for marriage equality in Australia can be predicted by social attitudes and demographic variables. These findings are discussed in terms of the implications of maintaining the legal status quo, which mandates marriage inequality.

AB  - More than a hundred thousand people crisscross South Africa's international borders annually. Public opinion on this cross-border migration is decidedly hostile. According to a 2013 opinion poll, more than three-fifths of the adult population would favour closing the border. Can civic and ethnic identifications with the nation explain this opposition to immigration? Using data from the 12th (2013) round of the cross-sectional South African Social Attitudes Survey (N= 2,739) this paper was able to investigate individual attitudes towards border control. This paper investigates different dimensions of national identity. The results revealed that ethnic national attachment was an important determinant of attitudes towards border control. Such attitudes were also associated with attitudes towards immigrant assimilation and the effect of nationalism on society. For those aiming to ameliorate public sentiment on border control, this study provides a test of multiple determinants of public opinion on the issue, examining the comparative strength of each.

AB  - Bilingual education influences the academic achievement of students in a positive way. Building bridges between two languages in education benefits students by developing confidence and fluency in using written and oral second language for academic accomplishment and for daily communication. The purpose of this study is to investigate how a bilingual education program effects the minority groups' academic achievements. An explanatory sequential mixed method was used for this study. Triangulation was used in both the quantitative and qualitative parts of the study to minimize prejudice and enhance honesty regarding the social phenomenon studied. Both the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed to examine the parameters to reveal academic achievements within a bilingual education context. For quantitative data collection, 140 participants responded the survey questions. For qualitative data collection, 12 participants were interviewed. Results indicated that bilingual education would help build stronger relationships between different ethnic groups and have a positive effect on all the academic achievement of minority students. Academic achievement is vital for minority people because, if they are not going to be educated or attend a university, they might be unable find a job and be involved in the community.

AB  - This paper examines a set of research evidence compiled in the last two decades by the author and several of his Australian colleagues to argue that violence directed at gay men, lesbians and transsexuals as 'sexual minorities' has not been wholly distinct from other general forms of male perpetrated violence with a broad range of victims including heterosexual women and other men attacked in general male-on-male violence. It observes that harassment and violence directed against sexual groups have been highly gendered and everyday phenomena and narrow views of homophobic prejudice should be refined in order to appreciate this. Furthermore, reflecting on these research findings indicates these violent acts have been widespread and collective social phenomena built on masculine understandings of a sexual mainstream and subordinate others. By focusing upon the masculine facets of this violence it can be seen that much of this violence has been a hostile response to sexual and gender non-conformity through which male perpetrators have sought to enact, police and reinforce sexual hierarchies and gender boundaries. There is contemporary research uncertainty about the real extent of sexual prejudice and related violence in Australia and similar liberal democratic nations around the globe. Nevertheless, it is evident that this social phenomenon had a key historical role in signaling socially acceptable masculine appearance and behavior.

AB  - Scant research has been conducted on gender in the Arab world; one explanation is due to a lack of Arabic measures on gender-related issues. To advance scientific work on gender in the Arab world, we developed the Arab Adolescents Gender Roles Attitude Scale (AAGRAS), the first known reliable and valid Arabic measure of gender-role attitudes. To develop this measure, we conducted two studies based on data collected from 776 high school students 15-19 years-old from the state of Qatar. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis produced 12 items divided equally into two subscales. One subscale assesses traditional gender-role attitudes, whereas the other measures egalitarian gender-role attitudes. Our findings indicate that young men are more likely to resist gender equality than young women are. Moreover, those who hold traditional attitudes are more likely to disapprove of women occupying positions of authority. The AAGRAS is a useful assessment tool that policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and educators can use to study gender-role attitudes in the Arab world and to develop educational and intervention programs that encourage adolescents to identify, confront, and avoid prejudice and discrimination against women and ultimately adopt more egalitarian gender roles.

AB  - Epistemic motives and threat have been considered important bases of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) for a long time. Yet, the interplay between these variables has hardly been investigated. The present study therefore examined how the interaction between dispositional need for closure (NFC) and perceived external threat, in addition to their main effects, shapes individuals' endorsement of RWA. In a representative sample collected in the Netherlands (N = 588), the results revealed cross-sectional as well as longitudinal interaction effects. In particular, higher levels of NFC were related to higher levels of RWA when individuals perceived relatively low levels of external threat. However, when the levels of perceived threat were relatively high, NFC was not significantly related to RWA. We discuss the importance of taking into account perceived contextual factors in theorizing on the motivated social cognitive basis of authoritarian ideology.

AB  - Numerous studies point to the potential of intergroup contact for reducing prejudice and intergroup tension. However, this potential can be realized only when group members are willing to engage in intergroup contact. The goal of the current article is to provide a theoretical framework for understanding the barriers and the motivations that explain why individuals would be willing (or not) to engage in intergroup contact. Our taxonomy relies on Pettigrew's (1997) multilevel approach for analyzing social phenomenon, considering the impact of factors at the macro societal level, the meso intermediate level, and the micro individual level. This taxonomy enables us to devote special attention to barriers and motivations that are specific to groups trapped in violent intergroup conflict (macrolevel factors), to barriers and motivations that result from membership in social groups (mesolevel factors), and to motivators and barriers that exist at the intrapersonal level (e.g., microlevel factors). We discuss the integration of the various levels and the implication of such integration for future research and practice. This article forms a roadmap for investigating a relatively understudied angle in the literature on contact and provides both theoretical and practical insights as to when and why individuals are willing to engage in intergroup contact.

We recruited a multiethnic sample of 129 gay and bisexual men living with HIV who completed a brief survey; a subset of participants completed semi-structured qualitative interviews to contextualize the data. In bivariate analyses, stigma was positively and significantly correlated with depression (r = .402, p < .001) and negatively correlated with social support (r = -.482, p < .001). Qualitative interview results captured the mental suffering caused by stigma and coping strategies the men had developed. Although some of the coping strategies reduced the likelihood of experiencing acts of stigmatization, they also exacerbated the psychological stress of living with a stigmatized disease and limited the potential for social support. Our results highlight the need to scale up stigma-reduction programs, particularly those that can bolster social support networks. Copyright (C) 2017 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care

AB  - This article addresses the way in which the securitisation of education, effected through initiatives in counter-terrorism such as Prevent, leads to what I call 'pedagogical injustice' for students and teachers. It analyses the implications of the pre-crime agenda in the space of the classroom and draws upon literature on epistemic injustice, communicative injustice and institutional prejudice to explain why bringing counter-terrorist legislation into education undermines the educational endeavour. It argues that by re-framing the Prevent agenda in the language of therapy, resilience and well-being, indicators guiding its implementation that might otherwise be seen as illegitimate or even illegal forms of profiling are given credence in the spheres of education and other domains which demand pastoral care from professionals. By targeting ideas instead of focusing on violence, Prevent undermines educators. Foucault describes this kind of blurring of discourses as ubuesque and examines the veneer of legitimacy given when professionals engage in discourses and practices beyond their specific expertise. This new figure is the counter-terrorist educator operating between the spheres of security, psychology and education. To contest this image of education and outline the dangers of this approach, we turn to Arendt's writings on education and her commitment to 'training the imagination to go visiting'.

AB  - Educational equity dominates discussions of US schooling. However, what educational equity' means is much contested in the scholarly literature and in public discourses. We follow the lead of scholars of color who have problematized the definition of educational equity. They have shown that the dominant, taken-for-granted definitions of equity which disguises the accumulation of societal and educational exclusions of and prejudices toward historically marginalized students, their families, and their communities. In response to this critique, we offer a new definitional framework for educational equity' that is community-based and, in our specific case, urban community-based. And, then, we will apply this new equity framework to three examples or exemplars' of education reform to explicate how they do and do not illustrate our framework. We will finish with a brief discussion, recommendations for future scholarship, and some concluding remarks.

AB  - Segregation has long been recognized as a source of ignorance which breeds negative feelings and hostility. This view maintains that interactions between members of different groups can foster social bonds and promote positive group relationship. Employing recently collected survey data, this study examines the effect of cross-Strait contacts on Taiwan citizens' negative views toward Chinese citizens and the Beijing government. The empirical results show that casual encounters have no effect on the island residents' general perception of China. Serious interactions in the form of friendship moderate their unfavorable feelings of Chinese citizens but have no effects on the perception of a hostile Beijing. Unless contacts can invoke true social bonds, frequent interactions do not have transformative effects on individuals' political views. The moderating effect of contacts at the personal level is not transferable to a political entity when the latter is perceived as a suppressing agent.

AB  - Background: General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the care of somatic and psychiatric problems in people diagnosed with schizophrenia (PWS). It is probable that, like other health professionals, GPs are not all free of prejudices toward PWS. In clinical practice, GPs sometimes interact with clients diagnosed with schizophrenia by specialists, passively accepting this diagnosis. Other times, GPs interact with clients having symptoms of schizophrenia but who have not been diagnosed. In this case, GPs are expected to actively make a diagnosis. Giving the key role of GPs in the process of care, it is worthwhile examining whether passive acceptance and active usage of the diagnosis schizophrenia have differential effects on GPs' attitudes toward people with this disorder.
   Aims: To investigate GPs' views of schizophrenia and whether they were influenced by a schizophrenia' label, passively accepted or actively used.
   Methods: A total of 430 randomly selected GPs were invited to complete a questionnaire about their views of schizophrenia, either after reading a description of this disorder and making a diagnosis, or without being provided with a description but passively accepting the label schizophrenia' given in the questionnaire.
   Results: The GPs who passively accepted the label schizophrenia (n=195) and those who actively identified schizophrenia from the description (n=127) had similar views. Compared to the GPs who did not identify schizophrenia in the description (n=65), those who used the diagnosis, actively or passively: more frequently reported heredity and less frequently psychosocial factors as causes of the disorder; were more skeptical about recovery; were more convinced of the need for long-term pharmacotherapies; believed more strongly that PWS should be discriminated against when in medical hospital; and perceived PWS as more dangerous and as kept at greater social distance.
   Conclusion: The diagnosis schizophrenia', however used, is associated with pessimistic views. Stigma education should be provided to GPs.

T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA  - English
KW  - RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS
AB  - In this article, we use qualitative data from 100 Native Americans living in mid-Michigan to document the changing nature of interactions between whites and tribal members. The community studied has seen significant changes in the economic and social position of the tribal community thanks to two decades of successful gaming operations. We find that, while Native Americans attest to positive changes in the community, many of which originate within the tribe itself, hostile and negative attitudes on the part of whites persist. Some of these contemporary attitudes are carry-overs of traditional anti-Native prejudice, while others reflect a reworking of old stereotypes to reflect new realities, while maintaining an unequal racial order. Hostile attitudes are accompanied by discriminatory behavior, often in the form of microaggressions. We suggest that, while old-fashioned racism has not disappeared, modern racism is more subtle and complex. While contemporary Native Americans react to and resist racism in a variety of ways, modern racist attitudes and the microaggressions that accompany them serve to reinforce an unequal racial status quo and the maintenance of a racial hierarchy of group positions.

AB  - Improving mainstream perceptions of diversity in Hong Kong is fundamental to enhancing equality and human rights in the society in the future. The importance of mainstream members of society learning to recognize diversity with less prejudice undergirds many of the aims of a recent educational reform, Liberal Studies. This paper evaluates the capacity of Liberal Studies to educate for multicultural understanding of cultural difference. Its primary data source is Liberal Studies textbooks, and it employs a qualitative content analysis to consider how diversity and ethnic, cultural, and religious differences are represented in the texts. The analysis is complemented by an examination of related resources teachers may use in the classroom (and are encouraged to use by the Hong Kong Curriculum Development Council): mainstream news articles and resources from the (government-provided) Web-based Resource Platform for Liberal Studies. The voices and views of some practicing teachers and pre-service teacher education students related to multicultural Liberal Studies resources are also included to provide a balanced picture. Based on this analysis, multicultural education as provided in major resources within the Liberal Studies curriculum appears inadequate. As diversity is reflected upon in resources analyzed here most often as problematic and stereotypical, interventions are needed if Liberal Studies is to enable multicultural appreciation and understanding among students in Hong Kong in the future.

T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH & PRACTICE
LA  - English
KW  - HEALTH
KW  - STIGMA
AB  - Aim: Mental illnesses have many distinctive features that make determining eligibility for disability income support challenging - for example, their fluctuating nature, invisibility and lack of diagnostic clarity. How do policy makers deal with these features when designing disability income support? More specifically, how do mental illnesses come to be considered eligible disabilities, what tools are used to assess mental illnesses for eligibility, what challenges exist in this process, and what approaches are used to address these challenges? We aimed to determine what evidence is available to policy makers in Australia and Ontario, Canada, to answer these questions.
   Methods: Ten electronic databases and grey literature in both jurisdictions were searched using key words, including disability income support, disability pension, mental illness, mental disability, addiction, depression and schizophrenia, for articles published between 1991 and June 2013. This yielded 1341 articles, of which 20 met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised.
   Results: Limited evidence is available on disability income support design and mental illnesses in the Australian and Ontarian settings. Most of the evidence is from the grey literature and draws on case law. Many documents reviewed argued that current policy in Australia and Ontario is frequently based on negative assumptions about mental illnesses rather than evidence (either peer reviewed or in the grey literature). Problems relating to mental illnesses largely relate to interpretation of the definition of mental illness rather than the definition itself.
   Conclusions: The review confirmed that mental illnesses present many challenges when designing disability income support and that academic as well as grey literature, especially case law, provides insight into these challenges. More research is needed to address these challenges, and more evidence could lead to policies for those with mental illnesses that are well informed and do not reinforce societal prejudices.

AB  - In three experiments (N= 56, 99, and 225), we showed that racial phenotypicality bias characterizes educational expectations for Chilean mestizo students: participants displayed more positive educational expectations for light complexioned than for dark complexioned high school students. In Study 1, with male high school target students, the relation between racial phenotypic appearance and educational expectations was mediated by differences in perceived competence. Study 2 suggests that the gender of the target student did not influence the occurrence of racial phenotypicality bias. Study 3 showed that racial phenotypicality bias occurs in both university students and high school teachers' judgements. Although socioeconomic background of the target student partially explained the effects of racial phenotypic appearance (especially in teachers), the latter exerted an additional and independent influence on educational expectations. These results underline the fact that effects of racial phenotypicality bias should not be overlooked in the educational domain. As mediational analyses suggested, these effects only partly occur because of stereotypical associations between racial phenotypic appearance and socioeconomic background, but also because of stereotypical associations between racial phenotypic appearance and attributed competence.

AB  - Nationalism played a role in almost all cases of denunciation that occurred in the Habsburg Monarchy during the First World War. But nationalism was never the only motive behind denunciation and the basis for decisions made by state authorities. Accusations were also influenced by the wartime food shortages, pre-war animosities and prejudices as well as conflicts among different social classes, religious groups, and political ideologies. Nevertheless, almost all denouncers mentioned nationality to stress the importance of their information. This paper examines the work of the Habsburg War Surveillance Office, which was responsible for dealing with denunciation in wartime Austria-Hungary. It investigates this institution's reaction to cases of denunciation from across the Habsburg Monarchy and to which extent nationalities questions played a role. Although according to the Austrian constitution all languages were to be treated equally, the War Surveillance Office treated German-language denunciations more seriously than those in other languages, so non-German-speakers also wrote their denunciations in German.

AB  - Intergroup contact-(positive) interactions with people from different social groups-is a widely researched and strongly supported prejudice-reducing mechanism shown to reduce prejudice against a wide variety of outgroups. However, no known previous research has investigated whether intergroup contact can also reduce sexism against women. Sexism has an array of negative outcomes. One of the most detrimental and violent ones is rape, which is both justified and downplayed by rape myth acceptance. We hypothesised that more frequent, higher quality contact with counter-stereotypical women would predict lower levels of sexism and thus less rape myth acceptance (in men) and less sexualised projected responses to rape (in women). Two studies using online surveys with community samples supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 170 male participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less intention to rape. Similarly, in Study 2, 280 female participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less projected sexual arousal at the thought of being raped. Thus, the present research is the first known to show that contact could be a potential tool to combat sexism, rape myth acceptance, intentions to rape in men, and sexualisation of rape by women.

AB  - The present study addresses antecedents and consequences of collective victimhood in the context of World War I (WWI) across 15 European nations (N=2423 social science students). Using multilevel analysis, we find evidence that collective victimhood is still present a hundred years after the onset of the war and can be predicted by WWI-related objective indicators of victimization at national and family levels. This suggests that collective victimhood is partly grounded in the actual experience of WWI. In addition, we show that sense of collective victimhood positively predicts acknowledgment of the suffering inflicted by one's nation on other countries during WWI. This is consistent with a social representation of WWI as involving a vast massacre in which nations were both victim and perpetrator. Finally, we find that objective indicators of victimization predict pacifism in divergent ways, with an indicator at the national level associated with more pacifist attitudes and an indicator at the family level being associated with less pacifist attitudes. This finding suggests that war-torn societies may have developed social representations favouring peaceful coexistence whereas, at the family level, victimization may still foster retaliatory tendencies.

AB  - This article focuses on the recent phenomenon of Ethiopian films that prominently feature Chinese characters. As the success of these films relies on representing a stereotypical Chinese 'Other', and in reference to China's ever-growing presence in African countries, we pose broader questions relating to the place of ethnicity, race and national identity in popular cultural productions emerging from the continent. Through an analysis which caters for multiple and at times oppositional interpretations, we argue that the representation of the 'Chinese Other' constructed by these films at times criticizes and at times reasserts existing stereotypes and prejudices. The overriding view and intent of the filmmakers to use Chinese characters mainly as narrative devices is often functional in the development of specific, inward-looking social and political criticisms. But this attitude inevitably forces the films to overlook the key issue underlying discourses about otherness in Ethiopian popular media - namely the issue of how to deal with racial multiplicity in a society that defines belonging along rigid and exclusionary terms.

AB  - This paper is situated at the intersection of ethics, pedagogy, and bias. Various challenges for pedagogy that are posed by explicit and implicit bias are discussed. Potential solutions to such challenges are then explored. These include practices such as enhanced thought experiments, interviews, research projects, in-depth role-playing, action projects, and appropriately morally deferential experiential service-learning. Moral imagination can be beneficially stretched through adopting differing moral lenses and engaging and encouraging multiple empathizing; art and literary narrative provide helpful tools to this end. Also recommended is critical scrutiny focused on personal biases (including teacher bias) and developing curriculum focused on moral literacy. Such moves of necessity span from individual to public action given the environmental components of the operations of bias. Shaping ourselves through intentional environment construction and avoidance of undesirable environments is therefore identified as a valuable technique. Finally, the potential contribution of loving-kindness meditation is addressed. Although we may be unable at present to eradicate problematic forms of bias, there are multiple methods available to begin to ameliorate the harms associated with those forms of bias.

AB  - Sexism as a variety of prejudice is widely addressed as a severe social problem for society owing to its quality of establishing various forms of inequality. However, sexism is a rather neglected issue in geography especially concerning the global South. The postcolonial island state of Mauritius, agrarian oriented and socially conservative but well integrated in global value chains, shows the unique combination of a strong paternalistic form of inward ethnic orientation, characteristic for most postcolonial states, combined with a minor tendency for metropolisation, which makes the island state worthwhile for the further development of generic theories of sexism in general. The paper analyses relevant predictors of sexism in Mauritius that can be useful in informing approaches that focus especially north/south differences of gender inequality. It becomes apparent that mechanisms of sexism in Mauritius are in most dimensions the same as the mechanisms found in the global North. Communalism and absent metropolisation remain significant, yet other important predictors are sex, life satisfaction, withholding citizen rights to foreign wives of Mauritian men, and xenophobic attitudes. These results point in the direction of the necessity to think in new ways about attitudinal differences of societies in the global North/South especially in postcolonial contexts.

AB  - Aims: To provide new insights into the socio-demographic characteristics of people who frequently attend Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments for alcohol-related reasons and to explore the findings with reference to stereotyping and prejudice. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 30 individuals (18 males; 12 females; aged 20-68 years) recruited from six A&E departments across London, United Kingdom. Participants had all attended A&E 10 times within the last year or 5 times in the last three months for an alcohol-related condition. Detailed data relating to participants' socio-demographic characteristics were systematically coded and analysed. Findings: Participants reported many years of heavy drinking, and high levels of mental and physical ill health, unemployment, dependence on state benefits, housing problems and social isolation. Frequency of A&E attendances varied greatly by participant, patterns of drinking and other substance use were diverse, and the nature and extent of self-reported health and social problems were wide-ranging. Conclusions: Findings suggest that people who regularly attend A&E for alcohol-related reasons collectively experience multiple and complex needs, but individually have diverse patterns of drinking and other problems. Flexible person-centred systems could help to support this patient population, whilst avoidance of terminology that overstates group traits should help to minimise stigma.

AB  - How can researchers use race, as they do now, to conduct health-care studies when its very definition is in question? The belief that race is a social construct without "biological authenticity'' though widely shared across disciplines in social science is not subscribed to by traditional science. Yet with an interdisciplinary approach, the two horns of the social construct/genetics dilemma of race are not mutually exclusive. We can use traditional science to provide a rigorous framework and use a social-science approach so that "invisible'' factors are used to adjust the design of studies on an as-needed basis. One approach is to first observe health-care outcomes and then categorize the outcomes, thus removing genetic differences as racial proxies from the design of the study. From the outcomes, we can then determine if there is a pattern of conceivable racial categories. If needed, we can apply dynamic notions of race to acknowledge bias without prejudice. We can use them constructively to improve outcomes and reduce racial disparities. Another approach is nearly identical but considers race not at all: While analyzing outcomes, we can determine if there are biological differences significant enough to identify classifications of humans. That is, we look for genetic patterns in the outcomes and classify only those patterns. There is no attempt to link those patterns to race.

AB  - Many individuals with non-heterosexual orientation or gender non-conformity are afflicted by prejudice, discrimination and isolation. This issue has been discussed in the religious field; however, little research has explored it from a Buddhist perspective. This qualitative inquiry investigates the coping strategies of Buddhist sexual minorities, including American, British, Chinese and Malay LGBTs, to overcome adversity in a heterosexual-dominated context. It uses semi-structured interviews to collect data that are analysed by interpretative phenomenological analysis, with the aid of a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis package. Member-checking is utilised to enhance academic trustworthiness. The participants address the importance of self-acceptance (part of self-compassion) through their narratives, together with support resources, when they attain a better understanding of the nature of suffering, impermanence, karma and mindfulness. It also unveils the importance of support from religious leaders, peers and family. These significantly help them strengthen their resilience and improve mental health, resulting in well-being.

AB  - Migrant women living in Athens often describe themselves as caught in a condition of double marginality: they constitute a vulnerable group within the overall migrant population. Lacunae in immigration policy, undocumented work and spatial and social isolation, coupled with prejudiced views regarding women's ability to undertake collective action, are among the reasons why it may seem impossible that these women could engage in organising activities - and therefore also why these activities remain understudied. Based on a qualitative study of migrant women's associations and networks in Athens, we examine the condition of possibility of associational activity undertaken by migrant women. We argue that work, motherhood, and culture are the three domains of action that account for the formation of networks and associations. Moreover, we present migrant women's associational activity as a process that allows for the negotiation and reworking of a subject position that deploys recognition strategies in the urban setting of Athens.

AB  - The evidence is now overwhelming that discrimination negatively impacts both the physical and mental health of minority groups. Members of multiple-minority groups, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer people of color (LGBTQ-POC), are more likely to be exposed to experiences of stigmatization, discrimination, and fear of rejection. However, whether the stress of having these unfavorable experiences translates into increased risk for negative health outcomes is unanswered by the literature. Research to date attempts to address the relationship of stress as a minority and health outcomes through examining the role of microaggressions, exploring the concepts of risk and resilience, and most notably the creation of the minority stress model. The model analyzes the complex relationship between external (discrimination/prejudice) and internal (self-doubt/rumination) stressors that shape the experience of multiple-minority groups, which helps us understand the lived experiences of LGBTQ-POC. LGBTQ-POC are adversely affected by cumulative discrimination and social exclusion, including racism from the LGBTQ community, and homophobia and heterosexism within their racial/ethnic community. In this way, they are a multiply marginalized group, which has implications not only for their risk of mental illness, but also for their access to mental health care, and the quality of care they receive. Using the minority stress model as a frame of reference, we will discuss current approaches to capturing the toll that stress as an LGBTQ-POC has on mental health consequences.

The aim is to provide a better insight into the deflated level of trustworthiness that members of stigmatized categories are credited with. Identity prejudice determining low levels of credibility for its victims has received substantial philosophical attention in the wake of the epistemic injustice literature. Instead of the standard cognitive concept of trust usually brought in, I apply a moral (or agential) account of trust (drawing on Domenicucci and Holton 2017) to discriminatory issues. We canfail to trust the trustworthy (Jones 2013) in a variety of ways. When it comes to the members of discriminated categories, I argue in the first part, this happens because they are refused a necessary condition of trust: a presumption of agency. This presumption of agency, prima facie attributed to human adults, is precisely what goes wrong for the members of stigmatized groups. Not recognised as individual agents, but as mere quasi-agents, the discriminatees cannot be trusted: their trustworthiness actually becomes unthinkable. The very possibility to give reasons for or against out-group members' trustworthiness is thus dismissed. Articulating documentality and feminist philosophy of language, the second part shows that members of stigmatized categories have their conduct described and recorded through a non-agential grammar. Once widespread and socially dominant, non-agential descriptions of their action give the discriminatees a peculiar moral status that jeopardizes the very possibility of their being recognised as trustworthy.

AB  - Textbooks are not only meant to deliver subject knowledge; they are also a medium to convey universal and community-specific values. Aiming to explore the social and emotional development goals of English for Ethiopia Student Textbook Grade 9, this study reviews the content and activities of the textbook by searching for embedded peace values and prejudices. Textual, contextual and sociological discourse analyses were conducted to characterise, understand and explain the nature of the textbook's discourse. A positive self-concept; good health and compassion (inner peace); tolerance, solidarity and social responsibility (social peace); and respect for life in all its forms and care for the environment (peace with nature) were found to be recurring peace values. However, some content reflected gendered stereotyping, which goes against the peace value of equality.

AB  - Schizophrenia is the most common illness used today as a metaphor in the media and routinely appears associated with crime and violence with no medical or scientific rigor, reinforcing the stigma against this disorder. Evaluation of the presence of structural stigma in the Brazilian media by means of a survey of printed news and the Internet using the term schizophrenia and its correlates under three aspects: (a) medical and scientific uses, (b) assigning a diagnosis of schizophrenia to crime suspects with little or no medical or scientific rigor, and (c) the metaphorical use. The study was conducted in three stages: search for publications, classification of items found and analysis of the context in which they were published. The survey was conducted in two periods: 2008 and 2011, the first being restricted to the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo and the second extended to the homepage of the main Brazilian print media. We found 229 texts, distributed as follows: 89 (39%) records as science and health, with a tendency to impersonality; 62 (27%) records as crime and violence, in which the 'diagnosis' of schizophrenia is given by lay people and 'supported' by an archeology of the life of the suspect which enlists all sorts of nonstandard behavior; and 78 (34%) records of metaphorical use, always with a negative meaning. Most of the texts found (a) does not give voice to people with schizophrenia and their suffering, (b) trivializes the use of this psychiatric illness out of context to describe contradictory or of dubious character political and economic decisions, and (c) reinforces the stigma that lays over the bearer of schizophrenia individualizing them only in rare violent cases with a supposed diagnosis.

AB  - Science museums can be excellent learning environments for engaging citizens in the complex societal issues of our timesuch as climate change, fishery collapse, social prejudice, and wealth inequitiesby fostering experimentation and metacognition about visitors' own social behaviors. The authors studied a low-cost metacognitive toolQuestion Askingin exhibit labels through a within-subjects, quasi-experimental research design with 59 randomly selected adult and teen dyads. Results indicated that the inclusion of an exhibit-specific question increased the proportion of time visitors spent in metacognitive conversations by at least a factor of three. Following that specific question with a more generally applicable real-world question maintained the already elevated proportion of time spent in metacognitive talk but did not boost that proportion further. The authors recommend including an exhibit-specific question at social science exhibits (and potentially adding another, broader real-world question as well) to prompt or enhance users' metacognitive responses to exhibit content.

AB  - Due to recent intensification in international mobility in Europe, its citizens are exposed to a much wider range of lifestyles and competing attitudes towards difference. Individuals are, therefore, increasingly likely to encounter strangers' and are, therefore, required to negotiate discontinuities and contradictions between the values that are transmitted through different sites. In response, the article explores the concept of the stranger' through original data collected in the UK and Poland. The article highlights that the construction of who is a stranger depends on national historical contexts, core values and related visions of the society. The UK and Poland have very different histories and experiences with social diversity, impacting on the ways in which individuals negotiate strange encounters. In both countries, the stranger' is often seen in a negative way and in relation to the minority groups that are perceived to be visibly different, distinct or unknown' in contemporary times. In Poland, this is now largely articulated through sexual prejudice (homophobia), whilst in the UK, attitudes towards the stranger' are largely conveyed through religious prejudice (Islamophobia). As such, the article offers a means of understanding how encounters with difference produce' strangers in different contexts.

AB  - This study is linked to research into narrative persuasion and the techniques used to reduce rejection of stigmatized groups. Upper-secondary school students were assigned to one of two conditions: viewing a film that arouses empathy toward immigrants or seeing a film that underscores positive intergroup contact. One month before viewing the films the participants completed the Modern Racism Scale. After they viewed the films, researchers measured their identification with ingroup and outgroup characters and their attitudes toward immigration. Results showed that viewing the empathyarousing film caused greater identification with the outgroup characters, which in turn induced more positive attitudes toward immigration, but only when previous prejudice was low or moderate. We discuss findings in the context of narrative persuasion research.

AB  - The microaggression concept has recently galvanized public discussion and spread to numerous college campuses and businesses. I argue that the microaggression research program (MRP) rests on five core premises, namely, that microaggressions (1) are operationalized with sufficient clarity and consensus to afford rigorous scientific investigation; (2) are interpreted negatively by most or all minority group members; (3) reflect implicitly prejudicial and implicitly aggressive motives; (4) can be validly assessed using only respondents' subjective reports; and (5) exert an adverse impact on recipients' mental health. A review of the literature reveals negligible support for all five suppositions. More broadly, the MRP has been marked by an absence of connectivity to key domains of psychological science, including psychometrics, social cognition, cognitive-behavioral therapy, behavior genetics, and personality, health, and industrial-organizational psychology. Although the MRP has been fruitful in drawing the field's attention to subtle forms of prejudice, it is far too underdeveloped on the conceptual and methodological fronts to warrant real-world application. I conclude with 18 suggestions for advancing the scientific status of the MRP, recommend abandonment of the term microaggression, and call for a moratorium on microaggression training programs and publicly distributed microaggression lists pending research to address the MRP's scientific limitations.

AB  - The overarching objective of this article is to describe the Swedish public's knowledge about HIV and attitudes toward people living with HIV during the period 1987-2011. Within the framework of this objective, the article also directs a special focus at the association between knowledge about HIV transmission and attitudes toward people who are HIV positive. The study is based on the results of a questionnaire sent to a stratified random sample on eight occasions between 1987 and 2011. The study population comprises the Swedish general public aged 16-44 and is stratified on the basis of the respondents' age, with each of five age groups (16-17, 18-19, 20-24, 25-34, and 35-44) comprising 20% of the study respondents. A total of 21,027 individuals have completed the questionnaire in the eight surveys. The survey instrument is relatively short and comprises 27 questions on knowledge, attitudes and sexual behaviour relating to HIV. The eight surveys show that the public's knowledge about HIV and its different transmission routes is high and has increased over time. Above all there has been an increase in the level of knowledge about how HIV is not transmitted between people. However, the public's knowledge about the infectiousness of individuals receiving treatment for HIV infection is low. Public attitudes toward people with HIV have also undergone a clear shift over time, toward increased tolerance and a decline in the level of fear, especially in social situations. Despite this, a residual suspicion and stigmatisation can be seen in the public's attitudes to people who are HIV positive. This is most obvious from the questions that link HIV to sexuality and here the changes are very modest over time. Public knowledge about HIV and its transmission routes has increased between 1987 and 2011. Attitudes toward people who are HIV positive have generally become more tolerant and positive, not least in relation to different social situations. The fear of becoming infected has declined. At the same time there remains a stigma, which continues to direct suspicion at people who are living with HIV and to ascribe them negative characteristics and behaviors that are based on prejudice. The results show, however, that the public's attitudes toward same-sex relationships are clearly more accepting today than they were previously, and that the symbolic association between HIV and this group is tending to become weaker.

AB  - The political legitimation of nation states traditionally tended to claim homogeneity requirements that often exclude large sections of population. Taking this account of the traditional correspondence between nationality and state as a backdrop, I will attempt to sketch a new conception of peoplehood not based on class, race or religious membership, but on the acceptance of manifold social differences and on the construction of new belonging models. Basically I will suggest the exploration of new avenues of political research about the future of the nation with the following main goals: a) to argue for the persistence of differences among the members of a society at a global scale as a positive feature able to remove deep prejudices and biased views about the others, b) to highlight the prejudices that the neoliberal frame of the EU has supposed in the West Balkans area and c) to criticize the ideological resistance stemming from the idea of a nation state that usually turns down the birth of new nations in history as the result of wrongly solved conflicts. My claim for a politics of peoplehood as a regular source of conflicts and demands, which shouldn't be viewed as a civil failure or breakdown, will be especially inspired by some texts from Seyla Benhabib, Slavoj Zizek and Lea Ypi focusing on the necessary updates that the conditions of membership and political participation ought to include in our current times.

AB  - There is little and unsystematic evidence about whether the content of stereotypes can vary within a culture. Using the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) as a theoretical framework, in two studies we examined the content of stereotypes in an Eastern European culture, namely Romania. Data were collected from four regions prototypical in terms of economic and social development in Romania, and we examined whether the content of stereotypes varies across these regions. As expected, the findings confirm the applicability of the SCM in Romania to reveal culture-specific stereotypes and provide initial support for within-culture variation in the content of stereotypes. We discuss, in particular, possible reasons for two main findings: a strong one-dimensional structure of stereotypes, and regional differences in stereotype content.

AB  - Community engagement of migrants has been identified as an important element in developing both individual well-being and cohesive multicultural receiving communities. Through 10 in-depth interviews, this study explores the profile of Moroccan migrant leaders in community organizations in the receiving context (south of Spain) and the reasons for which they engage. Moreover, it analyzes the relationship established between community engagement and their well-being. The results show that migrants commit for both intrinsic (e.g., support their compatriots) and extrinsic (e.g., increase their social connection) reasons. Their social action has a positive influence on their well-being because it activates the following paths: (1) improvement of bicultural competences; (2) development of social relationships with receiving members; (3) strengthening of social bonds with compatriots; (4) increase of abilities in dealing with unjust social conditions in the new environment; and (5) decrease of prejudice towards their own cultural group.

AB  - The study aimed to know how the professionals working with the assistance of women in violent situation in an intersectorial network perceive the assistance. Thirty interviews were carried out with professionals of the health sector, social work, public security and legal system located in a mid-sized city of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Using thematic analysis the results were classified in five categories: How women who suffer violence are perceived? Prejudices of the professionals. How the professionals perceive the assistance they provide? Emotions and feelings of the professional during the assistance. Barriers and progress related to the assistance. There are fragmented and stereotyped perceptions and the need to improve the existing structures, to prepare and to care of the professionals in order to humanize the assistance. To create special services and to invest in prevention is fundamental since there is a huge distance between the public policy proposals and the reality.

AB  - This article examines a selection of understudied nineteenth-century Haitian texts to illuminate how Haitians tensely narrated their country's foundational event and negotiated the challenge of constructing the first black nation-state in the Americas. The predominantly mixed-race male authors held their own biases and prejudices that were often informed by the same racialized labels they sought to overturn. Writing Haiti's history, specifically that of the revolution, exposed these biases as well as critical social divisions, most notably between an emergent Eurocentric elite and the majority of recently freed, uneducated former slaves who spoke no French. Despite appeals to unity and Haitians' Africanity, early narratives of the revolution disavowed or treated with ambivalence the role of former slaves and African-derived spiritual traditions in Haiti's founding. I trace this ambivalence towards or disavowal of the black majority through a corpus of understudied texts that represent specific interventions in Haiti's emerging national historiography. In particular, I focus on how five authors, Juste Chanlatte, Baron de Vastey, Herard Dumesle, Thomas Madiou, and Beaubrun Ardouin, narrate the Haitian Revolution and grapple with the role or contributions of slaves/former slaves in the revolution and the influence of African-derived spiritual traditions. Their histories initiated a process of incorporating the black majority and African traditions into the official national imaginary, though on elite terms. For these authors, the predominantly black majority, while contributors to the country's founding, needed civilizing in order for Haiti to prosper and progress as a nation in the post- Enlightenment Atlantic World.

AB  - Community opposition to locally unwanted development is not inherently problematic, but it can be destructive where conflict between proponents and objectors escalates. This paper relates mixed-methods findings from a Sydney case-study where opposition to planned affordable housing projects was widespread but uneven. Five factors are identified that escalated individual opposition campaigns in this case: public notification procedures; sense of injustice; prejudice; strong campaign leadership; and the involvement of politicians. We argue that these factors will likely also escalate opposition to the planned development of other forms of critical social infrastructure, and that an understanding of them can help minimise destructive conflicts between proponents and host communities.

AB  - Most analyses of sexual orientation and earnings find that gay men face a wage gap, whereas lesbian women earn higher wages than similar heterosexual women. However, analyses rarely consider bisexual men and women as a unique group separate from other sexual minorities. I argue that such binary views of sexual orientationtreating sexual minorities as a homogenous non-heterosexual grouphave obscured understandings of the impact of sexual orientation on labor market outcomes. Specifically, I predict that unequal outcomes for gay men and lesbian women are partly due to the influence of family arrangements and their effects on earnings. In contrast, I argue that bisexual men and women should be the most disadvantaged in the labor market, due to particularly disadvantaging stereotypes, perceptions of choice to their sexual orientation, and prejudicial treatment. Using data from the General Social Survey (N = 13,554) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 14,714), I show that family arrangements explain some of the observed earnings differentials for gay men and lesbian women. Bisexual men and women, in contrast, face wage penalties that are not explained by human capital differences or occupational characteristics. Perceptions of prejudicial treatment partially explain the observed wage gaps.

AB  - Past research documents the extent that discrimination experiences and observations can undermine people's health and performance. In addition to discrimination's direct consequence for targets, discrimination implicates the morality of the larger community where it occurs. Perceptions of community morality could predict community identification that, in turn, could predict health and performance. To test this serial mediation hypothesis, 615 second- and third-year university undergraduates reported the frequency of discrimination observations and experiences. Students' perceptions of the university community's morality mediated the relationship between discrimination and the extent that they identified with the university. In turn, university identification mediated the relationship between university morality and students' academic engagement and mental health. However, only university morality reliably mediated the relationship between discrimination and physical health. Discrimination can affect the health and engagement of all community members, even observers who are not part of the targeted group.

AB  - Aims and objectives. This study was conducted to determine the attitudes of undergraduate nursing students towards lesbian women and gay men.
   Background. Nursing education in Turkey is conducted holistically; in other words, it is an integration of the physical, spiritual, mental and social realms. Students are therefore expected to not express any discrimination due to factors such as religion, language, race and gender. However, some serious problems still exist in terms of the practical applications of that philosophy.
   Design. This study was descriptive.
   Methods. This study included 964 students. The Attitudes towards Lesbian Women and Gay Men scale and a questionnaire were used to learn about the attitudes of undergraduate nursing students regarding gay men and lesbian women.
   Results. Results of this study have indicated that the attitudes of religiously educated and/or conservative students towards lesbian women and gay men were negative. Female students from families with high incomes and highly educated families attended social activities and read more than other female students. The students with free life choice options expressed very positive attitudes towards gay men.
   Conclusion. The nursing education curriculum should cover information about patients with diverse sexual orientations and their absolute rights for equally optimal healthcare. Strategies to discourage traditional gender role stereotypes and educational and media experiences for better acceptance of sexual minorities need to be developed by educational policy makers. Antidiscrimination policies protecting lesbian women and gay men should be developed by the legislative authorities and then taught to students during their nursing education. Getting familiar with diverse sexual orientations might create awareness among nursing students and reduce their attitudinal and behavioural prejudices and biases.
   Relevance to clinical practice. To provide equal healthcare services for all patients, nurses must have accurate information about lesbian women, gay men and modify their attitude and behaviour accordingly.

AB  - Purpose: People with epilepsy (PWE) are negatively prejudiced in their ability to work. This study aimed to examine demographic, clinical and psychological factors associated with employability in PWE.
   Methods: This study recruited epilepsy patients from a neurology clinic in Malaysia. Employability was measured using employment ratio, with a ratio >= 90% (ER90) classified as high employability. Basic demographic data such as age, gender, marital status, religion, education level and household income was collected. Clinical measures consisted of age of seizure onset, seizure frequency, type of epilepsy, aura, polytherapy, nocturnal seizures and seizure control. Psychological measures included Work Self Determination Index (WSDI), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS).
   Results: Of 146 PWE, 64.4% had high employability. The participants were predominantly female (52%), Chinese (50.7%), single (50%), having tertiary education (55.5%) and focal epilepsy (72.6%). Clinically, only type of epilepsy was significantly correlated to employability of PWE. Employability of PWE was associated with ability to work (indicated by education level, work performance affected by seizures, ability to travel independently and ability to cope with stress at work) and family overprotection. The high employability group was found to have lower self-perceived stigma (ESS), higher self-determined motivation (WSDI), self-esteem (SES) and perceived social support (MSPSS), than the low employability group. Logistic regression analysis showed that tertiary education level (AOR 3.42, CI: 1.46-8.00), higher self-determination (WSDI, AOR 1.09, CI: 1.012-1.17), lower family overprotection (AOR 0.76, CI: 0.61-0.95), and generalised epilepsy (AOR 4.17, CI: 1.37-12.70) were significant predictors for higher employability in PWE.
   Conclusion: Ability to work (education level), clinical factor (type of epilepsy) and psychological factor (self-determined motivation and family overprotection) were important factors affecting employability in PWE. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Creating a socially conscious educational environment is an imperative if health care practitioners are to have a significant impact on health inequities. The effects of practitioner bias, prejudice, and discrimination on health and health outcomes have been well documented in the literature. Individuals being trained to provide health care will be entering into an increasingly diverse world and must be equipped with the appropriate knowledge and skills in order to meet the needs of those seeking their care. Cultural competency training in medical education has evolved over the past 15 years since the Institute of Medicine's 2002 report, Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care. As research on the effectiveness of this training has emerged, several authors have called for the integration of antiracism training into the cultural competency curriculum, but few have found effective ways of doing so. This article describes the approach of one midwifery program in order to inform clinical education programs across the spectrum of health care practitioners.

AB  - This article discusses the digital inequalities experienced by prisoners and the potential opportunities that providing new' media in prisons offer for offender rehabilitation and resettlement. Currently denied access to online and social media that most of us take for granted, and unable to communicate in ways that have become ordinary' in the wider community, it is argued that prisoners experience profound social isolation and constitute one of the most impoverished groups in the digital age. In prisons which provide selected prisoners some access to information and communication technologies, their high socio-cultural status and consequent construction as a privilege' frequently results in them being used in the exercise of soft' power by prison officer gatekeepers. Moreover, when prisoners come to the end of their sentences, they not only are faced with prejudice and poor job prospects due to their criminal record, but their digital exclusion during a period of incarceration may have compound effects and lead to long-term and deep social exclusion.

AB  - Building on an integration of research findings on proactive intergroup behavior from multiple fields of inquiry (biology, paleoanthropology, social psychology) as well as research on the HEXACO personality framework, a prospective study among adolescents investigated the relations between personality traits and xenophile and xenophobic orientations (Total N = 455, 219 males, M-age = 17.66 years). Path models corroborate that xenophile orientations and xenophobic orientations were predicted by two distinct subsets of major personality traits: High scores in endeavor-related traits (i.e., Openness to Experience, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness) predicted greater xenophile orientations, whereas low scores in altruism/cooperation-related traits (i.e., Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, and Emotionality) predicted greater xenophobic orientations. Conclusions on the effects of personality traits were complemented by a distinct pattern of gender effects suggesting higher levels of xenophobic orientations among male adolescents and higher levels of xenophile orientations among females. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This research experimentally examined the effectiveness of the use of virtual racial embodiment in a digital gaming application for reducing bias against a non-dominant group. The findings of this study advance theory and have practical implications for the design of immersive diversity initiatives. We tested avatar creation and the gaming app as a new modality for stimulating perspective-taking. In addition, we explored how sex and race intersect in virtual embodiment and stereotyping. Results showed that creating and embodying a Black avatar produced more favorable beliefs about African American men, but not African American women, and greater support for pro-minority policies in comparison to creating and playing a White avatar. Avatar liking was a significant moderator, but self-presence had no effect.

AB  - Miranda Fricker maintains that testimonial responsibility is the proper corrective to testimonial injustice. She proposes a perceptual-like "testimonial sensibility" to explain the transmission of knowledge through testimony. This sensibility is the means by which a hearer perceives an interlocutor's credibility level. When prejudice causes a hearer to inappropriately deflate the credibility attributed to a speaker, the sensibility may have functioned unreliably. Testimonial responsibility, she claims, will make the capacity reliable by reinflating credibility levels to their proper degree. I argue that testimonial sensitivity may be or involve "mindreading," the cognitive capacity by which we predict human behavior and explain it in terms of mental states. Further, I claim that, if testimonial sensibility is or involves mindreading, and mindreading is a function of brain processes (as claimed by cognitive neuroscientists), testimonial injustice cannot be corrected by testimonial responsibility. This is because 1) it appears to rely on conscious awareness of prejudice, whereas much bias occurs implicitly, and 2) it works at the individual level, whereas testimonial injustice occurs both individually and socially. I argue that the remedy for testimonial injustice is, instead, engaging in social efforts that work below the level of consciousness.

AB  - The care of patients with trisomy 13 and 18 is a source of significant controversy. While these conditions are life limiting, indisputable data refutes the notion that these conditions are lethal or incompatible with life. Despite such evidence, arguments of beneficence, quality of life and limited resources are invoked to make the case to limit care to trisomy children. Lessons learned in our ignominious history with Down syndrome should guide us as we explore care for patients with trisomy 13 and 18. As clinicians we should strive with equipoise to carefully examine available data, the current status of practices related to care from palliation to intensive interventions, rise above our personal prejudices and listen to the voices of families imploring us to consider their opinions regarding the value of the life of a child with trisomy 13 or 18. We should recall and learn from our Down syndrome odyssey and select the road previously not taken as we chart a course to the best possible care for our trisomy 13 and 18 sisters and brothers.

AB  - Background: Research on infrahumanization shows there is a strong tendency to deprive outgroups of the ability to experience secondary emotions when compared to ingroups. However, it is not known whether this tendency is also applied to social groups towards which ambivalent attitudes are held, such as individuals with Down syndrome. Methods: In the first study, participants were asked to attribute primary and secondary emotions to members of the ingroup (students) and outgroup (individuals with Down syndrome). The second study explored the effect of the physical features of Down syndrome on the differential association of emotions. A lexical decision task preceded by photographs of three face types (adults with Down syndrome, adults with ambiguous faces and adults without Down syndrome) was used for that purpose. Results: The results showed a higher attribution of secondary emotions to members of the ingroup than to members of the outgroup. Also revealed that participants associated secondary emotions with the faces of adults without Down syndrome and with ambiguous faces far more quickly than with faces of individuals with Down syndrome. Conclusions: These results confirm the existence of infrahumanization bias and the effect of visibility of the stigma in this subtle type of prejudice.

AB  - Biobanks will be essential to facilitate the translation of genomic research into real improvements to healthcare. Biobanking is a long-term commitment, requiring public support as well as appropriate regulatory, social and ethical guidelines to realize this promise. There is a growing body of research that explores the necessary conditions to ensure public trust in biomedical research, particularly in the context of biobanking. Trust is, however, a complex relationship. More analysis of public perceptions, attitudes and reactions is required to understand the primary triggers that influence gain and loss of trust. Further, the outcomes of these analyses require detailed consideration to determine how to promote trustworthy institutions and practices.
   This article uses national survey data, combined with the results of a community consultation that took place in Tasmania, Australia in 2013, to analyze the specific issue of public reactions to commercialization of biobanks and their outputs. This research will enhance the ability of biobanks to respond preemptively to public concerns about commercialization by establishing and maintaining governance frameworks that are responsive to those concerns. The results reveal that it is possible to counter the 'natural prejudice' that many people have against commercialization through independent governance of biobank resources and transparency with regard to commercial involvement. Indeed, most participants agreed that they would rather have a biobank with commercial involvement than none at all. This analysis provides nuanced conclusions about public reactions towards commercialization and equips researchers and biobank operators with data on which to base policies and make governance decisions in order to tackle participant concerns respectfully and responsively.

AB  - Aims and objectivesThis paper examines the qualitative results of two studies of Black African new settler communities in New Zealand. The analysis investigates the issues of stigma and microaggressions and their effects on Black African communities.
   BackgroundPrevious work that investigated experiences of stigma faced by relatively early Black African new settlers to New Zealand found that new settlers experienced stigma, and their resulting isolation had negative implications for access to health and social services, regardless of HIV status.
   DesignThis paper is a meta-analysis of two published studies, using original qualitative data from each.
   MethodsResearchers for the first study, Standing in the Fire, interviewed 13 Black Africans living with HIV who were new settlers to New Zealand. The second study, AfricaNZ Care, was a national mixed method study which surveyed 703 Black African new settlers, and included 131 participants in 23 different focus groups. The present analysis includes only the qualitative data from the second study. Some, but not most, participants of the second study were living with HIV.
   ResultsBlack African identity is used as a proxy for HIV status among non-HIV specialist health care workers. Participants reported experiences of stigma and microaggressions based on their race, and a lack of knowledge about HIV in non-HIV specialist nurses and other health care workers. They also experienced poor health care and education practices, professional prejudice against colleagues living with HIV and institutional challenges including failure to protect patient confidentiality.
   ConclusionsHIV-related stigma and microaggressions remain significant problems, not only for people living with HIV but also for those perceived to be at high risk for HIV.
   Relevance to clinical practiceExperiences of stigmatising behaviour by health care professionals have a broad and significant range of impacts on patients' health outcomes.

AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

AB  - We explore the effect of economic hardship on the identification with a disadvantaged ethnic minority using longitudinal data on 10,000 adolescents in Hungary. Fixed-effects and first-differenced panel models show that adolescents having Roma descent are more likely to identify as Roma when their families experience economic hardship, an effect strongest among adolescents with mixed-ethnicity parents. Adolescents who identify as Roma are substantially less prejudiced against the Roma and less supportive of exclusionary policies than those with Roma descent but not identifying as Roma. These findings support self-perception-based theories of ethnic identification and imply that changes in ethnic identity can reinforce stereotypes.

AB  - The human body plays a central role in nonverbal communication, conveying attitudes, personality, and values during social interactions. Three experiments in a large, open classroom setting investigated whether the visibility of torso-located cues affects nonverbal communication of similarity. In Experiments 1 and 2, half the participants wore a black plastic bag over their torso. Participants interacted with an unacquainted same-sex individual selected from a large class who was also wearing (or also not wearing) a bag. Experiment 3 added a clear bag condition, in which visual torso cues were not obscured. Across experiments, black bag-wearing participants selected partners who were less similar to them on attitudes, behaviors, and personality compared to the bag-less-and clear bag-participants. Nonverbal cues in the torso communicate information about similarity of attitudes, behavior, and personality; the center of the body plays a surprisingly central role in early-stage person perception and attraction.

AB  - The actions of advantaged group activists (sometimes called allies) are admirable, and they likely make meaningful contributions to the movements they support. However, a nuanced understanding of the role of advantaged group allies must also consider the potential challenges of their participation.Both in their everyday lives and during their activist work, advantaged group allies are especially likely to have direct contact with disadvantaged group members. This article considers when such contact may harm rather than help resistance movements by disadvantaged groups.We also suggest that to avoid these undermining effects, advantaged group allies must effectively communicate support for social change, understand the implications of theirown privilege, offer autonomy-oriented support, and resist the urge to increase their own feelings of inclusion by co-opting relevant marginalized social identities.

AB  - Increasing scholarly attention is being paid to urban encounters with 'difference'. Much of this work to-date has focused on incidental encounters in various spatial settings from the market to the cafe. Here, a number of commentators have observed that fleeting, unintended encounters, where diverse people rub along together as a consequence of accidental proximity, do not necessarily produce 'meaningful contact'. That is contact which breaks down prejudices and translates beyond the moment to produce a more general respect for others. This paper contributes to these debates by focusing instead on purposeful organised activities ('The Project') to bring two different groups together intentionally who would not normally have the opportunity for sustained engagement through a case study of an interfaith (Muslim and Jewish) youth cricket project in a large UK city. Here, we use the concept of the 'contact zone' to evaluate the effectiveness of this project. The findings highlight three critical processes which contribute to generating meaningful contact. First, it is important to establish space where participants from different groups can safely explore their differences together. Second, it is necessary to create space to establish shared interests: here through the game of cricket. Both are factors which require significant resourcing, in particular to enable a professional facilitator to manage what can be, or become, conflictual encounters and the expression of potentially negative emotions. Third, banal sociality also matters. It was time spent 'hanging out' alongside, instead of in, the purposeful activities when the participants identified their own natural affinities and found particular shared identity positions which contributed to destabilising the significance of differences beyond those The Project sought to address. These findings have clear relevance for future policy initiatives to develop interfaith relations.

AB  - While the stigma surrounding mental illness has been well-established, less is known about methods for reducing that bias. In both laboratory (Study 1) and community (Study 2) samples, we tested the efficacy of imagined contact and perspective-taking for reducing stigma against depression. Participants first read a vignette about an individual with depression and then imagined either interacting with the individual (imagined contact), putting themselves in the individual's shoes (perspective-taking) or a neutral scene (control). In both samples, imagined contact was more effective in reducing stigma against depression than perspective-taking. The findings suggest that different prejudice reduction strategies should be used for different stigmatized groups.

AB  - Background: Racism and associated discrimination are pervasive and persistent challenges with multiple cumulative deleterious effects contributing to inequities in various health outcomes. Globally, research over the past decade has shown consistent associations between racism and negative health concerns. Such research confirms that race endures as one of the strongest predictors of poor health. Due to the lack of validated Australian measures of racist attitudes, RACES (Racism, Acceptance, and Cultural-Ethnocentrism Scale) was developed.
   Methods: Here, we examine RACES' psychometric properties, including the latent structure, utilising Item Response Theory (IRT). Unidimensional and Multidimensional Rating Scale Model (RSM) Rasch analyses were utilised with 296 Victorian primary school students and 182 adolescents and 220 adults from the Australian community.
   Results: RACES was demonstrated to be a robust 24-item three-dimensional scale of Accepting Attitudes (12 items), Racist Attitudes (8 items), and Ethnocentric Attitudes (4 items). RSM Rasch analyses provide strong support for the instrument as a robust measure of racist attitudes in the Australian context, and for the overall factorial and construct validity of RACES across primary school children, adolescents, and adults.
   Conclusions: RACES provides a reliable and valid measure that can be utilised across the lifespan to evaluate attitudes towards all racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious groups. A core function of RACES is to assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce community levels of racism and in turn inequities in health outcomes within Australia.

KW  - ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - Indigenous peoples around the world endure health and social disparities. In the United States, such disparities are typically ameliorated through conventional care services and organizations. Purpose: To examine points of tension that characterize culturally pluralistic care services in the United States, specifically Alaska, within context of Indigenous colonial histories. Design and Methods: The research design is ethnographic and multisited, comprising 12 months of fieldwork across urban, rural and remote village sites in Alaska. A conceptual lens that accounts for culturally diverse social spaces where relations of power are at stake frames research presented here. This work incorporates relational and participatory action research principles with Alaska Native Elders. Ethnographic evidence was collected through multiple methods, including field notes, documents, and interviews, with ethnographic analysis involving atlas.ti. Findings: Alaska Native Elders describe salient points of tension characterizing Alaska's conventional care services through the following insights: generational curses-a pain, prejudice on both sides-wounded, and value-systems clash-fighting. Conclusion: This article concludes with discussion about collective anxieties and implications for care services.

AB  - This article explores the social representations of youngsters from favelas in Rio de Janeiro on police practices in the context of the implementation of Pacifying Police Units'. Drawing from fieldwork, participant observation and interviews, the authors analyse the narratives and practices which influence relations between young people and the police in the Complexo do AlemAo area of the city. The interviewees expressed a demand for further public security and social services. Young people noted some progress in police practices, although these changes appear to be unstable. The permanence of violent practices and prejudice by the police was verified in youngsters' narratives. Any change in this scenario should be based on the replacement of the war logic of pacification' for another logic, that of participation.

AB  - The construct of the "Rescue Personality" as claimed by Mitchell (1983) in the course of Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) was investigated in a sample of 235 German soldiers. As hypothesized, soldiers scored lower on neuroticism, openness and agreeableness but higher on extraversion, conscientiousness, risk and competition seeking as well as resilience compared to a norm sample. Cluster analyses revealed two distinct personality subtypes within the military sample that differed significantly regarding gender ratio and resilience. Male soldiers scored lower on neuroticism and agreeableness but higher on risk and competition seeking and resilience than female soldiers. Military students and military medical personnel differed only in openness. Duration of military service was not associated with personality except for extraversion. The results indicate considerable personality differences between soldiers and the norm population that are largely consistent with the "Rescue Personality" concept. Implications of these personality differences and the existence of the two military personality subtypes for prevention, intervention and personnel selection are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The authors introduce the concept of vigilance, capturing behaviors that reflect attempts to navigate racialized social spaces on a daily basis. Specifically, vigilant behaviors include care about appearance and language to be treated with respect, avoidance of social spaces, and psychological preparation for potential prejudice and discrimination. Furthermore, these behaviors align with those discussed in Black respectability politics debates. Using data from a population-representative sample of Black adults in Chicago, they report that vigilance is associated with poor physical and mental health indexed through chronic health conditions, depressive symptoms, and self-rated health.

AB  - Resilience is typically conceptualized as successful adaptation to serious negative life events. Even relatively mundane stressors, however, require coping. Therefore, we argue that resilience should reflect managing well with stressors in general. To support the argument that resilience is relevant for social psychology and that social psychology can inform our understanding of resilience, we first discuss a program of research that links prior life adversity exposure to resilience to everyday stressors. We next review a psychophysiological approach-the biopsychosocial model of challenge/threat-to assessing resilience as it occurs and tie this approach to research on coping resources. Finally, we highlight two central research areas within social psychology-romantic relationships and stigma and prejudice-for which resilience is highly relevant. This demonstrates the merits of applying the concept of resilience to a range of stressors and the potential for experimental social psychology to inform understudied aspects of resilience.

AB  - This article constitutes a narrative of the life events of Antonio, a man belonging to the Roma community. His life story combines passages of exclusion, in which Antonio was the target of cultural bias that even led him to be imprisoned, with transformative experiences that were greatly influenced by his participation in a Dialogic Literary Gathering. Through the shared reading of Federico Garcia Lorca's Gypsy Ballads, he strengthened his identity as a man who is deeply proud of belonging to the Roma community and became an agent of social transformation. The interactions and meaning created in the Dialogic Literary Gathering allowed him to rewrite his story, tearing down the walls of prejudice that Lorca masterfully denounced in his works.

AB  - Abortion is a relatively frequent experience, yet public discourse about abortion is contentious and stigmatizing. Little literature is available on private conversations about abortion, which may be distinct from public discourse. We explored private discourse by documenting the nature of women's discussions about abortion with peers in a book club. We recruited thirteen women's book clubs in nine states. Participants (n = 119) read the book Choice: True Stories of Birth, Contraception, Infertility, Adoption, Single Parenthood, & Abortion, and participated in a book club meeting, which we audio-recorded and transcribed. Data collection occurred between April 2012 and April 2013. In contrast to public discourse of abortion, private discourse was nuanced and included disclosures of multiple kinds of experiences with abortion. Participants disclosed having abortions, considering abortion as an option for past or future pregnancies, and supporting others through an abortion. Distinguishing between public and private discourse enabled us to identify that an abortion experience could include personal decisions, hypothetical decisions, or connection with someone having an abortion. The book club atmosphere provided a rare opportunity for participants to explore their relationship to abortion. More research is needed to understand the role of private discourse in reducing abortion stigma.

AB  - The contact hypothesis suggests that the interaction between members of different groups decreases prejudice. Moderators and mediators shaping this link have been investigated. However, research about the factors that facilitate contact is not frequent. This article examines secure attachment as an antecedent of contact. Three studies provide information about various aspects of the relationship between secure attachment and contact: security is positively associated with (a) intergroup contact, which in turn is related to reduced prejudice (Study 1); (b) implicit approach tendencies toward the outgroup (Study 2); and, once again, (c) with contact through the indirect effect of openness to exploration (Study 3). In the discussion, we recommend priming both secure and insecure schemas to investigate their unique effects on intergroup contact.

AB  - Even though human racial difference has been a longstanding topic of the school biology curriculum, there is little evidence that contemporary biology textbooks challenge stereotypical racial beliefs that are based in biological thinking. Rather, the modern biology curriculum may be a place where such beliefs about race are perpetuated unwittingly. Drawing upon a theoretical framework of racial conceptualization based in psychological essentialism, this paper argues that biology textbook curricula ought to directly challenge problematic and unscientific racial beliefs to increase understanding of human genetic variation and decrease racial beliefs associated with prejudice.

AB  - Objective: Physician knowledge of the complex contributors to obesity varies. We do not know whether today's medical students are graduating with deep understanding of the causes of obesity. Our objective was to assess beliefs about causes of obesity in a national sample of 4th year medical students.
   Method: We randomly selected 2000 4th year students from a random sample of 50 U.S. medical schools and asked them to rate the importance of several factors as causes of obesity. Of those invited, 1244 (62%) responded. We conducted latent class analysis to identify groups with similar response patterns.
   Results: Most students demonstrated knowledge that obesity has multiple contributors. Students fell into 1 of 4 classes: (1) more likely to endorse all contributors (28%), (2) more likely to endorse physiological contributors (27%), (3) more likely to endorse behavioral or social contributors (24%), and (4) unlikely to endorse contributors outside of overeating and physical activity (22%).
   Conclusion: Though students were generally aware of multiple causes, there were 4 distinct patterns of beliefs, with implications for patient care.
   Practice implications: Targeted interventions may help to improve depth of knowledge about the causes of obesity and lead to more effective care for obese patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose that the propensity to think creatively tends to be associated with independence and self-directionqualities generally ascribed to menso that men are often perceived to be more creative than women. In two experiments, we found that outside the box creativity is more strongly associated with stereotypically masculine characteristics (e.g., daring and self-reliance) than with stereotypically feminine characteristics (e.g., cooperativeness and supportiveness; Study 1) and that a man is ascribed more creativity than a woman when they produce identical output (Study 2). Analyzing archival data, we found that men's ideas are evaluated as more ingenious than women's ideas (Study 3) and that female executives are stereotyped as less innovative than their male counterparts when evaluated by their supervisors (Study 4). Finally, we observed that stereotypically masculine behavior enhances a man's perceived creativity, whereas identical behavior does not enhance a woman's perceived creativity (Study 5). This boost in men's perceived creativity is mediated by attributions of agency, not competence, and predicts perceptions of reward deservingness.

AB  - Background: The Philippines has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and recently passed domestic legislation protecting the sexual and reproductive rights of people with disability. However women in the Philippines continue to report barriers to sexual and reproductive health services, and there is limited empirical evidence available to inform policy makers' efforts to respond. This study aims to contribute to the available evidence by examining service providers' perceptions of disability and their experiences providing sexual and reproductive health services to women with disability.
   Methods: The study was conducted as part of a larger three-year program of participatory action research that aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health of women with disabilities in the Philippines. Fourteen in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted with a total of thirty-two sexual and reproductive health service providers in Quezon City and Ligao. Qualitative data were analysed to identify key themes in participants' discussion of service provision to women with disability.
   Results: Analysis of service providers' accounts suggests a range of factors undermine provision of high quality sexual and reproductive health services to women with disability. Service providers often have limited awareness of the sexual and reproductive health needs of women with disability and inadequate understanding of their rights. Service providers have had very little training in relation to disability, and limited access to the resources that would enable them to provide a disability inclusive service. Some service providers hold prejudiced attitudes towards women with disability seeking sexual and reproductive health services, resulting in disability-based discrimination. Service providers are also often unaware of specific factors undermining the health of women with disability, such as violence and abuse.
   Conclusion: Recent legislative change in the Philippines opens a window of opportunity to strengthen sexual and reproductive health service provision across the country. However the development of services that are disability-inclusive will require substantial efforts to address supply-side barriers such as prejudiced service provider attitudes and limited capacity. Disability inclusion must be prioritised for the national goal of responsible parenthood and reproductive health to be realised for all.

AB  - This article presents an exploratory, qualitative study of 12 Muslim women living in the Triangle area of North Carolina, who were interviewed regarding their voluntary practice of hijab (Muslim tradition of veiling), exercise of choice in hijab, their relationship to feminist belief and identity, female empowerment, and body image. Through examining the influence of political movements in concert with market capitalism, this article examines how the hijab and those who voluntarily practice this Muslim tradition challenge or contradict mainstream images of what is marketed in the West as feminist. Moreover, this article seeks to examine how, if at all, the hijab empowers those women who practice it, whether it offers an avenue of female empowerment and liberation not traditionally included in prevailing feminist thought, and how this may contribute to third-wave feminist theory. This article informs social work practitioners of the strength of Muslim women, the exercise of choice in hijab, and contributions to feminist thought as participants respond to assumptions of oppression, patriarchal control, and prejudice in a post-9/11 society.

AB  - The mesolimbic reward pathway is activated by drugs of abuse and palatable food, causing a sense of pleasure, which promotes further consumption of these substances. Children whose parents smoke are more vulnerable to present addictive-like behavior to drugs and food. We evaluated the association between maternal nicotine exposure during lactation with changes in feeding, behavior and in the dopaminergic reward system. On postnatal day (PN) 2, Wistar rat dams were implanted with minipumps releasing nicotine (N; 6 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or saline (C) for 14 days. On PN150 and PN160, offspring were divided into 4 groups for a food challenge: N and C that received standard chow (SC); and N and C that could freely self-select (SSD) between high-fat and high-sugar diets (HFD and HSD, respectively). Offspring were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) arena on PN152-153. On PN170, offspring were euthanized for central dopaminergic analysis. SSD animals showed an increased food intake compared to SC ones and a preference for HFD. However, N-SSD animals consumed relatively more HSD than C-SSD ones. Regarding behavior, N animals showed an increase in the time spent in the EPM center and a reduction in relative activity in the OF center. N offspring presented lower dopamine receptor (D2R) and transporter (DAT) contents in the nucleus accumbens, and lower D2R in the arcuate nucleus. Postnatal exposure to nicotine increases preference for sugar and anxiety levels in the adult progeny possibly due to a decrease in dopaminergic action in the nucleus accumbens and arcuate nucleus.

AB  - The Kal Oddars are a Denotified Criminal Tribe living in southern Tamil Nadu, India. With a history of nomadism, this community was categorised by the British as hereditary criminals. Though denotified today, the community still faces social exclusion, marginalisation and continued stereotyping by law enforcement agencies and society at large. This article describes the feminisation of stigma taking place within the community and its consequences. The continued stigma and the prejudices of society and the police have a profound impact on the position of the Kal Oddar women, who bear the brunt of all oppression.

AB  - In this paper we examine conditions that underlie vulnerability and resilience possibilities for households and communities that face and respond to climate- and other changes, in nine East and West African countries. We base our analysis on a unique integrated qualitative and quantitative dataset composed of household surveys and village focus group studies carried out across a wide range of environments and agricultural systems. We identify human population growth, commercialization of the economy, and natural resource use policies, in addition to weather, as key drivers of change. We compare the agricultural and livelihood systems of male and female respondents, as well as their productive resources, organization and access to services. Women have less access than men to common property resources, as well as to cash to obtain goods or services. Women control less land than men, the land they control is often of poorer quality, and their tenure is insecure. Women engage in mutual insurance and risk-sharing networks, and benefit from non-agricultural services provided by social support institutions external to the village. Formally registered, public and private external organizations that foster agriculture and livestock production have tremendous anti-women biases, and tend to provide support primarily to men. Policies and strategies are needed to eliminate those prejudices so that men and women increase their resilience and manage well their changing environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Following the social identity perspective and using data from two national surveys, the present research examines among the native Dutch their recognition of discrimination against immigrants (Study 1) and their intention to protest against this (Study 2). It was found that stronger endorsement of a common national identity was associated with higher recognition and stronger protest intention. However, higher perceived power threat was associated with lower common identity endorsement and thereby to lower recognition of discrimination and reduced willingness to protest. At the same time, a less in-group centric perspective (deprovincialization) was associated with higher recognition of discrimination and willingness to protest because of a stronger endorsement of common identity. The similar results in the two studies support the generality of the proposed processes and add to the limited research on when and why majority members recognize and act against group-based injustices.

AB  - Humans show stronger empathy for in-group compared with out-group members' suffering and help in-group members more than out-group members. Moreover, the in-group bias in empathy and parochial altruism tend to be more salient in collectivistic than individualistic cultures. This work tested the hypothesis that modifying self-construals, which differentiate between collectivistic and individualistic cultural orientations, affects in-group bias in empathy for perceived own-race vs other-race pain. By scanning adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found stronger neural activities in the mid-cingulate, left insula and supplementary motor area (SMA) in response to racial in-group compared with out-group members' pain after participants had been primed with interdependent self-construals. However, the racial in-group bias in neural responses to others' pain in the left SMA, mid-cingulate cortex and insula was significantly reduced by priming independent self-construals. Our findings suggest that shifting an individual's self-construal leads to changes of his/her racial in-group bias in neural responses to others' suffering.

AB  - Communicators often tune their message about a target to the audience's attitude toward that target. This tuning can shape a communicator's own evaluation of the target, which reflects the creation of a shared reality with the audience. So far, evidence for shared-reality creation has been confined to one specific target. In two experiments, we examined whether and when a shared reality would generalize to other targets. In Experiment 1, shared-reality creation about an ambiguous sexist target generalized to the evaluation of a new ambiguous sexist target for which no audience attitude was provided. However, this happened only when there was high (vs. low) commonality with the audience regarding previous judgments. In Experiment 2, we investigated conditions for the temporal persistence of generalization. One week after message tuning to a high-commonality audience, a shared reality generalized to a new ambiguous sexist target when participants recalled the shared-reality creation about the initial target, but it did not generalize in conditions without such recall. Also, no generalization occurred for non-ambiguous or non-sexist targets. Results suggest that shared reality generalization depends on perceived commonality with the audience, recollection of shared reality at time of judgment, and similarity between new and initial targets.

AB  - Objective: Recent years have seen advances in theories and models of risk and crisis communication, with a focus on emerging epidemic infection. Nevertheless, information flow remains unilateral in many countries and does not take into account the public's polyvocality and the fact that its opinions and knowledge often "compete" with those of health authorities. This article addresses the challenges organizations face in communicating with the public sphere.
   Methods: Our theoretical approach is conceptualized through a framework that focuses on the public sphere and that builds upon existing guidelines and studies in the context of health and pandemics. We examine how health organizations cope with the public's transformation from recipients to an active and vocal entity, ie, how and to what extent health organizations address the public's anxiety and concerns arising in the social media during outbreaks.
   Results: Although international organizations have aspired to relate to the public as a partner, this article identifies notable gaps.
   Conclusions: Organizations must involve the public throughout the crisis and conduct dialogues free of prejudices, paternalism, and preconceptions. Thereby, they can impart precise and updated information reflecting uncertainty and considering cultural differences to build trust and facilitate cooperation with the public sphere.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: As rates of obesity have increased throughout much of the world, so too have bias and prejudice toward people with higher body weight (that is, weight bias). Despite considerable evidence of weight bias in the United States, little work has examined its extent and antecedents across different nations. The present study conducted a multinational examination of weight bias in four Western countries with comparable prevalence rates of adult overweight and obesity.
   METHODS: Using comprehensive self-report measures with 2866 individuals in Canada, the United States, Iceland and Australia, the authors assessed (1) levels of explicit weight bias (using the Fat Phobia Scale and the Universal Measure of Bias) and multiple sociodemographic predictors (for example, sex, age, race/ethnicity and educational attainment) of weight-biased attitudes and (2) the extent to which weight-related variables, including participants' own body weight, personal experiences with weight bias and causal attributions of obesity, play a role in expressions of weight bias in different countries.
   RESULTS: The extent of weight bias was consistent across countries, and in each nation attributions of behavioral causes of obesity predicted stronger weight bias, as did beliefs that obesity is attributable to lack of willpower and personal responsibility. In addition, across all countries the magnitude of weight bias was stronger among men and among individuals without family or friends who had experienced this form of bias.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings offer new insights and important implications regarding sociocultural factors that may fuel weight bias across different cultural contexts, and for targets of stigma-reduction efforts in different countries.

AB  - Attempts at modifying public opinions, attitudes, and beliefs range from advertising and schooling to "brainwashing." Their effectiveness is highly controversial. In this paper, we use survey data on anti-Semitic beliefs and attitudes in a representative sample of Germans surveyed in 1996 and 2006 to show that Nazi indoctrination-with its singular focus on fostering racial hatred-was highly effective. Between 1933 and 1945, young Germans were exposed to anti-Semitic ideology in schools, in the (extracurricular) Hitler Youth, and through radio, print, and film. As a result, Germans who grew up under the Nazi regime are much more anti-Semitic than those born before or after that period: the share of committed anti-Semites, who answer a host of questions about attitudes toward Jews in an extreme fashion, is 2-3 times higher than in the population as a whole. Results also hold for average beliefs, and not just the share of extremists; average views of Jews are much more negative among those born in the 1920s and 1930s. Nazi indoctrination was most effective where it could tap into preexisting prejudices; those born in districts that supported anti-Semitic parties before 1914 show the greatest increases in anti-Jewish attitudes. These findings demonstrate the extent to which beliefs can be modified through policy intervention. We also identify parameters amplifying the effectiveness of such measures, such as preexisting prejudices.

TI  - Interests, Values, and Geopolitics: The Global Public Opinion on China
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The essay discusses the public opinion surveys on the rise of China in the United States, Asia and Latin America since 2010, conducted by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Duke University's collaborative research team headed by the author. It examines the world public recognition of China's growing influence, their attitudes toward China's influence, and reactions to the 'China Model' and impressions of China's political, economic, social, and cultural development. These assessments of China's domestic issues or internal behavior show not only the amount of information and knowledge that the people in various countries know about China, but the intrinsic value judgments and ideological biases that influence their perceptions of China. The essay argues that the rise of China is a complicated phenomenon with a multifarious nature, including material dimensions, such as military power, economic development, and technological innovation, as well as ideational dimensions, such as perception, understanding, or prejudice. Public opinion, attitudes and perceptions of China's rise are the outcome of dynamic interactions and assemblage of factors, a synergy of material interests, ideational and emotional reactions, and values, ideologies, principles, unraveling themselves against a highly volatile, precarious and contentious geopolitical backdrop, in which the interests of nation-states and individuals became all intertwined and inseparable.

AB  - There is mounting evidence to suggest that East European migrants in the UK have been victims of discrimination. Reports of pay gaps point to the possibility of structural discrimination, restrictions on employment operate as a kind of legal discrimination, and politicians and the media have constructed East European migrants as different and at times threatening. The Hungarians and Romanians we spoke with in Bristol also reported some discrimination, albeit in ways that deflected its racialised connotations. But they also denied that they were victims of discrimination. Why would the supposed victims of discrimination deny discrimination? We argue they did this to attenuate, and potentially reverse, the status degradations they suffered as disadvantaged and at times racialised labour migrants in Britain. We examine two discursive strategies they employed to negotiate this higher status. First, they claimed a higher social class status by embracing the meritocratic values of the dominant class. Second, they claimed a higher racial status by emphasising their whiteness and Europeanness. These were discursive attempts to reposition themselves more favourably in Britain's racialised status hierarchies.

AB  - Many mental health professionals still consider homosexuality to be a mental disturbance. These professionals often practice interventions that aim to change or "repair" homosexuality. Even when these "reparative" interventions are required by the client her/himself, the interventions minimize the role of internalized homophobia and promote ineffective and harmful therapeutic practices. This report aims to study this "reparative attitude" (RA) through the use of an Internet-based questionnaire that was administered anonymously to Italian licensed psychologists (n = 3,135). The analysis of the frequencies showed that RA affected 58% of the participants. In addition, RA was predicted by variables representing demographic, sociocultural and professional characteristics, as well as by some theoretical assumptions about homosexuality. This study highlighted the need to improve the theoretical preparation of mental health professionals. The study also contributed to the development of the first Italian guidelines for providing counseling and psychotherapy to lesbian, gay, and bisexual clients.

AB  - What determines professional motivations and values of security operatives: sector or profession? Our article aims to answer this question through a survey study among police officers (n = 405) and private security guards (n = 329) in the Netherlands. Our results show that both groups closely resemble each other in how they prioritize motivations and values, although police officers have a slightly more missionary and crime fighting work ethic than private security guards. Mutual perceptions, however, reveal contrasts: Police officers look down on private security guards, while private security guards look up to police officers. We conclude with theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

AB  - We advance a theory-driven approach to stereotype structure, informed by connectionist theories of cognition. Whereas traditional models define or tacitly assume that stereotypes possess inherently Group -> Attribute activation directionality (e.g., Black activates criminal), our model predicts heterogeneous stereotype directionality. Alongside the classically studied Group -> Attribute stereotypes, some stereotypes should be bidirectional (i.e., Group reversible arrow Attribute) and others should have Attribute -> Group unidirectionality (e.g., fashionable activates gay). We tested this prediction in several large-scale studies with human participants (N-Combined = 4,817), assessing stereotypic inferences among various groups and attributes. Supporting predictions, we found heterogeneous directionality both among the stereotype links related to a given social group and also between the links of different social groups. These efforts yield rich datasets that map the networks of stereotype links related to several social groups. We make these datasets publicly available, enabling other researchers to explore a number of questions related to stereotypes and stereotyping. Stereotype directionality is an understudied feature of stereotypes and stereotyping with widespread implications for the development, measurement, maintenance, expression, and change of stereotypes, stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.

AB  - This study applies the aversive racism framework to Spain and tests whether aversive racism depends on intergroup contact. Relying on a 3 (qualifications) by 3 (ethnicity) experiment, this study finds that aversive racism is especially pronounced against the Mexican job applicant, and emerges among those who held overtly positive attitudes toward immigrants. Friendships with Latinos predicted decreased overt prejudice yet exacerbated aversive racism. Exposure to immigrants in one's neighborhood, in turn, predicted overt prejudice but was unrelated to aversive racism. These results suggest that (i) aversive racism emerges in Spain and against some immigrants, (ii) overt attitudes do not reliably reflect subtle biases, and (iii) among this sample, intergroup contact does not improve deep prejudices and is limited to affecting overt prejudice against out-groups only.

AB  - Research has shown that women on average express more positive attitudes towards out-groups than men. We hypothesize that, because of differences in the social climate that this gender gap produces, people who spend more time in female-dominated groups are likely to develop more positive attitudes towards out-groups than people who spend more time in groups that are dominated by men. We corroborate our argument with evidence from two unique Swedish data sets. On the basis of the first data set, we show that students who attend female-dominated school classes are more tolerant of immigrants' rights than students attending male-dominated school classes. On the basis of the second data set, we show that adults who work at female-dominated workplaces are more tolerant of immigrants' rights than adults who work at male-dominated workplaces. Overall, our findings demonstrate that group gender composition is important for understanding the formation of attitudes towards out-groups.

AB  - A substantial body of research suggests that some news media outlets depict certain social groups stereotypically. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to such news influences viewers' automatically activated gut feelings (i.e., implicit attitudes) toward this social group, which, in turn, may be used as a basis for overtly expressed evaluations (i.e., explicit attitudes). This prediction was investigated in three empirical studies in two cultural contexts. In the United States and Austria, results suggest that regular exposure to stereotypical news coverage creates negative implicit attitudes, which, in turn, alter explicit attitudes. A better understanding of the news stereotype effects will allow us to develop strategies to reduce prejudice, which may contribute to the improvement of a humane and open society.

AB  - Purpose: A newly emergent literature suggests that bisexual men and women face profound health disparities in comparison to both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Additionally, bisexual individuals often experience prejudice, stigma, and discrimination from both gay/lesbian and straight communities, termed "biphobia." However, only limited research exists that empirically tests the extent and predictors of this double discrimination. The Bisexualities: Indiana Attitudes Scale (BIAS) was developed to test associations between biphobia and sexual identity.
   Methods: Using standard techniques, we developed and administered a scale to a purposive online sample of adults from a wide range of social networking websites. We conducted exploratory factor analysis to refine scales assessing attitudes toward bisexual men and bisexual women, respectively. Using generalized linear modeling, we assessed relationships between BIAS scores and sexual identity, adjusting for covariates.
   Results: Two separately gendered scales were developed, administered, and refined: BIAS-m (n = 645), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual men, and BIAS-f (n = 631), focusing on attitudes toward bisexual women. Across scales, sexual identity significantly predicted response variance. Lesbian/gay respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their heterosexual counterparts (all p-values < .05); bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their straight counterparts (all p-values < .001); and bisexual respondents had lower levels of bi-negative attitudes than their lesbian/gay counterparts (all p-values < .05). Within racial/ethnic minority respondents, biracial/multiracial status was associated with lower bi-negativity scores (all p-values < .05).
   Conclusions: This study provides important quantitative support for theories related to biphobia and double discrimination. Our findings provide strong evidence for understanding how stereotypes and stigma may lead to dramatic disparities in depression, anxiety, stress, and other health outcomes among bisexual individuals in comparison to their heterosexual and homosexual counterparts. Our results yield valuable data for informing social awareness and intervention efforts that aim to decrease bi-negative attitudes within both straight and gay/lesbian communities, with the ultimate goal of alleviating health disparities among bisexual men and women.

AB  - Sexism differs from other prejudices due to intimate interdependence between the sexes, requiring gender-specific research on effective ways to confront sexist behavior. Two central themes emerge from the current issue: (i) who can confront sexism successfully and (ii) how organizations and leaders should intervene. The burden to confront often falls on female targets, who experience social costs for doing so, especially when perpetrators have greater power. Targets therefore need allies, including men, who are not perceived as having self-interested motives for confronting. Organizationsthrough leaders and policiesrepresent the most important and effective allies. Organizational priorities can determine whether female targets suffer in silence or are empowered to confront. Fortunately, there is increasing popular interest, both among women and organizations, to address barriers to women's advancement. This special issue represents an important first step, outlining promising strategies for confronting sexism.

AB  - Studies have indicated that social stigma related to podoconiosis (endemic non-filarial elephantiasis) has a major impact on the psychosocial wellbeing of patients. However, little effort has been made so far to quantify the level of both felt and enacted stigma in a range of domains of life. We used a recently developed podoconiosis stigma assessment scale to measure levels of stigma as recalled over the previous 12 months. One hundred and fifty patients with podoconiosis rated the levels of stigma they perceived and experienced in 'interpersonal interactions', 'major life areas' and 'community, social and civic life'. High levels of stigma were observed on both felt and enacted stigma scales. The overall average stigma score was 40.7 (range 0 to 96). Enacted stigma was scored higher than felt stigma (mean score 21.2 vs. 19.5, respectively). The mean enacted stigma score was higher in 'major life areas', and 'community, social and civic life' than 'interpersonal interactions', while felt stigma was experienced most at the interpersonal level. Over half of patients reported that they had considered suicide in response to discrimination and prejudice, particularly in interpersonal interactions. Forced divorce, dissolution of marriage plan, insults and exclusion at social events were some of the most commonly mentioned forms of enacted stigma reported by affected individuals. Scores for overall level of stigma and enacted stigma increased significantly with stage of podoconiosis while the association observed in relation to felt stigma was only marginally significant (p = 0.085). Appropriate stigma reduction strategies must be identified and implemented in communities highly endemic for podoconiosis.

KW  - QUALITY
AB  - How does the use of a secret vote affect the likelihood that legislators will punish their peers? Two contending arguments exist in the literature: some argue that secret voting may be prejudicial, while others argue that it may help accountability. We address this controversy by analyzing the case of the Brazilian Congress, which uses a sequential combination of open and secret voting procedures. We begin with a statistical analysis of the Congress that establishes some key parameters of variance. The results of this exercise are then used to populate an agent-based model of the Congress, which is used to simulate a variety of potential behaviors under diverse conditions. Agent-based modeling enables us to extend the discussion beyond the small-n of cases available in the real world, demonstrating that slight changes in parameters can lead to very large changes in the overall effect of voting procedure. Modeling voting behaviors under different conditions, we conclude that both arguments about secret voting may hold true, and that the effects of the type of vote - open or secret - will be contingent on factors such as the power of the accused politician, the composition of the voting body, and the publicity given to the accusations.

AB  - Infants universally elicit in adults a set of solicitous behaviors that are evolutionarily important for the survival of the species. However, exposure, experience, and prejudice appear to govern adults' social choice and ingroup attitudes towards other adults. In the current study, physiological arousal and behavioral judgments were assessed while adults processed unfamiliar infant and adult faces of ingroup vs. outgroup members in two contrasting cultures, Japan and Italy. Physiological arousal was investigated using the novel technique of infrared thermography and behavioral judgments using ratings. We uncovered a dissociation between physiological and behavioral responses. At the physiological level, both Japanese and Italian adults showed significant activation (increase of facial temperature) for both ingroup and outgroup infant faces. At the behavioral level, both Japanese and Italian adults showed significant preferences for ingroup adults. Arousal responses to infants appear to be mediated by the autonomic nervous system and are not dependent on direct caregiving exposure, but behavioral responses appear to be mediated by higher-order cognitive processing based on social acceptance and cultural exposure.

AB  - Each individual's personal experiences-and the developmental environments that individuals create for others' personal experiences-are profoundly affected by membership in, and attitudes toward, social groups. Although social groups may offer supports to their members and though members may contribute to groups' collective good, social-group divisions also create occasions for stereotyping and prejudice. This article reviews developmental intergroup theory (Bigler & Liben, 2006) that argues for the emergence of stereotyping and prejudice through the relational interplay of constructive and contextual processes. The theory is then discussed in the domain of gender by describing first, illustrative laboratory and field research on gender stereotypes and biases, and second, implications for gender-segregated (single-sex) educational programs.

AB  - We assessed whether intergroup contact at a nation-building intervention in Malaysia improved participants' perceptions of threat and outgroup evaluations and whether this process was conceptually moderated by group status in a three-group setting. We found evidence of a strong relationship between post-intervention contact and post-intervention outgroup evaluations in all groups and evidence of indirect effects of post-intervention contact on outgroup evaluations by symbolic threat for the minority groups rating the majority group. We found that in the context of institutional inequalities, integrated threat theory may not be sufficiently complex to uncover the processes that underlie the contact-attitude link for majority groups rating minority groups. Further, we found indirect effects of post-intervention contact on outgroup evaluations via realistic threat for interminority group ratings. Thus, we elucidate some of the different mechanisms that underlie the intergroup perceptions of majority and minority group members.

AB  - List and endorsement experiments are becoming increasingly popular among social scientists as indirect survey techniques for sensitive questions. When studying issues such as racial prejudice and support for militant groups, these survey methodologies may improve the validity of measurements by reducing nonresponse and social desirability biases. We develop a statistical test and multivariate regression models for comparing and combining the results from list and endorsement experiments. We demonstrate that when carefully designed and analyzed, the two survey experiments can produce substantively similar empirical findings. Such agreement is shown to be possible even when these experiments are applied to one of the most challenging research environments: contemporary Afghanistan. We find that both experiments uncover similar patterns of support for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) among Pashtun respondents. Our findings suggest that multiple measurement strategies can enhance the credibility of empirical conclusions. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.

AB  - Background: Research on discrimination in healthcare settings has primarily focused on health implications of race-based discrimination among ethno-racial minority groups. Little is known about discrimination experiences of other marginalized populations, particularly groups facing multiple disadvantages who may be subjected to other/multiple forms of discrimination. Objectives: (1) To examine the prevalence of perceived discrimination due to homelessness/poverty, mental illness/alcohol/drug related problems, and race/ethnicity/skin color while seeking healthcare in the past year among racially diverse homeless adults with mental illness; (2) To identify whether perceiving certain types of discrimination is associated with increased likelihood of perceiving other kinds of discrimination; and (3) To examine association of these perceived discrimination experiences with socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptomatology and substance use, and Emergency Department utilization.
   Methods: We used baseline data from the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi randomized controlled trial of Housing First for homeless adults with mental illness (n = 550). Bivariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used for the analysis.
   Results: Perceived discrimination related to homelessness/poverty (30.4%) and mental illness/alcohol/substance use (32.5%) is prevalent among ethnically diverse homeless adults with mental illness in healthcare settings. Only 15% of the total participants reported discrimination due to race/ethnicity/skin color. After controlling for relevant confounders and presence of psychosis, all types of discrimination in healthcare settings were associated with more frequent ED use, a greater -3 - severity of lifetime substance abuse, and mental health problems. Perceiving discrimination of one type was associated with increased likelihood of perceiving other kinds of discrimination.
   Conclusions: Understanding the experience of discrimination in healthcare settings and associated healthcare utilization is the first step towards designing policies and interventions to address health disparities among vulnerable populations. This study contributes to the knowledge base in this important area.

AB  - This study not only shows that the empirically well-established negative relationship between residential diversity and trust in neighbors holds for the case of Germany, but goes beyond existing research by providing experimental evidence on the causal nature of the diversity effect. Respondents exposed to experimental stimuli that made salient the ethnic or religious heterogeneity of their neighborhoods display significantly lower levels of trust in their neighbors than do respondents in the control group. Further, we explore the role of interethnic contact in mediating the relationship between diversity and trust in a degree of detail unmatched by earlier studies. We consider not only positive forms of interethnic contact such as friendships, but also neutral and negative encounters between people of native and immigrant origin. We find that interethnic contacts mediate negative diversity effects on trust in different ways for both groups. For natives, distant encounters and negative experiences with immigrants in diverse contexts reduce trust, whereas for people of immigrant origin trust in neighbors suffers from the relatively small number of native acquaintances in diverse neighborhoods.

AB  - Historically, discourse about welfare in the United States has changed from a language of need' to a culture of dependency'. Adopting dependency' as a frame to construct the public opinion of welfare, workers help maintain the current punitive welfare state. In this study, we use critical discourse analysis to examine how county program managers in Ohio, USA (N = 69) use several discursive techniques to legitimate their identities as good workers while neutralizing negative connotations associated with administering welfare policy. Further, we find managers use discursive techniques of contrast to heighten boundaries between three pairings: (1) generational' and situational' clients, (2) clients and non-clients, and (3) welfare workers and clients. Managers engage in classtalk' in their contrasts in a way that blames the poor through contrasts with others with middle-class values'.

AB  - Background: Stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness remain barriers to help seeking and full recovery for people in need of mental health services. Yet there is scarce research investigating the experiences of psychiatric stigma on mental health service users in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was therefore to explore the experiences of psychiatric stigma by service users in order to inform interventions to reduce such stigma and discrimination in one LMIC, namely South Africa.
   Methods: Participants comprised a total of 77 adults aged above 18 years, made up of service providers including professional nurses (10), lay counsellors (20), auxiliary social workers (2); and service users (45).
   Results: Psychiatric stigma was found to be perpetuated by family members, friends, employers, community members and health care providers. Causes of psychiatric stigma identified included misconceptions about mental illness often leading to delays in help-seeking. Experiencing psychiatric stigma was reported to worsen the health of service users and impede their capacity to lead and recover a normal life.
   Conclusion: Media campaigns and interventions to reduce stigma should be designed to address specific stigmatizing behaviours among specific segments of the population. Counselling of families, caregivers and service users should include how to deal with experienced and internalized stigma.

AB  - Recent research has shown that contact with the historically advantaged can have paradoxical effects on the political attitudes of the historically disadvantaged, reducing outgroup prejudice but also reducing the motivation to acknowledge and challenge social inequalities. These effects have been attributed primarily to the role of intergroup contact in decreasing the salience of intergroup differences, encouraging common identification, and creating warm feelings. This paper explores a related but distinct process through which contact may have paradoxical consequences, focusing on its capacity to act as a vehicle for the transmission of systems-justifying ideologies. The paper presents a qualitative study of domestic labour relations in post-apartheid South Africa. Analysis of interviews with domestic workers and employers demonstrates how intergroup contact in this context was typically organised and defined in terms of paternalistic values, beliefs and practices. Interview accounts were designed to resolve the moral and political tensions associated with participation in the historically racist institution of domestic labour by (re)constituting everyday relations between 'maids' and 'madams' in the language of caring, helping and reciprocal exchange.

AB  - Although mimicry generally facilitates social interaction, sometimes mimicry effects can hamper pursuit of focal goals. Two studies tested whether the self-regulation strategy of forming implementation intentions (i.e., planning in advance the when, where, and how of one's goal striving) can be used to regulate mimicry effects. In Study 1, implementation intentions to be non-prejudiced ensured that mimicking increased attraction even for an unlikable person. In Study 2, implementation intentions to be thrifty reduced participants' susceptibility to the persuasive effects of being mimicked. Mere goal intentions to be non-prejudiced and to be thrifty did not suffice to regulate mimicry effects. We conclude that the strategic automaticity accomplished by implementation intentions allows people to intentionally strengthen (Study 1) and weaken (Study 2) mimicry effects in line with their goals. Implications for the effective self-regulation of mimicry effects are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: People with schizophrenia face prejudice and discrimination from a number of sources including professionals and families. The degree of stigma perceived and experienced varies across cultures and communities. We aimed to develop a cross-cultural measure of the stigma perceived by people with schizophrenia.
   Method: Items for the scale were developed from qualitative group interviews with people with schizophrenia in six countries. The scale was then applied in face-to-face interviews with 164 participants, 103 of which were repeated after 30 days. Principal Axis Factoring and Promax rotation evaluated the structure of the scale; Horn's parallel combined with bootstrapping determined the number of factors; and intra-class correlation assessed test-retest reliability.
   Results: The final scale has 31 items and four factors: informal social networks, socio-institutional, health professionals and self-stigma. Cronbach's alpha was 0.84 for the Factor 1; 0.81 for Factor 2; 0.74 for Factor 3, and 0.75 for Factor 4. Correlation matrix among factors revealed that most were in the moderate range [0.31-0.49], with the strongest occurring between perception of stigma in the informal network and self-stigma and there was also a weaker correlation between stigma from health professionals and self-stigma. Test-retest reliability was highest for informal networks [ICC 0.76 [0.67 -0.83]] and self-stigma [ICC 0.74 [0.64-0.81]]. There were no significant differences in the scoring due to sex or age. Service users in Argentina had the highest scores in almost all dimensions.
   Conclusions: The MARISTAN stigma scale is a reliable measure of the stigma of schizophrenia and related psychoses across several cultures. A confirmatory factor analysis is needed to assess the stability of its factor structure.

AB  - Anthony Forge was a pioneer in the anthropology of art and established an international reputation in this field. His work on the political anthropology of egalitarianism, by contrast, has been virtually ignored because of the demise of British Social Anthropology as a method, and the rise of inequality as the problem to be investigated. Some fifty years have passed since Forge did his fieldwork in the Sepik District of Papua New Guinea; a critical reappraisal of his method and ideas in light of the political history of democracy in Oceania is called for. Equality as a male value has re-emerged as a key concern for the new 'Big Shot', so too has equal exchange, but in the form of the commercial gift. If we are to grasp the general principles, and paradoxes, that inform transactions of this kind, anthropologists need to reassess their prejudices about the method of British Social Anthropology.

AB  - The history of Chinese immigration in Italy is about a century old, but numbers have become consistent in the last decades and the emergence of new generations is a recent phenomenon. This article examines the growing role of Chinese descendants in the country (within Chinese enterprises and new forms of interaction with the mainstream society) and their processes of identity formation, focusing the attention on the role played by Italian society and the dominant prejudices about this ethnic minority. The study highlights the relevance of social exclusion and identity prescription, as well as the importance of class, in determining different feelings of belonging and processes of identification. While a minority of middle-class Chinese have identified with Italy and developed a new hyphenated identity, many Chinese from the lower class appear uncertain about their national identity and react to social exclusion by abandoning hope and dropping out of education.

AB  - Background: A challenge in human genome research is how to describe the populations being studied. The use of improper and/or imprecise terms has the potential to both generate and reinforce prejudices and to diminish the clinical value of the research. The issue of population descriptors has not attracted enough academic attention outside North America and Europe. In January 2012, we held a two-day workshop, the first of its kind in Japan, to engage in interdisciplinary dialogue between scholars in the humanities, social sciences, medical sciences, and genetics to begin an ongoing discussion of the social and ethical issues associated with population descriptors.
   Discussion: Through the interdisciplinary dialogue, we confirmed that the issue of race, ethnicity and genetic research has not been extensively discussed in certain Asian communities and other regions. We have found, for example, the continued use of the problematic term, "Mongoloid" or continental terms such as "European," "African," and "Asian," as population descriptors in genetic studies. We, therefore, introduce guidelines for reporting human genetic studies aimed at scientists and researchers in these regions.
   Conclusion: We need to anticipate the various potential social and ethical problems entailed in population descriptors. Scientists have a social responsibility to convey their research findings outside of their communities as accurately as possible, and to consider how the public may perceive and respond to the descriptors that appear in research papers and media articles.

AB  - It is a commonplace in Genocide Studies to say that 'Turkey denies the Armenian genocide'. The Turkish state's official policy towards the Armenian genocide was and is indeed characterized by misrepresentation, mystification and manipulation. But when one gauges what place the Armenian genocide occupies in the social memory of Turkish society, even after nearly a century, a different picture emerges. Even though most direct eyewitnesses to the crime have passed away, oral history interviews yield important insights. Elderly Turks and Kurds in Eastern Turkey often hold vivid memories from family members or fellow villagers who witnessed or participated in the genocide. This article is based on interviews conducted with (grand)children of eyewitnesses to the Armenian genocide. The research suggests there is a clash between official state memory and popular social memory: the Turkish government is denying a genocide that its own population remembers.

AB  - I examine how migrant-national encounters are morally framed through boundary making based on intersections of class, sexuality, ethnicity and migrancy. Encounters are a fruitful lens for the study of the everyday politics of diversity and belonging. By focusing on encounters it is possible to analyse whether close contact does in fact reduce prejudice, as has been argued in research on cosmopolitan urbanism. I present the notion of contact space as a conceptual tool for such analysis, as well as examples of contact spaces in the private and public spheres. I use ethnographic data on the employment of domestic workers in Naples, Italy, to show that close contact does not alleviate prejudices in societies that offer little possibility of social advancement for migrant workers.

AB  - Recent research suggests that the Big Five personality traits are important determinants of a wide range of political and social attitudes. In spite of this, the impact of personality traits on attitudes towards immigrants has been unattended in sociological research. On the basis of insights from personality psychology, we extend the sociological approach to immigrant-specific prejudice by analysing the effects of personality using a large and nationally representative sample of the Dutch population. Moreover, we consider personality jointly with situational predictors of attitudes towards immigrants. The results confirm that some personality traits are associated with attitudes towards immigrants, beyond the effect of socio-economic, attitudinal and contact predictors. We conclude that combining insights from sociology and personality psychology in the study of dispositional and situational determinants of attitudes towards immigration is a fruitful avenue for research.

AB  - Previous research has shown that nativist ideology racializes nonwhite immigrants, but little research has looked at how color-blind racist discourse shapes how people accomplish this while maintaining a race-neutral identity. This study examines how online discussion forum participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance, which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to include nonwhite immigrants.

AB  - Prejudice against a social group may lead to discrimination of members of this group. One very strong cue of group membership is a (non)standard accent in speech. Surprisingly, hardly any interventions against accent-based discrimination have been tested. In the current article, we introduce an intervention in which what participants experience themselves unobtrusively changes their evaluations of others. In the present experiment, participants in the experimental condition talked to a confederate in a foreign language before the experiment, whereas those in the control condition received no treatment. Replicating previous research, participants in the control condition discriminated against Turkish-accented job candidates. In contrast, those in the experimental condition evaluated Turkish- and standard-accented candidates as similarly competent. We discuss potential mediating and moderating factors of this effect.

AB  - The civil rights movement fostered dramatic shifts in legal responses to discrimination based on race, gender, and a host of other group characteristics. The legal system now evinces yet another dramatic shift, as it moves from considering difference to focusing on neutrality, from efforts that seek to counter subjugation to those that adopt a "color-blind" approach. The shifting approach already has reached laws regulating responses to the group that spurred massive civil rights reform: minority youth. The shift requires a different body of empirical evidence to address it and a new look at equality jurisprudence. This article notes the need to turn to the current understanding of prejudice and discrimination for guidance, and uses, as illustration, developmental science to shed light on the development, manifestation, and alleviation of invidious discrimination. Using that understanding, the analysis details how the legal system can benefit from that research and better address discrimination in light of dramatic changes in law. The article articulates the need to address discrimination by recognizing and enlisting the law's inculcative powers through multiple sites of inculcation, ranging from families, schools, health and justice systems to religious and community groups. The discussion concludes with brief suggestions for reform benefiting from understandings of prejudice and its expression.

AB  - In times of globalisation and super-mobility, ideas of normality are in turmoil. In different societies in, across and beyond Europe, we face the challenge of undoing specific notions of normality and creating more inclusive societies with an open culture of learning to live with differences. The scope of the paper is to introduce some findings on encounters with difference and negotiations of social values in relation to a growing visibility of difference after 1989 in Poland, on the background of a critique of normality/normalisation and normalcy. On the basis of interviews conducted in Warsaw, we investigate how normality/normalisation discourses of visible homosexuality and physical disability are incorporated into individual self-reflections and justifications of prejudices (homophobia and disabilism). More specifically we argue that there are moments of 'cultural transgressions' present in everyday practices towards 'visible' sexual and (dis)ability difference.

AB  - Do labour markets discriminate against workers with particular ethnic-sounding names? We use non-random sorting into inter-ethnic marriage and salient differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazi surnames to evaluate the causal impact of Sephardic affiliation on wages. Using the 1995 Israeli Census, we estimate the effect of a Sephardic sounding surname on wages. We first compare the wages of Israeli Jewish males born to Sephardic fathers and Ashkenazi mothers (SA), who are more likely to carry a Sephardic surname, with the wages of Israeli Jewish males born to Ashkenazi fathers and Sephardic mothers (AS). We find that Israeli labour markets discriminate based on perceived ethnicity: SA workers earn significantly less than their AS counterparts. We then exploit the custom of women to adopt their husbands' surnames to disentangle actual ethnicity from the ethnicity perceived by the market. Consistent with ethnic discrimination based on surnames, we find that it is father-in-law's ethnicity-rather than father's ethnicity-that shapes female wage rates. Finally, we find that labour markets discriminate based on surname only when those names provide additional information about ethnicity. When ethnicity can be discerned from skin tone, surnames do not provide additional explanatory power with respect to wages.

KW  - FEWER
AB  - In our target article, The Fewer the Merrier: Assessing Stigma Surrounding Consensual Nonmonogamous Relationships, we documented a robust stigma toward consensual nonmonogamous relationships and a halo surrounding monogamous relationships. In the present piece, we respond to six commentaries of our target article with the aim of promoting future research and policy change. First, we address questions and concerns raised by commentators using existing data and found that regardless of perceived relationship happiness, sexual orientation, or gender (of experimental targets), individuals in consensual nonmonogamous relationships were more negatively viewed on a variety of qualities (both relationship-specific and nonrelationship specific) compared to those in monogamous relationships. Second, we suggest productive future research avenues with regards to implications for social change, and strengthening methodology used in consensual nonmonogamous research. Finally, we consider common ground among the commentators as an avenue to promote coalition building through the examinations of prejudice toward individuals in nonnormative romantic relationships. We conclude that this is only the beginning of a fruitful line of research and argue that the stigma toward departures from monogamy is robust and, of course, worthy of additional research.

AB  - In the present study, we surveyed university students (n = 183) to determine if the inclusion of moral intuitions as described in Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) would aid in the explanation of two types of homonegativity toward gay men. After accounting for demographic variables, social desirability, and intrinsic religiousness, results of hierarchical multiple regression procedures indicated that the inclusion of moral intuitions improved prediction of both traditional and modern forms of homonegativity, although this occurred through differential emphases on specific moral foundations. Our findings suggest that the more participants regarded the individual rather than the group (e.g., family or society) as the focus of moral concern, the less likely they were to evidence either type of homonegativity. MFT appears to provide the sexual prejudice literature with a means of understanding the motivational schema of Christian and other conservatives in less derogatory terms than have heretofore been examined. This can enhance the study of homonegativity and the public policy that flows from it.

AB  - Introduction: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Kenya are at high risk for HIV and may experience prejudiced treatment in health settings due to stigma. An on-line computer-facilitated MSM sensitivity programme was conducted to educate healthcare workers (HCWs) about the health issues and needs of MSM patients.
   Methods: Seventy-four HCWs from 49 ART-providing health facilities in the Kenyan Coast were recruited through purposive sampling to undergo a two-day MSM sensitivity training. We conducted eight focus group discussions (FGDs) with programme participants prior to and three months after completing the training programme. Discussions aimed to characterize HCWs' challenges in serving MSM patients and impacts of programme participation on HCWs' personal attitudes and professional capacities.
   Results: Before participating in the training programme, HCWs described secondary stigma, lack of professional education about MSM, and personal and social prejudices as barriers to serving MSM clients. After completing the programme, HCWs expressed greater acknowledgement of MSM patients in their clinics, endorsed the need to treat MSM patients with high professional standards and demonstrated sophisticated awareness of the social and behavioural risks for HIV among MSM.
   Conclusions: Findings provide support for this approach to improving health services for MSM patients. Further efforts are needed to broaden the reach of this training in other areas, address identified barriers to HCW participation and evaluate programme effects on patient and HCW outcomes using rigorous methodology.

AB  - Intercultural contact may lead to temporary phases of acculturative stress but is also associated with personal growth. While this topic has been well studied, we argue that there has been a lack of systematic investigation in the form of panel data studies. The present article examines the temporal pattern of stress and self-esteem, with measures for sojourners and controls prior to, during, and post intercultural contact. The sojourner sample consisted of a group of Belgian adolescents who took part in a 1 year intercultural exchange program. Sojourners reported lower levels of stress and higher levels of self-esteem during the sojourn compared to pre-departure levels and controls. These findings were explained in terms of personal growth and acculturative resilience. Subsequent analyses also investigated whether stress and self-esteem could be predicted by intrapersonal (i.e., homesickness), interpersonal (i.e., social support), intergroup (i.e., identity, prejudice), and cultural distance measures. Stress was indeed associated with intrapersonal, interpersonal, and intergroup measures, but not with cultural distance. Self-esteem was associated with intrapersonal and intergroup predictors.

AB  - Challengers, as opposed to defenders, of the status quo ascribe more negative motives for the attitudes of their opponents and more positive motives to their allies. This may be associated with a heightened social cost involved in challenging the generally considered good and true. Most social issues are associated with ideology, and conservatives display more prejudices than liberals. Hence, it is unclear whether ideology or position toward the status quo per se drives these attributions. In two studies, position showed to be a stronger predictor of biased intergroup perceptions than ideology. Both left- and right-wing affiliates displayed stronger biases when in opposition. This supports the notion that the challenging position per se, elicits group differentiation. Results are important for understanding of negative campaigning and political action.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the discourse of health managers on aspects related to delay in tuberculosis diagnosis. This was a qualitative research study, conducted with 16 Family Health Unit managers. The empirical data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. The analysis was based on the theoretical framework of the French school of discourse analysis. According to the managers' statements, the delay in tuberculosis diagnosis is related to patient and health service aspects. As for patient aspects, managers report fear, prejudice and lack of information as factors that may promote a delayed diagnosis. Regarding health service aspects, structural problems and lack of professional skills were reported. The discourse of managers should be considered to qualify tuberculosis control actions and to prevent delays in diagnosis.

AB  - The 20th century was a century of genocide and other great violence between groups within societies. Already at the beginning of the 21st century, there have been mass killings, civil wars, violent conflict, and terrorism. This article summarizes influences that tend to lead to intense group violence. It then considers prevention, stressing early prevention-and reconciliation as an aspect of prevention and focusing on central principles and practices. The principles include developing positive orientations to previously devalued groups; healing from past victimization and promoting altruism born of suffering; moderating respect for authority; creating constructive ideologies; promoting understanding of the origins of violence, its impact, and avenues to prevention; promoting truth, justice, and a shared history; and raising inclusively caring, morally courageous children. Practices related to all of these are also discussed. The article stresses the role of progressive change, that is, of psychological, behavioral, and social evolution, in both extreme violence and positive relations between groups; the role of passive bystanders in the unfolding of violence; and the role of active bystandership in the prevention of violence, in the promotion of reconciliation, and in the development of harmonious societies. It emphasizes psychological processes but notes the importance of creating societal institutions. The author cites findings from both laboratory research and case studies, reviews interventions and their evaluation in Rwanda, and points to the need for further research.

AB  - Contrary to a widely held prejudice, service activities are polluting because they make use of physical tools and require travel, both of which give rise to externalities. In order to deal with these externalities, service firms can implement eco-innovations. The aim of this article is to evaluate the sensitivity of this eco-innovation to environmental policies by comparing the effectiveness of two such policies: the environmental tax and consumer information. To this end, we construct an agent-based model of innovation that draws on evolutionary biology and theories of innovation in services (Gallouj and Weinstein, 1997 [26]). A test of 123 different scenarios confirms that service firms are sensitive to environmental policies. The results suggest that the eco-tax is more effective, since it produces a lower and more stable level of pollution than a consumer information policy. The information policy appears to give rise to a perverse effect that causes market niches for the most environmentally friendly services to disappear. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plesch examines changing attitudes towards the gaucho as a musician in nineteenth-century Argentina through literary, musical and iconographic sources. She proposes the existence of a discursive formation gaucho, whose archive comprises travellers' writings, official reports, memoirs, visual arts, literature and music. Despised and persecuted throughout most of the nineteenth century, the gaucho was considered by Argentine elites as the epitome of barbarism', and his music was consistently described in derogatory terms. This attitude would be dramatically reversed towards the end of the century, when he was promoted to the role of national character and his cultural universe used as a source for the construction of a distinctive Argentine high culture that included the visual arts, literature and music. Plesch analyses the dominant discourse on the gaucho from colonial times to the publication of Martin Fierro (1872) and identifies four strategies of Othering at work: debasement, homogeneity, timelessness and Orientalism. They constitute, in the symbolic realm, the counterpart to the larger strategy of domination of the gaucho. In the second part of the article she examines the use of the gaucho and his world in the aesthetic production of Argentine cultural nationalism, isolating three key features: use, nostalgia and distancing. These are connected to the xenophobia unleashed by mass immigration and the modernization of the country, and the consequent need for elites to create a distinctive type of Argentine identity. The antithetical representations of the gaucho and his music, Plesch concludes, can only be understood in relation to the changing needs and political agendas of hegemonic society.

AB  - Aural surgery is a branch of nineteenth-century medicine and surgery providing specialized treatment for ear diseases. During the 1830s, faced with a "popular prejudice" against the curability of deafness as well as intraprofessional rivalries and continuous accusations of quackery, aurists found their surgical authority questioned and their field's value threatened. In an attempt to bolster aural surgery's reputation, in 1841, the aurist John Harrison Curtis (1778-4856) introduced his new diagnostic instrument, the cephaloscope, which could not only improve diagnosis but also provide approaches for regulating aural knowledge, thus strengthening aural surgery's authority. This article examines the motives underlying Curtis's introduction of the cephaloscope and the meanings it held for the occupational group at large.

AB  - Although female singlehood has become a lifestyle in western countries, never married and being over 30 is still viewed as "special" in contemporary China. Chinese single females live in a culture of traditional social prejudice against singlehood. Traditional family and societal values in general place pressure on single females to marry and have a child. This phenomenological study explores the meaning of being single and presents a firsthand view of how such women feel. Ten never-married single females over 30 years of age took part in one-on-one telephone interviews. Constant comparison data analysis revealed three major themes in their lived experiences of being single: (1) awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of singlehood; (2) ambiguous attitudes towards marriage; and (3) adjustments in life needed to make living as singles worthwhile.

AB  - Aim: The present study aimed to clarify the factors affecting early psychiatric intervention for patients with first-episode psychosis in Japan.
   Methods: A postal questionnaire survey was conducted in 346 members of the Association of Family of Psychosis Patients, in Mie, Japan.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 138 respondents. The mean interval between a suspected first episode of psychosis and the first visit to a medical institution was 18.4 months (SD: 40.0, range: 0-336 months). Forty-five respondents consulted a family member first and required a mean duration of 9.8 months (SD: 11.2) before their first visit; this was significantly shorter than those who did not. Eighteen respondents consulted their class teacher at school first and required a mean duration of 40.2 months (SD: 63.0) before their first visit; this was significantly longer (P < 0.05) than those who did not. When loss of sleep or appetite was present, the mean duration before their first visit was 9.3 months (SD: 12.1), which was significantly shorter (P < 0.05) than the time required by those who did not. Logistic regression analysis using the first episode-first visit interval as an independent variable, and independent variables such as age, gender of the patient and family member, and loss of sleep, revealed that variables relating to the respondent's notion about the psychosis were mitigating factors (e. g. 'prejudice-causing' and 'nothing to do with me').
   Conclusion: Prejudice towards psychosis and poor awareness about mental illnesses are two factors that may affect early psychiatric intervention.

AB  - A central question in the study of political development is how conflict between ethnic groups might be transcended. Findings from social psychology suggest that ethnically integrating institutions such as militaries or representative bodies may remove prejudices and exclusionary behavior that perpetuate interethnic animosity. Political scientists have tended to be skeptical, arguing that such processes may actually intensify or "freeze" conflicting ethnic identities. I use evidence from a hard case-military reform in the aftermath of a brutal, ethnically charged civil war in Burundi-to study this issue. At the macro level, the Burundian military undertook extensive quota-based integration that nonetheless resulted in a cohesive institution. A micro-level natural experiment, which produces quasirandom exposure to ethnic integration through the military retirement age, shows that exposure to ethnic integration decreases prejudicial behavior and is benign with respect to ethnic salience. Together, these results suggest promise in ethnic integration.

AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an out-group member would change behavioral tendencies toward the out-group. In Experiment 1, British high school students who imagined talking to an asylum seeker reported a stronger tendency to approach asylum seekers than did participants in a control condition. Path analysis revealed this relationship was mediated by out-group trust and, marginally, by out-group attitude. In Experiment 2, straight undergraduates who imagined an interaction with a gay individual reported a stronger tendency to approach, and a weaker tendency to avoid, gay people. Path analyses showed that these relationships were mediated by out-group trust, out-group attitude, and less intergroup anxiety. These findings highlight the potential practical importance of imagined contact and important mediators of its effects.

AB  - This article discusses the transnational industry of private, supplemental education (PSE) among ethnic Koreans, especially in Southern California. PSE offers a unique vantage point to examine the educational struggles and values of students, parents and teachers. A "Tiger Mom" educational culture reflects the extreme competition for elite, educational credentials, which can foster academic cheating and racial prejudices among Korean-Americans. In response, a growing number of educators, parents and students espouse more traditional, liberal-humanistic values of developing individual interests and talents and of mutual respect among diverse persons. This "Liberal Elephant" culture receives significant support from some members of actively proselytizing, Christian churches.

AB  - Processes for the identification of criminal suspects tell us a great deal about wider cultural assumptions and social prejudices regarding somatic difference; its causes, relative degree, and consequence.

Rather than assume astrology's seventeenth-century decline in the face of revolutionary natural philosophy, what follows suggests that English astrology remained significant for mundane bodily discrimination, in the context of both a more deliberate, gradual reform and the tenacity of centuries-old humoral physiology. More importantly, scrutiny of astrological practice, and the logic underpinning its lasting currency, can reveal much about the significance of bodily contrasts and the meanings ascribed to them by Tudor-Stuart folk.

AB  - Although there is temptation to judge the Roma community as having a strong cultural constancy and stability in time, as surviving at the periphery of societies, outside the process of modernization, this paper aims to make an analysis of the factors which caused important changes in the socio-economic and cultural state of this community within the context of globalization. The prejudice that the Roma are a community closed within its traditional culture had and still has adverse effects on the perception which the majority population has about the Roma community and on the support policies for the marginalised segments of the Roma population too. In some ways, the Roma population doesn't have a different pattern from all the other populations, minority or majority. All the populations are engaged in a process of social change and reconstruction, of transition from traditional to modern cultural patterns imposed by a dynamic society undergoing fast modernization. It is true though, that modernization is not only an opportunity through the unavoidable commitment of the communities within the global flow of change, but also a process of new social differentiation. The division of work has generated new pressures of internal differentiation for all populations: some people advanced socially, others remained at the margin of the process. The popular history of the Roma, with the myths of any such history, includes also the intellectuals, prestigious politicians and successful people as main patterns of exiting the `Gypsyhood'. But in spite of this, the paper underline that the concrete social and economic conditions put, in many cases, the Roma population, as ethnic group in a special social and cultural position different from that of other minorities. These papers bring a theoretical starting point for an empirical survey focusing on the successful Roma population. The survey was an exploratory research done by IQLR at the end of 2012, being centred on the Roma elite: intellectuals, political leaders and businessmen. The research has been identified three successful categories among the Roma people, mentioned above, as well as the factors associated to their success. The survey data are yet to be processed completely. However, they will certainly bring another perception/image on the Roma people, different from the one associated to severe poverty, as shown by the sociological research up to now.

AB  - This paper examines theoretical propositions regarding the social mechanisms that produce hostility and discriminatory attitudes towards out-group populations. Specifically, we compare the effect of perceptions of socio-economic and national threats, social contact and prejudice on social distance expressed towards labour migrants. To do so, we examine exclusionary views held by majority and minority groups (Jews and Arabs) towards non-Jewish labour migrants in Israel. Data analysis is based on a survey of the adult Israeli population based on a stratified sample of 1,342 respondents, conducted in Israel in 2007. Altogether, our results show that Israelis (both Jews and Arabs) are resistant to accepting and integrating foreigners into Israeli society. Among Jews, this is because the incorporation of non-Jews challenges the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and poses a threat to the homogeneity of the nation. Among Arabs, this is probably due to threat and competition over resources. The meanings of the findings are discussed within the unique ethno-national context of Israeli society and in light of sociological theories on ethnic exclusionism.

AB  - The population of older adults in the United States is growing in size and diversity, presenting challenges to health care providers and patients in the context of health care decision making (DM), including obtaining informed consent for treatment, advance care planning, and deliberations about end-of-life care options. Although existing literature addresses providers' need to attend to patients' cultural values and beliefs on these issues, less attention has been paid to how the corresponding values and beliefs of providers color the care they deliver and their assessments of older adults' DM capacity. The provider's challenge is to understand her own unacknowledged anxieties, prejudices, and fears around such charged issues as truth telling, individual agency, capacity, death and dying, and the value of life itself and address their impact on the delivery of care. A social constructivist perspective and the clinical concept of cultural countertransference are proposed as aides in achieving this awareness and improving care.

AB  - In 2004, the second International Association of Language and Social Psychology Task Force focused on relationships involving language and emerging communication technology, culminating in a Special Issue of the Journal of Language and Social Psychology (Vol. 23, No. 4). The present article reviews the topics and conclusions of that work and traces the continuation of study on those topics as they have evolved and influenced language and social psychology research to the present. Communication technology research offers views on the central question of how individuals adapt language to communicative action in the presence or absence of various nonverbal cue systems. This question is reflected in topics such as the expression of affect and immediacy online, the virtual presentation of self and gender, the management of online conversations, adaptation via visual grounding in electronic collaboration, and the employment of online interaction technology to reduce intergroup prejudice. As communication systems have evolved, interfaces offer new cues and representations of users, which continue to propel inquiry into these central questions about language and its usage within various technological contexts.

AB  - The literature has found that eating disorders (ED) patients usually have a depression and anxiety diagnosis. However, not many investigations have studied the relationship between ED and well-being. One of the main problems of patients with ED is their body image. These individuals usually see themselves too big but there are not many investigations that focus on how these patients see people with real weight problems. For this reason in this study it is analyzed how women in risk to develop ED see obese people. 456 female students were selected. It was found that women with high scores in the different subscales of the Eating Attitudes Test 26 (EAT-26; dieting, bulimia and oral control) had lower well-being (both subjective and psychological) and worse attitudes toward obese people (measured with Antifat Attitudes Test, AFA, Beliefs About Obese People Scale, BAOP, and Attitudes Toward Obese People Scale, ATOP) compared with women with low scores in the EAT-26.

AB  - This appraisal highlights the productive engagement between feminism and discursive psychology (DP). It discusses some of the confluence and tensions between DP and feminism. The two share critical perspectives on science and psychology, a concern with prejudice, and have ideas in common about the constructed nature of social categories, such as gender. One difficulty arises from the relativism associated with the post-structural theoretical underpinnings of DP, which can be understood as politically paralyzing. Another problem comes from an endorsement of a conversation analytic mentality, where identity categories such as gender can only be legitimately used in an analysis when participants orient to their relevance. The high-profile debates and literature in DP shows it has made a notable contribution to social psychology and its influence can also be found in other areas. A particular influence of DP highlighted in the present appraisal is on gender and language research.

TI  - Service provision and barriers to care for homeless people with mental health problems across 14 European capital cities
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

KW  - ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT
KW  - ILLNESS
AB  - Background: Mental health problems are disproportionately higher amongst homeless people. Many barriers exist for homeless people with mental health problems in accessing treatment yet little research has been done on service provision and quality of care for this group. The aim of this paper is to assess current service provision and identify barriers to care for homeless people with mental health problems in 14 European capital cities.
   Method: Two methods of data collection were employed; (i) In two highly deprived areas in each of the 14 European capital cities, homeless-specific services providing mental health, social care or general health services were assessed. Data were obtained on service characteristics, staff and programmes provided. (ii) Semi-structured interviews were conducted in each area with experts in mental health care provision for homeless people in order to determine the barriers to care and ways to overcome them.
   Results: Across the 14 capital cities, 111 homeless-specific services were assessed. Input from professionally qualified mental health staff was reported as low, as were levels of active outreach and case finding. Out-of-hours service provision appears inadequate and high levels of service exclusion criteria were evident. Prejudice in the services towards homeless people, a lack of co-ordination amongst services, and the difficulties homeless people face in obtaining health insurance were identified as major barriers to service provision.
   Conclusions: While there is variability in service provision across European capital cities, the reported barriers to service accessibility are common. Homeless-specific services are more responsive to the initial needs of homeless people with mental health problems, while generic services tend to be more conducive to long term care. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different service delivery models, including the most effective coordination of homeless specific and generic services.

AB  - A number of recent studies have examined the sources of conflict surrounding the presence of Muslim minorities in Western contexts. This article builds upon, and challenges, some of the principal findings of this literature through analyzing popular opposition to mosques in Badalona, a historically industrial city in Catalonia where several of the most vigorous anti-mosque campaigns in Spain have occurred. Drawing upon 46 semi-structured interviews and ethnographic observation conducted over a two-year period, I argue that opposition to mosques in Badalona is not reducible to anti-Muslim prejudice or fears of Islamic extremism. Rather, it is rooted in powerful associations drawn between Islam, immigration, and a series of social problems affecting the character of communal life and the quality of cherished public spaces in the city. These associations are expressed through local narratives that emphasize a sharp rupture between a glorified ethnically homogeneous past of community and solidarity, and a troublesome multicultural present fraught with social insecurity and disintegration. I show how the construction of these "rupture narratives" has entailed active memory work that minimizes the significance of prior social cleavages and conflicts, and selectively focuses on disjuncture over continuity with the past. I also highlight how these narratives have been reinforced by strong socio-spatial divisions, which have intensified contestations over public space and led to the integration of mosque disputes into broader struggles over social justice and public recognition.

TI  - A Case of Prejudice? The Uncertain Development of Collective and Certification Marks
T2  - BUSINESS HISTORY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The introduction of collective and certification marks to U.S. law in 1946 by the Lanham Act has generally been regarded as an innovative and forward-looking step. Yet these marks had been widely used by individual states since the previous century, and international conventions had long been pushing the federal government to enact measures to protect them. Indeed, it may be stranger that the U.S. trademark law of 1905 did not include protection for such marks than that, forty years later, the Lanham Act did. In exploring why the law of 1905 failed to respond to widespread innovation, and why the Lanham Act was celebrated for fulfilling such a long-overdue obligation, this article raises questions about conventionally linear accounts of the development of trademark law and practice.

AB  - Several aspects of social psychological science shed light on how unexamined racial/ethnic biases contribute to health care disparities.
   Biases are complex but systematic, differing by racial/ethnic group and not limited to love-hate polarities. Group images on the universal social cognitive dimensions of competence and warmth determine the content of each group's overall stereotype, distinct emotional prejudices (pity, envy, disgust, pride), and discriminatory tendencies. These biases are often unconscious and occur despite the best intentions.
   Such ambivalent and automatic biases can influence medical decisions and interactions, systematically producing discrimination in health care and ultimately disparities in health. Understanding how these processes may contribute to bias in health care can help guide interventions to address racial and ethnic disparities in health.

AB  - The role of intergroup contact and ethnic identity in forming stereotypes was investigated in a military setting. The samples included 535 immigrant soldiers, serving in immigrant-only, combat, and administrative units. Participants rated their ethnic identity and their perception of in-group and out-group soldiers. Significant effects were found for unit type, ethnic identity (low vs. high), and the interaction between these variables. In-group perceptions were more positive than out-group perceptions. Interdependence is important for enhancing out-group perception and, unlike contact, buffers the negative effect of ethnic identity on out-group perception.

AB  - This article suggests that the way in to sociology may not always be through the front door. The authors demonstrate how students in a three-day campus diversity program develop a sociological imagination despite not having a formal affiliation with the sociology department. In particular, students demonstrate a move from color blindness into racial consciousness and a shift from individual prejudice into institutional privilege when understanding both diversity issues and their own personal biographies. In short, despite not knowing the phrase, they develop a sociological imagination. While the goal is not to diminish the significance of traditional sociology classrooms, the authors argue that programs like theirs may diminish resistance to learning about privilege and inequalities once students enter the classroom. Such programs may also have the benefit of attracting students to the discipline and creating a more welcoming environment for related programs and events on campus. It is one model of public sociology that other campus communities may mirror outside of the traditional classroom environment.

AB  - The expansion of British imperial warfare during the middle of the eighteenth century provided motivation and opportunity for observations on British and native forces. The nature of military medicine, with its use of regimental returns and empirical observations about mortality rates of large groups of anonymous individuals, encouraged generalizations about differences between native and European bodies. As foreign, colonial environments accentuated European deaths due to disease during war-time, and as early modern medicine advised the use of acclimatized, native labour, the physical experience of eighteenth-century colonial warfare encouraged the recruitment of native forces as menial labourers under the direction of professional British soldiers. Although not inherently racial, such practices buttressed emerging social and cultural prejudices. In contrast to the traditional focus on intellectual writings on race and science during the modern period of nineteenth-century imperialism, Charters's article examines the experience of common me-rank-and-file soldiers-during the early modern period, demonstrating the relationship between developing empirical and scientific observations and burgeoning racial theories.

AB  - The United States is a classic country of immigration that has long defined itself as having been built by successive waves of immigrants. Social scientists often speak of a multicultural or cultural pluralist 'model of integration' in the US that recognizes, sometimes even celebrates, diversity at the same time as it assumes and expects immigrants and their children to assimilate and become American. This article complicates the picture. It brings in history to show how national models of integration in the US are not stable but have changed over time. In fact, the very incorporation of earlier waves of immigrants in the past has contributed to these changes. It also considers local-level variation-that is, differences among US cities in policies as well as in widespread understandings about the integration of immigrants. Despite these complications, there are clearly ways that national models of integration matter in the US, which is the theme of the concluding section.

AB  - Majority group members often hold inconsistent attitudes and behave inconsistently toward minority group members (LaPiere, 1934). We conceptually replicated LaPiere (1934) to examine discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in two studies. As predicted, randomly selected bed-and-breakfasts were more likely to discriminate against gay male individuals when impersonally contacted (Study 1) than when personally contacted (Study 2), suggesting an attitude-behavior discrepancy. We reason that establishments were more likely to discriminate when they did not have the motivation to appear nonprejudicial, and we discuss the results in terms of the MODE model of attitude-behavioral processes.

AB  - The authors examine African American African American and White socioeconomic and infant mortality outcomes in Genesee County, Michigan, assess the stated effects of the Undoing Racism Workshop (URW) on its participants and the greater-Genesee County community, and introduce the ecological approach to the cycle of socialization as a tool to help identify sources of racially linked tension and sites for ameliorative intervention. Findings show that African Americans in Flint are geographically and socioeconomically isolated, have fewer resources to sustain health, and experience higher rates of infant mortality when compared to Whites in Flint's surrounding suburbs. Between two thirds and three fourths of URW follow-up survey respondents endorse the belief that the URW can help reduce infant mortality, and results suggest the workshop helps elicit individual and institutional/policy-related changes intended to lessen the disparity. Authors assert the URW offers a common language and framework for discussing racism as a structural phenomenon rather than merely racial prejudice within individuals.

AB  - Islamophobia is an emerging comparative concept in the social sciences. Yet there is no widely accepted definition of Islamophobia that permits systematic comparative and causal analysis. This article explores how the term Islamophobia has been deployed in public and scholarly debates, emphasizing that these discussions have taken place on multiple registers. It then draws on research on concept formation, prejudice, and analogous forms of status hierarchies to offer a usable social scientific definition of Islamophobia as indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims. The article discusses the types of indicators that are most appropriate for measuring Islamophobia as well as the benefits of concept development for enabling comparative and causal analysis.

AB  - Taking an approach from religion as a social identity and using large-scale comparative surveys in five European cities, we investigate when and how perceived discrimination is associated with religious identification and politicization among the second generation of Turkish and Moroccan Muslims. We distinguish support for political Islam from political action as distinct forms of politicization. In addition, we test the mediating role of religious identification in processes of politicization. Study 1 estimates multi-group structural equation models of support for political Islam in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden. In line with a social identity model of politicization and across nine inter-group contexts, Muslims who perceived more discrimination identified (even) more strongly as Muslims; and high Muslim identifiers were most ready to support political Islam. In support of a competing social stigma hypothesis, however, negative direct and total effects of perceived discrimination suggest predominant depoliticization. Using separate sub-samples across four inter-group contexts in Belgium, Study 2 adds political action tendencies as a distinct form of politicization. Whereas religious identification positively predicts both forms of politicization, perceived discrimination has differential effects: Muslims who perceived more discrimination were more weary of supporting political Islam, yet more ready to engage in political action to defend Islamic values. Taken together, the studies reveal that some Muslim citizens will politicize and others will depoliticize in the face of discrimination as a function of their religious identification and of prevailing forms of politicization.

AB  - This paper examines Greek writer Eugene Trivizas's 2001 crossover animal fantasy The Last Black Cat, considering the implications of using the trope of the animal both to interrogate the construction of black cats as Other and to challenge examples of prejudice, or rather the grounds of prejudice, discrimination, and scapegoating. Extended consideration is devoted to the ways in which the narrative produces black cats as the marginalised and demonised Other of both humans and other cats, while at the same time it questions the culturally established hierarchy between humans and animals, and the paradigm of animal victim. It is argued that the focus on how the human/animal relations are articulated in Trivizas's novel makes it possible to perceive both the irrationality of the ideology behind the discrimination and the beast in humankind; in others words, by using misfortunes of animals as a tool for social criticism it subverts dominant discriminatory discourses and redefines prevailing ideas of humanity.

AB  - In the light of food studies in social science, this article examines references to food, its connotations and the ways in which cultures use such phenomena to legitimate their systems of meanings and ideologies, and suggests that food in Diana Wynne Jones's Power of Three works to conjoin the concepts of self and other and as a means to negotiate and transform the familiar self and the unfamiliar other. As all living creatures must feed, in entering a different culture, one cannot avoid experiencing foods. The probable immediate reaction might be shock or dislike for the unfamiliar taste, and hence quickly it could be consigned to otherness. However, by adjusting one's taste to accept the foods, one opens the possibility of crossing the cultural boundaries constructed through the arbitrary eating habits and altering one's prejudiced presumptions. With a compounded narrative that withholds much story information, Power of Three draws on this dual nature of food to mark it as a means through which both the protagonists and the novel's readers negotiate the notions of self and other as well as cultural boundaries and differences.

AB  - Theory predicts that individuals' sexism serves to exacerbate inequality in their society's gender hierarchy. Past research, however, has provided only correlational evidence to support this hypothesis. In this study, I analyzed a large longitudinal data set that included representative data from 57 societies. Multilevel modeling showed that sexism directly predicted increases in gender inequality. This study provides the first evidence that sexist ideologies can create gender inequality within societies, and this finding suggests that sexism not only legitimizes the societal status quo, but also actively enhances the severity of the gender hierarchy. Three potential mechanisms for this effect are discussed briefly.

AB  - Psychologists' attempts to define and measure religion reveal substantial variability, a lack of consensus, cultural variation and differences between religions. A discursive psychology approach can address variability in meanings and the inferential issues that may inform claims to be religious. This paper identifies strategies used by Syrian Muslims and Christians to affirm, reformulate or deny religiousness. The analysis is based on a corpus of data generated through semi-structured interviews with 158 men and women. It shows how some speakers affirm that they are religious and treat this as a non-accountable matter. When asked to describe the basis of being religious, they produced descriptions of their own practices or a set of general criteria. Other speakers denied or modified 'being religious', using an 'x but not y' formulation to reject one meaning (for example, conformist) in favour of another (for example, believer). Some speakers' self-ascriptions were reinforced by characterizing their own views of religion as morals and good behaviour. Thus speakers deploy multiple meanings of religion for different purposes. Moreover their accounts address inferential and interpersonal problems that arise when claiming to be religious: specifically that others may infer extremism or conformity, or prejudice against members of other religions. The implications of these observations for social psychological studies of religion are discussed. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The integration of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals into the U. S. military is a long-standing and politically and socially divisive issue. Exclusionary and pseudo-inclusionary policies that restrict openly LGB individuals from military service are also of long duration. Yet LGB servicemembers have continued to serve covertly in the military for many decades. Moreover, political issues and social conventions associated with "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" (DADT) have diverted focus from imperative research issues, such as LGB servicemembers and incidents of victimization in the military. Research is reviewed to evaluate such victimization, which is conceptualized as resulting from a convergence of sexual stigma, conservative gender role beliefs, and sexual prejudice. DADT, in combination with overarching difficulties intrinsic to sexual orientation research, serves to augment LGB victimization and reduce victim reports and help seeking. Consequently, there is a deficient evidence base for assisting LGB servicemembers and for advancing research, prevention efforts, and policy changes. Implications of repealing DADT are discussed, as are future directions for LGB military research.

AB  - The acid test of phenotyping is that it leads either to a clinically useful or mechanistically important insight. Phenotypes may change over time, but the exact definition of a phenotype shift is unclear. Methods of phenotyping are either investigator driven, in which a priori prejudices are applied to the data, or (semi) objective, in which mathematical techniques or systems biology approaches are applied to the dataset. However, the composition of the dataset is driven by investigator prejudice. Phenotyping is likely most useful in severe asthma, because mild and moderate asthma responds to simple treatments, and no great subtlety is required. Our non-evidence based approach is to define the subpopulation of genuine severe, therapy-resistant asthmatics from the generality of problematic severe asthma. We then investigate them invasively with bronchoscopy and a steroid trial using intramuscular triamcinolone to determine the nature of any inflammatory process; whether inflammation and symptoms are concordant or discordant; whether the inflammatory process is steroid resistant or sensitive; and whether the child has persistent airflow limitation. Other possibly relevant phenotypes include the child with severe exacerbations; brittle asthma; and severe asthma with fungal sensitization. Severe, therapy resistant asthma is a disparate disease, and only international uniform approaches, carefully characterising the children as a prelude to focussed clinical trials will allow progress to be made, and vindicate (or otherwise) our suggested approach.

AB  - We review 50-odd years of research on Allport's (1954) 'contact hypothesis', to assess progress, problems, and prospects. We chart the progress that has been made in understanding two distinct forms of contact: direct and indirect. We highlight the progress made in understanding the effects of each type of contact, as well as both moderating and mediating factors, and emphasize the multiple impacts of direct contact, especially. We then consider some of the main critiques of inter-group contact, focusing on empirical issues and whether contact impedes social change, and provide a research agenda for the coming years. We conclude that this body of work no longer merits the modest title of 'hypothesis', but fully deserves acknowledgement as an integrated and influential theory.

AB  - Despite legislative attempts to eliminate gender stereotyping from society, the propensity to evaluate people on the basis of their sex remains a pernicious social problem. Noting the critical interplay between cultural and cognitive factors in the establishment of stereotypical beliefs, the current investigation explored the extent to which culturally transmitted colour gender associations (i.e., pink is for girls, blue is for boys) set the stage for the automatic activation and expression of gender stereotypes. Across six experiments, the results demonstrated that (1) consumer choice for children's goods is dominated by gender-stereotyped colours (Experiment I); (2) colour-based stereotypic associations guide young children's behaviour (Experiment 2); (3) colour gender associations automatically activate associated stereotypes in adulthood (Experiments 3-5); and (4) colour-based stereotypic associations bias impressions of male and female targets (Experiment 6). These findings indicate that, despite prohibitions against stereotyping, seemingly innocuous societal practices may continue to promote this mode of thought.

AB  - The article describes the newly developed Teacher Cultural Beliefs Scale (TCBS). The TCBS assesses multicultural and egalitarian beliefs about diversity, both of which reflect favorable attitudes toward immigrant students, but differ with regard to how cultural diversity is believed to be best accommodated in schools. Results from a first study with 433 beginning teachers supported the two-factor structure and the measurement invariance of the scale. Results from a second study with 340 teacher candidates and educational science students showed that proponents of multiculturalism and egalitarianism shared a motivation to control prejudiced reactions, but that they differed in their views on acculturation, prejudices, and authoritarianism.

AB  - CONTEXT Non-conscious stereotyping and prejudice contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Contemporary training in cultural competence is insufficient to reduce these problems because even educated, culturally sensitive, egalitarian individuals can activate and use their biases without being aware they are doing so. However, these problems can be reduced by workshops and learning modules that focus on the psychology of non-conscious bias.
   THE PSYCHOLOGY OF NON-CONSCIOUS BIAS Research in social psychology shows that over time stereotypes and prejudices become invisible to those who rely on them. Automatic categorisation of an individual as a member of a social group can unconsciously trigger the thoughts (stereotypes) and feelings (prejudices) associated with that group, even if these reactions are explicitly denied and rejected. This implies that, when activated, implicit negative attitudes and stereotypes shape how medical professionals evaluate and interact with minority group patients. This creates differential diagnosis and treatment, makes minority group patients uncomfortable and discourages them from seeking or complying with treatment.
   PITFALLS IN CULTURAL COMPETENCE TRAINING Cultural competence training involves teaching students to use race and ethnicity to diagnose and treat minority group patients, but to avoid stereotyping them by over-generalising cultural knowledge to individuals. However, the Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) standards do not specify how these goals should be accomplished and psychological research shows that common approaches like stereotype suppression are ineffective for reducing non-conscious bias. To effectively address bias in health care, training in cultural competence should incorporate research on the psychology of non-conscious stereotyping and prejudice.
   TRAINING IN IMPLICIT BIAS ENHANCES CULTURAL COMPETENCE Workshops or other learning modules that help medical professionals learn about non-conscious processes can provide them with skills that reduce bias when they interact with minority group patients. Examples of such skills in action include automatically activating egalitarian goals, looking for common identities and counter-stereotypical information, and taking the perspective of the minority group patient.

AB  - This paper deals with the depiction of cultural and national otherness in Harry Potter. It analyses the presentation and connotation of cultural and national otherness in the novels, its aims and main characteristics, and highlights how otherness as a social and ideological construct is used to create a certain social order within the Hogwarts universe. Rowling has been praised widely for her supposed multicultural worldview and her support of NGO-like structures fighting for equal treatment and human rights. On the surface, the Harry Potter novels do indeed strike a light for multiculturalism, racial harmony and emancipation. As this paper will demonstrate, however, the underlying worldview of the novels is an imperial and racial biological one: despite the claims of many critics that Rowling's works are multicultural and anti-racist, the hidden discourse of the novels supports and perpetuates racial and xenophobic prejudice.

AB  - Aim. The study aimed to describe how patients with epilepsy perceive living with epilepsy.
   Background. Epilepsy signifies a medical diagnosis as well as a social label. Persons living with epilepsy have more psychosocial problems compared with the general population, and stigma is often experienced. Few studies address patients' life situations as a whole, and there are no studies on how patients perceive living with epilepsy.
   Design. This was a qualitative interview study where 19 outpatients were purposively chosen and interviewed.
   Method. A phenomenographic approach was used for interviewing and for analysing the interviews.
   Results. Living with epilepsy was perceived in two different ways depending on the person's feelings towards the condition. A positive feeling signified 'Living with epilepsy means living a normal life - gaining and maintaining control' with the descriptive categories: 'Accepting the person with epilepsy', 'Taking responsibility' and 'Appreciating the good things'. A negative feeling signified 'Living with epilepsy means living with focus on the condition - conflict and avoidance or resigning to fate' with the descriptive categories: 'Struggling with feelings of stigma, prejudices and loss of control' and 'Giving up hope of recovery, accepting loss of control'.
   Conclusion. The findings indicate that patients' perceptions of living with epilepsy are closely related to their feelings towards the condition. There is a need for further exploration of the relationship between perceptions of epilepsy as a phenomenon, perceptions of living with epilepsy and feelings related to the condition.
   Relevance to clinical practice. The findings demonstrated how important feelings and perceptions are to how patients with epilepsy regard themselves. This knowledge is essential for nurses when helping patients to better understand underlying reasons for their reactions to various situations. Forming interventions to help patients with epilepsy to find coping strategies that enhance self-esteem and self-value is another area of relevance.

KW  - Faucher
KW  - Machery
AB  - I here respond to several points in Faucher and Machery's vigorous and informative critique of my volitional account of racism (VAR). First, although the authors deem it a form of "implicit racial bias," a mere tendency to associate black people with "negative" concepts falls short of racial "bias" or prejudice in the relevant sense. Second, such an associative disposition need not even be morally objectionable. Third, even for more substantial forms of implicit racial bias such as race-based fear or disgust, Faucher and Machery offer no account or explanation of when we should consider these racist, in whom, in what respect(s), or why. So, findings of implicit racial bias pose no clear objection to VAR. Fourth, because VAR allows not only racial hate, but also callous indifference, disdain, and other forms of racially driven disregard, to be racist,VAR is not "psychologically monist." Fifth, as VAR allows racist attitudes to be immoral in more than one way, offending against both the moral virtues of benevolence and justice, VAR is not "morally monist" either. I also reveal problems with some of Faucher and Machery's other claims: Faucher and Machery take too narrow a conception of the types of psychology that can contribute to understanding racism; the internal complexity of hatred, which they approvingly mention, is irrelevant to VAR's truth and undermines part of their criticism of VAR; whether some forms of racial bias are "racial ills" is irrelevant to VAR, which only analyzes racism; over-attention to implicit racial bias may cloak or exacerbate some of our society's racial ills, or even constitute a new one. I conclude by noting that Faucher and Machery are not just critics of VAR but also allies of VAR in important controversies against those who insist racism lies primarily in social structures and institutions.

AB  - Minority populations have remained in relatively poor health compared to the majority population and continue to be underserved by the health care system. Racial and ethnic health disparities are not new phenomena. Understanding the causes of these disparities continues to evolve. Within the past decade researchers have looked more toward social determinants of health to explain the differences. The Institute of Medicine (TOM) report Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care provided documentation to shift the discussion from patient behaviors to the contributions of health care systems, including health care providers, that contribute to health disparities. The report was the first comprehensive study that documented racial and ethnic inequities within the US health care delivery system (ie, differential treatment on the basis of race and ethnicity). The authors of the IOM report indicated that they found some evidence to suggest that bias, prejudice, and stereotyping by providers may contribute to differences in care. It is possible that food and nutrition practitioners have the same biases and are presented with the same systems challenges as the health care providers referenced in the TOM report. It is, therefore, also possible that food and nutrition practitioners may be at risk of contributing to health disparities. This article provides an in-depth look at the recommendations put forth by the IOM, offers discipline-specific recommendations consistent with those outlined in the TOM model, and introduces other models that may be of use as food and nutrition practitioners move forward with developing strategies to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities.

It is about the need to develop trust within diverse groups, so that students can learn from each others' differences, confront their own assumptions and biases and prepare for engaged citizenship. To address the affective dimensions of this pedagogical work, this article synthesizes educational research on the impact of diversity, social science research on the impact of trust, and psychoanalytic literature on how we respond to and negotiate difference.

T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The revolutionary events sweeping North Africa and the Middle East, called the 'Arab Spring', are of great historic significance. They challenge not only political and social realities in those countries; they confront us, the spectators to these momentous events with serious questions about our own political, cultural and theological perceptions, concepts and prejudices. This article probes, from a Black Liberation theology point of view, these events at several levels: (1) what are the connections between the 'Arab Spring' and the two other historic movements for social change, the Civil Rights struggle in the United States of America, and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa; (2) what lessons are to be learnt from these events?; (3) the article revisits the question of M. M. Thomas, in terms of whether God is at work in events of social upheaval and revolutionary change, and if so, 'how?'; and (4) what is the meaning and consequences of international, and more importantly, inter-religious solidarity with the people of those regions? The article discusses the meaning, complexity and efficacy of nonviolence and choices for violence or nonviolence in such situations of conflict and the questions these raise for theological reflection, prophetic action and Christian integrity.

AB  - The Indian government provides free antiretroviral treatment (ART) for people living with HIV. To assist in developing policies and programs to advance equity in ART access, we explored barriers to ART access among kothis (men who have sex with men [MSM] whose gender expression is feminine) and aravanis (transgender women, also known as hijras) living with HIV in Chennai. In the last quarter of 2007, we conducted six focus groups and four key-informant interviews. Data were explored using framework analysis to identify categories and derive themes. We identified barriers to ART access at the family/social-level, health care system-level, and individual-level; however, we found these barriers to be highly interrelated. The primary individual-level barrier was integrally linked to the family/social and health care levels: many kothis and aravanis feared serious adverse consequences if their HIV-positive status were revealed to others. Strong motivations to keep one's HIV-positive status and same-sex attraction secret were interconnected with sexual prejudice against MSM and transgenders, and HIV stigma prevalent in families, the health care system, and the larger society. HIV stigma was present within kothi and aravani communities as well. Consequences of disclosure, including rejection by family, eviction from home, social isolation, loss of subsistence income, and maltreatment (although improving) within the health care system, presented powerful disincentives to accessing ART. Given the multi-level barriers to ART access related to stigma and discrimination, interventions to facilitate ART uptake should address multiple constituencies: the general public, health care providers, and the kothi and aravani communities. India needs a national policy and action plan to address barriers to ART access at family/social, health care system, and individual levels for aravanis, kothis, other subgroups of MSM and other marginalized groups.

AB  - To explore the theory that some men experience antigay bias because of a defensive reaction to uncertainties surrounding their own sexuality (cf. Herek, 1987), we conducted a study (n = 132 men) in which we physiologically measured the affective underpinnings of antigay bias while individuals with different levels of self-reported bias viewed sexually explicit material. Those higher in antigay bias exhibited less positive affect than did others, but did not appear to experience a defensive reaction. Given these results, combined with those of our previous studies, we conclude that evidence for the existence of a group of men who exhibit antigay bias because of a hidden or unconscious attraction toward men is difficult to demonstrate using current methodology.

AB  - Background: This study is the first to explore the relations between attachment styles, ageism, and quality of life (QoL) among elderly people. The attachment theory describes how human beings relate to each other, according to their attachment style. Previous studies have examined the connection between attachment styles and prejudice toward distinctive social groups and minorities. Ageism as a form of prejudice is a way of relating negatively to people because they are old. QoL among the elderly was found to be associated with negative age-perceptions. It was therefore hypothesized that QoL, attachments styles, and demographic characteristics can explain ageism among the elderly.
   Methods: Four questionnaires were administered: Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA), which comprises four scales (separation, affective, stereotype, and intergeneration); Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, which measures four attachment styles (secure, dismissive, fearful, and preoccupied); SF-36 health status inventory (eight scales); and sociodemographic questions. Ninety-four elderly men and women aged 64-85 years living in the community completed the questionnaires.
   Results: MANCOVAS indicated that securely attached individuals score higher on separation than fearfully attached individuals, and that securely and dismissively attached individuals score higher than fearful and preoccupied individuals on seven QoL scales. Multiple regression analyses showed that attachment styles, age, gender, and some QoL scales contribute to the explained variance of ageism.
   Conclusions: Secure attachment in late life seems to be related to less ageism and a better QoL. The enhancement of a secure attachment base in elderly people may assist in moderating ageism and improving older people's QoL.

AB  - Public stigma robs people with mental illnesses from rightful opportunities related to work and other important life goals. Advocates have developed anti-stigma programs meant to address the prejudice and discrimination associated with these conditions. Evidence is now needed to make sense of program impact; this paper looks at measurement issues related to stigma change. Community-based participatory research is central to this research and includes the involvement of a diverse collection of stakeholders in all phases of evaluation. Investigators should be cautious about measures vis-a-vis social desirability effects and should directed by social validity of targeted audiences. Conceptual domains with some research support that correspond with assessments include behavior, penetration, psychological perspective, knowledge, and physiological/information processes. These issues are summarized as ten recommendations for evaluation of anti-stigma programs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To qualitatively assess the influence of patient-provider communication on contraceptive choice among HIV-positive women in the context of universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) access.
   Methods: Focus group discussions (FGD; n = 3), in-depth (IDI; n = 15) and freelist interviews (FLI; n = 36) were conducted with HIV-positive women aged 18-40 years recruited from public health units in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil.
   Results: Of 70 participants, 49 used ART and the median time since HIV diagnosis was 6 years (range: 1-18). The majority of participants (71.4%) reported some degree of dissatisfaction with their health providers (usually lack of open dialogue) and a few reported experiences of stigma/prejudice during appointments. Intra, interpersonal and social factors modulated behaviors and reproductive health decisions, and those issues were rarely addressed by providers during HIV clinical care.
   Conclusion: Despite dramatic increases in survival and life quality after universal ART implementation in Brazil, reproductive health issues are neglected by multiple cadres of HIV health providers. Communication on reproductive health issues remains fragmented and potentially contradictory, compromising care in these settings.
   Practice implications: Adequate provider training to address reproductive health-related issues in a comprehensive, culturally sensitive manner and improved integration of HIV and reproductive health care are urgently needed in this setting. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Physical cleanliness has many medical benefits, such as protection from the dangers of contagion. We explore a potential unintended consequence of cleanliness. Given the metaphorical association between physical cleanliness and moral purity (Zhong & Liljenquist, 2006), we contend that a clean self may also be linked to a virtuous self. This enhanced moral self-perception can in turn license harsher moral judgment. Three experiments found that cleanliness, whether induced via physical cleansing or through a visualization task, licensed severe judgment on morally contested issues such as abortion and pornography. Further, we found that an inflated moral self mediated the relationship between cleanliness and moral judgment. These results provide unique insight to the social significance of cleanliness and may have important implications for discrimination and prejudice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present research examines how romantic relationship experience and age predict ambivalent sexism in adolescents. We measured sexist beliefs and romantic relationship experience in a large sample of Spanish adolescents (N = 1447), ranging from 12 to 19 years of age. Consistent with prior research, age predicted less sexist beliefs. Controlling for the effects of age, relationship experience predicted increased hostile sexism in girls and increased benevolent sexism in boys. Additionally, younger boys (12-14 years) with greater relationship experience tended to endorse hostile sexism more strongly. The general decline in sexism over the course of adolescence masks a contrasting effect of romantic experience, which suggests that heterosexual adolescents' desire to attract romantic partners may foster, rather than reduce, sexism.

T2  - CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA  - English
KW  - POLITICAL CORRUPTION
KW  - DEMOCRACY
AB  - In recent years, comparative corruption analysis has been fuelled by the growth of international survey data on related perceptions. Taking issue with the typological vein of such analysis, this article questions both the treatment of perceptions indices and the validity and pertinence of variables used to explain them. It is argued that perceptions are conflated with practice, whilst explanatory variables appear ungrounded in empirical reality. These limitations serve to reinforce expectations that corruption is a menace to be associated primarily with societies of the global periphery. Drawing on the supposedly paradigmatic case of Britain, the article suggests that the problem of bias in comparative scholarship is compounded by three factors: the failure of comparative and domestic-focused literatures to engage with one another in sufficient depth; the relative lack of qualitative research into corruption within core Western states; and the neglect of power in the study of perceptions and practices at comparative and domestic-focused levels of analysis.

AB  - We conducted 2 studies to examine student athletes' intentions to enter the coaching profession. In Study 1, participants responded to a questionnaire designed to assess the major constructs from social cognitive career theory. Results indicate that although racial minorities, relative to Whites, expected more positive outcomes with being a coach and had greater intentions to pursue that profession, they also anticipated more barriers associated with coaching. To clarify this relationship, we conducted a focus group interview (Study 2) with 6 male athletes of color. Participants indicated that prejudice and discrimination were expected across their potential vocational choices, not just coaching. Thus, given the many positives associated with coaching, they preferred to encounter those barriers in the coaching context.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the perceptions and attitudes of health professionals toward violence against women in intimate relationships, and to discuss them as opportunities and barriers for improving health professionals' response.
   Methods: Six focus groups were conducted with 71 health professionals employed in the public primary health care centers in Belgrade (Serbia). The data were analyzed according to the direct approach of the qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Findings suggest that the majority of health professionals perceive IPV as an unjustifiable act. They showed an understanding for women; see their role as providing support to women and collaborating with other institutions. They are willing to help, but do not know how. However, some health professionals appeared to be judgmental in terms of what preceded violence, and would insist on extracting a woman's disclosure that violence had occurred. As barriers, they emphasized the lack of training and specific education on IPV, a weak support network, and overall social insecurity.
   Conclusion: There is a gap between health professionals' willingness to help and resources needed, along with prejudice and interrogative attitudes. Barriers appeared at individual, organizational and societal levels.
   Practice implications: Proper education and protocols are priorities in strengthening health professionals' response to IPV. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 4 experiments anxious uncertainty threats caused reactive approach motivation (RAM). In Studies 1 and 2, academic anxious uncertainty threats caused RAM as assessed by behavioral neuroscience and implicit measures of approach motivation. In Study 3 the effect of a relational anxious uncertainty threat on approach-motivated personal projects in participants' everyday lives was mediated by the idealism of those projects. In Study 4 the effect of a different relational anxious uncertainty threat on implicit approach motivation was heightened by manipulated salience of personal ideals. Results suggest a RAM account for idealistic and ideological reactions in the threat and defense literature. Speculative implications are suggested for understanding diverse social and clinical phenomena ranging from worldview defense, prejudice, and meaning making to narcissism, hypomania, and aggression.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive archival examination of FTSE 100 companies in the period 2001-2005, focusing on the relationship between the presence of women on company boards and both accountancy-based and stock-based measures of company performance. Consistent with work by Adams, Gupta and Leeth this analysis reveals that there was no relationship between women's presence on boards and 'objective' accountancy-based measures of performance (return on assets, return on equity). However, consistent with 'glass cliff' research there was a negative relationship between women's presence on boards and 'subjective' stock-based measures of performance. Companies with male-only boards enjoyed a valuation premium of 37% relative to firms with a woman on their board. Results support claims that women are found on the boards of companies that are perceived to be performing poorly and that their presence on boards can lead to the devaluation of companies by investors. Yet the findings also indicate that perceptions and investment are not aligned with the underlying realities of company performance.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Between the World Wars, public transportation in Northern cities like Chicago and New York allowed African Americans, many of them newly migrated from the South, to contest geographical and bodily boundaries. Attention to the public, liminal space of subways and streetcars complicates scholarly understanding of black mobility that typically centers on restrictive residential covenants. While covenants did confine African Americans to living in delimited black belts, the necessities of work or school and the gratification of leisure activities often led to interracial contact on public transportation outside black neighborhoods. Once on public transportation, the close proximity of white and black bodies both fueled and challenged prejudices that marked African Americans as loci of disease and violence; subways and streetcars were spaces for African Americans to enact and police standards of respectability within their own community. Mobility that offered both promise and peril in the interwar years also inspired aesthetic reflection on the modern black urban experience by writers like Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, and Ralph Ellison.

KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - We investigated whether increases in tattooing rates and designs have eradicated or altered traditional delinquent tattooing stereotypes. We tested the perceived suitability of tattooed and non-tattooed individuals for 2 different jobs. Affective evaluations mediated judgments of job suitability, with those displaying traditional tattoos being rated as less suitable for employment than those who were not tattooed and those displaying contemporary tattoos. Those with a contemporary tattoo were judged in the same manner as those who were not tattooed (even by observers who neither had a tattoo nor were considering getting one). These results suggest that the savage associations of tattooing continue for some, but suggest that for other tattoo enthusiasts, a new stereotype has emerged reflecting a shift toward respectability.

AB  - This article describes the population participating in the LGBT Pride Parade in Santiago, Chile, from discrimination and victimization standpoints. The sample consisted of 488 subjects older than 18 years (M = 25.1), who were interviewed during the 2007 event. For this purpose, a questionnaire from the Latin American Centre of Sexuality and Human Rights (CLAM) was adapted and administered. Approximately 35% of respondents reported having experimented school, religious, or neighborhood discrimination. The more discriminated are transgender people. Approximately three fourths of respondents reported experiencing ridicule and almost 60% reported experiencing insults or threats. Transgender were significantly more likely than gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals to experience discrimination or victimization events. Finally, the parade acquired an important social and political character in the context of a clearly homophobic society.

AB  - The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a popular means of examining "hidden" biases. However, some express concerns about classroom use of the IAT, citing students' potentially negative affective reactions to taking the IAT and discovering their implicit biases. To investigate the validity of this criticism, 35 social psychology students completed affect measures after taking and discussing the Race IAT. Students reported more positive than negative affect both immediately after taking the IAT and 1 week later. They also reported greater awareness of their own and others' implicit racial biases, knowledge of implicit processes, and perceived value of the IAT demonstration.

AB  - We argue that attitudes about immigration can be better understood by paying closer attention to the various ways in which national group boundaries are demarcated. We describe two related lines of work that address this. The first deals with national group definitions and, based on evidence from studies carried out in England and analyses of international survey data, argues that the relationship between national identification and prejudice toward immigrants is contingent on the extent to which ethnic or civic definitions of nationality are endorsed. The second, which uses European survey data, examines support for ascribed and acquired criteria that can be applied when determining who is permitted to migrate to one's country, and the various forms of national and individual threat that affect support for these criteria. We explain how the research benefits from a multilevel approach and also suggest how these findings relate to some current policy debates.

AB  - Although many scholars point to the importance of gender in structuring the immigrant experience, many immigrant women themselves do not attribute much importance to the role that gender plays in their lives. To explore this issue further, we investigate how thirty-two foreign-born Latinas define their experiences in Utah, a new immigrant destination that has received little empirical attention. The women in our sample indicated five major challenges they faced in their everyday lives: social isolation, language difficulty, racial-ethnic prejudice, poverty and lack of documentation. Most of the women described these challenges in terms of social class, race-ethnicity and immigrant status, rather than gender. We argue that migration research needs to be more attuned to axes of oppression other than gender and more attentive to how immigrant women, themselves, interpret their everyday lives.

AB  - This article problematises the concept of 'Africanisation' as a response to colonial conquest and apartheid rule, bearing both political and knowledge consequences. It aims to rescue 'Africanisation' from essentialist notions, but at the same time to show how paradigms cannot be simply applied where they derive from quite different experiences. The article introduces modes of differentiating concepts that are dynamic, as opposed to static, singular and unmediated meanings that bedevil any emancipatory project. The tendency to see a moment in the life of a concept as having a settled and finalised meaning renders the qualities of democracy, and other similar liberating concepts, as settled though their meaning is never finally realised. While colonialism marginalised and devalued local knowledges, the national liberation project sought unity/homogenisation, which tended to deny distinct identities, as is largely the case today. There remains hostility to pluralism at a social and political level and a failure to recognise autonomous identities unconnected to the state or the ruling organisation, the African National Congress (ANC). The tendency towards static notions of custom and paradigms that do not derive from the experiences of African women, in particular, has tended to erase the voices of women or prejudice the emancipation of women from patriarchal oppression. Africanisation, the article proposes, must be located through an ongoing dialogue between dynamic local knowledges and a range of other explanatory tools.

AB  - Yuval-Davis discusses three interconnected questions relating to identity. She first examines whether and in what ways the notion of identity should be theorized, on the one hand, and empirically researched, on the other, focusing on the opposing views of Stuart Hall and Robin Williams. She then examines the contested question of what is identity, positioning it in relation to notions of belonging and the politics of belonging, and in relation to several influential schools of thought, especially those that construct identity as a mode of narrative, as a mode of performativity or as a dialogical practice. Her third interrelated question concerns the boundaries of identity and the relationship between self and non-self. She explores both social psychological and psychoanalytical approaches to that question, and deals with questions such as reflexivity, identifications and forced identities. The last part of the article explores several types of relationships between self and non-self, such as: 'me' and 'us'; 'me/us' and 'them'; 'me' and other 'others'; 'me' and the transversal 'us/them'. Yuval-Davis's basic argument here is that dichotomous notions of identity and difference, when theorizing boundaries of individual and collective identities, are more misleading than explanatory.

AB  - Racial discrimination takes many forms and so does opposition to it. In contrast to the dominant emphasis on institutional or state efforts to counter racism, we examine how members of racially minoritized groups resist racism in their everyday lives. Drawing on forty-one qualitative interviews with young, mainly Black, people in Norway, we identify five distinct ways in which they actively counter racism, as opposed to passively accepting or adapting to it. Participants resisted racism by ignoring, confronting, sharing experiences about, reporting and protesting it. Our analysis explicates the characteristics, potential outcomes and social function of such resistance to racism. The study contributes to the literature on everyday racism and antiracism by making it evident how those at the receiving end negotiate and actively oppose racist experiences.

AB  - The aim was to assess the feasibility of an intervention to reduce stigma among primary care and community healthcare staff in Beijing, China through a contact-based education intervention.
   Participants were randomly assigned to: (i) "education only" group, a lecture-based education; or (ii) "education and contact" group, lectures plus contact with people with lived experience of mental illness. Each participant completed an assessment of mental health stigma related: knowledge (mental health knowledge schedule, MAKS); attitudes (mental illness: clinicians' attitudes scale, MICA-4); and behavior (reported and intended behavior scale, RIBS) before and after the intervention, with follow up at 1 month and 3 months after the intervention.
   A total of 121 healthcare staff were recruited. Both "education only" group and "education and contact" group showed improved knowledge after the intervention, MAKS scores increased by 1.77 +/- 3.15 VS 2.46 +/- 2.49 (both p < 0.001), respectively. There was no between-group difference in MAKS score. The "education and contact" group showed a significantly greater improvement for MICA and RIBS score than the "education only" group: the MICA score decreased by 4.43 +/- 9.42 VS 8.41 +/- 7.48 (p = 0.027), and the RIBS score increased by 2.28 +/- 3.89 VS 4.57 +/- 3.53 (p = 0.003), in the "education only" and the "education and contact" groups respectively, but the between group differences disappeared at 1 month and 3 months follow-up points. The positive effects on stigma levels (knowledge, attitudes and behaviours) in both groups were sustained at 3 months.
   The intervention to reduce stigma among the primary and community healthcare staff through a contact-based education intervention was feasible in Beijing.

AB  - BackgroundThe job placement of persons with disability is often threatened by prejudices and stereotypes; even when they are employed, they have less qualified and less paid jobs. The aim of this study was to investigate the self-perceived employability in a sample of workers with disability, hypothesizing to find a good level of self-determination and positive meaning of work. Materials and MethodsTen semi-structured interviews have been conducted, applying a mix-method to the data analysis through qualitative interpretation and quantitative content analysis. Results confirmed what recent literature shows about the need for job inclusiveness for persons with disability and also underlined a profound sense of satisfaction related to the job, strong identity, and empowerment derived from the job involvement. ConclusionPractical implications are related to the job design procedure inspired by diversity management, in order to pay attention to every single diversity and ensure equity and inclusion.

AB  - People often form impressions of others in contexts where both relatively static demographic cues (e.g., age, race, gender) and situationally flexible, dynamic cues (e.g., emotion expressions) are available. We examined whether and how attending to gender (male, female) versus emotion expression (neutral, smiling) affects threat-based person impressions. In three experiments, we heightened the salience of either gender categories or emotion categories in a sequential priming task. Category salience consistently moderated the use of both categories in threat impressions. The effect of gender (emotion) categories was stronger when attention was directed to gender (emotion) than when attention was directed to emotion (gender); however, category salience did not eliminate the use of either category. Implications for models of person construal and bias in person impressions are discussed.

AB  - Recent research suggests presumptions about atheists' uncommitted mating strategy causes atheists to seem less trustworthy, and that people who are more religious or espouse less agreeable attitudes toward uncommitted mating (i.e., more restricted sociosexual attitudes) tend to harbor greater anti-atheist attitudes. We provided additional tests of these ideas and addressed whether they could extend to discrimination against atheists in a "high-trust domain:" likelihood of granting approval to marry one's adult child. An MTurk sample of U.S. parents (N = 301) self-reported their religiosity and sociosexual attitudes, then were randomly assigned to a condition wherein they read about their adult child's fiance who was either depicted as an atheist or devoted Christian. Participants reported their likelihood of approving of their child marrying the fiance and estimated the fiance's committed mating strategy, trustworthiness, and dark personality characteristics. Participants with high religiosity presumed an atheist (vs. devoted Christian) fiance endorsed a less committed mating strategy, which, apart from presumptions about the fiance's standing on dark personality characteristics, was associated with (a) perceiving the atheist as less trustworthy and (b) indicating less approval for their child marrying an atheist. Broadly, the research extends theorizing on how atheism relates to perceived threats to moral values and discrimination.

AB  - Purpose Physically less attractive job applicants are discriminated against in hiring decisions. In a US context, the authors tested whether appearance-altering photo-filters can exploit this bias, focusing on the moderating role of job type, gender and race as well the mediating role of two major dimensions of person perception (warmth and competence). Design/methodology/approach In study 1, 223 managers evaluated White mock applicants presented with or without a beautifying filter for either a position as a social worker or an IT specialist. In study 2, 212 managers evaluated Black and White mock applicants with or without beautifying filters for an HR specialist position. Findings In study 1, beautifying filters increased perceived hireability irrespective of job type, but especially when applicants were female. Both male and female applicants whose photos were filtered were perceived as more competent, but only male applicants were perceived as warmer. In study 2, beautifying filters increased the hireability only slightly for White female applicants, followed by White and Black male applicants but substantially for Black female applicants. The filters increased the perceived competence of Black (and especially Black female) applicants but not of White applicants and increased the perceived warmth of all groups except for White females. Warmth and competence partially mediated the observed effects on hireability in both studies. Originality/value In the context of widely available technological advances, the authors show that beautifying photo-filters can exploit attractiveness biases, at least at an early hiring stage. The results emphasize the importance of intersecting factors such as gender and race.

AB  - This study examines how serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) affects individuals' attitudes toward immigrants. Several hypotheses were developed based on intergroup contact theory. An online survey was filled out by 1,290 undergraduate students taking classes at a state university in Utah. Multivariate analyses yielded several findings. First, those who have served an LDS mission hold a more positive attitude toward immigrants than other individuals. Second, missionaries serving in some mission fields hold a more positive attitude toward immigrants than their counterparts, including those who needed to learn and speak a new language during their mission, those who served the mission in Latin America, those who received help from people of other countries during their mission, and those serving in places with either a lower or similar living standard. Surprisingly, being a victim of violence from people of other countries during the mission did not exert a significant impact on respondents' attitudes toward immigrants.

AB  - A recent evolutionary theory of female sexual fluidity suggests that women do not have sexual orientations in the same sense that men do, and instead women's apparent sexual orientation is a function of their sociosexual orientation. Among other things, the theory predicts that women's unrestricted sociosexual orientation decreases their negative attitude toward same-sex behavior, whereas men's unrestricted sociosexual orientation increases it. An analysis of the General Social Surveys data shows that, net of age, education, race, religion, religiosity, political attitude, intelligence, urbanicity and region of residence, and survey year, sociosexually unrestricted women are less likely to believe homosexual relationships are always morally wrong, while sociosexuality was not associated with homophobia among men. The study provides further evidence for the evolutionary theory of female sexual fluidity.

AB  - The world's population is currently aging, and the issue of ageism has become serious worldwide, including in Japan. Negative attitudes toward older adults can have undesirable effects on the mental and physical health of this group. We focused on the effects of contact experience with older adults and germ aversion, or the degree of aversion to infection, on negative attitudes toward older adults. Additionally, we included a moderating variable; youth identity, or the sense of belonging with younger rather than older age groups. An online survey was conducted with Japanese participants (N = 603). We conducted multiple regression analyses and the results showed that the interaction effect between youth identity and contact experience on negative attitudes toward older adults was significant. The findings suggest that contact experience may help in reducing negative attitudes toward older adults among people with low youth identity. The interaction effect between youth identity and germ aversion, however, was not significant. Academic research on the effects of some psychological interventions (e.g., intergenerational social exchange) should pay particular attention to the role of youth identity. Future directions for empirical studies are also discussed.

AB  - Fusing social psychological theory on the BIAS map and attributions with cross-cultural theory on organizational tightness-looseness, we examine the interactive effects of active/passive facilitation/harm by organizational members and perceptions of organizational tightness on employee job attitudes. Study hypotheses were tested using a sample of bank employees located across 26 branches of a large bank in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (N = 324). Using a norm-behavior alignment perspective, we hypothesized that (supportive) active facilitation behaviors would be more strongly related to employee attitudes in tight versus loose perceived organizational cultures, whereas (negative) passive facilitation, active harm, and passive harm behaviors would be less strongly related to employee attitudes in tight versus loose perceived organizational cultures. Results provided overall support for these expectations. The present findings have implications for the mitigation of the effects of unfair discrimination on employee attitudes in organizational contexts, theorized associations between cultural T-L and unfair discrimination, and the generalizability of cultural T-L theory to developing country contexts that are typified by collectivistic and tight societal cultures.

AB  - In our current globalised, multicultural world, understanding antecedents of reciprocal interactions between native people and people of immigrant background is a major issue, because intergroup contact plays a crucial role in building inclusive societies. In this vein, using daily diary data, we examined the relation between the number of daily positive and negative interactions of White British majority (N = 744) and Asian British minority people (N = 582) with members of the respective outgroup, with RWA, SDO, perceived ingroup norms, neighbourhood diversity and contextual deprivation. Results showed that for the majority group, ingroup norms in favour of intergroup contact were positively associated with positive intergroup encounters, whereas Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) was positively associated with negative intergroup contact. Neighbourhood diversity was positively associated with positive and negative intergroup encounters. Moreover, RWA moderated the relationship between neighbourhood diversity and both positive and negative contact of White British people. For the minority group, ingroup norms were positively associated with positive intergroup contact, and the relationship between ingroup norms and negative contact was moderated by SDO. Overall, different factors affect positive and negative intergroup contact of majority and minority groups. We discuss the implications of the findings for future research and interventions.

AB  - This paper examines the volume and type of anonymous comments academics receive in student evaluations of courses and teaching (SETs) at the 16,000 higher education institutions that collect this data at the end of each teaching period. Existing research has increasingly pointed to the negative issues of student surveys, but very little research has focused on the volume, type, and impact of anonymous student comments on academics. This paper analyses the survey results of 674 academics to inform higher education leaders and the sector more widely of the amount and type of abusive comments academics are receiving. The work also demonstrates that the highest volume, most derogatory, and most threatening abuse is directed towards women academics and those academics from marginalised groups. The paper finds that previous estimates of the rate and severity of abusive comments that academics receive, and the impact to academics' wellbeing, mental health, and career progression, have underestimated what is taking place. The paper argues that many universities are failing to protect their staff from this abuse, and the prejudice nature of SET results, which will continue to have a negative impact on the career progression of marginalised academics - a major flaw in a sector that prides itself on diversity and inclusion.

AB  - Grounded in the theoretical framework of the dual-process motivational model of ideology and politics, we investigated the mediational role of RWA and SDO on the relationship between voting for populist parties and conspiracy beliefs; the moderation of political interest was also explored. Collapsing different convenience samples gathered after the European election (2014/2015) and the General National Election (2018/2019) allowed us to analyse two datasets (Study 1, n = 4141; Study 2, n = 2301). We hypothesised that populist voters would report higher conspiracy beliefs, RWA, and SDO, compared to non-populist voters and abstainers, and that populist voters would report more conspiracy beliefs through indirect pathways running through RWA and SDO. Furthermore, we hypothesised that such direct and indirect associations would be stronger for individuals with high rather than low political interest. Analyses of variance and moderated mediation models mostly confirmed our expectations, although RWA, and not SDO, mediated the relationships in the expected directions.

AB  - To address sexism, people must first recognize it. In this research, we identified a barrier that makes sexism hard to recognize: rudeness toward men. We found that observers judge a sexist perpetrator as less sexist if he is rude toward men. This occurs because rudeness toward men creates the illusion of gender blindness. We documented this phenomenon in five preregistered studies consisting of online adult participants and adult students from professional schools (total N = 4,663). These attributions are problematic because sexism and rudeness are not mutually exclusive. Men who hold sexist beliefs about women can be-and often are-rude toward other men. These attributions also discourage observers from holding perpetrators accountable for gender bias. Thus, rudeness toward men gives sexist perpetrators plausible deniability. It protects them and prevents the first perceptual step necessary to address sexism.

AB  - Background: Mild microcytic hypochromic anemias caused by iron deficiency (IDA) and beta-thalassemia trait (beta-TT) continue to be problematic and a significant threat to society, particularly in relatively poor developing countries. The goal of this study was to use an accuracy approach to improve the diagnostic function of eight different prejudiced indices in Egyptian pediatric patients with microcytic anaemia.
   Methods: Eight discrimination indices for diagnostic performance are introduced to analyze the differences between beta-beta-TT and IDA among Egyptian paediatric patients by using evaluation metrics calculated from RBC indices by various mathematical formulae. CBC, iron study and hemoglobin electrophoresis were performed to all included participants.
   Results: A total of 300 Egyptian paediatric patients with beta-TT or IDA were enrolled. The Mentzer and Ehsani index exhibited the highest diagnostic accuracy (100%) followed by Sirdah (97.5%), Sirvistava (95%), MDHL (92.5%) Green & King, Recierca, (90%), and Matos (70%). Indices with AUCs greater than 0.8, such as Mentzer, Ehsani, and Sirdah had very valuable predictive accuracy in distinguishing between beta-TT and IDA.
   Conclusion: Although Hb electrophoresis is the gold standard for diagnosing beta-TT, in developing countries, the Mentzer index, followed by the Ehsani and Sirdah indices, could be used as a simple and cheap method to distinguish beta-TT from IDA in pediatric patients with mild microcytic hypochromic anaemia.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to identify the extent of implicit and explicit bias in a sample of pharmacy students and to determine whether there is an association between implicit bias, explicit bias, and responses to clinical cases.
   Methods. Investigators sent links to two online surveys to students at six US schools and colleges of pharmacy. In the first survey, students responded to two clinical cases. Students were presented with a picture of a White or Black patient with each clinical case. On the second survey, students indicated their level of racial implicit bias as assessed by the Harvard Implicit Association Test and their level of racial explicit bias. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the correlation between bias and responses to the clinical cases.
   Results. Three hundred fifty-seven first, second, and third year pharmacy students responded to both surveys (response rate 52%). The students who were presented with the picture of a Black patient rated the patient's pain and the reliability of the patient's family as higher than students presented with the picture of a White patient. Students had more negative implicit and explicit bias towards Black patients. Neither implicit nor explicit bias correlated with student responses to the clinical cases.
   Conclusion. Evidence of slight to moderate negative implicit bias and slight negative explicit bias towards Black patients was identified in this group of pharmacy students. Future studies that include a more representative population and heighten the stakes of the clinical scenario should be done to investigate a possible correlation between bias and clinical behaviors.

AB  - The current research examined the role of values in guiding people's responses to COVID-19. Results from an international study involving 115 countries (N = 61,490) suggest that health and economic threats of COVID-19 evoke different values, with implications for controlling and coping with the pandemic. Specifically, health threats predicted prioritization of communal values related to caring for others and belonging, whereas economic threats predicted prioritization of agentic values focused on competition and achievement. Concurrently and over time, prioritizing communal values over agentic values was associated with enactment of prevention behaviors that reduce virus transmission, motivations to help others suffering from the pandemic, and positive attitudes toward outgroup members. These results, which were generally consistent across individual and national levels of analysis, suggest that COVID-19 threats may indirectly shape important responses to the pandemic through their influence on people's prioritization of communion and agency. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Woods and Ruscher examine hate speech as a multifaceted phenomenon that has adapted to novel communication contexts and opportunities. In particular, online communication represents a growing opportunity for individuals to engage in anonymous hate speech, a situation that merits additional research for several reasons. The authors posit, first, that this specific type of hate speech warrants focused research because it may not altogether fit into pre-established categories of hate speech events, a matter that may have implications for the likelihood of legal censure. Second, this incarnation of hate speech may be best understood in terms of constitutive harms, relative to other harms, that are themselves understudied. Finally, anonymous hate speech online may inflict unique and additional harms by virtue of the unique context of the Internet and the ease of anonymity for perpetrators. Woods and Ruscher provide an overview of research on the types and harms of hate speech, and a consideration of the impact both of anonymity and of the Internet on these harms, as well as describe an illustrative example of a type of hate speech online that is often anonymous-derogatory Internet memes-in an effort to encourage further research into this novel incarnation of words that wound.

AB  - As organizations take on grand challenges in gender equality, anti-racism, LGBTQ+ protections and workplace inclusion, many well-intentioned individuals from dominant groups (e.g., cisgender men, Caucasian, heterosexual) are stepping forward as allies toward underrepresented or marginalized group members (e.g., cisgender women, People of Color, LGBTQ+ identified employees). Past research and guidance assume an inevitable need for external motivation, reflected in the 'business case' for diversity and in top-down policies to drive equity and inclusion efforts. This qualitative study explored internal motivations in the form of morally motivated virtues of 25 peer-nominated exemplary allies serving in leadership positions. In-depth life/career story interviews were used to identify the virtues that supported their allyship journeys. Findings demonstrated that they tapped into several virtues that served distinct functions in a 4-stage allyship development process: Stage 1-Energizing psychological investment (compassion, fairness); Stage 2-Thinking through allyship-relevant complexities (intellectual humility, perspective-taking, wisdom); Stage 3-Initiating action (prudence, moral courage, honesty); Stage 4-Committing to allyship (perseverance, patience). We call this the 'EThIC model of virtue-based allyship development.' This study has implications for theory and research on a virtue-based approach to diversity, equity and inclusion.

AB  - The current study proposes an extension of theory and research on the effect of status threat specific to heterosexual men's anti-gay slurs usage. Drawing on both the Precarious Manhood Thesis and the Coalitional Value Theory, the current study investigates whether masculine personality traits moderate the association between status threat and men's readiness to use anti-gay slurs. A sample of heterosexual male university students (N = 139) was recruited from two English-speaking universities in Montreal, Quebec, and Houston, Texas. Participants completed questionnaires and randomly received either status threatening or status confirming feedback. Next, after reading vignettes describing heterosexual men behaving in ways that might jeopardize their status, participants reported their estimated probability of calling the target character a "fag" or "faggot." Findings revealed a significant interaction effect. That is, only among participants high in masculine personality traits, those in the threat condition indicated significantly greater readiness to use anti-gay slurs relative to those in the status affirmation group. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of men's anti-gay slur usage grounded in a status striving motive paired with distinct personality features. Future research directions are discussed.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate whether U.S. citizenship status influences the racialization of offenders engaged in homicide, sexual violence, and terrorism. The role of social media exposure and interracial contact are explored as additional proximal factors that may explain racialization across citizenship status. The cross-sectional online survey consisted of 729 participants enrolled at a culturally diverse northeastern university. Results suggest that non-U.S. citizens have a more color-blind perspective and are less likely to racialize crime when associating a particular race/ethnicity with violent crimes. Surprisingly, social media exposure and interracial contact were not significant contributors to racialization. Suggestions for future research and policy implications are discussed.

AB  - At the intersection of race and gender, Black women can face multifaceted marginalization as members of two marginalized groups. Is such bias against Black women due to individual differences in racism or sexism, or are both implicated? In the present study, non-Black undergraduates at a Canadian university (N = 231) rated stereotype endorsement of Black women ("Mammy," "Jezebel," "Sapphire," "Ratchet") and their willingness to discriminate against Black women (hiring of, sublet to, voting for). Hostile sexism uniquely predicted stronger stereotype endorsement, whereas modern racism uniquely predicted greater discrimination willingness. Generalized right-wing ideology (tapping the variance shared by right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political conservatism) was not uniquely related to the criteria. Implications in terms of group category suppression or activation, and the designing of interventions, are discussed.

AB  - The present research builds on previous models of jury diversity's benefits by exploring how diversity impacts the deliberation process. In Study 1, community members (N = 433) participated in a jury decision-making study manipulating the strength of evidence (ambiguous vs. weak) and the diversity of the jury. When the evidence in the case was ambiguous, both white and black jurors made high-quality contributions to discussion in diverse juries than in nondiverse juries. In Study 2, undergraduate students (N = 369) were randomly assigned to wealth and power conditions and then deliberated in diverse and nondiverse groups. Diverse juries were less likely to convict the defendant, and jurors on diverse juries made high-quality contributions to discussion. Although previous work has documented effects of diversity on high-status jurors' contributions to deliberations, this work suggests that diversity may relate to more complex evidence evaluation for members of low-status groups as well.

AB  - Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is an underdiagnosed psychiatric condition in which there is minimal research to support a validated treatment regimen. As a result, it is unclear how mental health practitioners approach NPD patients and the outcomes of clinical management. Given this gap in current mental health practice, this article explores the attitudes of clinicians toward treating NPD patients and the clinician-reported outcomes of managing NPD patients. The study uses a qualitative and quantitative approach to analyze the results of a 16-question survey about clinicians' experiences working with NPD patients. 173 participants were recruited from online psychology interest forums between April 2019 to August 2019. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Scientist (SPSS-26). The qualitative data showed that clinicians find NPD patients to be difficult and challenging. Additionally, clinicians report minimal experience treating NPD and high treatment drop-out rates. The quantitative data were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. These results show that clinicians who view NPD as a diagnosis worth treating report more benefit from their care. These results also showed that participants who report formal didactic training in NPD have better results with their patients. The data also show that clinicians feel group therapy can be helpful in treating NPD, despite reporting that it is often not offered to NPD patients. This is an area that can direct future NPD research to develop a comprehensive approach to NPD management.

This metaphor highlights that stigma is not a static or fixed state but is enacted through processes of continuity and change. The following three orienting concepts are identified: (a) lineage (i.e. origin narratives and initial manifestations are created in relation to existing stigmas, stereotypes, and outgroups), (b) variation (i.e. stigma changes over time in response to new content and contexts), and (c) strength (i.e. stigma can be amplified or weakened through counter- or de-stigmatizing forces). I go on to use this metaphor to offer an analysis of the emergence of COVID-19 stigma. The lineage of COVID-19 stigma includes a long history of contagious disease, resonant with fears of contamination and death. Origin narratives have stigmatized Asian/Chinese groups as virus carriers, leading to socio-political manifestations of discrimination. Newer 'risky' groups have emerged in relation to old age, race and ethnicity, poverty, and weight, whose designation as 'vulnerable' simultaneously identifies them as victims in need of protection but also as a risk to the social body. Counter-stigmatizing trends are also visible. Public disclosure of having COVID-19 by high-status individuals such as the actor Tom Hanks has, in some instances, converted 'testing positive' into shared rather than shamed behaviour in the West. As discourses concerning risk, controllability, and blame unfold, so COVID-19 stigma will further mutate. In conclusion, the metaphor of mutation, and its three concepts of lineage, variation, and strength, offers a vocabulary through which to articulate emergent and ongoing stigma processes. Furthermore, the concept of stigma mutation identifies a clear role for social scientists and public health in terms of process engagement; to disrupt stigma, remaking it in less deadly forms or even to prevent its emergence altogether.

AB  - Role congruity theory postulates that traditionally there is a mismatch between the communal qualities associated with women and the masculine or agentic qualities considered necessary in a good leader. Thus, female candidates are presumed to be less suitable for leadership roles. The purpose of this study is to discover the conditions under which this (in)congruity may fluctuate. In a hypothetical manager recruitment process done in Spain, two profiles (agentic and communal) were associated with female and male candidates to explore variations according to the organizational setting (profit-oriented or civic-minded company) and the value attributed to candidates' qualities (high or low). Results showed congruity between candidates' profile and organizational setting when their trait value was high: agentic candidates were preferred over communal candidates for the profit-oriented company, with the reverse occurring for the civic-minded company. However, candidates' sex apparently played no significant role in participants' decision making; additionally, when the value of candidates' traits was low, congruity was only found for the profit-oriented company. We conclude that, overall, the agentic construal of management, with its good and bad features, still has the upper hand in the current vision of leadership.

AB  - Background Mining in the Amazon exposes gold miners to various diseases, including malaria, whose control is still a major challenge. The environment of the mines contributes to the proliferation of vector mosquitoes and the precarious housing conditions facilitate transmission of the disease. Understanding gold miners' perceptions is essential for the formulation of strategies to fight malaria. A qualitative study was carried out in the municipality of Calcoene, state of Amapa, Brazilian Amazon adjointining the municipality of Oiapoque, that is in the border area with French Guiana and Suriname. Methods A semi-structured interview was applied to an intentional sample of 29 miners, a number determined by the theoretical saturation criterion. Thematic analysis was adopted to obtain the results and the Cohen's Kappa index was calculated to verify the agreement between observers during coding. Results The agreement between observers was verified by a Cohen's Kappa index of 0.82. Analysis of the interviews showed that gold miners were subjected to prejudice from the community due to forest diseases that they can transmit, and their activities are often associated with crime. When the miners return to their hometown after a period of mining, the urban population blames them for the onset of diseases such as malaria. Most participants in the survey did not know how malaria transmission occurs, and associated its occurrence with contaminated water and food. Participants reported not being afraid of the disease, trusting the diagnosis and available treatment, though this depends on where they are treated. The use of therapeutic resources, such as medicinal plants and medicines acquired in the illegal market, is very common in this population. Despite the challenges identified by the research subjects, they believe that the disease can be controlled, or the cases reduced, but there was low acceptability for a possible mass drug administration (MDA) intervention. Conclusion Despite a recent reduction in malaria prevalence in Brazil, there are still vulnerable populations, such as gold miners, who help to perpetuate the existence of the disease in the Amazon. The lack of knowledge regarding how the transmission of malaria occurs, associated with myths regarding this and the use of traditional health practices and illegal drugs for the treatment of the disease without a specific diagnosis, jeopardizes the country's efforts to eliminate malaria. It is necessary to implement control programmes in these populations, especially those who frequently travel around the border region and to remote locations, which are difficult regions for health teams to access, thus hindering diagnostic and treatment actions. For this reason, understanding the perceptions of these individuals as well as their customs, beliefs and lifestyle, can assist in the production of targeted educational material and adoption of strategies in the elimination of malaria in the country.

AB  - Much research suggests mental health diagnoses elicit stigmatization of individuals. The current study builds upon this literature at the intersection of same- and cross-race perceptions. Black and White participants viewed Black and White targets paired with either a mental health diagnosis (e.g., depression), a physical health diagnosis (e.g., high blood pressure), or no health information (control) while indicating each target's favorability and how much social distance they would want from them. Overall, people were more stigmatizing toward targets with a mental health diagnosis than a physical health diagnosis or no diagnosis. Black targets with a mental health diagnosis were stigmatized more than White targets with a mental health diagnosis and White participants displayed a greater aversion to Black targets with a mental health diagnosis than did Black participants. Results contribute to the mental health stigma literature and suggest it may be particularly problematic for White perceivers' attitudes toward Black individuals with mental health diagnoses. Findings may shed light on the racial differences in treatment-seeking amongst Black and White individuals.

AB  - When pupils learn geography they are extending their world view and reshaping it. This paper analyses representations of Africa and African countries and cultures in Irish primary geography textbooks and assesses to what extent these textbook portrayals facilitate or repress multicultural education, specifically critical multicultural education (CMCE). Here, this paper argues that primary geography can and should play a critical role in challenging societal issues of inequality, racism, prejudice and stereotypes, particularly pertaining to perspectives of the 'Other'. This paper devises a framework for critical multicultural geography education (CMCGE) and applies this to Irish primary geography textbooks. While some textbooks can demonstrate capacity in fostering multiple perspectives, appreciation for diversity, development of critical thinking and enquiry, and making connections; in the main, textbooks present stereotypical, oversimplified accounts of issues, peoples and places which can result in feelings of superiority amongst dominant groups and more entrenched feelings of 'Otherness' amongst minority groups.

AB  - Some individuals may be internationally displaced by climate change. We surveyed two independent samples of New Zealanders to understand attitudes towards climate aid. Participants were relatively less supportive of financial aid policies, though the majority supported climate refugee policy. We assessed whether those ideological barriers commonly used to predict prejudice and policy support related to this acceptance in meaningful ways. Interestingly, we show that approval or rejection of climate refugee policy was largely predicated on views regarding how hierarchically society ought to be ordered. Our research suggests that those opposing climate refugee policy are motivated by anti-egalitarianism and concerns about their own economic welfare to a greater extent than concerns about differences in culture, values, and norms.

AB  - Objective: To describe the perceptions of homeless people on Avenida Paulista in the city of Sao Paulo regarding access to health devices in the region. Method: This is a qualitative research conducted with 10 people who were homeless on Avenida Paulista in January 2019. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, and analysis of the findings was made using hermeneutics-dialectics. Two categories of results were created: Health services accessed in the region by homeless people; Barriers to health access faced by homeless people on Avenida Paulista, Sao Paulo. This study obtained ethical approval. Results: Seeking emergency services occurs as the main gateway for homeless people in the region, and among the barriers faced, prejudice is placed as the main phenomenon. Conclusion: It is necessary to consider the specificities of this population, understand their conceptions of health-disease and their trajectories so that services can be improved and access to health for this vulnerable and growing group can be guaranteed.

AB  - I explore how empathetic visual argument may be the mode best suited for eliciting appropriate force to the reasons given by arguers who face systematic identity prejudices. In the verbal mode, this force is often skewed through epistemic injustice (Fricker 2007), argumentative injustice (Bondy 2010), and discursive injustice (Kukla 2010). Highlighting their reliance on the Aristotelian sense of enthymeme, I show how visual arguments are highly context specific. Using Ian Dove's Visual Scheming (2016) and the theory of the Retort collective (2004) via case study, I demonstrate how the visual mode can leave the appropriate force in the arguer's control.

AB  - Gatekeepers' tipping-off serves as a crucial first line of defense in safeguarding individuals and society from emerging, severe deviant behaviors. The present research provides a theoretically driven, quantitative approach in examining a gatekeeper's decision to tip-off a deviant close-other to the authorities. We draw inspiration from motivation science and propose a dual-factor model with desirability and feasibility forming two distinct mediating pathways through which a range of personal and situational factors predict gatekeepers' reporting intentions. In four studies (N = 1142), we demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the model across diverse deviant behaviors (racial prejudice, addictive gambling and violent extremism) and populations (Asians vs. Americans). We also provide evidence of the theoretical utility of the model in (1) differentiating complex motives underlying gatekeepers' reporting, (2) arbitrating competing theoretical accounts of reporting and (3) demonstrating a synergistic interaction between desirability and feasibility. The present research underscores the value of applying a motivation science perspective to enhance understanding of gatekeepers' decision-making process and offers empirically based suggestions for designing relevant crime-reporting interventions.

In this theoretical paper, we discuss why Black people may be at a greater risk for police intervention when not abiding by public health guidelines. We also describe the importance of considering how Whiteness, in addition to anti-Blackness, may influence how and when public health guidelines are enforced. Finally, we consider how disparate public health policing related to COVID-19 is situated in a broader historical and global context.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to experimentally investigate whether disclosing one's sexual orientation while applying for a job would impact hiring decisions. Design/methodology/approach The experiment employed a 2 (Applicant Gender: Male/Female) x 2 (Applicant Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual or Gay/Lesbian) x 2 (Job Type: Masculine/Feminine) between-subjects design. Participants (N = 349) were randomly assigned to one of eight applicant conditions. They were first presented with a job description, followed by a cover letter displaying the applicants' qualifications, gender and sexual orientation. Participants evaluated the applicant's competence, social skills and hireability, and provided self-reports of their attitudes toward gays/lesbians and traditional gender roles. Findings The results demonstrated a distinct pattern of discrimination toward gay/lesbian applicants who were rated significantly lower in competence, social skills and hireability than were heterosexual applicants. Additionally, using multigroup structural equation modeling, we found that sexual orientation differentially impacted the relationship between attitudes and hireability ratings; negative attitudes toward homosexuality, beliefs about sexual orientation as a choice and belief in traditional gender roles were significant predictors of hireability ratings for gay/lesbian applicants, but were unrelated to evaluations of heterosexual applicants. Research limitations/implications The current study highlights the underlying mechanisms involved in hiring discrimination against Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans (LGBT) workers including lower evaluations of competence, social skills and structural differences in the impact of attitudes. These direct links must be explicitly addressed for continued progress related to equality, diversity and inclusion in Human Resource Management (HRM). Continued multidisciplinary research that considers gender identity and sexual orientation signal salience, consequences of specific career stereotypes, regional differences and the effects of societal shifts in attitudes overtime will continue to improve our understanding and drive us toward a more equitable future. Practical implications By identifying the underlying mechanisms involved in hiring discrimination, this study highlights the need for diversity trainings that go beyond the blanket approaches to diversity management and explicitly address conscious and unconscious biases that may influence the hiring process. Additionally, it is critical for organizations to provide top-down support from leadership, and implement mechanisms that allow LGBT voices to be heard and feel comfortable in their work environment to reduce the psychological strain. Social implications Prior to the recent landmark ruling by the Supreme Court on June 15, 2020, which extended the 1964 Civil Rights Act workplace protections to gay, lesbianand transgender employees, in many places across the United States Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) identifying workers could still be legally discriminated against. The pattern of discrimination identified in the current study provides clear evidence that these protections are necessary, and long overdue. Originality/value This study identifies two clear patterns of hiring discrimination: (1) lower hireability ratings and (2) structural differences in the evaluative process for gay/lesbian applicants.
   These findings provide experimental evidence, currently lacking in the literature, that support survey-based and qualitative findings of LGBT's experiences, and demonstrate how negative attitudes, irrelevant to the qualifications of an applicant, seep into hiring decisions.

AB  - Why do some upper caste respondents view Dalit socio-economic conditions as a consequence of a lack of effort by Dalits, while others see it as a consequence of systematic discrimination and exclusion of Dalits from opportunities across generations? What explains this variation? This forms the central question I explore in this article. Two commonly held explanations for much of the observed upper caste behaviours towards Dalits also explain the divergent opinions held by upper caste respondents on the reasons for current Dalit socio-economic conditions. Using individual level data from the Politics and Society between Elections survey, I find that a negative bias toward Dalits that arises when upper caste respondents perceive themselves as more hardworking than Dalits and a perception of the relatively favourable treatment of Dalits by government officials significantly explain differences in upper caste opinions. Persistent inequalities reinforced by denying the historical burden borne by Dalits over centuries ultimately renders social change meaningless and democratic deepening a pipe dream.

AB  - Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the fear of infection increases and, with it, the stigma-discrimination, which makes it an additional problem of the epidemic. However, studies about stigma associated with coronavirus are scarce worldwide.
   Aims: To determine the association between stigmatisation and fear of COVID-19 in the general population of Colombia.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 1,687 adults between 18 and 76 years old (M = 36.3; SD = 12.5), 41.1% health workers, filled out an online questionnaire on Stigma-Discrimination and the COVID-5 Fear Scale, adapted by the research team.
   Results: The proportion of high fear of COVID-19 was 34.1%; When comparing the affirmative answers to the questionnaire on stigma-discrimination towards COVID-19, it was found that the difference was significantly higher in the general population compared to health workers in most of the questions evaluated, which indicates a high level of stigmatisation in that group. An association between high fear of COVID-19 and stigma was evidenced in 63.6% of the questions in the questionnaire.
   Conclusion: Stigma-discrimination towards COVID-19 is frequent in the Colombian population and is associated with high levels of fear towards said disease, mainly people who are not health workers.

AB  - The Mediterranean migration crisis especially affects three Southern European countries that represent the main gateways into the continent for immigrants and asylum seekers: Greece, Italy, and Spain. In recent years, feelings of rejection towards migration have been increasing in all of them, accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the number of hate crimes. Similarly, the representation of these groups in European news media seems to have worsened, especially since 2015, the year in which the migratory crisis significantly worsened. This coverage could be affecting European citizens on emotional, cognitive, and attitudinal levels and thus should be rigorously analyzed. The present study is based on the theory of framing and, specifically, on visual framing to analyze the connotative representations of immigrants and refugees spread by the reference media of Southern Europe through images, paying more attention to the negative frames in particular, which represent displaced people as a burden or threat. Specifically, 360 photographs taken between 2014 and 2019 and published by the main media in Greece, Italy, and Spain were subject to content analysis. The findings show a temporal increase in the negative visual frames of immigrants and refugees in the analyzed media. Differences were also found between countries, with Greece presenting a higher percentage of images with negative frames, as well as a greater predominance of this type of frame compared with the other countries. Finally, differences were identified between the media themselves, being the Greek Kathimerini the one that stands out for having a greater presence and prevalence of visual frames that represent innnigrants and refugees as a burden and threat.

AB  - Within the framework of sustainable development, the concept of cultural heritage is linked to the heritage awareness of a specific spatial context, and to the conservation of collective memory. Despite the clear interest in cultural sustainability, the lack of research devoted to interpreting different teaching methods for transmitting patrimonial assets and preserving natural heritage is noteworthy. For this reason, the present study takes various scientific contributions as the background for considering sustainable education as a fundamental instrument to recover and conserve heritage resources, both from an informative and educational point of view. The aim of this study was to assess the training of new teachers in terms of the particular skills needed to develop active learning methods related to the teaching of heritage sustainability. The research sample consisted of 488 students in the Degree in Primary Education program. The methodology combined both qualitative and quantitative techniques, to obtain information from both observation and an opinion survey given to the students. The results show several opinions related to achieving and facilitating the implementation of innovative methodologies, due to a lack of initial university training. Generally speaking, this work provided an opportunity for students to analyze a series of prejudices regarding their working methods, and to overcome excessive theorization in their university studies.

AB  - In response to the coronavirus pandemic, several countries have imposed curfews, quarantines, and lockdowns to restrict the spread of the infection among people. India had initiated a nationwide lockdown to combat the pandemic starting from the last week of March until the end of May 2020. But, the lockdown had continued subsequently in several red zones across parts of the country for few months. However, scientists have criticized the government's abrupt lockdown since it prevented people from preparing for the worst aftermath. Besides, the curfews have blocked millions of impoverished migrant workers from leaving cities to return to their homes in distant rural villages. As a result, the destitute workers have endured enormous hardship and outright discrimination desolately leading to their added physical and mental distress, pain, suffering, and death. Most of the victims of the lockdown have belonged to the economically distressed lower social classes of the Indian caste hierarchy. This article outlines their sufferings triggered by the long drawn-out lockdown episode.

AB  - When addressing the pernicious effects of racial discrimination, majority white psychoanalysts and psychotherapists like to believe that their psychological awareness enables them to avoid engaging in prejudice and racism. As a result, when asked to acknowledge their implication in systemic racism, powerful counter-reactions from shame and guilt to feelings of vulnerability and discomfort result. Meaningful dialogue about white racism and the effects of coloniality in Canada and the United States requires acknowledging the limits of understanding, to be unsettled and ultimately to embrace discomfort. It also requires an awareness of the history of prejudice and racism and its impact on the disciplines of psychology, psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.

AB  - Under the powerful influence of the Cartesian split, American psychotherapy theories usually take for granted the separation of the sociopolitical and the psychological. The intellectual movement referred to as The Interpretive Turn, composed of postmodernism and hermeneutics, directly opposes the split. Drawing from hermeneutic conceptions of the cultural clearing, the everyday social experience of similarity and difference, and Gadamer's description of dialogue, psychotherapy can be thought of as an encounter with difference. This way of conceiving of therapy opposes the split and welcomes Kohut's concept of the group self as an early approach to cultural history. This way of conceiving of similarity and difference aids in meeting the challenges-such as those related to race, gender, sexual orientation, and class-therapists confront in their everyday practices. It is also suggested that some therapists could engage in the role of public intellectual, thus bringing more psychologically sophisticated interpretations of our current political struggles over authoritarianism and democracy. In that way a hermeneutic cultural history could aid in combating the rise of neo-fascism in the United States and throughout the world, and in developing ways of building a more humane society dedicated to the well-being of all its inhabitants.

After six years abroad, she returned to England but owing partly to establishment prejudice was unsuccessful in setting up a London practice and eventually became the Principal of a Women's Agricultural College. Her career illustrates the aspects of medical practice abroad in the 1890s, as well as the difficulties encountered by women doctors in England even after the route to qualification in the UK had been opened.

AB  - Students evaluate male professors higher than female professors. In a study that we presented to participants as a test of a new form for student evaluations of teaching (SETs), we examined if self-affirmation (contemplating elements that positively contribute to one's self-image) reduced the gender bias. Belgian students (n = 568), who were randomly assigned to self-affirm (through either a value-affirmation task or self-superiority priming) or not, read a vignette prompting them to imagine that they had received a good or a bad grade from a male or a female professor. They evaluated the course, the professor, and the form. Non-self-affirmed participants showed a gender bias after a bad grade, disadvantaging the female professor. Self-affirmation eradicated the gender bias by lowering evaluations for the male professor, suggesting that the gender bias involves overvaluing male rather than derogating female professors. Without self-affirmation, the positivity of the SETs was correlated with participants' evaluation of the SET form itself. Self-affirmation inflated the correlation for the male professor and eradicated it for the female professor. Having students self-affirm before SETs may be useful when SETs are obligatory only. An even better approach is asking SETs before students learn their grades or simply abolish SETs as a factor in hiring and promotion decisions.

KW  - Prejudices
AB  - While climate change has become a salient political and social issue in Western societies, we know relatively little about how these societies will react to one of the potentially important consequences of climate change: increasing migration flows. By means of a representative online survey in Germany, this paper therefore investigates for the very first time to what extent citizens in industrialized societies are willing to accept climate change migrants, especially in comparison with other groups of migrants and refugees, and the circumstances and principles under which they would accept them. The findings show that climate change migrants receive high support levels comparable with those enjoyed by political refugees (migrants who need special protection) and that contrast with attitudes towards economic migrants (who are often not seen as in need of special protection). We also see that people are more likely to accept justifications for taking climate change migrants when they realize that the expected number of migrants is relatively low. While arguments about morality, corrective justice, and a country's capacity lead to similar acceptance rates in general, the latter argument plays a more important role for highly educated people and non-environmentalists than the former two. The findings of this study allow us to better prepare for potential conflicts that might emerge with increasing migration flows caused by climate change.

AB  - This study explored the views of non-psychiatric medical specialists about people with schizophrenia and depression and examined whether specialists' approach to these clients, and their perception of dangerousness and social distance, differed by disorder. Non-psychiatric medical specialists working in community centers in Italy read either a schizophrenia or depression description and then completed a questionnaire on their views about people with that disorder. The schizophrenia-group (N = 114) was more sure than the depression-group (N = 97) that the patients should be approached differently in outpatient specialized clinics like those where the respondents worked; are incapable of caring for their open health; and are kept at distance by others. Perceived dangerousness did not significantly differ between the two groups. These findings highlight the potential effects of attitudes on medical practice and outline the need to educate non-psychiatric medical specialists on stigma as a strategy to reduce health discrepancies, particularly toward people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

AB  - Objectification theory suggests that sexualization has significant dehumanizing consequences for how perceivers see women. To date, research has mostly documented how sexualized bodies in the mass media are objectified and dehumanized. The purpose of the present work was to test the novel cosmetics dehumanization hypothesis (CDH), that is, that subtler manifestations of sexualization, such as heavy makeup, might influence the way people attribute humanness-related traits to women. Across four experiments, 1000 participants (mostly from the United Kingdom and United States) were asked to evaluate women's faces with or without heavy makeup. Consistent with the CDH, results showed that faces with makeup were rated as less human while using complementary indicators of dehumanization: They were perceived as possessing less humanness, less agency, less experience (Experiment 1), less competence, less warmth, and less morality (Experiments 2-4) than faces without makeup. This pattern of results was observed for faces of both models (Experiments 1-2) and ordinary women (Experiments 3-4). In Experiment 4, we manipulated the part of the face that wore makeup (eye makeup vs. lipstick) and found that faces with eye makeup were attributed the least amount of warmth and competence. A meta-analysis based on Experiments 2-4 confirmed the robustness of the findings, which were not moderated by either participant gender or sexual orientation. Whereas prior studies suggested that a focus on faces may serve as an antidote for objectification and related dehumanization, the present set of experiments indicates that this strategy might not always be effective.

AB  - The present paper addresses Baruch Spinoza's radical affirmation of individual identity emergent from within the psychosocial tensions of group membership. Focusing upon psychological experience beginning with a lived history of fearful Inquisitional persecution, and continuing from conformity to rebellion within the constraints of the Amsterdam Jewish synagogue, we trace the psychological recognition of individual identity in Spinoza's understanding of the self-determined, immanent acts of daily life. Spinoza's multiple names are depicted as markers, corresponding to membership in mutually exclusive social groups, each constraining freedom of thought and action.

AB  - This article discusses the role of cycling in women's emancipation in late Victorian Britain and explores the attitudes of the middle-class public to women's pursuit of this recreational activity. The unique combination of healthy physical exercise, unrestrained mobility and sporting excitement that the bicycle offered elevated cycling into one of the epoch's most popular leisure activities. For women, the bicycle became an important instrument to break away from the constraints of the androcentric paternalistic culture that stereotyped them and cast them in the passive role of the angel in the house. The immense popularity of bicycling with middle- and upper-class women and the inevitable changes in patterns of female leisure, clothing and normative behaviour it involved, caused strong reaction from the bourgeois establishment. An analysis of opinions published in the British press at the time reveals a discourse marked by anxiety that cycling might become an avenue for women to claim more independence for themselves and even subvert the established social framework based on power relations and a clear delineation of gender roles.

AB  - This article provides a critical assessment of the contributions to this special issue. As these articles show, it is only once we take theatrical metaphors seriously that what can start to understand international politics. The world really is a stage, on which states are the players. Yet the theoretical prejudices displayed in these articles obscure this fact rather than highlighting it. Poststructuralism, Butlerian theories of performativity, and actor-network theory are constitutionally incapable of discussing the theater. The reason is that real, theatrical, performances are events that audience members interpret by means of their bodies and their imagination.

AB  - Violent encounters between police and Black people have spurred debates about how race affects officer decision-making. We propose that racial disparities in police-civilian interactions are amplified when police interact with Black civilians who are encountered in groups. To test this possibility, we analyzed New York City stop and frisk data for over 2 million police stops. Results revealed that Black (vs. White) people were more likely to be frisked, searched, arrested, and have force used against them. Critically, these racial disparities were more pronounced for people stopped in groups (vs. alone): Being stopped in a group led to a 1.7% increase in racial disparities for frisks, a 1% increase for searches, a 0.3% increase for arrests, and a 1.7% increase for use of force. Moreover, these disparities held even when we controlled for a potential proxy of effective policing: discovery of illegal contraband. We conclude that groups amplify racial disparities in policing.

AB  - When economic resources are scarce, racial minorities are often devalued and disenfranchised. We proposed that this pattern extends to visual processing, such that the encoding of minority group faces is disrupted under scarcity-an effect that may facilitate discrimination and contribute to racial disparities. Specifically, we used EEG and fMRI to test whether scarce economic conditions induce deficits in neural encoding of Black faces, and we examined whether this effect is associated with discriminatory resource allocation in behavior. In Study 1, framing resources as scarce (vs. neutral) selectively impaired the neural encoding of Black (vs. White) faces, as indexed by a delayed face-related N170 ERP response, and the degree of this encoding deficit predicted anti-Black allocation decisions. In Study 2, we replicated and extended this effect using fMRI: Resources framed as scarce (vs. neutral) reduced face-sensitive fusiform activity to Black (vs. White) faces. Furthermore, scarcity-decreased fusiform activity to Black faces corresponded with decreased valuation-related striatum activity to predict anti-Black allocation decisions. These findings suggest that impaired visual processing and devaluation occur selectively for minorities under scarcity-an implicit effect that may promote discrimination and contribute to rising disparities observed during economic stress.

AB  - We describe and evaluate the North Dublin City General Practitioner Training Programme (NDCGP), which was designed to educate doctors to work with the underserved. People who are marginalised have poorer health and less access to healthcare than the general population. Furthermore, these groups have significantly lower numbers of GPs per capita of population. Few GP training programmes are located in such communities, despite GPs tending to work in the areas where they trained. An evaluation of NDCGP training programme was conducted by sending a self-administered questionnaire to all graduates of the programme (2013?17). Thirty-seven graduates (88%) responded to the questionnaire. Thirty-six (97%) were either working as GPs in an area of deprivation or their work included services to a marginalised group. These 36 (97%) respondents indicated that continuing to serve deprived communities was in their long-term plans. The training provided trainees with the knowledge, understanding and a specific skill set to equip them to work with the underserved. Through teaching and exposure placements, trainees? confidence and empathy had increased and their prejudice and fear towards underserved patients had decreased. Conclusion: The NDCGP Training Programme achieved its aims. Replication of this model of education should be considered elsewhere.

AB  - We investigated whether stereotypes linking Black men and Black boys with violence and criminality generalize to Black women and Black girls. In Experiments 1 and 2, non-Black participants completed sequential-priming tasks wherein they saw faces varying in race, age, and gender before categorizing danger-related objects or words. Experiment 3 compared task performance across non-Black and Black participants. Results revealed that (a) implicit stereotyping of Blacks as more dangerous than Whites emerged across target age, target gender, and perceiver race, with (b) a similar magnitude of racial bias across adult and child targets and (c) a smaller magnitude for female than male targets. Evidence for age bias and gender bias also emerged whereby (d) across race, adult targets were more strongly associated with danger than were child targets, and (e) within Black (but not White) targets, male targets were more strongly associated with danger than were female targets.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to make strategic recommendations that benefit under-represented entrepreneurship (UE). Design/methodology/approach The approach toward suggesting the proposed strategic recommendations is conceptual in nature. Blumberg's theory of nested level of resource structure and McPherson's theory of homophily will be invoked. Findings Under-represented entrepreneurship would benefit from initiating key resource identification and acquisition at a meso-level, i.e. within one's own community in the first place and engaging in community-based collaborative and collective entrepreneurship. Originality/value The beneficial effects of implementing these strategies for UE will be felt in stages. First, communities will emerge as entrepreneurial as a whole. Subsequently, societal-level attribution of these communities as "entrepreneurial communities" will occur providing the necessary visibility and acceptance they would need to participate, contribute and get blended with more traditional entrepreneurship without distinction or prejudice.

AB  - Empathy can be both beneficial and costly. This trade-off is pertinent for physicians who must care for patients while maintaining emotional distance to avoid burnout. Prior work using self-report and neurophysiological measures has found mixed evidence for differences in empathy between physicians and nonphysicians. We used implicit measurement and multinomial modeling to examine intentional empathy (IE) and unintentional empathy (UE) for pain among physicians and demographically matched nonphysicians. Relative to nonphysicians, physicians displayed greater ability to judge the painfulness of target experiences (i.e., IE). Contrary to some prior work, however, physicians and nonphysicians displayed comparable spontaneous resonance with distracter experiences (i.e., UE). These findings suggest that physicians may be more likely than nonphysicians to empathize with others' pain when empathy aligns with their overt goals.

AB  - Objective: To perform the cross-cultural adaptation of the original North American version of the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men Scale (ATLG) for use in Brazil, and to evaluate the psychometric properties of the adapted instrument in a sample of Brazilian heterosexual physicians. Methods: Stages of cross-cultural adaptation were as follows: translation by two independent evaluators, translation synthesis, evaluation by the target population for semantic equivalence, pilot study with 42 physicians, and final instrument preparation involving 224 heterosexual physicians practicing medicine in the Federal District. Invitations containing a link to the study were sent to physicians via e-mail, social media and medical associations. Inclusion criteria were as follows: being a physician authorized to practice medicine in Brazil, practicing medicine in the Brazilian Federal District, and self-declared heterosexual, as stipulated in the original version of the ATLG scale. Exclusion criteria were not disclosed to potential participants to avoid inhibition and unwillingness to participate; respondents meeting exclusion criteria were removed from the sample during data analysis. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested a one-factor solution to be the most representative of the data, including all 20 items with high reliability (composite reliability coefficients =0.948). Conclusion: The ATLG scale is a suitable instrument to assess physicians' attitudes toward homosexuals, with good validity and reliability evidence based on the sample studied.

AB  - The short-stories I have chosen to discuss here are "A Worn Path" (1941) by Eudora Welty and "The Artificial Nigger" (1955) by Flannery O'Connor. They are complementary - as I hope to prove - illustrating two versions of a one-(grand) parent family tale. The white grandfather in O'Connor's story and the black grandmother in Welty's story have to cope with ever more difficult tasks in terms of truth(telling/teaching) and (self-)discovery. For truth - at least personally, if not philosophically - may mean facing all dangers as an ancient grandmother, for the sake of her sick grandson; it can mean coming to terms with one's own old self - in both stories; it may mean facing qualms of conscience and merciless loneliness - for both young and old.

AB  - The primary sources of economics are human thinking and observation through sense-perception. Economics does not accept any super-sensory source as a valid field of enquiry. However, divine revelation granted to Prophets by God, is a source of knowledge that deals with wide-ranging issues including the economic problem. The main argument of the paper is that by integrating human understanding of the divine revelation with conventional economics, existing frontiers of the subject can be expanded. Although the divine revelation is found in the basic texts of all revealed religions, yet the present paper deals with the Islamic primary sources (the Qur'an(2) and the hadith(3)) only. The paper enumerates, by way of example, six problem areas where the Qur'anic revelation can give a lead. These areas are: inequality, human happiness and unhappiness, economic balance, philanthropy, financial crises and stock exchange instability, and waste in human society. However, such a conclusion would firstly require overcoming prejudice against religion and non-conventional fields of enquiry.

AB  - People tend to hold negative attitudes about and derogate those in poverty to varying degrees, often relying on individualistic explanations of poverty that largely ignore systemic sources. This study (N = 208) examined a perspective-taking strategy that could be used to reduce distancing behaviors and negative attitudes toward the poor. Perspective takers distanced less and reported fewer negative attitudes than others. An additional finding was that men (n = 57) were more likely to derogate/distance than women, showed greater agreement with personal deficiency explanations for poverty, and reported stronger stereotypic attitudes toward people who are impoverished.

AB  - We examine women's responses to subliminal gender stereotypes, that is, stereotypes present outside conscious awareness. Previous research suggests that subtle stereotypes elicit acceptance and assimilation, but we predict that subliminal exposure to gender stereotypes will trigger resistance in some women. Specifically, we expect resistance to occur among women who are relatively strongly identified with feminists, but not with the broader group of women. We predict that resistance takes the form of persistence in stereotypically masculine domains and (implicit) in-group bias. Indeed, we found that subliminal exposure to stereotypes (vs. counter-stereotypes) led women who identify relatively strongly with feminists, but less strongly with women, to (a) persist in a math task, (b) show increased willingness to sacrifice men in a Moral Choice Dilemma task, and (c) show implicit in-group bias on an evaluative priming task. This evidence of resistance suggests that members of devalued groups are more resilient than previously thought.

AB  - This article analyzes how Maryse Conde and Marie-Celie Agnant portray the struggles faced by Haitian "boat people" in their novels Reves amers and Alexis d'Haiti which feature child protagonists forced to leave their homeland in search of a better life in the United States. As children and migrants, they are often forgotten and misrepresented in official histories. I argue that by restoring the voices of the most vulnerable, Conde and Agnant rectify what Michel-Rolph Trouillot labels the "silencing of the past"(1) of Haitian history.

KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - Theory and research in cultural psychology highlight the need to examine racism not only "in the head" but also "in the world." Racism is often defined as individual prejudice, but racism is also systemic, existing in the advantages and disadvantages imprinted in cultural artifacts, ideological discourse, and institutional realities that work together with individual biases. In this review, we highlight examples of historically derived ideas and cultural patterns that maintain present-day racial inequalities. We discuss three key insights on the psychology of racism derived from utilizing a cultural-psychology framework. First, one can find racism embedded in our everyday worlds. Second, through our preferences and selections, we maintain racialized contexts in everyday action. Third, we inhabit cultural worlds that, in turn, promote racialized ways of seeing, being in, and acting in the world. This perspective directs attempts at intervention away from individual tendencies and instead focuses on changing the structures of mind in context that reflect and reproduce racial domination.

AB  - Social biases among healthcare providers could limit PrEP access. In this survey study of 115 US medical students, we examined associations between biases (racism and heterosexism) and PrEP clinical decision-making and explored prior PrEP education as a potential buffer. After viewing a vignette about a PrEP-seeking MSM patient, participants reported anticipated patient behavior (condomless sex, extra-relational sex, and adherence), intention to prescribe PrEP to the patient, biases, and background characteristics. Minimal evidence for racism affecting clinical decision-making emerged. In unadjusted analyses, heterosexism indirectly affected prescribing intention via all anticipated behaviors, tested as parallel mediators. Participants expressing greater heterosexism more strongly anticipated increased risk behavior and adherence problems, which were associated with lower prescribing intention. The indirect effect via condomless sex remained significant adjusting for background characteristics. Prior PrEP education did not buffer any indirect effects. Heterosexism may compromise PrEP provision to MSM and should be addressed in PrEP-related medical education.

AB  - Are men and women categorized differently for similar sexual behavior? Building on theories of gender, sexuality, and status, we introduce the concept of precarious sexuality to suggest that men's-but not women's-heterosexuality is an especially privileged identity that is easily lost. We test our hypotheses in a series of survey experiments describing a person who has a sexual experience conflicting with their sexual history. We find that a single same-sex sexual encounter leads an observer to question a heterosexual man's sexual orientation to a greater extent than that of a heterosexual woman in a similar situation. We also find that a different-sex sexual encounter is more likely to change others' perceptions of a lesbian woman's sexual orientation-compared to perceptions of a gay man's sexual orientation. In two conceptual replications, we vary the level of intimacy of the sexual encounter and find consistent evidence for our idea of precarious sexuality for heterosexual men. We close with a general discussion of how status beliefs influence categorization processes and with suggestions for extending our theoretical propositions to other categories beyond those of sexual orientation.

AB  - Introduction: Epilepsy remains a stigmatised disease across geographical and temporal boundaries. Very little is known about epileptic stigma (ES) in cross-cultural settings. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of perceived stigma and factors associated with it, among patients with epilepsy (PWE) at a tertiary care referral hospital in East Coast of Malaysia. Methods: A cross sectional survey among 132 consenting PWE using pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire in Malay/English language to assess their knowledge, attitude and practices (KAPs). Results: Among 132 respondents, 51.5% were male and 48.5 % were female. Their age ranged from 14 to 70 years (mean=31.6 +/- 13.41). Majority (53.8%) of them were aged 30 years or younger. The median number of years they had epilepsy was 8.0 (IQR 4.0-18.8) years and average duration of seizure prior to seeking medical attention was 1.0 (IQR 0.3-4.5) year. Most of them (90.9%) did not know the cause of epilepsy; however nearly all (91.7%) believed that it was a disease of the brain. Higher education level respondents possessed significantly higher KAP scores compared to lower education level respondents (p<0.001). Respondents with good KAP scores believed that epilepsy was not contagious and they observed greater social tolerance. Conclusion: Our study suggests that there is an inverse relationship between knowledge and ES. Self-perceived stigma was more common among our PWE. The results suggest that there is a critical need to enhance epilepsy education amongst the PWE beyond mere seizure control.

AB  - Using autocritography, this essay acts as a critical performance of interracial communication, civil and academic unrest, and theatre during the Grand Jury Hearing for Darren Wilson a year after he murdered Michael Brown in the streets of Ferguson. On the second day of my interview for the intercultural communication professor position at Saint Louis University, the grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson. Protests erupted around the city. Later that week, after Thanksgiving and as protests began to wane, my family and I went to the Fabulous Fox Theatre to view Motown: The Musical. Drawing from canonical prejudice, this essay adds canonical exception to the discussion in an attempt to illuminate the repulsive practice of respectability politics in policed spaces like the academy, theatre, and music.

The role of implicit cognition, such as attribution of secondary emotions in leading people to attribute human rights to minorities, is discussed.

AB  - The return of xenophobic and racist movements in many countries known for their multiculturalism and tolerance signifies the resurgence of nationalism, marked by hostility to outsiders and cultural apartheid. The nation has been portrayed as an imagined community, and the terms nation and nationality have been acknowledged to be difficult to define. Despite its abstract nature, nationalism still commands profound political and emotional legitimacy in modern society and remains the most cruel and powerful force in politics. It is associated with the perception of national superiority, an orientation toward dominance, a collective grievance against foreigners, and a downward comparison of other nations. It shows an evaluative negative bias and prejudice against other countries and a need for national power, bolstered by a hostility toward others. Against the backdrop of the violence, racism, and religious fanaticism of the contemporary world, this paper aims to enhance our understanding and add to the literature on the consumption and marketing of intercultural and interfaith understanding, human rights, diversity, and nationalism and explores implications therein for nonprofit organizations in this area, with an ethnographic study of one of the world's largest Nichiren Buddhist organizations and of the ideology of Asia's first Nobel-Laureate, poet, author, and philosopher, Rabindranath Tagore.

AB  - The sexuality of people with disabilities has historically been a site of oppression and discrimination. The sexuality of people with disabilities remains relatively under-researched and poorly understood. As a result, many myths and misconceptions about the sexuality of people with disabilities may prevail. This paper reports on findings from a qualitative study exploring the experiences of 13 people with physical disabilities in South Africa. A thematic analysis was conducted to explore how the sexuality of participants are constructed by others, as revealed by reported interactions with non-disabled people. Results show that often the sexuality of people with disabilities is erased by others, or they are questioned, often in prejudiced ways, and less frequently they are explored in intimate relationships.

AB  - This study explored the relationship between exposure to television programs featuring gay male characters and homonegativity in a diverse adult sample. Specifically, this relationship was examined at both the program and character level. Participants (N = 120) responded to an online survey that asked about exposure to television shows known to feature gay male characters that aired between 2000 and 2015. Next, participants recalled specific characters from these programs before reporting their homonegative attitudes and beliefs. Results revealed that both viewing programs featuring gay male characters and recall of specific gay male characters decreased their negative attitudes toward gay men in society, irrespective of individual difference factors (e.g., religiosity, gender, close interpersonal contact with gay men). Results are discussed in terms of mediated intergroup contact theory.

AB  - Janet Taylor Spence was a gender pioneer in her career as an academic psychologist and an important contributor to the psychological study of gender roles. That is, she both blazed a path for women in academia and contributed to our scientific understanding of the factors that produce and shape such paths. In this piece, I address both these aspects of her life and work. I begin by briefly highlighting Spence's groundbreaking posts in academia and her influence on my own academic career. With respect to her research, I identify five aspects of Spence's work that were innovative and made important, lasting contributions to theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding gender in the United States. I first describe Spence's commitment to challenging the ideological beliefs about gender held by laypeople and scientists alike by engaging in empirical tests of commonly held beliefs. I next review Spence's argument that within-individual variability of gender-typing of the self is normative rather than unusual. Third, I describe Spence's beliefs about the relation between gender-typing of the self and gender-typing of others, and fourth, I describe Spence's work concerning the mechanisms that support self-perceived femininity and masculinity. In the fifth and final section, I highlight Spence's treatment of environmental contributions to gender role development.

AB  - To preserve economic and social sustainability, countries impacted by international migration must prepare for the challenges that influx will bring to their societies, whether it be to their labor markets or their local, regional and national cultures. In essence, all areas of public life may be affected. Therefore, the exploration and recognition of the factors influencing integration, as well as the correlations behind attitudes of acceptance or rejection of the integration of immigrants, are essential. The present study contributes to the results in this field by revealing the beliefs behind the differences between groups accepting and rejecting immigrants, using a questionnaire database. Our survey sample consists of 444 Hungarian university students and 170 employees. The primary method of data analysis is binary logistic regression, completed by bivariate analyses. Our findings confirm that a positive, accepting attitude towards immigrants is more probable if an image is formed of them as being hardworking and that the work they do contributes to the economic development of the host country. Moreover, the integration of such individuals should not be seen as resulting in any unfavorable change in criminal statistics, working conditions, unemployment or discrimination. Additionally, the acceptance of immigrants as colleagues might be facilitated-in addition to their higher qualifications-by domestic (i.e., Hungarian) employees being better informed about immigration, and if immigrants occupy positions in which domestic employees are not willing to work.

T2  - SYNTHESE

KW  - Testimony

KW  - Epistemic injustice
KW  - Social cognition
AB  - There has been much recent discussion of the harmful role prejudicial stereotypes play in our communicative exchanges. For example, Fricker (Epistemic injustice: power and ethics of knowing, 2007) explores a type of injustice (testimonial injustice) which arises when the credibility judgments we make about speakers are informed by prejudicial stereotypes. This discussion has so far focused on the role stereotypes play in our epistemic assessments of communicative actions, rather than our interpretations of such actions. However, the same prejudicial stereotypes that infect credibility judgments can also infect our interpretation of the speaker, leading to uncharitable interpretation (call this 'interpretative injustice'). This paper explores the sources of interpretative injustice, and considers some of the harms to which it gives rise. There are several harms caused by interpretative injustice. Firstly, it constitutes a form of silencing. It prevents certain groups from being able to efficiently communicate knowledge to other (perhaps more powerful) groups. Secondly it results in speakers being held epistemically responsible for propositions they never intended to communicate. And thirdly, it contributes to the illusion that prejudicial low credibility judgments are epistemically justified. I close by arguing that if Miranda Fricker's strategy for treating testimonial injustice is implemented in absence of a treatment of interpretative injustice then we risk epistemically harming the hearer with little benefit to the speaker. Thus testimonial injustice and interpretative injustice are best treated in tandem.

AB  - Both historians and lay people attempt to explain national histories. However, psychological research, to date, focused predominantly on the patterns of those explanations with regard to negative historical behaviors. In this article, we assess ethnocentrism of people's explanations of both negative and positive historical behavior of ingroup members (own nation) and outgroup members (other nation). Two studies analyze how Poles explain crimes and heroic acts committed in the General Government, as well as diverse behaviors during the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. The studies confirm an ethnocentric pattern of explanation: positive historical actions of ingroup members were explained more dispositionally than positive actions of outgroup members-negative historical actions of ingroup members were explained less dispositionally than negative historical actions of outgroup members. Furthermore, we found that this effect is more pronounced among individuals who highly identify with their nation. Apart from the influence of the strength of ingroup identification, we found that people who cling to structured knowledge (i.e. a high ability to achieve cognitive closure) tend to explain well-established historical facts (e.g. the Holocaust) but not little known facts (e.g. intervention in Czechoslovakia) in a more ethnocentric way.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the expectations and evaluations of services provided by members of an ethnic minority using the lens of ethnic stereotypes. The authors also examine how ethnic service providers (ESPs) are evaluated by customers from the majority group vs the same ethnic group as the provider.
   Design/methodology/approach - In Study 1, the authors measure the stereotypes about skills, abilities, and typical professions associated with different ethnic groups (i.e. Chinese, South Asians and white). The authors then measure the effect of these stereotypes on the performance expectations from ESPs in different professional services. In Study 2, the authors manipulate the service domain (stereotypical vs counter-stereotypical) and the level of service performance (good: above average performance vs mediocre: below average) of a Chinese ESP, and subsequently measure the evaluation of the ESP by the same ethnic group (Chinese) vs majority group (white) participants.
   Findings - Performance expectations from ESPs closely match the stereotypes associated with the ethnic group. But the performance of an ESP (especially mediocre-level service) is evaluated differently by the same ethnic group vs majority group customers, depending upon the domain of service. A Chinese ESP providing mediocre service in a stereotypical domain (martial arts instructor) is evaluated more critically by same ethnic group (Chinese) participants as compared to white participants. In contrast, a Chinese ESP providing mediocre service in a counter-stereotypical domain (fitness instructor) is evaluated more favourably by same ethnic group (Chinese) participants as compared to white participants. There is no such difference when performance is good.
   Research limitations/implications - It is a common practice to employ ESPs to serve same ethnic group customers. While this strategy can be effective in a counter-stereotypical domain even if the ESP provides mediocre service, the findings suggest that this strategy can backfire when the performance is mediocre in a stereotypical service domain.
   Practical implications - The results demonstrate the need for emphasizing outcome (vis-a-vis interaction) quality where ESPs are employed to serve same ethnic group customers in a stereotypical service setting. However, when an ESP is offering a counter-stereotypical service, the emphasis needs to be more on the interpersonal processes (vis-a-vis outcome). Firms can gain by taking this into account in their hiring and training practices.
   Originality/value - Prior research has primarily used cultural distance to examine inter-cultural service encounters. The authors show that ethnic stereotypes pertaining to the skills and abilities of an ESP can affect evaluations beyond the role of cultural distance alone.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to find the predominant attitudes and cultural stereotypes towards immigrants in Spain among future teachers, and the sources of information that influence them the most. The mental associations caused by the words foreigner and immigrant, and the ranking of the immigrant nationalities - according to positive or negative attitudes towards them- are studied. In order to do this, stereotype functions are explained and an opinion survey of 151 students of the Primary Education degree at the University of Granada is analyzed. The research instrument is a 41 - item questionnaire with closed- and open-ended questions and it combines dichotomous and open questions with Likert scale questions. Data analysis was done with the SPSS 17.0 statistics software (Statistical Product and Service Solutions). The variables were subjected to descriptive analysis to obtain the frequency and percentages of the answers. We used inferential analysis to study the relationships between qualitative variables.
   Considering that stereotypes and prejudices hamper coexistence and are consolidated through a lack of intergroup contact - and therefore through a lack of knowledge of the Other-it becomes important to support these contacts in xenophobia.
   The word immigrant is associated in the first place with poverty, need and an illegal stay. The word foreigner is attributed to a person with money who resides legally in Spain for pleasure.
   The authors consider that the results of this study will be useful in diagnosing the current situation and later designing pedagogical interventions directed at increasing the acceptance of inclusive education principles among future teachers.
   This study is part of an I+D project, titled "The training of teachers of Spanish for immigrants in different educational contexts" (code EDU2013-43868-P).

AB  - People derive considerable amounts of information about each other from minimal nonverbal cues. Apart from characteristics typically regarded as obvious when encountering another person (e.g., age, race, and sex), perceivers can identify many other qualities about a person that are typically rather subtle. One such feature is sexual orientation. Here, I review the literature documenting the accurate perception of sexual orientation from nonverbal cues related to one's adornment, acoustics, actions, and appearance. In addition to chronicling studies that have demonstrated how people express and extract sexual orientation in each of these domains, I discuss some of the basic cognitive and perceptual processes that support these judgments, including how cues to sexual orientation manifest in behavioral (e.g., clothing choices) and structural (e.g., facial morphology) signals. Finally, I attend to boundary conditions in the accurate perception of sexual orientation, such as the states, traits, and group memberships that moderate individuals' ability to reliably decipher others' sexual orientation.

AB  - This articles handles methods and theory of the didactics of democratic learning and points out the importance of reflection in the learning process to create sustainable learning in the area of democratic and political education. There are countless methods in this area in many diverse disciplines, for example global and intercultural training, socio-political education and civic education, human rights education and peace education. Without reflection on social and structural circumstances and without the readiness to take responsibility on democratic society, all these methods have no real influence on student's learning outcomes. This paper gives an overview of the main theories and methods and shows how to teach these disciplines in a sustainable way. It gives impulses to reflect on teaching methods and to find a good balance between theory and self-awareness-games. The focus lies on a training-program over 3 half-day-trainings/lesson which comprises impulse-questions, self-awareness-methods and theoretical insights.

AB  - Encounters are politically and pedagogically charged. They have long been celebrated for their ability to chip away at prejudices, enact cultural destabilisations, shape subjectivities, and produce new knowledges. Yet encounters come with risk. The paper argues that encounters should be taken as very specific genres of contact and offers a conceptual interrogation of the notion of encounter, and its (dis)organisation, as a way of reflecting on the paradox of organised encounter'. In particular, the paper suggests that the promise and hope of organised encounter stands in tension with the recognition that encounters are inherently unpredictable -that they are about rupture and surprise. Taking this tension forward, the paper asks what possibilities remain for forms of planned encounter in intercultural contexts and focuses on two concerns. First, a concern with what happens when something that is inherently unpredictable becomes a site of intervention and secondly, a concern with the risks of encounter, and for whom the risks are most acutely felt. It finishes by reflecting on what it might mean to keep hold of the unpredictability of encounter in organised settings and what it means for questions of difference, power, and privilege.

AB  - Positive cross-group contact can undermine disadvantaged group members' collective action engagement. However, we hypothesised that positive cross-group contact in which an advantaged group member explicitly communicates opposition to inequality between groups ("supportive contact") would not undermine collective action and would be empowering for disadvantaged group members. Study 1 focused on cross-group contact between international students and domestic students at an Australian university. Study 2 focused on immigrants to Canada, and provided an opportunity for a cross-group contact with a Canadian-born individual. The results revealed that supportive contact heightened collective action engagement relative to a number of comparison conditions involving other forms of positive cross-group contact. Increased perceptions of injustice emerged as the key mediator of the relationship between supportive contact and increased collective action engagement.

AB  - Two studies examined the effects of reliance on direct and media-based contact for information about Muslims on Americans' stereotypic beliefs of and negative emotions toward Muslims and support for public policies harming Muslims domestically and internationally. Results revealed that reliance on media for information about Muslims was positively associated with stereotypic beliefs, negative emotions, and support for harmful policies. Reliance on direct contact for information about Muslims produced the opposite results. Results from a three-wave longitudinal design revealed that reliance on media and direct contact significantly predict changes in negative emotions which then predict changes in support for civil restrictions for Muslim Americans. We discuss the differential effects of reliance on media-based and direct contact in influencing intergroup outcomes.

AB  - In two cross-cultural studies, we examined the relationship between intrinsic religiosity (IR; inwardly held religious devotion), coalitional rigidity (CR; a rigid adherence to the superiority of the norms and beliefs of one's own group), and intergroup hostility (IH; morally impugning or wishing persecution on members of other groups). For Study 1, we analyzed a number of single-item interview questions in a data set collected from 10,068 people in 10 nations. For Study 2, we conducted our own surveys in two multicultural samples: Vancouver, Canada, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In all 18 religious subsamples from both studies, there were null or negative independent relationships between IR and some form of IH, and null or positive independent relationships between CR and such hostility. The results suggest that this pattern of prediction, which has previously been found in North American Christian samples, generalizes cross-culturally.

AB  - Bisexual people are often implored to "pick a side," implying that bisexuality is both more controllable and less desirable than heterosexuality or homosexuality. Bisexual people's status as a social group perceived to fall between a traditionally advantaged group and a traditionally disadvantaged group may have the potential to clarify lay conceptions of sexual orientation. We examined participants' views of groups varying in sexual orientation by randomly assigning participants (including heterosexual men and women as well as gay men and lesbian women) from four samples to evaluate heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual targets (N = 1379). Results provided strong evidence for the previously untested theoretical argument that bisexuality is perceived as less stable than heterosexuality or homosexuality. In addition, participants low in Personal Need for Structure rated female (but not male) bisexuality as relatively stable, suggesting that a preference for simple, binary thinking can partially explain a negative conception of an ostensibly "intermediate" identity. Bisexual targets were perceived as falling between heterosexual and homosexual targets in terms of gender nonconformity, and less decisive, less monogamous, and lacking in positive traits that were associated with homosexual targets. In sum, views of bisexual people were both more negative than and qualitatively different from views of gay men and lesbian women. We discuss the results as an illustration of the complex ways that perceivers' attitudes can differ depending on which target groups they are considering, suggesting that intergroup bias cannot be fully understood without attending to social categories viewed as intermediate.

AB  - Academic publication now dominates the lives of academics across the globe who must increasingly submit their research for publication in high profile English language journals to move up the career ladder. The dominance of English in academic publishing, however, has raised questions of communicative inequality and the possible 'linguistic injustice' against an author's mother tongue. Native English speakers are thought to have an advantage as they acquire the language naturalistically while second language users must invest more time, effort and money into formally learning it and may experience greater difficulties when writing in English. Attitude surveys reveal that English as an Additional Language authors often believe that editors and referees are prejudiced against them for any non-standard language. In this paper, I critically review the evidence for linguistic injustice through a survey of the literature and interviews with scholars working in Hong Kong. I argue that framing publication problems as a crude Native vs non-Native polarization not only draws on an outmoded respect for 'Native speaker' competence but serves to demoralizes EAL writers and marginalize the difficulties experienced by novice Ll English academics. The paper, then, is a call for a more inclusive and balanced view of academic publishing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We posit instructors' implicit racial bias as a factor in racial disparities in academic achievement and test the relationship between this factor, instructor lesson quality, and learners' subsequent test performance. In Study 1, white participants were assigned to the role of instructor and gave a short lesson to a learner who was either black or white. Instructors' implicit bias predicted diminished test performance on the part of black, but not white, learners. Further, instructors' anxiety and lesson quality, as rated by coders, mediated the relationship between their implicit bias and learners' test performance. In Study 2, a separate sample of non-black participants watched videos of instructors from cross-race lessons from the first experiment. Once again, instructors' implicit bias predicted diminished test performance by participants. These findings suggest that underperformance by minorities in academic domains may be driven by the effect implicit racial biases have on educators' pedagogical effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose - The workforce is becoming increasingly diverse and yet leadership research has lagged behind this trend. In particular, theory links leader-member exchange (LMX) to the development of racially diverse leaders (e.g. Scandura and Lankau, 1996). Yet, there remains a need for empirical evaluation of this premise. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, results of two studies of the effects of leader-member diversity on the LMX dimensions of professional respect, affect, loyalty, and contributions were examined. In the first study, supervisor-subordinate dyads in an applied work setting were examined, while in the second study a laboratory study was used.
   Findings - Results in Study 1 indicated that cross-race and minority dyads reported different LMX attributes of professional respect, affect, loyalty and contributions compared with dyads where both members were of the racial majority. In Study 2, racial compositions of dyads was not associated with reported differences in LMX relationships, but was associated with differences in task performance.
   Originality/value - This research provides the first systematic examination of the influence of racial diversity on LMX in a leader-follower dyad. As such, this work provides an important reference point in which future research on LMX and diversity can build. Such efforts will help future organizational leaders better navigate the increasingly diverse workplace.

AB  - Obesity stigma is highly prevalent in society and is acted upon by friends, family, teachers, and medical professionals. Widely held stereotypes and internalization thereof can negatively affect behavior change. Ways in which weight-related stigma consciousness, body esteem, and attitudes toward obese people play a role in eating behaviors were explored. Results showed that possession of a negative attitude toward obese people was related to stigma consciousness, low body esteem, and higher perceived barriers to healthy eating. Weight stigma and internalization of weight stigmata can be disempowering, and potentially undermine efforts to treat and prevent obesity.

AB  - Research into the relationship between religion and anti-gay attitudes frequently focuses on Christianity. We explored the role of religiosity dimensions, previous contact, and factors in the dual-process motivation model as predictors of explicit and implicit anti-gay attitudes in samples of Muslims and Atheists. The explicit and implicit attitudes of Muslims were more negative than the attitudes of Atheists. Explicit attitudes were more negative towards gay men than lesbians; implicit attitudes were negative towards gay men but were unexpectedly positive towards lesbians. In regression analyses, religious fundamentalism and extrinsic religious orientations (Study 1), and contact and right-wing authoritarianism (Study 2) were strong significant predictors of explicit anti-gay attitudes. Interestingly, none of the factors of interest predicted implicit anti-gay attitudes. These findings reveal a strong link between Islam and explicit anti-gay attitudes, but suggest that the relationship between religion and implicit anti-gay attitudes may be more complex than previously thought.

AB  - This paper begins by describing recent controversies over cross-contamination of crops in the United States and European Union. The EU and US are both applying the principle of freedom of cropping to resolve these conflicts, which is based on an individualistic philosophy. However, despite the EU and the US starting with the principle of freedom of cropping they have very dissimilar regulatory regimes for coexistence. These contradictory policies based upon the same principle are creating different sets of winners and losers. In the US the organic industry claims the system of coexistence is unfair and in the EU the biotech industry claims the system is unfair. It seems that states, despites claims to neutrality and freedom of choice, are prejudicing one system of agriculture over another in resolutions to the conflict over cross contamination. In this paper I will argue that if states cannot remain neutral in coexistence policies, there are conditional reasons for favoring the organic industry over the biotech industry in coexistence policies based in communitarian moral philosophy.

AB  - We investigated whether individual items on the nine item William's Perceived Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) functioned differently by age (< 45 vs >= 45) within five racial groups in the United States: Asians (n= 2,017); Hispanics (n= 2,688); Black Caribbeans (n= 1,377); African Americans (n= 3,434); and Whites (n= 854). We used data from the 2001-2003 National Survey of American Lives and the 2001-2003 National Latino and Asian Studies. Multiple-indicator, multiple-cause models (MIMIC) were used to examine differential item functioning (DIF) on the EDS by age within each racial/ethnic group. Overall, Asian and Hispanic respondents reported less discrimination than Whites; on the other hand, African Americans and Black Caribbeans reported more discrimination than Whites. Regardless of race/ethnicity, the younger respondents (aged < 45 years) reported less discrimination than the older respondents (aged >= 45 years). In terms of age by race/ethnicity, the results were mixed for 19 out of 45 tests of DIF (40%). No differences in item function were observed among Black Caribbeans. "Being called names or insulted" and others acting as "if they are afraid" of the respondents were the only two items that did not exhibit differential item functioning by age across all racial/ethnic groups. Overall, our findings suggest that the EDS scale should be used with caution in multi-age multi-racial/ethnic samples.

AB  - Objective: to analyze the meanings of leprosy for people treated during the sulfonic and multidrug therapy periods. Method: qualitative nature study based on the Vigotski's historical-cultural approach, which guided the production and analysis of data. It included eight respondents who have had leprosy and were submitted to sulfonic and multidrug therapy treatments. The participants are also members of the Movement for Reintegration of People Affected by Leprosy. Results: the meanings were organized into three meaning cores: spots on the body: something is out of order; leprosy or hanseniasis? and leprosy from the inclusion in the Movement for Reintegration of People Affected by Leprosy. Conclusion: the meanings of leprosy for people submitted to both regimens point to a complex construction thereof, indicating differences and similarities in both treatments. Health professionals may contribute to the change of the meanings, since these are socially constructed and the changes are continuous.

AB  - Four experiments provide evidence for the hypothesis that we can "catch" racial bias from others by merely observing subtle nonverbal cues. Video recordings were made of white participants (with varying levels of racial bias) interacting with a neutral black confederate. Videos contained subtle expressions of positivity or negativity, corresponding to white participants' levels of bias. Participants randomly assigned to observe the subtle anti-black bias videos (vs. pro-black) formed more negative impressions of the black person (Experiment 1), adopted more negative racial stereotypes (Experiment 2), and demonstrated greater anti-black bias themselves (Experiment 3). Participants only demonstrated increased bias when they knew that a black person was the target (vs. white; Experiment 4). Results suggest that nonverbal expressions of racial bias affect more than simply the actor and target they affect passive, naive observers. The good news, however, is that the same is true of pro-black bias. Implications for organizations are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This contribution investigates perceptions of Arab nomads in the hagiography of the Late Antique East. Over the past decades, these texts, mostly saints' lives and episodes from church histories, have often been used to provide social and cultural historians with information on the ethnography, geography, customs and manners of those labelled "Saracens" or "Ishmaelites" in the texts. However, the historicity of the narratives is difficult to assess, and a closer inspection reveals that most of the motifs used in Late Antiquity revert to older models from Classical Antiquity. The article therefore focuses on specific aspects, such as how the writers depicted the Arabs' manners and customs as contrasting with their own societies and constructed a dichotomy between the civilisation and the animal-like ferocity of the former. It becomes clear that Christian authors used the depiction of the Arabs' seemingly deviant lifestyle in order to both reassure their readership and excite its curiosity. The display of God's omnipotence in a large number of the texts discussed here offered a chance to demonstrate that Christian saints could eventually convert such people, or, when conversion was not possible, could still hope for very potent miracles.

AB  - Social desirability can influence reports of stigma change in that subscribing to stigmatizing attitudes might pose a threat to personal beliefs of open-mindedness, while endorsing difference might not be as troubling. A measure is needed that assesses stigma change but is less susceptible to desirability effects. This study examined the psychometrics of various assessments of perceived difference from a person with mental illness. A total of 460 participants were recruited online using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Four measures of difference, the Likert Scale of Difference, Semantic Differential: Similar-Different Scale, Semantic Differential: Mental Illness versus Other Illness scale, and Cause of Perceived Difference Scale were compared to measures of stereotypes, affirming attitudes, and care seeking. A vignette describing a person with mental illness anchored the Difference Scale and a measure of stereotype. Results showed that measures of difference yielded significantly higher endorsements than measures of stereotypes; the Semantic Differential Scale: Similar-Different was endorsed at a higher rate than other difference scales. Difference scores were positively related to stereotypes and inversely related to affirming attitudes. Difference was also found to influence empowerment separate from, and in addition to stereotype. These results suggest a new domain as an efficient and sensitive measure of stigma change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present research examined how differences in attachment style might impact women's awareness of sexism. Identity threat models of stigma emphasize the role of individual differences in responding to social identity threats, however little is known about what factors lead to avoidance versus vigilance for such threats. Furthermore, research shows that insecure attachment is related to avoidant responses to blatantly threatening cues, but vigilance when such cues are ambiguous. Thus, insecurely attached women should acknowledge less sexism toward women when faced with instances of blatant sexism, whereas their awareness should be heightened by instances of ambiguous sexism. Conversely, securely attached women should acknowledge sexism when encountering blatant rather than ambiguous instances of sexism. In a test of these hypotheses, 155 women were exposed to either a male verbally rejecting a women's opinion for blatantly sexist or ambiguously sexist reasons. The data confirm predictions. The findings suggest interventions to improve outcomes for stigmatized groups should consider impacts of attachment style, and further, that attachment style might partially explain women's divergent responses to sexism.

AB  - Since the end of the Civil Rights Movement, large numbers of black people have made their way into settings previously occupied only by whites, though their reception has been mixed. Overwhelmingly white neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, restaurants, and other public spaces remain. Blacks perceive such settings as "the white space," which they often consider to be informally "off limits" for people like them. Meanwhile, despite the growth of an enormous black middle class, many whites assume that the natural black space is that destitute and fearsome locality so commonly featured in the public media, including popular books, music and videos, and the TV news-the iconic ghetto. White people typically avoid black space, but black people are required to navigate the white space as a condition of their existence.

AB  - Although blatant expressions of sexism in the American workforce appear on the decline, many researchers note that discrimination is not disappearing but is instead becoming more subtle and ambiguous. Drawing from Sue et al.'s construct of microaggressions, which examines manifestations of prejudice ranging from subtle to overt, the present research provides the first known empirical investigation of gender differences in third-party perceptions of microaggressions against women at work. Undergraduate women and men read vignettes describing interactions between male supervisors and female subordinates, which portrayed potentially discriminatory supervisor behavior, ranging in explicitness from subtle to blatant. Results indicate that although both men and women perceive differences in microaggression explicitness, women tend to detect greater discrimination than men, particularly when instances are subtle in nature. Both genders expect microaggressions to generate more negative work outcomes as explicitness increases. We discuss practical implications of our research, including the importance of raising awareness of workplace gender microaggressions, especially its most subtle forms, and of developing supporting programs to help observers of discrimination, who may be more likely to be women in cases of perceived microaggressions against women. Future research directions for addressing the broad range of discrimination facing working women today are also explored.

AB  - Although the relationship between an individual's racist attitudes and discriminatory behaviours has been widely studied, the association between racist attitudes among perpetrators and experiences of racism among targets has been under-examined. Based on data from the 2001-8 Australian Challenging Racism Project survey, this paper details a novel method to investigate the link between racist attitudes and experiences of discrimination utilising two separate models linked by nomination of cultural or ethnic groups who do not fit into Australian society (i.e., out-groups). Those identified as out-groups were more likely to report experiences of discrimination than those who were not nominated as out-groups. Overall, out-group nomination by those with racist attitudes strongly predict experiences of discrimination among these same target out-groups, OR = 2.2, F(6, 12,348) = 78.61, p < .001. Racist attitudes are related to racist behaviours among perpetrators that are, in turn, related to experiences of racial discrimination among targets. This study demonstrates that attitudes not only affect majority group behaviour but also drive the resulting experiences of discrimination for minority group members. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Most contemporary research on disgust can be divided into "disgust advocates" and "disgust skeptics." The so-called advocates argue that disgust can have a positive influence on our moral judgment; skeptics warn that it can mislead us toward prejudice and discrimination. This article compares this disagreement to a structurally similar debate in the field of genocide studies concerning the phenomenon of "perpetrator abhorrence." While some soldiers report having felt strong disgust in the moment of committing or witnessing atrocity, scholars disagree on whether such disgust is moral in nature. These empirical cases provide us with reasons to reconsider the normative features of disgust. Inspired by the conceptualization of disgust in Immanuel Kant and Aurel Kolnai, and as an alternative to both the disgust advocates and the skeptics, this article argues that the analogy of a stop sign can better help us define disgust responses.

AB  - Little research has been done on Western women who convert to Shii Islam. To fill this gap, this study was conducted on American and Canadian women who have converted to Shii Islam. Most of the research subjects in this study reported a moderate to severe sense of social marginalization after conversion. This marginalization resulted from membership in multiple minority groups (Shii, Muslim, convert, and female); Black converts reported the most severe sense of marginalization due to the added pressure of being a racial minority in North America. Most of the research subjects also experienced a sense of social exclusion from other Shii Muslims. Therefore, the question arises as to why these women continued to adhere to Shii Islam despite these difficulties. This article will attempt to answer this question through an analysis of the data provided by the research subjects.
   Peu de recherches ont ete effectuees sur les femmes occidentales qui se convertissent a l'Islam Chiite. Cette etude va donc permettre de combler cette lacune sur les femmes americaines et canadiennes qui se sont convertis a l'Islam Chiite. La plupart des sujets de cette recherche demontrent une marginalisation sociale moderee ou intense apres la conversion. Cette marginalisation est causee par l'appartenance a de multiples groupes minoritaires (Chiite, Musulman, converti, et gente feminine) ; les Noirs convertis ressentent un plus profond sentiment de marginalisation du par une pression supplementaire d'appartenance a une minorite visible raciale en Amerique du Nord. La plupart des sujets de recherche ont porte leur experimentation sur le sentiment d'exclusion sociale des autres groupes Musulmans Chiites. Par consequent, la question se pose sur la raison pour laquelle ces femmes ont continue a adherer a l'Islam Chiite en depit de ces difficultes. Cet article tentera de repondre a cette question grace a une analyse de donnees fournies a travers des sujets de recherche.

People answer a single question; their romantic relationships improve over several weeks. At-risk students complete a 1-hour reading-and-writing exercise; their grades rise and their health improves for the next 3 years. Each statement may sound outlandishmore science fiction than science. Yet each represents the results of a recent study in psychological science (respectively, Bryan, Walton, Rogers, & Dweck, 2011; Marigold, Holmes, & Ross, 2007, 2010; Walton & Cohen, 2011). These studies have shown, more than one might have thought, that specific psychological processes contribute to major social problems. These processes act as levers in complex systems that give rise to social problems. Precise interventions that alter themwhat I call wise interventionscan produce significant benefits and do so over time. What are wise interventions? How do they work? And how can they help solve social problems?

AB  - Despite ample research linking conservatism to discrimination and liberalism to tolerance, both groups may discriminate. In two studies, we investigated whether conservatives and liberals support discrimination against value violators, and whether liberals' and conservatives' values distinctly affect discrimination. Results demonstrated that liberals and conservatives supported discrimination against ideologically dissimilar groups, an effect mediated by perceptions of value violations. Liberals were more likely than conservatives to espouse egalitarianism and universalism, which attenuated their discrimination; whereas the conservatives' value of traditionalism predicted more discrimination, and their value of self-reliance predicted less discrimination. This suggests liberals and conservatives are equally likely to discriminate against value violators, but liberal values may ameliorate discrimination more than conservative values.

AB  - "Philosophical Terminology" (1899-1900), the essay by Ferdinand Tonnies with which he won the Welby Prize, constitutes the first - and for long the only - example of dialogue between sociology and semiotics. Tonnies delineated a complex theory of signs beginning from his theory of will as developed in his monograph Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887). Through an original interpretation of the analogy between word and money he was ahead of his times in foreseeing the fundamental role carried out by language in structuring social relations. All the same, his analogical approach to the relation between word and money - as had already been observed by Victoria Lady Welby - also represents the weak point in his argumentations in the essay in question. An important contribution for a better understanding of the relations subtending the social production processes of signs and language is that offered by Ferruccio Rossi-Landi with his homological method. Tonnies' own work can be read in this framework and further developed.

AB  - Studies of those who rescued Jews during the Holocaust suggest that their most shared quality was a sense of belonging to one human family (Monroe, 1996, p. 205), caring deeply about human beings without regard for their race, religion, or other distinction. In this article, we first note the development of the concept of one humanity since the late 15th century, and then we summarize recent work with a new measure of that caringthe Identification With All Humanity Scale (IWAH). Research with the IWAH establishes that identification with all humanity is more than (a) an absence of prejudice and its sources and (b) the sum of positive qualities, such as dispositional empathy and principled moral reasoning. Many people appear to intuit that a mature moral person would identify with all humanity, even when they do not do so themselves. Finally, a brief discussion is offered of how identification with all humanity may develop or could be taught.

AB  - People often fail to empathize with others, and sometimes even experience schadenfreude-pleasure at others' misfortunes. One potent predictor of schadenfreude is envy, which, according to the stereotype content model, is elicited by high-status, competitive targets. Here we review our recent research program investigating the relationships among stereotypes, envy, schadenfreude, and harm. Experiment 1 demonstrates that stereotypes are sufficient to influence affective responses to targets' misfortunes; participants not only report feeling less negative when misfortunes befall high-status, competitive targets as compared to other targets, they also smile more (assessed with facial EMG). Experiment 2 replicates the self-report findings from Experiment 1 and assesses behavioral tendencies toward envied targets; participants are more willing to endorse harming high-status, competitive targets as compared to other targets. Experiment 3 turns off the schadenfreude response by manipulating status and competition-relevant information regarding envied targets. Finally, Experiment 4 investigates affective and neural markers of intergroup envy and schadenfreude in the context of a long-standing sports rivalry and the extent to which neurophysiological correlates of schadenfreude are related to self-reported likelihood of harming rival team fans. We conclude with implications and future directions.

AB  - In the 1830s, when 20-year-old medical student Charles Poyen (1815-1844) began the demonstration tour that led to the popularization of animal magnetism in New England, he met with considerable resistance from both the medical profession and the general public. Skeptics argued that the phenomena apparently demonstrated during mesmeric sessions were so extraordinary that they had to be the result of intentional deception. The deception argument was bolstered by referencing the then popular prejudices against the working-class women who served as mesmeric subjects. Conveniently, these prejudices included belief in a special talent for deception that was not found in women from more respectable backgrounds. Mesmerists defended themselves against accusations of dishonesty by publicizing the achievements of Lurena Brackett (1816-1857), a young woman who escaped the prejudices associated with the working-class mesmeric subjects but still demonstrated apparently extraordinary mesmeric phenomena. The well-publicized story of Lurena regaining her sight during mesmeric seances is acknowledged as important in establishing the popularity of mesmerism in the United States. Lurena's supporters argued that her respectable background made deception impossible. This article uses Shorter's work on the history of hysteria and Trembinski's analysis of the history of trauma to argue that some of the seemingly extraordinary phenomena observed during a mesmeric seance can be better understood with reference to conversion disorder and the concept of hypnotic suggestion rather than intentional deception. While Lurena's respectability made her audience ready to accept her credibility, a conversion disorder would have produced the physical symptoms that responded so convincingly to mesmerism.

AB  - Gender identity is a sociocultural construct based (in nearly every society) on a binary norm: female and male. Transsexual individuals suffer from intense family and social discrimination because they express a dissident sexuality incongruent with this norm. They assert they feel trapped in a body that does not belong to them, so they seek help from health professionals to modify their bodies, to "adapt their bodies to their minds." This essay discusses health care for transsexual persons in Cuba from a human rights perspective that does not pathologize their gender identification.

AB  - We hypothesize that while evaluative priming involves proprioceptive cues, the IAT is representational due to its structural features and the specific algorithm upon which the IAT-effect rests. As predicted, evaluative priming is shown to rely on differential facial muscle activity while the IAT as a measurement instrument is not influenced by proprioceptive information. Evaluative priming does not yield differential responsiveness for congruent and incongruent trials when facial muscle activity is inhibited whereas the IAT-effect is shown to be impervious to such inhibition. Implications for the underlying mechanisms of implicit measures are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social-class discrimination is evident in many societies around the world, but little is known about its impact on the poor or its role as an explanatory variable in the link between socioeconomic status and health. The current study tested the extent to which perceived discrimination explains socioeconomic gradients in physical health. Participants were 252 adolescents (51% male, 49% female; mean age = 17.51 years, SD = 1.03 years) who participated in Wave 3 of an ongoing longitudinal study focusing on the developmental consequences of rural poverty. Physical health was operationalized as allostatic load, a measure of cumulative wear and tear on the body caused by overactivation of physiological systems that respond to stress. Mediation analyses suggested that 13% of the effect of poverty on allostatic load is explained by perceived discrimination. The findings suggest that social-class discrimination is one important mechanism behind the influence of poverty on physical health.

AB  - The personal and societal devastations wrought by the genocidal actions of individuals remain confounding to psychologists. As instructors aim to increase students' engagement in global concerns, courses that address the often confusing interplay among prejudice, mass persuasion, human aggression, and prosocial behavior seem to be well placed to reduce these ambiguities. With previous examples in the teaching literature scarce, this article describes a new course on the psychology of genocide through an interdisciplinary blend of historical and psychological evidence of the single worst episode of genocide in human history: the Holocaust. Course themes and topics, readings and assignments, and recommended audiovisual supports provide a useful framework for future application of this new course in the psychology of genocide.

AB  - In the present paper, relying on event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we investigated the automatic nature of gender categorization focusing on different stages of the ongoing process. In particular, we explored the degree to which gender categorization occurs automatically by manipulating the semantic vs. nonsemantic processing goals requested by the task (Study 1) and the complexity of the task itself (Study 2). Results of Study 1 highlighted the automatic nature of categorization at an early (N170) and on a later processing stage (P300). Findings of Study 2 showed that at an early stage categorization was automatically driven by the ease of extraction of category-based knowledge from faces while, at a later stage, categorization was more influenced by situational constrains.

AB  - As Richard Wright's last short story, "Big Black Good Man'' has received modest but not very detailed attention from scholars, who often use it to hypothesize about how his fiction might have developed had he lived longer. But while opinions differ on this score and on the story's merits, all assume that the black American sailor Jim is a gentle giant who represents Wright's triumphant rebuttal of white fantasies about black violence like those harbored by the Danish hotel clerk Olaf. However, careful analysis suggests that Olaf's supposed racism is somewhat exaggerated while Jim's behavior is much more questionable morally than critics have assumed. The story resembles others by Wright flawed by a compulsive preoccupation with violence that the author seems not fully aware or in control of. Now, more than half a century after its initial publication, altered political and social circumstances invite a juster appreciation of Wright's virtues and faults as displayed in this story.

AB  - Ethnic minorities often have shown higher mean levels of authoritarianism compared to Whites. However, no theoretical mechanism has been directly tested to explain these ethnicity differences. Using the stigma literature as a framework, two studies are presented that test a novel explanation for this difference, rooted in the devaluing that accompanies being a member of a stigmatized group in society. The results show that, in Study 1, ethnic minorities reported higher levels of authoritarianism in ways that could not be explained by traditional explanations of authoritarianism, including lower income, lower education, or lack of cognitive complexity. However, in Study 2, when participants were given the opportunity to affirm their sense of worth, ethnic minorities did not differ in their mean levels of authoritarianism compared to Whites. These findings are discussed in the context of understanding ethnic minority endorsement of authoritarianism in terms of self-regulatory processes that may be related to their stigmatized condition in society.

The present study examined the reactions of college students with disabilities to being primed with different aspects of their identity and how individual differences in stigma consciousness moderate this effect. Design: After being primed with their identity as a person with a disability or a student, college students with disabilities (n = 116) completed measures of autonomy-related thoughts, help-seeking, and stigma consciousness. Results: Students primed with their disability status activated autonomy-related thoughts less than the participants primed with their student identity. Moreover, as predicted, the priming manipulation had a stronger impact for participants higher in stigma consciousness. Across all participants, greater activation of autonomy-related thoughts was associated with a lower likelihood of seeking help. Conclusion: Depending on the aspect of their identity that is most salient in a given context and their level of stigma consciousness, people with disabilities can access autonomy-related thoughts to a greater or lesser extent. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Teaching of psychology courses trains graduate students in pedagogy, but little is known about how diversity is addressed in these courses. A survey of instructors in teaching of psychology courses assessed their coverage of diversity and classroom bias, as well as the instructional methods used to cover them. Results indicated that 87% of instructors covered diversity issues, and 78% covered bias that occurs in the classroom. Instructors who covered diversity and bias devoted 3 to 5 hr to the topics and primarily used traditional instructional methods, such as discussion, readings, and lectures. Older instructors tended to cover fewer topics than younger instructors. Although diversity topics are part of teaching of psychology courses, it is unlikely that the time devoted to the topics is sufficient preparation for teaching in diverse classrooms.

AB  - Empathy is a critical function regulating human social life. In particular, empathy for pain is a source of deep emotional feelings and a strong trigger of pro-social behavior. We investigated the existence of a racial bias in the emotional reaction to other people's pain and its link with implicit racist biases. Measuring participants' physiological arousal, we found that Caucasian observers reacted to pain suffered by African people significantly less than to pain of Caucasian people. The reduced reaction to the pain of African individuals was also correlated with the observers' individual implicit race bias. The role of others' race in moderating empathic reactions is a crucial clue for understanding to what extent social interactions, and possibly integration, may be influenced by deeply rooted automatic and uncontrollable responses.

AB  - The topic of Muslim integration in Western societies such as Australia has generated much interest and comment. Despite factors that might promote Muslim inclusion in Australia, there has been an unofficial policy swing back to promoting monoculturalism, which threatens to establish a two-tier Australian national identity. This article criticizes the notion of an inherent conflict between Australian and Muslim identities and examines how a group of 200 Australian-born practising Muslims living predominantly in New South Wales and Victoria value their Muslim and Australian identities. It finds they strongly value being Muslim, while also valuing a concept of Australian identity that is affirming and inclusive and consists of achievable attributes, despite also struggling with perceptions of discrimination and prejudice.

AB  - Transference occurs when a perceiver's representation of a significant other is activated and applied to a new target person (Andersen & Chen, 2002). Extending past research, it was hypothesized that transference occurs even when a target person possesses a core feature-namely, group membership status-that is inapplicable to the relevant significant-other representation. Supporting this, transference led perceivers to make representation-consistent memory and evaluation judgments about a target-regardless of whether the target's political (experiment 1) or ethnic (experiment 2) group membership was the same or different from that of the relevant significant other. Moreover, in experiment 2, perceivers undergoing transference involving a positively evaluated significant other behaved more positively toward the target even when the target was from an ethnic out-group. The results represent initial evidence of transference processes occurring across group boundaries. Implications for transference and the reduction of out-group bias are discussed.

AB  - Two studies examined bias correction by manipulating a perceived chronic judgmental bias (i.e., overestimator/underestimator) using a modified dot estimation task. In Experiment 1, participants corrected for this perceived estimation bias by making adjustments away from the arbitrary feedback about their personal bias tendencies. In Experiment 2, the perceived desirability of the same estimation bias was manipulated. Results indicated that self-enhancement concerns impacted perceivers' motivation to correct, at a cost to accuracy. These studies expand our current understanding of theory-based correction by including self-enhancement motives as causes of correction, demonstrating that such corrections can decrease rather than increase judgment accuracy, and illustrating the usefulness of a new perceived bias manipulation in theory testing.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate similarities and particularities of barriers encountered by different immigrant groups when entering the labor market, to define the modes of how immigrants deal with barriers and to detect determinants influencing these modes, comparing two groups of immigrants to Israel. On the basis of twofold criteria (number of barriers and coping with barriers) we created modes classifying the ways in which immigrants deal with barriers: "the easy going", encountered few barriers and showed high coping; "the fighters", - many barriers and high coping; "the incapable", - few barriers and low coping, and "the disadvantaged", - many barriers and low coping. Whereas the majority of the Ethiopian immigrants were dispersed between the "disadvantaged" and "fighters" modes, the majority of Former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants were positioned in the "fighters" mode. The results reveal that FSU immigrants encountered different barriers than immigrants from Ethiopia and coped with them better. Human capital characteristics of immigrants explain the distribution of immigrants between the modes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior research has found that positive affect, compared to negative affect, increases stereotype activation. In four experiments the authors explore whether the link between affect and stereotype activation depends on the relative accessibility of stereotype-relevant thoughts and response tendencies. As well as manipulating mood, the authors measured or manipulated the accessibility of egalitarian response tendencies (Experiments 1 and 2) and counterstereotypic thoughts (Experiments 2 through 4). In the absence of such response tendencies and thoughts, people in positive moods displayed greater stereotype activation-consistent with past research. By contrast, in the presence of accessible egalitarian response tendencies or counterstereotypic thoughts, people in positive moods exhibited less stereotype activation than those in negative moods. Implications of these results for existing affect-cognition models are discussed.

The focus is on citizenship issues and marriage migration, patterns of socioeconomic, cultural and legal integration and/or exclusion, and prejudice against international migrant spouses. The aim is to contribute to our understanding of how state policies on migration and citizenship shape patterns of cross-national marriage and forms of migrant integration into a specific society. Connecting statistical, interview and survey findings, the article also illustrates the role of the state and societal attitudes in shaping citizenship, channelling the regional choice of migrant marriage partners for Greek Cypriot men and women and influencing integration patterns for non-national spouses.

AB  - Interculturality may be something normal which everyone possesses to a degree. However, dominant neo-essentialist theories of culture give the impression that we are too different to easily cross-cultural boundaries. These theories support the development of academic disciplines and the need for professional certainty in intercultural training. There is an illusion of neutrality in established cultural descriptions such as collectivism and individualism. The criticism of this position is that such theories and descriptions may instead be ideologically constructed, and represent an idealised Self and a demonised non-Western Other. This denial of ideology results in a liberal-essentialist duality which also underpins multiculturalism. A critical cosmopolitanist approach and a social action theory of society project a different picture of culture which resides in realities which respond to personal circumstances. A cultural realism not only acknowledges the influence of national structures but also allows for the agency of the individual. However, the Centre positioning of established theories of culture means that emergent realities residing on the always defined Periphery need to assert an existence that the always defining Centre needs to appreciate.

AB  - The goal of the present research was to investigate the role of three central-executive functionsswitching of mental sets, inhibition of prepotent responses, and simultaneous storage and processing (i.e., working-memory capacity)in accounting for method variance in the Implicit Association Test (IAT). In two studies, several IATs with unrelated contents were administered along with a battery of central-executive tasks, with multiple tasks tapping each of the above executive functions. Method variance was found to be related to the switching factor, but not to the inhibition factor. There was also evidence for a small independent contribution of the working-memory capacity factor. The findings constrain process accounts of the IAT, lending support to an account in terms of task-set switching, and they have consequences for applications.

In addition to specific methodological issues, Rughinis addresses the relevance to such surveys of qualitative research in Romani communities.

AB  - Drug-related overdose deaths topped 100,000 between 2020 and 2021. Opioids and stimulants are implicated as the primary drivers of this public health crisis. Stigma remains one of the primary barriers to treatment and recovery from substance use disorders. However, little is known about how stigma varies across different substance types, whether individuals are actively using or in recovery, and medical versus recreational onset. We examined these questions using data from the 2021 Shatterproof Addiction Stigma Index, the only nationally representative data available on this topic. Respondents (N = 7051) completed a vignette-based survey experiment to assess public stigma (social distance, prejudice, competence, and causal attributions) toward people with alcohol, opioid (following a prescription pain or recreational use onset), heroin, or methamphetamine dependencies. Vignette characters were described as active users or in recovery. Adjusting for covariates (e.g., race, age, gender), prejudice and desire for social distance were highest toward heroin and methamphetamine, and lowest toward alcohol dependence. The perceived onset of the dependency affected stigma. Specifically, prescription opioids with a recreational onset were more stigmatized than those with a medical onset. Moreover, individuals depicted as being in recovery were less stigmatized than those depicted as active users. Recovery status had the largest impact on prejudice and social distance toward methamphetamine, relative to other conditions. The nature and magnitude of substance dependency stigma differs across substance types and onset and offset conditions. Reducing stigma will require tailored strategies that consider the multidimensional nature of stigma toward people with addiction.

AB  - We tested how Muslim participants identify speeches as hate speech or not, and whether they thought an apology from the speakers is needed. In Studies 1a (N = 209) and 1b (N = 183), participants were asked about a speech delivered by a prominent ingroup figure showed that hate, meta-hate, and collective narcissism tended to identify a prejudiced speech about outgroup members as not related to hate speech, and thus no apology is needed. Nonetheless, the resulting path was in contrast to participants who believe the outgroup nature as good. With similar predictors of Study 1, Study 2 (N = 191) showed that when participants were asked to identify a (non-harmful) speech about ingroup delivered by a minority outgroup member, there was an opposite path compared to Study 1. Across all findings, we argue that in the real-world setting, how a speech, with or without harmful contents, is identified depends on positive or negative views about ingroup and outgroup members by which it can dictate people's understanding and denial.

AB  - How rampant is political discrimination in the United States, and how does it compare to other sources of bias in apolitical interactions? We employ a conjoint experiment to juxtapose the discriminatory effects of salient social categories across a range of contexts. The conjoint framework enables identification of social groups' distinct causal effects, ceteris paribus, and minimizes 'cheap talk,' social desirability bias, and spurious conclusions from statistical discrimination. We find pronounced discrimination along the lines of party and ideology, as well as politicized identities such as religion and sexual orientation. We also find desire for homophily along more dimensions, as well as specific out-group negativity. We also find important differences between Democrats and Republicans, with discrimination by partisans often focusing on other groups with political relevance of their own. Perhaps most striking, though, is how much discrimination emerges along political lines - both partisan and ideological. Yet, counter-stereotypic ideological labels can counter, and even erase, the discriminatory consequences of party.

AB  - I am writing about how whiteness works in the United States and Mexico, by looking at portraits by one photographer in Mexico, Yvonne Venegas and one photographer in the United States, Dana Lixenberg. I understand whiteness as something that goes beyond a skin tonality and that does something in the world. I analyze symbols and poses in portraiture to interpret how whiteness is performed and, also, how (through cultural, social and economic schemes of whiteness, by the photographer) the subject is called back into whiteness. I found that whiteness is performed similarly in both cultural contexts I examined, and although mestizaje in Mexico and slavery in the United States defined race relations in distinctive ways, whiteness must be studied as something that goes beyond a pigment and more in alignment with social and economic class perceptions. I propose study of pigmentocracy as an interlocking skin-color/class system in which skin tones are perceived based on social and cultural prejudices and linked to particular socioeconomic levels. In this system, perceptions of class and skin color work as self-reproducing and interdependent power apparatuses and dispositifs.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the experiences of transgender and gender non-binary (TNB) physicians in medical residency training programs. Aim: To identify the self-reported experiences and needs of TNB individuals during medical residency in United States training programs. Methods: An online, anonymous survey of TNB current residents and recent graduates was designed. Results: A total of 26 respondents completed the survey. The most common reported gender identity was non-binary or gender queer (n = 11, 42.3%) and male or transgender man (n = 7, 26.9%). About half of participants (n = 14, 53.8%) had undergone gender affirming interventions prior to residency. Most participants (n = 19, 73.1%) did not know all the gender affirming healthcare benefits offered by their program. The majority (n = 21, 80.8%) also reported 2 hours or less of transgender-related didactics in residency. Respondents were most likely to disclose their gender identity to other residents (n = 19, 73.1%) and faculty (n = 19, 73.1%) and were least likely to disclose their identity to patients (n = 6, 23.1%). Most respondents (n = 15, 57.7%) stated that program faculty and staff communicated support for their gender identity. Most participants (n = 16, 61.5%) reported that they perceived transgender residents to be treated similarly to their non-transgender peers in their training program, while the remainder (n = 7, 26.9%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. Nevertheless, approximately three-quarters of trainees (n = 22, 84.6%) self-reported microaggressions during their training program and non-binary and transfeminine trainees were more likely to report these experiences than transmasculine people. Nearly a quarter of transfeminine and non-binary participants reported macroaggressions, with none of the transmasculine respondents reporting these negative experiences. Most macroaggressions were from program faculty. Discussion: This study highlights that while most physicians in residency report support from their program for their TNB identity, TNB physicians still experience significant barriers and prejudices throughout training and more action is needed among program faculty for support of TNB trainees.

AB  - Background Cultural safety requires healthcare professionals and organisations to improve healthcare, facilitate patient access to healthcare, and achieve equity within the workforce. Methods This ethnomethodological study, which consisted of two phases, explored the concept of cultural safety from the perspective of Advanced Practice Nurses. Semi-structured interviews and the nominal group technique were used to prioritise challenges related to cultural safety, identify barriers to clinical practise and assess educational needs. The data collected was subjected to thematic analysis. Results Nurses working in Austria, Germany and Switzerland were recruited (N = 29). Accordingly, the phenomenon of cultural safety in health care is not generally known and there is little prior knowledge about it. The most frequently discussed themes were communication difficulties, lack of knowledge, the treatment of people with insufficient language skills and expectations of treatment goals and outcomes, which can lead to conflicts and accusations of unequal treatment due to diverse cultural backgrounds. Conclusion Diverse cultures are encountered in German-speaking healthcare settings. Cultural safety is also about healthcare staff, as nurses with different socialisations encounter prejudice, discrimination and racism. Although the issue of power was not discussed, academic nurses were willing to make an effort to change. Only a minority were aware that lasting change requires challenging one's own cultural structures and adapted behaviours, rather than pushing for the mere acquisition of cultural competence. Organisations were encouraged to introduce self-reflection sessions and provide better access to translation services to improve equity and support nurses.

AB  - Despite the proactive efforts of many firms to combat gender bias within their organizations, societal prejudices still disadvantage women leaders and the firms who employ them. This external gender bias shapes outside stakeholder evaluations of women leaders' efforts in various ways, and firms need strategies to cope with this external gender bias. We examine the conditions that might alleviate this burden of external bias and what women leaders and top executives can do to leverage these conditions-from a strategic positioning perspective-that will effectively allow female leaders to differentiate their work. To do this, we synthesize and build upon evidence that the external gender bias against women leaders diminishes when they lead in areas that are unconventional rather than mainstream. We then propose a two-step process based on (1) identifying the likely threat of external gender bias, which is stronger in some industry contexts than others, and (2) leveraging unconventionality to circumvent male prototypical comparisons, thereby reducing the hazards of external gender bias.

This is a theoretical study of the importance of race in whiteness discourse characterised by exnomination, universality, and normativity, in relation to identity politics and othering, and understood through the lens of intersectionality within the broader field of New Testament studies. In the closing reflections, possible connections between whiteness and anti-Jewish interpretations are considered.

AB  - In 2018 the Bruce McArthur serial killer case became the largest forensic homicide investigation in Toronto, Canada's history. Victims of serial killers tend to be portrayed negatively by newspapers because they often embody stigmatized identities. However, this research asks, How do newspapers frame victims who belong in between marginalized and liberated identities? Under the frameworks of post-gay and intersectionality theory, the identities of many of McArthur's victims reflect an opportunity to analyze how serial killer victims are puzzlingly framed by newspapers. Through an analysis of 277 articles in three major Canadian newspapers, the Toronto Star, the Globe and Mail, and the National Post, findings show that the framing of victims through textual accounts as nonpartisan is discrepant with their negative visual representations. While newspapers tend to simply frame these victims as belonging to Toronto's gay village without layering stigma around queerness onto them explicitly, most articles provide close-ups, passport photos, and occasionally mugshots of victims, ultimately portraying them in undesirable ways. This inconsistent framing between textual description and image selection highlights the important role photos, activists, and non-profits can play when featured or quoted in newspapers as they can humanize and dignify victims in the absence of family or friends to do so. This textual-visual discrepancy shows that deeply racialized queer injustices can exist in newspaper framing despite the absence of overtly prejudicial narratives.

AB  - Introduction: There have been numerous reports of cluster outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitals and nursing homes. Healthcare workers fighting COVID-19 experience mental health issues. Caregivers in nursing homes experienced increased psychological distress and concern about deterioration of their mental health. We conducted a large-scale web-based survey exploring mental health among caregivers working in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of identifying their support needs. Methods: Survey participants were caregivers working at 284 nursing homes in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. The survey period was from September 2020 to March 2021. Participants responded to a questionnaire covering gender, age, occupation, infections at facilities, infection protection, changes in nursing home users, cooperation with other medical institutions, and prejudice/discrimination. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate participants' depression and anxiety. Results: In total, 676 participants completed the survey; 350 (52.5%) were with anxiety symptoms and 378 (56.7%) were with depressive symptoms (scores exceeding the HADS cut-off points). The risk for anxiety was associated with being care worker or social worker. The risk of anxiety or depression was high when family caregivers' mental state changed. Discussion/Conclusion: This study found that caregivers working in nursing homes were exposed to high levels of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and were at high risk for developing depression and anxiety.

AB  - In recent years, Amazon???s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has become a pivotal source for participant recruitment in many social-science fields. In the last several years, however, concerns about data quality have arisen. In response, CloudResearch developed an intensive pre-screening procedure to vet the full participant pool available on MTurk and exclude those providing low-quality data. To assess its efficacy, we compared three MTurk samples that completed identical measures: Sample 1 was collected prior to the pre-screening???s implementation. Sample 2 was collected shortly following its implementation, and Sample 3 was collected nearly a full-year after its implementation. Results indicated that the reliability and validity of scales improved with the implementation of this prescreening procedure, and that this was especially apparent with more recent versions. Thus, this prescreening procedure appears to be a valuable tool to help ensure the collection of high-quality data on MTurk.

AB  - In this article we reflect on our engagement with a broad spectrum of dress- and textile-related artefacts housed within the Cornell Fashion + Textile Collection and Department of Anthropology Collections at Cornell University. In recent years, fashion critics and scholars have begun to address the biases and prejudices that continue to inform the collection and display of fashion within museums and academic institutions. In addition to museums of art, design, anthropology and history, universities have contributed to and influenced the public's perceptions of fashion as an embodied material practice and a social phenomenon through the development and circulation of fashion- and dress-related teaching collections. Drawing upon our experiences co-curating a digital fashion exhibition about the development of two ethnological dress collections on Cornell's campus, we discuss the opportunities and challenges that we faced working with these objects in a university setting. Our objective is to contextualize the formation of these collections and raise questions and critiques about the ways in which university dress collections have perpetuated - and continue to perpetuate - forms of discrimination like sexism, homophobia, transphobia, sizeism, class ism, ageism and racism amidst an ongoing colonial context. We suggest possible steps for decentring the colonial gaze through digital curation.

AB  - The hypothesis of this article is that, for its adherents, QAnon is truthful, rather than true; that is, it captures their perception of the way things typically happen, rather than picturing what really has happened-and it does this in a way that seems more vivid and complete than actual experience. Why that is the case can be explained in terms of the peculiar nature of fictional representations, combined with the capacity of imaginary worlds, to symbolize real-world concerns in ways that resonate with prejudices and preconceptions but escape direct censure. After reviewing the literature on the conspiracy movement, we argue for QAnon as a conspiracy story, rather than a conspiracy theory, and interpret that story as "structured like a fantasy", giving imaginative expression to a set of social feelings and normative grievances that would otherwise not dare speak their own names. We conclude that QAnon is an authoritarian fiction centered on anti-Semitic conspiracy beliefs that disturbingly reprise key themes of fascism, but that it presents this within the symbolic disguise of a fantasy scenario that is calculated to attract alienated white, middle-class and working-class, individuals. This argument helps explicate adherents' resistance to the falsification of Q claims and predictions.

AB  - In January 1620, Sir George Calverley of Lea Hall, Cheshire, died intestate leaving behind him his widow, Lady Sidney Calverley, and five children. His eldest son, Hugh, aged six, was now a ward of court, the wardship falling to Prince Charles as Earl of Chester. Wardship was often problematic for widows regardless of their geographic location, but in counties where there was a particularly strong sense of community, kinship bonds and local rivalries could add an extra layer of anxiety and discord to their litigation. Lady Calverley confronted prejudice as widow, stepmother, and, being Welsh, as an outsider. Using court records and correspondence, this article examines the circumstances of Lady Calverley's case and dissects how it unfolded through and beyond Prince Charles's court of wards, an important but overlooked institution that to date has received no in-depth historical analysis. It illuminates the problems women faced in establishing themselves in close-knit communities, as well as how disadvantaged a widow could be in a patriarchal society despite the relative freedom she enjoyed as a feme sole.

AB  - Purpose Taking a transdisciplinary viewpoint, the authors synthesize the literature on the theoretical, methodological, and epistemological issues in the study of corruption as a construct in project management (PM) as applied to IDPs. While the study of corruption has focused on "who and why" to help understand corruption's occurrence, there is a lack of analysis on "where and how" to ensure corruption's prevention and improve PM to better support delivery actors. The authors rely on four theoretical frameworks to help interpret evidence and formulate a coherent model for managing project socio-cultural context: organizational interests theory (OIT), principal-agent theory (PAT), culturalist theory (CT) and institutional theory (IT). Design/methodology/approach International development projects (IDPs) have become very complex with greater diversity of donor agencies and aid delivery actors. The relative lack of success of development aid has been linked in part to corruption at various levels. PM methods are essential to help prevent this behavior. To assess the complexity of this problem, the authors completed a grounded theory research based on thirty interviews with international development experts, balancing representation from donor and receiving countries, as well as project managers in public and private sectors. Data are analyzed using a qualitative sorting process using the software NVivo. Findings Results show that PM, beyond PM's practical nature and technical focus, can offer numerous opportunities to prevent corruption impact on project actors, even in a context where anti-corruption initiatives may be perceived as less effective. The authors present an original theoretical model that illustrates which actors, events and context are related and linked in the dynamic efforts to understand and combat corruption in international development endeavors. Context is linked to dynamics: foreign aid cycle, capture opportunities, context pressures, personal damages done, and control mechanisms exercised. Originality/value The outcomes and quality of IDPs remain highly controversial, especially with perception of corruption by various stakeholders. Some experts recognize the inefficacy of applying classical PM tools and processes. By contrasting findings to the literature, the authors conclude that an alternative approach to overcome the taboos and prejudices in studying corruption is to ask a different research question. A research agenda is proposed for solving this phenomenon. To guide PM research on development projects, focusing on the "where and how" of corruption requires addressing how actors build their knowledge management capabilities, and address the social and cultural challenges inherent to IDPs.

AB  - Drawing on a case study of unconscious bias levels in the Australian Public Service (APS), findings suggest gender equality remains a concern for career prospects for women, particularly for Indigenous women when two-thirds of Indigenous employees in the APS are women. Additionally, age and length of service provide further insights into the implications for a workplace free of discrimination and prejudice. For example, male respondents across each successive age category show higher preference levels for Caucasian Australians than do female respondents. In this paper, I compare findings with results found in an Australian study reported by Shirodkar, (2019). Journal of Australian Indigenous Issues, 22, 3. The basis of both studies was the Australian Aboriginal Implicit Association Test (IAT) administered by Project Implicit. Arguably most importantly for the APS will be the need to convince senior managers to accept and act on the discriminatory effects of unconscious bias in Indigenous employment. Any policy response will need an enhanced understanding of unconscious bias, including a broader knowledge of Indigenous culture and gender equity in the APS. The framework presented at the end of this paper offers an opportunity to revisit the effectiveness of unconscious bias training for the APS.

AB  - Objective The internet provides convenient access to information about non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) owing to its accessibility and anonymity. This study aimed to explore the distribution of topics regarding NSSI posted on the internet and yearly trends in the derived topics using text mining. Methods We searched for the keyword "non-suicidal self-injury" (Ja-Hae in Korean) in the Naver Q&A using the statistical package R. We analyzed 7893 NSSI-related questions posted between 2009 and 2018. Text mining was performed using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on the dataset to determine associations between phrases and thus identify common themes in posts about NSSI. Results In the LDA, we selected the following 10 most common topics: anger, family troubles, collecting information on NSSI, stress, concerns regarding NSSI scarring, ways to help a non-suicidal self-injurious friend, depression, medical advice, ways to perform or stop NSSI, and prejudices and thoughts regarding non-suicidal self-injurious people. Conclusions This study provides valuable information on the nature of NSSI questions posted online. In future research, developing websites that provide NSSI information and support or guidance on effectively communicating with NSSI is necessary.

AB  - In this study, I take a critical look at the presence of narcoculture in reggaeton using as a case study the music video of the remix of 'Somos de calle'. Specifically, I evaluate whether and to what extent reggaeton's narco-messages and narco-representations - when they converge with other variables - could potentially influence an individual's modes of thinking and behaviour. The study does not aim to provide a definitive answer to the debate surrounding this issue. More than anything, it strives to analyse the extent to which the claim that such influence may occur has scientific merit, in order to advocate further research on this matter. The article also discusses the highly politicized debate that has surrounded this topic in public discourse, and how this has seemingly affected its critical assessment in academia. For the analysis I rely particularly on social psychology literature concerning violent media content and in the areas of persuasion studies and prejudice studies, but I also consider literature from other fields, including criminology.

AB  - Older lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) people are concerned that their needs will not be recognised, understood or met in older age care spaces. Some are especially worried about care provided by religious care organisations and/or staff with negative beliefs about LGBTQ people and their lives. While these issues have been raised at the margins of previous research, there has not, until now, been a study which has focussed upon them. This article reports on a recent UK preliminary scoping consultation research project, which explored older LGBTQ people's views about possible care from religious organisations and/or carers. The findings highlight four key fears about: 1) inferior care quality; 2) a lack of affirmative, anti-oppressive care; 3) religious-based prejudice and discrimination; 4) religious conversion attempts. Each theme is considered in relation to social justice, i.e., equality of resources, recognition, representation, and relationality. The need for open dialogue and debate is highlighted and a research agenda is proposed. There is an urgent need to understand what happens in the delivery of care to LGBTQ people by religious care organisations and/or staff, place the concerns identified here in their proper context and determine the appropriate responses.

AB  - Although the notions of privilege and marginalization have become a common theme in research, the application of these concepts to extralocal teachers of English (ETEs; i.e., non-local, non-native, or native foreign English teachers who are not citizens of the national community in which they teach) in applied linguistics has been problematic. Much of this research has equated characteristics of marginalization with implicit bias and structural inequity, and privilege as immunity to such prejudice and discrimination, while other work has viewed these constructs as subjective feelings influencing foreign teacher identities. These problematic depictions of privilege and marginalization have resulted in a contradictory situation where an ETE may be simultaneously privileged and marginalized. Using an autoethnographic approach, this paper examines the first author's experiences in developing their identity as a researcher while trying to critically resolve ethical dilemmas, potential criticisms, and feelings of academic inferiority and diffidence, which are seldom addressed in similar research undertakings. This article reports the learning journey of a developing researcher in creating a usable operationalization of the constructs of privilege and marginalization, with attention paid to the aspects of working contexts and social perceptions that emerged within the literature, and the influence of such factors on the self-image of ETEs in Thailand.

AB  - We argue that the (mis)treatment of Eastern European migrant workers during the pandemic revealed the existence of a two-tier EU citizenship, despite the political discourse of equality within the EU. We show that this two-tier citizenship system was generated by the combined effect of differentiated rights and of prejudicious practices applied to EE citizens. In terms of differentiated rights, we refer specifically to the implementation of transitional arrangements for up to 7 years following the Eastern enlargements in 2004 and 2007, which restricted access to the labour markets and welfare systems of the incumbent member states, de facto undermining the right to free movement for this group of EU citizens. In terms of prejudicious practices, we refer to the instances of exploitation, abuses, de-skilling, exclusion from public services and use of social rights that EE migrant workers have been well documented to experience. We show that the two-tier citizenship system reflects the unequal power relations between Member States and the internal political, economic and social hierarchy present within the European Union.

AB  - Several adverse psychological outcomes among sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are well documented in the literature. Notwithstanding the emergence of these data, SGM still receive little attention regarding psychological interventions, which include Schema Therapy (ST), an emerging integrative psychotherapy approach. Even though revisions have been proposed to expand ST's understanding of emotional needs, schemas, domains, and schema modes, there is a gap in our understanding of SGM. Based on that, the main goal of this theoretical essay is to propose a specific ST intervention for SGM, addressing sociocultural aspects aiming at promoting a healthy functioning that can interpose oppression and internalized prejudice. To this end, we will present (a) the minority stress theoretical framework; (b) the ST model applying to SGM clients; and (c) a few strategies of ST intervention for SGM clients, highlighting the need for strengthening individuals' healthy schema mode. It should be noted that, despite clinical work being relevant, there are social variables supporting and maintaining maladaptive structures. We hope the therapeutic interventions proposed promote dialogue on this subject and encouraging positive societal changes.

AB  - Scholars have noted how online dating technologies are one important arena in which racism, classism, heteronormativity, and other systems of domination are reproduced. This often materializes via a "personal preference" discourse-a framing of desire as unique, individual, and untethered from systems of domination. Yet underexplored is how such a discourse, which fosters prejudice in preferences, is framed as socially acceptable. This paper draws on a content analysis of 858 unique profile screenshots and in-depth interview data of 26 users of Grindr, Scruff, and Jack'd to examine how users voice their "personal preferences." The content analysis results indicated that 24 percent of profiles listed a preference, and that most were framed in "positive" or polite ways (e.g., "I'm into horizontal ellipsis "). Analysis of interview data demonstrated that respondents engaged in what we call blatant exclusion and positive reframing in their interactions with other users to voice their "personal preferences." Users who did not state preferences still allowed their preferences to infuse their experiences on the app. We document how users negotiated racist, classist, and heteronormative preferences and, to an extent, how these users are understanding others' preferences. This study has implications for understanding the logic behind "personal preference" discourse and why it remains socially acceptable even as other systems of domination do not.

AB  - Philosophers and psychologists have argued that fiction can ethically educate us: fiction supposedly can make us better people. This view has been contested. It is, however, rarely argued that fiction can morally "corrupt" us. In this article, we focus on the alleged power of fiction to decrease one's prejudices and biases. We argue that if fiction has the power to change prejudices and biases for the better, then it can also have the opposite effect. We further argue that fictions are more likely to be a bad influence than a good one.

KW  - femicide
KW  - Latin America
KW  - law
KW  - limitations
AB  - The concept of femicide was created within the feminist theoretical field of studies influencing Law reform in Latin America. Eighteen countries throughout the region have criminalized femicide based on different legal provisions, in intimate and nonintimate relations. This article aims to provide a comparison of legal definitions of femicide as adopted in Latin American legal frameworks and to analyze the challenges of using law to give a name to the gender-based killings of women. The transition of the concept to law may partially impact its potential since other forms of gender-based violence may be hidden in a general clause of 'gender prejudice'. It may also lead to restricted recognition in the legal system since traditionally this system operates in a conservative way wherein individual criminal liability has limitations in addressing institutional discrimination. Despite regional challenges, criminalization has contributed to raising social awareness on gendered killings. It has induced improvements in statistics and pushed for more attention on prevention policies and support for survivors and relatives. Nevertheless, current conservative movements tend to stress only the punitive approach and entail backlash on gender equality policies. This comparative study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the concept in the region.

AB  - The article looks at how memories and experiences of hunger in Dalit life writings form a strong political critique against the claims of modern welfare society. The instances of hunger recorded in Ethiru by Kunhaman are analysed in order to see how hunger itself constitutes a humiliating experience when it is combined with experiences of caste discriminations. Despite developing juridical as well as social sensibilities to irradicate hunger and poverty, caste-ridden contexts give rise to situations of death by hunger not due to any shortage of food but due to ostracization and alienation of the marginalized communities. These moments also expose the colonial and feudal views and prejudices about the poor, their attitude to hard work, and value of labour and charity which still lie deep in the social psyche of many developed countries. The article attempts to locate Kunhaman's work within the context of emerging critiques from the marginalized communities against tall claims of the progressivism and development indices of Kerala society.

AB  - While most Germans reacted welcoming toward newly arrived refugees in 2015 and 2016, parallelly overt hateful reactions such as hate crimes, social exclusion, and increasing right-wing electoral support have been registered all over Germany with several regions emerging as "hot spots" in these regards. Among them was our case, the mid-sized town of Bautzen in the state of Saxony, where intergroup conflict and violent clashes between locals and refugees caused news headlines. To analyze intergroup conflicts in the ethnically super-homogenous context of Bautzen, we performed a qualitative interview study. More specifically, we conducted 48 semistructured interviews with residents and members of the victimized outgroup of refugees. Our analysis reveals that the societal basis of intergroup conflict in Bautzen seems to be a distinct climate of exclusion aimed at tagged outgroups. Refugees report facing everyday discriminatory practices and even violence. Further, this specific local climate is facilitated by several Bautzen-specific characteristics on the macro level, such as low number of foreigners and high levels of right-wing electoral support. Our findings suggest that limited diversity and widespread stereotypes affect locals' reactions toward and perception of refugees. We discuss our results in light of the intergroup contact hypothesis and encourage more qualitative research on the nexus of intergroup contact and intergroup conflict.

AB  - Targeting people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), this research examined the prevalence of space-focused stereotypes and their underlying mechanism on behavioral inclinations. Study 1 adopted the explicit nomination and implicit Go/No-Go association tests to explore the existence of space-focused stereotypes of people living with HIV/AIDS. The results demonstrated that space-focused stereotypes were only manifested explicitly with characteristics such as messy, dirty, and gloomy. Study 2 demonstrated a more negative evaluation and community-approaching willingness for communities that include people living with HIV/AIDS than those without HIV/AIDS. Additionally, space-focused stereotypes were found to have an indirect influence on community-approaching willingness; the influence was mediated by both emotional (threat perception) and cognitive factors (community evaluation). These results indicate the deviation of explicit and implicit space-focused stereotypes. More importantly, it revealed that space-focused stereotypes decreased community evaluation and influenced behavioral inclination. This research suggested the existence of space-focused stereotypes on another stigmatized social group. Characteristics of space (e.g., geographical segregation) might be the key to forming space-focused stereotypes.

AB  - Transphobia is a result of the widespread lack of knowledge among the general population, together with prejudice based on irrational fear and hatred, of those who do not fit the dominant, socially established gender categories. Little is known about transgender-related knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs among the Mexican population, due to the lack of reliable, valid Spanish-language instruments. This study presents a Spanish translation of the Transgender Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs (T-KAB) Scale and examines its psychometric properties for the Mexican population. A cohort of 501 adult subjects, 337 (67.3%) women and 161 (32.1%) men, drawn from the general population, answered the T-KAB in an anonymous online survey. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and internal consistency measure were used to determine whether its dimensions were reliable and valid for use in a Mexican Spanish language and cultural context. A CFA including the three original dimensions proposed and excluding one item from the T-KAB Scale showed appropriate goodness of fit indices (chi(2)(180) = 389.41; chi(2)/df = 2.16, RMSEA = 0.048, CI [0.042, 0.055]; CFI = 0.971; TLI = 0.966), with Cronbach's alpha values over 0.85. The psychometric properties exhibited by the Spanish version of the T-KAB support its use for the assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding transgender people in the Mexican cultural context. This instrument offers researchers a brief, reliable, valid, and easy self-report measure to use in further studies in Spanish-speaking populations.

AB  - There is an unnamed crisis of aesthetic immediacy afoot in the American criminal justice system. Defendants are seen too quickly. Or rather, they are recognized too quickly. They are recognized spatially, at the defense table, surrounded by lawyers and court marshals, playing the protagonists in the court performance. For most observers, this staging and its familiarity bring about a series of untold assumptions-assumptions that, when viewed nakedly, erode the presumption of innocence. While implicit biases and prejudices similarly short-circuit judicial proceedings-procedure and proceduralism itself-nefariously permit implicit narratives to outpace evidence. Tools to interrupt the aesthetics of transgression and its aftermath will serve judicial accuracy without substantial efficiency tradeoffs. While the bifurcation of the guilt and sentencing in American courts laudably partitions the culpability inquiry from the question of deserved punishment-the former, the question of wrongdoing, can never be truly divorced from history, neither personal nor social. Nor should it be. The Anglo-American insistence on a socially ahistorical criminal trial comes at a high cost: real and textured history-the foreground, leadup, and intimate histories of what occurred is kept out, while the more depersonalized histories that undergird daily life, narrative tropes, and mythologies of crime are permitted to play an outsized role. There is no place, as it stands, for simultaneity in truth or a multiplicity of character. This article thinks of ways to render collective transgression and the complexity of truth legally cognizable and to afford individual defendants full subject status as, I argue, the Sixth Amendment demands. It turns to a source famed for disrupting perception and the study of how and why perception is to be unsettled: Russian Formalism.

AB  - Assessing student mathematical knowledge is an important factor in the mathematics learning process because students obtain important feedback to improve their knowledge and learning. Despite the importance of student assessment, several researchers have shown that student grades comprise noncognitive and metacognitive factors and teachers' prejudices and beliefs. One method to obtain a more objective view of student mathematical knowledge is through standardized assessments. In this paper, we analyze two methods of assessing student mathematical knowledge by considering their written and oral grades and achievements on the Italian National Assessment of Knowledge (INVALSI). The final grade was produced using the fuzzy logic inference system. It was tested on a sample of 2279 Grade 13 Italian high school students, who had both an oral and written grade in mathematics and who took the INVALSI assessment in the school year 2020-2021. Both tested fuzzy-logic-based assessment methods lowered the mean grades.

AB  - Consumerism favours the culture of the disposable, excessive extroversion, and superficiality. Data manipulation, the shadow of information technology, harms individual and collective lives. In a world filled with prejudice, intolerance, violence and social inequality, nature is neglected putting our survival at risk. The lack of appreciation for subjectivity and self-knowledge and the demand for greater performance foster physical and emotional problems expressed through anxiety, depression, anguish and burnout. It is thus urgent to develop a pattern of consciousness that allows us to overcome polarization and cope with the opposites by the means of dialogue and an appreciation of the dialectical and symmetrical relationship between the polarities. Carlos Byington, in his symbolic psychology, named this the archetypal pattern of alterity, and considered it the basis of solidarity, respect for difference, democracy and sustainability.

AB  - I describe "spiritual" addiction as a felt compulsion to seek surrogates in the absence of that spirit of unconditional love underlying core personality change. We awaken to a "real" world akin to a prison in which all sides seem morally compromised, so any choice seems to necessitate sacrificing our conscientious relationship to the truth. Thus, spiritual addiction runs deeper than physical and psychological addictions to include socially accepted "addictions" to all we associate with "success"-including our morality and religion. All that we seek may be grounded in a collectively imbibed prejudice toward truth itself. If so, such a prejudice, underlying spiritual addiction, compromises our will, reason, feelings, actions, and character-including all of our relationships. It underlies the reality of a collective moral crisis which, we show, is more deeply a religious crisis tempting us to doubt the reality and attainability of that unconditional love that provides a foundation for hope. To overcome the prejudice underlying spiritual addiction, we show how unconditional love can be realized by placing conscientiousness in the foreground of concern as we are guided by the most reliable moral and spiritual witnesses in our history distinct from any religious group claiming to speak in their name.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic and the need for social distancing created challenges for accessing and providing health services. Telemedicine enables prompt evaluation of patients with traumatic brachial plexus injury, even at a distance, without prejudice to the prognosis. The present study aimed to verify the validity of range of motion, muscle strength, sensitivity, and Tinel sign tele-assessment in adults with traumatic brachial plexus injury (TBPI). Methods A cross-sectional study of twenty-one men and women with TBPI admitted for treatment at a Rehabilitation Hospital Network was conducted. The participants were assessed for range of motion, muscle strength, sensitivity, and Tinel sign at two moments: in-person assessment (IPA) and tele-assessment (TA). Results The TA muscle strength tests presented significant and excellent correlations with the IPA (the intra-rater intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC ranged between 0.79 and 1.00 depending on the muscle tested). The agreement between the TA and IPA range of motion tests ranged from substantial to moderate (weighted kappa coefficient of 0.47-0.76 (p < 0.05) depending on the joint), and the kappa coefficient did not indicate a statistically significant agreement in the range of motion tests of supination, wrist flexors, shoulder flexors, and shoulder external rotators. The agreement between the IPA andTA sensitivity tests of all innervations ranged from substantial to almost perfect (weighted kappa coefficient 0.61-0.83, p < 0.05) except for the C5 innervation, where the kappa coefficient did not indicate a statistically significant agreement. The IPA versus TA Tinel sign test showed a moderate agreement (weighted kappa coefficient of 0.57, p < 0.05). Conclusions The present study demonstrated that muscle strength tele-assessment is valid in adults with TBPI and presented a strong agreement for many components of TA range of motion, sensitivity, and Tinel sign tests.

KW  - PREJUDICE
AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of stigma among a geographic population of people living with HIV in Maricopa County, Arizona. People living with HIV who experience stigma have lower medication adherence and fewer kept appointments. The people living with HIV patient survey was administered using both paper and online versions in the beginning months of 2019. A total of 296 respondents completed the survey for this study. Participants were recruited through multiple methods, including online sites, the Phoenix AIDS Walk, health clinics, and the identification of zip codes with high HIV prevalence rates. There was a significant relationship between health status and age, with those who reported a higher health rating, that of excellent or good, more likely to be 45 years of age or older, X2 (1, N = 296) = 4.812, p = 0.028. Researchers and health care providers must be attentive to these variations and intersecting stigmas when providing services across diverse populations, especially when working with a high-stigma population such as people living with HIV. Providers can take a more active role in helping people living with HIV to see how their perceptions and experience of HIV-related stigma may be taking a toll on their perceptions of their health, as well as their approach to treatment, and refer them to support groups or individual counseling. Strategies, policies, and messages should be tailored with cultural, social, and ethnic sensitivities in mind. To address these threats, policies must be created that reduce the impact of HIV-related stigma within various systems, including but not limited to the public health sector.

AB  - In Homo Ludens Johan Huizinga defined play as a free activity outside "ordinary" life, viewed as "not serious", "connected with no material interest" or possible "profit", "proceed[ing] within its own proper boundaries" by "fixed rules", and fostering groups shrouded in "secrecy stress[ing]" their separateness "by disguise or other means" (1949: 13). He audaciously argued that human culture originated in play and to some extent remains play. His analysis illuminates how Dickinson approached aspects of culture like language, religion, war, law, politics, love, education, and art. Nourished by affluent gentry privileges and prejudices, Dickinson's detached playfulness strikes some as socially irresponsible. Does defending her seriousness validate Huizinga's claim that "solitary play is productive of culture only in a limited degree" (1949: 47), or should we challenge Huizinga here? Did her privately circulated works have any impact on culture, and if so, how? Strategies of withdrawal, inconclusiveness, and depersonalization ultimately turned her playful poetry into high culture.

AB  - This paper argues that the emergence of social media as a new public sphere has shaped masculine identity in the cyber platform. Such masculinity in Assamese society (the Assamese-speaking community), based on the images of the ideal Assamese man is linked with a form of Assamese nationalistic masculinity that gathered momentum during the Assam Movement (1979-1985). Politics of identity in Assam is basically trapped in the world of appearances, fighting real and imaginary enemies, and drawing strength from prejudices and misconceptions of groups, about themselves and others. This process of identity creation also shaped the identity of the "ideal" Assamese man in the recent socio-political history of Assam. This article is an attempt to define how masculinity works in the cyber world by focusing attention on Assamese nationalistic masculinity which is based on the image of the "RealAssamese Man." The "Real Assamese Man," in turn, draws inspiration from a socio-cultural context which started with the creation of Assamese iconographies of masculinity which were later transformed and appropriated to serve the purpose of identity-politics.

AB  - Stigmatization of one or more discredited attributes has a profoundly negative social impact on stigmatized individuals. Researchers have applied narratives as a persuasion device to reduce stigma. However, the overall effect of narratives on stigma is yet known. This research synthesized and quantified the effect of narratives in reducing stigma and identifies moderating factors. Forty-six effect sizes were extracted from 40 articles investigating the effect of narratives on stigmatization in various stigmatized conditions. A small effect of narratives on reducing stigma was yielded, which indicated that narratives were effective in reducing stigma. Narratives constructed with the first-person point of view were to be superior in reducing stigma. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - In this paper, I suggest that one of the ways in which problems of exclusion from deliberation and uptake within deliberation can be ameliorated is to develop a more robust account of the deliberative virtues that socially privileged speakers/hearers ought to cultivate. Specifically, privileged speakers/hearers ought to cultivate the virtue of actively facilitating equitable and inclusive deliberative exchanges (which includes a cluster of virtues, including the practice of silence and of listening) and the deliberative virtue of training their 'testimonial sensibility' to correct for prejudicial judgments about other speakers.

TI  - Far Beyond Baker: Heuristics and the Inadequacy of the Reasonable Apprehension of Bias Analysis

AB  - When we consider bias in an adjudicative setting, we may think about cases such as Baker v. Canada in which the interviewing officer's undue emphasis on the applicant's number of children, economic status, and mental health is glaring. It is easy to become accustome When we consider bias in an adjudicative setting, we think about cases such as Baker v. Canada where the interviewing officer's emphasis on the applicant's number of children, economic status, and mental health is glaring. It is easy to become accustomed to thinking about bias in clear examples such as prejudice against people of a disadvantaged group. However, bias can also be subtly present in the subconscious mind, even when a person appears to be acting objectively. The development of cognitive psychology research has revealed that the mind relies on heuristics, or mental shortcuts, to make quick decisions. Heuristics research divides the mind into two systems of operation: The first operates automatically, while the second operates methodically. Heuristics are a function of the former and are consequently difficult to clearly observe and readily identify. Subconscious reliance on heuristics when approaching tasks that demand objectivity can result in decisions that are unintentionally guided by bias, rather than evidence. A reasonable apprehension of bias (RAB) claim is advanced when a party suspects bias on the part of an adjudicator. The question is whether an informed reasonable person would reasonably perceive bias on the part of the adjudicator. The onus is not to prove bias, but merely an appearance of bias. The test is an appeal to the maxim that justice must not only be done but should be seen to be done. The analysis is designed to protect not only the parties but also the public perception of the legal system. In this sense, the RAB test is overinclusive. Conversely, consideration of the RAB test, in light of cognitive biases and heuristic reasoning, reveals that the test is also underinclusive. The driving force behind the RAB analysis appears to be that justice must be seen to be done. Neither the informed reasonable person's knowledge of the law nor the community can help discover veiled or subtle cognitive biases. We are left with a conundrum: The original premise that justice must be done may be violated covertly without triggering the prevailing test for a RAB, leaving an unintentional blind spot. In order to address the shortcomings of the RAB analysis, I propose the implementation of preventative measures to decrease adjudicators' vulnerability to cognitive biases. These measures can be established by increasing adjudicators' understanding of heuristics and counteracting potential intuitive predispositions. Development of remedial measures should consider scarce judicial and adjudicative resources.d to thinking about bias only in clear examples that reveal obvious prejudice against people of a disadvantaged group. However, bias can also be subtly present in the subconscious mind even when it is not objectively apparent. The development of cognitive psychology research has revealed that the mind relies on heuristics, or mental shortcuts, to make quick decisions. Subconscious reliance on heuristics when approaching tasks that demand objectivity can result in decisions that are unintentionally guided by bias, rather than evidence. The current legal framework for identifying a reasonable apprehension of bias (RAB) in adjudication captures only obvious and observable instances of bias, not subtle cases of cognitive bias.
   This article argues that the RAB test is both underinclusive and overinclusive. It offers a series of recommendations to reduce adjudicators' susceptibility to inappropriate intuitive reasoning but concludes that the best remedies available are preventative. We should prioritize decreasing adjudicators' vulnerability to cognitive biases by increasing their understanding of heuristics and counteracting against potential intuitive predispositions.

AB  - Following the Digital Revolution, we are witnessing an increase in the number of manipulated sources of information. For this reason, virtual environments can be a breeding ground for the proliferation of prejudices and stereotypes, resulting from the spread of racial fallacious news, known as 'racial hoaxes'. Adolescents may be more susceptible due to the tense and complicated relationship between their experience with digital platforms and the development of their relatively limited critical thinking. In this landscape, in order to explore the features of disinformation in adolescence, the research involved 41 Italian adolescents between 13 and 16 years old, balanced by gender and school education. The teenagers took part in the focus group discussions on the topic of online information preferences, fake news and racial hoaxes, which were analyzed by means of content analysis. The answers given by participants show a so-called adolescents' perception of 'misinformation invulnerability' that can influence their credulity in fake news, since they are aware of fake news but they are not so able to recognize or remember it.

AB  - This paper aims to explore the experiences of female leaders considering the interplay of gender, religion, and culture. Drawing on an inductive-qualitative study, the paper examines perceptions regarding the role of religion and cultural norms in women's ascension into leadership positions in Jordan. The results indicated that Jordanian women leaders adopted an Islamic feminist worldview and did not embrace a liberal nor a socialist/Marxist feminist worldview. Women leaders seemed wanting to claim their religion back from those forces that are reportedly holding their aspirations hostage to monolithic interpretations of religious texts. By constantly referring to their religion, female leaders wanted to be granted spaces of trust and responsibility in leadership positions that they did not see contradictory to the way they understood their faith. The paper provides insights into how women leaders understand prejudicial stereotypes and discrimination in their society, explaining how those are linked to patriarchal socio-cultural traditions emphasizing male control.

AB  - English language teaching has become a global phenomenon, involving racially and culturally diverse teachers travelling across national borders. While these transnational teachers bring diversity to host countries, the superiority of White native English speakers continues to be reinforced. This raciolinguistic ideology can uniquely shape the subjectivities of English language teachers of colour who sojourn abroad. Focusing on three African American female teachers of English who were participating in the English Program in Korea (EPIK) to teach in South Korean schools and posting YouTube videos to describe their experiences, this qualitative study examined the nature of their experiences and intersecting subjectivities regarding race, colour, language, gender, and nationality, as well as privilege and marginality as they are expressed online. The analysis focused on how intersectionality, a notion originally developed to describe Black women's unique experiences in the United States, would be applied to this transnational context. A thematic analysis of a total of 12 videos revealed these EPIK teachers' multifaceted and negotiated subjectivities as American teachers, victims of racial prejudice, and ambassadors with a mission to educate local people. These subjectivities signify the intersectionality of privilege and marginality, which are embedded in the local and global ideologies and power relations.

AB  - In this study, it was aimed to experiment a new method to increase the quality of the history of mathematics course instruction in the primary mathematics education. The method composed by synthesizing project-based and collaborative learning methods was named "Newspaper Preparation Method," and the course was delivered using this method. Exploratory design, one of the mixed methods in which qualitative and quantitative techniques are both used, was applied in the study. The sample of the study consists of 35 undergraduate students studying in the primary mathematics education department. The quantitative data analyzed through SPSS-25 while qualitative data analyzed through content analysis. The results of data analysis revealed that the pre-service teachers held positive attitudes towards the method. Also, participants realized that they gained skills such as proactivity, research, inquiry, reproductivity, authorship, teamwork, and socializing. Besides, pre-service teachers' prejudices were eliminated against the course, their motivation increased, their curiosity was triggered, and most importantly the pre-service teachers deemed themselves important. Moreover, this method has transformed the course from a boring program into an exciting and enjoyable part of the syllabus. Finally, pre-service teachers stated that they learned the class effectively and permanently, their vocabulary and general knowledge increased, and their computer literacy improved. It is predicted that this study will contribute to the literature through analyzing a hands-on method and inspire those teaching the history of mathematics.

AB  - Bias among faculty search committees has been considered a significant barrier to diversifying the professoriate. Given the traditional faculty hierarchy in academia, junior faculty search chairs may not have the positional power to challenge authority when confronted with bias or prejudice. Yet, search chairs are expected to ensure equitable practices and outcomes in their searches. In response to this quandary, through the lens of role theory, this study examined how faculty roles, within the hierarchical structure of tenure, affected equity during the hiring process. Findings revealed that the faculty hierarchy often superseded decision-making power given to search chairs if they were junior faculty, often leading to implicit support of biased hiring practices and the perpetuation of a culture of Whiteness. The study also indicated that search chairs' identities, values, and perceptions influenced how they operationalized diversity and equity in the search process, contributing to either diversity advocacy or support of the status quo. This qualitative inquiry makes an important contribution to the literature by exploring the ways in which faculty search chairs' status and social identities impact interpersonal committee dynamics and decisions about hiring diverse candidates.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the idea of inclusion in women's bottom-up peacebuilding in Ghana. Inspired by the growing importance of "inclusion" and "local empowerment" in the discourse and practice of local ownership in peacebuilding, this paper seeks to investigate the scope and degree of inclusion of key actors such as women and youth, and how that affects peacebuilding and sustainable peace in some conflict-affected zones. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a cross-sectional case study design and qualitative strategy. It is based on semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions conducted with actors who have been engaged in grassroots peacebuilding in Ghana and West Africa. The analysis was largely inductive, identifying emerging themes and patterns in the research data. Findings The findings indicate that young women are usually absent or not engaged meaningfully in the mobilization of women and youth in the "inclusive" grassroots peacebuilding in Ghana. This is due to the prevalence of deep-seated cultural and political prejudices or stereotypes about women in the areas studied. As these local constructs and thus practices are difficult to change or challenge, peacebuilding non-governmental organizations (NGOs) usually deploy innovative ways by mobilizing socially constructed women's positionalities - as "whistleblowers," "cross-ethnic/cross-cultural actors" and "socially networked actors" - in ways that promote women in contemporary peacebuilding discourses and practices. Through mobilizing these stereotypes (to forestall possible provocation, especially from dominant actors or gatekeepers), peacebuilding NGOs have subtly positioned women centrally within a vibrant peace infrastructure in Ghana. Yet, due to the dominance of some patriarchal sociopolitical structures, only older women and young men occupy the spaces for women and youth's peacebuilding. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the first research papers to question not only the scope but also the degree of inclusion and participation of women in peacebuilding in sub-Sahara Africa. This has nuanced scholarly debates on the subject and encouraged the development of innovative programmes targeted at a more comprehensive gendered and youth-ed inclusion to address the inequality gap in peacebuilding discourses and practices.

AB  - People who use illicit drugs are continuously subjected to harsh stigmatization from society. This study explores the perspectives of people who use illicit drugs, specifically their general beliefs about illicit drug use and related stigma. A convergent parallel mixed methods design was used, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. The participants were recruited in a Psychosocial Care Centre (CAPSad) of a municipality in the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil. Findings revealed that illicit drug use can cause individual, family, professional and social difficulties, including problems with the law. The participants indicated they felt victimized by illicit drugs and their use, but also shared prejudicial and discriminatory views, highlighting self-stigmatizing perspectives. There is a need to develop intervention studies with a psychosocial approach on the use of illicit drugs, valuing the person's participation in the treatment, covering biomedical approaches, having in mind the social impact of illicit drugs and their use.

AB  - Ageism is a stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination against people, based on age. Ageism may impact the quality of life and the care of older people, a problem that can be greater when the older person is "frail." However, few studies explored the role of frailty as a factor related to ageism. The aim of this study was to assess the association between perceived age discrimination (PAD), i.e., ageism, and multidimensional frailty in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults. We enrolled 1,337 community-dwelling subjects over-65 years that filled out a structured questionnaire to collect psycho-socio-economic and behavioral information. Multidimensional frailty was assessed by the SELFY-Multidimensional Prognostic Index Short-Form (SELFY-MPI-SF). PAD, over the past 5 years, was assessed based on explicit criteria. Overall, 83 out of 1,337 participants (6.2%) reported PAD. These subjects were older, more frequently women, with greater economic difficulties, lower level of cultural fruition, social network and psychological well-being, and a greater degree of frailty compared to their counterparts. After adjustment for age and gender, multidimensional frailty (SELFY-MPI-SF score) and negative affectivity were the two only "predictors" significantly associated with PAD (SELFY -MPI-SF, Odds Ratio: 1.19, 95%CI: 1.029-1.370; PANAS negative: Odds Ratio: 1.06, 95%CI: 1.033-1.099). In conclusion, self-reported frailty and negative affectivity are independently associated with PAD in community-dwelling older people. Interventions to prevent and treat frailty could be useful to reduce ageism and improve the well-being of the older people.

KW  - IDEOLOGIES
KW  - ZIMBABWE
AB  - This study focuses on the perspectives of parents in a Ndebele heritage language family in post-Gukurahundi Matabeleland in Zimbabwe. Gukurahundi is a codename for a military operation that resulted in the killing of over 20 000 mainly Ndebele speakers in Matabeleland and the Midlands (of Zimbabwe) between 1983 and 1987. The failure by the state to publicly acknowledge and own the genocide has resulted in survivors deploying nuanced strategies in dealing with Gukurahundi inflicted trauma. This article examines how the focal parents' Gukurahundi language experiences are infused into their explicitly articulated family language policy. The study deploys Tannenbaum's reconceptualisation of family language policy as a coping and defence mechanism to demonstrate how the parents' emotional dispositions and orientations towards the use of their Ndebele heritage language as a form of coping strategy are enmeshed with memories of language prejudices experienced during Gukurahundi. The study also exposes how focal parents' reification of a Ndebelecentred family language policy is emotionally laden, and borders on the proscription of Shona as a defence against the reproduction of post-Gukurahundi state-wide Ndebele marginalisation in the family.

KW  - Emancipatory career guidance
AB  - This scoping paper sets out to consider various aspects of the phenomenon of people on the move, and to examine some of the ways in which career guidance has responded to the challenge of integrating the newly arrived. The paper is informed by a recognition of the dignity of individuals above any classificatory system that places persons in a hierarchy, with some having access to rights that others are denied. This stance requires career practitioners to confront the prevalent vocabulary, discourses and attitudes circulating in the mainstream in order to become aware of-and to overcome-personal prejudice, thus opening up possibilities for more socially just forms of service. A synthesis of relevant literature concerning the integration of migrants and refugees in the labour market is provided in order to signpost emancipatory forms of career guidance, ones that move beyond an emphasis on individual resilience to take seriously the impact of exclusionary social practices and structures. The paper concludes by highlighting a number of initiatives that suggest that career guidance is rising to the challenge of catering for a diverse group of newly arrived by mobilising theoretical frameworks that are fit for purpose, by developing bespoke training programmes for practitioners, and by sharing the lessons learnt from the field.

AB  - Recent scholarship on the social history of health and medicine in colonial India has moved beyond enclavist or hegemonic aspects of imperial medicine and has rather focused on the role of Indian intermediaries and the fractured nature of colonial hegemony. Drawing inspiration from this scholarship, the article highlights the significance of the Indian subordinates in the lock hospital system in the nineteenth century Madras Presidency. This study focuses on a class of Indian subordinates called the "gomastah", who were employed to detect clandestine prostitution in Madras to control the spread of venereal disease. It also underlines the role of other native and non-native subordinates such as Dhais, Chowdranies and Matrons, the ways in which they became indispensable for the smoother operation of the Contagious Diseases Act and the lock hospitals on a day-to-day basis. By emphasising how Indian subordinates were able to bring in caste biases within colonial governmentality, adding another layer to the colonial prejudices and xenophobia against the native population, it underlines the fact that there was not a one-way appropriation or facilitation of the coloniser's knowledge or biases by the colonised intermediaries. Rather, it argues for an interaction between them, and highlights the complexities of caste hierarchies and prejudice within the everyday colonial governmentality. Moreover, the article focuses on the consequent chaos and inherent power struggle between different factions of colonial staff.

AB  - Religious sectarian intolerance occurs when members of different religious sects within a faith are unable to tolerate the religious beliefs and practices of each resulting in bigotry and prejudice toward each other. The present research sought to develop a psychometrically sound measure of religious sectarian intolerance for Muslim adults. The research comprised two studies. Study I involved the development of an initial item pool for the Religious Sectarian Intolerance Scale (RSIS). The initial pool of items was based on thematic analysis from focus group discussions. This item pool was reviewed by a committee of experts resulting in a 39-item initial draft of the RSIS, which was administered to a purposive sample of Pakistani Muslim adults (N = 270). The exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure for the RSIS (with loadings ranging from 0.56 to 0.94) that explained 62% of the variance. The factors include dogmatic loyalty (9 items), social intolerance (13 items), renunciation of other religious Sects. (8 items), and propagation of one's Sect. (9 items). All factors were moderately related to each other with acceptable Cronbach's alpha (.78 to .92). Study II replicated the factorial structure of RSIS through confirmatory factor analysis on an independent sample of Muslim adults (N = 274). The convergent validity of the RSIS was demonstrated by a positive relationship with dogmatism. Overall, the findings indicated that the RSIS is a psychometrically sound measure that provides a standard operationalization for religious sectarian intolerance in Muslim cultures and it needs to be studied further in Muslim populations across the globe.

AB  - Introduction Stigma towards alcohol use disorders is prevalent in India and can lead to social exclusion and hamper treatment access and outcomes. Family members of individuals with dependent drinking are often their primary caregivers and play a key role in decisions around help-seeking, treatment and recovery. The nature and role of stigma in caregiving, and the consequent burden on family caregivers of those with dependent drinking, has not been qualitatively studied in India. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with: (i) men with probable alcohol dependence (n = 11); (ii) family caregivers (n = 12); and (iii) doctors with experience of treating alcohol dependence (n = 13) in community settings in Goa. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results Two primary themes were identified from the data: (i) stigma in the form of ignorance, prejudice and discrimination; and (ii) the impact of this stigma on caregiving decisions and the mental health of caregivers. Discussion and Conclusions We found that stigma functioned as a barrier to a proper course of treatment and care, as well as a detrimental factor for caregiver's mental health and caregiving decision-making. Stigma towards dependent drinking in the forms of ignorance, prejudice and discrimination is prevalent within homes, workplaces and health systems and might exacerbate the caregiving burden among female family caregivers. Policies, educational programs and campaigns aimed at preventing stigma in these forms would likely enable access to more inclusive and appropriate health services, benefit the health of family caregivers and improve the treatment outcomes of drinkers.

AB  - The garden landscape of urban residential areas has significant environmental benefits, allowing people to get closer to nature and integrate with nature to relax and have some social benefits at the same time. This article is aimed at studying the effect of urban greening remote sensing on residential landscape construction. This paper uses the greening remote sensing image processing algorithm combined with the analysis method of SURF color remote sensing image and conducts the experiment based on the urban greening remote sensing on the residential area landscape architecture research. This article combines sustainable development strategies with innovative design methods to deeply study the role of urban greening remote sensing on the construction of residential landscape architecture. At the same time, the experiment in this article also proposes that the garden landscape of urban residential areas can provide entertainment for people, soothe residents' mood, and achieve the best use of residential buildings. However, there are still some constraints in the development process of residential industry: insufficient government support, relatively backward technology of residential industrialization, lack of support and input from enterprises, and prejudice of people's traditional concept towards it. The experimental results of this paper show that the remote sensing image features of buildings in residential areas and public areas are obvious. In the recognition of 46 training features and 34 detection features, the number of correct remote sensing recognition features is 32, and the green building image remote sensing recognition is good. The accuracy is 94%, which can meet the identification requirements of greening in the building. Combined with the specific conditions of urban greening and garden construction in my country, it can meet people's entertainment needs and, to a certain extent, can also improve people's life and cultural taste.

AB  - Purpose Given the training and experience of lawyers, we assumed that a study of lawyers' willingness to disclose disability in the workplace would provide an example of the actions of a group knowledgeable about disability law. The current study accounts for the effect of visibility of disability, onset and type of disability, and whether the lawyer has made an accommodation request. We also investigate the role of other individual characteristics, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, race/ethnicity, age, and job-related characteristics, in willingness to disclose. Methods We use data from the first phase of a longitudinal national survey of lawyers in the USA to estimate the odds of disclosing disability to co-workers, management, and clients using proportional odds models. Results Lawyers with less visible disabilities, those with mental health disabilities, and those who work for smaller organizations have lower odds of disclosing to co-workers, management, and clients as compared to their counterparts. Attorneys who have requested accommodations are more willing to disclose as compared to those who have not, but only to co-workers and management. Women are less likely than men to disclose to management and clients. However, gender is not a significant determinant of disclosure to co-workers. Older attorneys are more likely to disclose to clients, whereas attorneys with children are less likely to disclose to co-workers. Lastly, lower perceived prejudice and the presence of co-workers with disabilities are associated with higher disclosure scores, but not for all groups. Conclusions Individuals who acquired a disability at a relatively early point in life and those with more visible disabilities are more likely to disclose. However, such willingness is affected by the intersection of disability with other individual and firm-level characteristics. Implications for Cancer Survivors. The findings imply that those with less visible disabilities and with health conditions acquired later in life are less likely to disclose. The relevance of the findings is heightened by the altered work conditions and demands imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic for cancer survivors.

AB  - This article addresses the compulsory seizing of children from vulnerable women in Brazil. Its objectives were: to discuss the violation of the right to maternity; to present the imposed restrictions especially on poor, black and indige-nous women; the strategic control over their lives and children, and the resistance movements that oppose segregation. The sources of the research were: narratives of women in vulnerable situa-tions, family members and health workers; inter-views with strategic actors; document analysis; field journal. It became evident that vulnerabili-ties-linked to the criminalization of poverty and racial prejudice-have justified these separations. The lack of responsibility that State and society practice towards the support network for women, the devaluation of non-hegemonic productions of maternity, and the reinforcement of a 'reason of the world', that produces violence as a tool for exclusion establishing practical limits on the right to maternity. Women and children are disregar-ded in their singularities. Resistance movements have shown that intersectoral dialogues are an alternative to overcome discrimination and vul-nerabilities.

AB  - For many years, mental health has been hidden behind a veil of shame and prejudice. In 2017, studies claimed that 10.7% of the global population suffered from mental health disorders. Recently, people started seeking relaxing treatment through technology, which enhanced and expanded mental health care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the use of mental health forums, websites, and applications has increased by 95%. However, these solutions still have many limits, as existing mental health technologies are not meant for everyone. In this work, an up-to-date literature review on state-of-the-art of mental health and healthcare solutions is provided. Then, we focus on Arab-speaking patients and propose an intelligent tool for mental health intent recognition. The proposed system uses the concepts of intent recognition to make mental health diagnoses based on a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and the International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Experiments are conducted using a dataset collected at the Military Hospital of Tunis in Tunisia. Results show excellent performance of the proposed system (the accuracy is over 92%, the precision, recall, and F1 scores are over 94%) in mental health patient diagnosis for five aspects (depression, suicidality, panic disorder, social phobia, and adjustment disorder). In addition, the tool was tested and evaluated by medical staff at the Military Hospital of Tunis, who found it very interesting to help decision-making and prioritizing patient appointment scheduling, especially with a high number of treated patients every day.

KW  - Refugees
AB  - Background: It is crucial to determine the intercultural sensitivity of nursing students who will provide care to refugees in the future and to examine their perspectives, experiences, and views on providing care to refugees.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe nursing students' perspectives and caregiving experiences with refugees in Turkey.
   Design: This study was conducted with a phenomenological approach in a qualitative design.
   Settings, participants, methods: The sample of the study consisted of 10 intern nursing students with purposive sampling method in their last year of education at the bachelor level for nursing who had experience of caring for refugees and voluntary participation in this study. The data was collected through in-depth interviews conducted with a semi-structured interview form. MAXQDA program was used to code qualitative data.
   Results: 74 codes gathered under four themes with related subthemes as follows: a) Perspective on refugees with three subthemes: Health, social and economic perspective, b) Barriers in cultural care and two subthemes: Barriers on language and communication and problem-solving technique, c) Feelings and barriers in nursing care, d) Recommendations and five subthemes: society, refugees government, health services, and nursing education. Students expressed that language and communication were the most significant problems when they gave care to patients. They felt helpless, insufficient, and afraid of making mistakes in providing care due to communication barriers. Nursing students suggested that education is an essential factor to increasing awareness and break prejudice towards refugees.
   Conclusions: Language and communication were the greatest problems when students gave care to refugees patients. Language problems could be managed by using interpreters in hospitals to decrease cultural conflicts and provide equal healthcare. In order to increase students' cultural sensitivity and awareness, organizing training and integrating the concept of intercultural in nursing education into the curriculum could be suggested, and students should receive training to ensure they can provide culturally competent nursing care.

KW  - MEDICINE
AB  - Stigma related to mental health and substance use (MHSU) is a well-established construct that describes how inequitable health outcomes can result from prejudice, discrimination, and marginalization. Although there is a body of literature on educational approaches to reduce stigma, antistigma education for MHSU has primarily focused on stigma at the social, interpersonal/public, and personal (self-stigma) levels, with little attention to the problem of structural stigma. Structural stigma refers to how inequity is manifested through rules, policies, and procedures embedded within organizations and society at large. Structural stigma is also prominent within clinical learning environments and can be transmitted through role modeling, resulting in inequitable treatment of vulnerable patient populations. Addressing structural stigma through education, therefore, has the potential to improve equity and enhance care. A promising educational approach for addressing structural stigma is structural competency, which aims to enhance health professionals' ability to recognize and respond to social and structural determinants that produce or maintain health disparities. In this article, the authors propose a framework for addressing structural MHSU stigma in health professions education that has 4 key components and is rooted in structural humility: recognizing structural forms of stigma; reflecting critically on one's own assumptions, values, and biases; reframing language away from stereotyping toward empathic terms; and responding with actions that actively dismantle structural MHSU stigma. The authors propose evidence-informed and practical suggestions on how structural competency may be applied within clinical learning environments to dismantle structural MHSU stigma in organizations and society at large.

AB  - Background Mental health literacy (MHL) is an evolving concept encompassing knowledge of mental illness, help-seeking options, perceived stigma, and discrimination. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a human library intervention at enhancing MHL. A human library intervention was adopted to enhance MHL in this study. The human library intervention aims to establish a positive framework and safe space for dialogue between readers and a 'human book'. It works to promote dialogue, reduce prejudice, and encourage understanding of people who are regarded as disadvantaged or in a minority group. Methods An experimental approach with a multigroup pretest-posttest design was adopted. Forty-five participants aged between 18 and 23 years were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (human library intervention), comparison group (didactic teaching session), or control group (no intervention). Adapted vignette-based MHL scale scores were used as the outcome measures. The overall and subscale scores were included in the analysis. Results The human library intervention group showed a significant improvement in overall MHL compared with the other two groups. In a multivariate analysis of the variance in subscale scores, the intervention was shown to significantly reduce stigma and preferred social distance, but had no significant effect on knowledge acquisition. Conclusions The human library intervention is effective at enhancing overall MHL and reducing stigma and preferred social distance. Further studies are suggested to further develop the MHL construct, human library interventions, and the MHL scales for consolidating evidence-based practice.

AB  - The news media is a major contributor to stigmatizing beliefs that people with mental illness are dangerous and should be avoided. To reduce stigma, it is critical to understand how to reduce the negative impact from stories about violence and mental illness. This study experimentally manipulated elements of a TV news report to explore the effect on stigma. Participants were 838 community adults, mainly from the U.K. and USA, who were randomized to one of two versions of a TV news report describing a violent crime in which the perpetrator has a severe mental illness, one containing additional stigmatizing elements and the other elements thought to mitigate against stigma. Participants completed a variety of stigma outcome measures designed to assess beliefs about dangerousness, fear, and desire for social distance. The effect of the news condition upon stigma was mixed. While several effects were in the expected direction favoring the mitigating condition, these effects were very small and not statistically significant. In contrast, participants in the mitigating condition showed significantly lower prosocial beliefs and greater perceived difference from people with mental illness than the stigmatizing condition. Exploratory analyses suggested that country may have moderated effects. In conclusion, we could not reliably detect a difference between the two versions of the TV news report on stigmatizing outcomes. Further novel research is needed to build the evidence base of how to improve TV reporting of stories involving people with severe mental illness in the context of violent crime.

AB  - It is widely accepted that individuals with convictions are disadvantaged when trying to access the job market. People convicted of sexual offences face further prejudice and stigma given the nature of the most extreme examples of their offences. Desiring employment but being unable to secure it presents challenges for the individual. This study focused on the real and perceived barriers that twelve British men experienced while seeking employment with a criminal record pertaining to a sexual offence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with interview data analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Two superordinate themes emerged. Stigma as a Barrier to Employment explored the impact of the disclosure of the sexual criminal record at interview and the enduring stigmatisation the participants faced as a result of the 'sex offender' identity. In the second theme, Autonomy and Control, participants sought to explain the personal significance of being employed, and how their inability to secure employment had resulted in the loss of autonomy and the introduction of self-isolating behaviours. Finally, they acknowledged having felt 'better off' in prison at times, due to the lasting effects of social exclusion. The implications of the research are discussed further.

AB  - Though much work has examined how sexual orientation and body shape are jointly constituted, less has examined the joint perception of body shape, gender/sex, and sexuality. We draw upon multifarious person perception approaches to examine how personality and sexuality-related traits are attributed to bodies of varying shape (skinny, average, fat) when presented with differing social identities along the axes of gender/sex (male, female) and sexual orientation (heterosexual, lesbian/gay). In a sample of 991 participants, we found robust evidence that trait application varied by both body shape and sexual orientation. Further, supporting our hypotheses, we found that gay male bodies were perceived as more feminine than heterosexual male bodies, and skinny male bodies were perceived as more feminine than other body shapes. Supporting additional hypothesizing, lesbian female bodies were perceived as more masculine than heterosexual female bodies, and fat female bodies were perceived as the most masculine across sexual orientations. Partially supporting our hypotheses, we found that average bodies were perceived as the most typical for all identities; further, bodies perceived as less typical of their social identity category were perceived as experiencing heightened prejudice on the basis of body shape.

AB  - Receiving help can make or break a career, but women and racial/ethnic minorities do not always receive the support they seek. Across two audit experiments-one with politicians and another with students-as well as an online experiment (total n = 5,145), we test whether women and racial/ethnic minorities benefit from explicitly mentioning their demographic identity in requests for help, for example, by including statements like "As a Black woman horizontal ellipsis " in their communications. We propose that when a help seeker highlights their marginalized identity, it may activate prospective helpers' motivations to avoid prejudiced reactions and increase their willingness to provide support. Here we show that when women and racial/ethnic minorities explicitly mentioned their demographic identity in help-seeking emails, politicians and students responded 24.4% (7.42 percentage points) and 79.6% (2.73 percentage points) more often, respectively. These findings suggest that deliberately mentioning identity in requests for help can improve outcomes for women and racial/ethnic minorities.
   In two audit experiments with politicians and students, and an online experiment, Kirgios et al. show that women and racial/ethnic minorities seeking help are more likely to receive support when they explicitly mention their marginalized demographic identity.

AB  - Using the stereotype content model and behavior from intergroup affect and stereotypes map model, we examined whether stereotype content directed toward specific disabilities conforms to the high warmth/low competence stereotype associated with "disabled people" or whether individual disabilities, or clusters, would elicit different stereotypes. Participants from the USA rated 12 disabilities on perceived warmth, competence, courage, emotions and behavioral tendencies. All disabilities, except schizophrenia and disability, were rated higher in warmth than competence. Four clusters emerged, varying on relative warmth, competence and courage. Pity was the highest rated emotion, and negative behavioral intentions were generally low. Perceived warmth predicted positive behavioral intentions, but mean ratings suggest actual help might be minimal. Results suggest some uniformity in stereotypes of different disabilities, but some variation in stereotypes indicates the need for targeted interventions to reduce prejudice and discrimination against disabled people.

AB  - As autism is an invisible and often stigmatised condition, disclosing the diagnosis may lead to both support and/or discrimination. This mixed-methods questionnaire study examined autistic adults' experiences of disclosure in various contexts. The sample consisted of 393 participants aged 17-83 years from two longitudinal surveys. Almost all participants disclosed their diagnosis to someone, most commonly to friends. A significant minority of participants studying and/or working at the time had not disclosed to their education provider/employer. Content analysis of open-ended responses showed participants desired to gain understanding and support from disclosure but feared prejudice. While some received support, others encountered dismissiveness and misunderstanding. Findings highlight the need to improve autism understanding and reduce stigma within and beyond educational and employment contexts.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Social Networking Services (SNS), especially Twitter, have been an increasingly popular communication medium, especially in political transformation. This research analyses the language of tweets by Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) of Pakistan, shared during the recent standoff between India and Pakistan on the issue of the Pulwama Attack in February 2019 and the Revocation of Article 370 by the Indian Government in August 2019.
   Methodology: The present research examines the linguistic techniques, and micro and macro approaches used in the discourse of tweets by DG ISPR on the said issues. Selection of vocabulary, tone of the message, and emotion in the discourse are studied through Ideological Square Model under the umbrella of CDA, with the aid of NVivo 12 Plus, to inspect the magnitude of the impact of linguistic memorandums from authoritative institutes.
   Findings: This study has revealed that the impeccable choice of vocabulary by ISPR adequately represented the Military of Pakistan, nationally and internationally, and has brought a state of tranquility at the time of standoff between two rival countries. This research argues that the discourse in tweets by DG ISPR represented Pakistan as a peaceful country but determinedly ready to defend its homeland during external enmity.
   Contributions: This study contributes a better understanding of the subtle ways in which language plays an essential role in creating political polarisation and constructing or manipulating reality while consolidating power struggle, discrimination, prejudice and inequality in society.

AB  - Introduction: By embracing cultural diversity, human rights, and social justice - in its practice and knowledge production -, occupational therapy has been interested in discussing the theme of Africa, problematizing different contemporary social dynamics. Objective: To understand the trajectory, the construction of identity, and the demands of young African immigrant university students. Method: Qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews for data collection and thematic content analysis. Results: The first category, "Culture, identity, and daily life: crossing the Black Atlantic", encompasses the perception of young people about otherness and cultural differences/identifications between Brazil and Africa in their daily lives. The second, "'A country of hunters?': prejudice, discrimination and colonial imaginary" dealt with reports of discrimination in everyday life and the imaginary about Africa in Brazil; The last category, "'The house belongs to the other': institutional support/helplessness and coping strategies", discusses the conditions of reception and permanence of the African immigrant student at the university. Conclusion: The trajectory of African students goes through institutional care, and social and relational needs, which overlap in daily life, culture, and academic performance, emphasizing the experience of racial discrimination inside and outside the university that guides otherness in the construction of subjectivity of young people. The appreciation of African themes demonstrates a tendency of the profession to seek new epistems and decolonial theoretical-methodological constructions that produce other looks for human action in the tension of culture and power relations established by the modern world system.

AB  - Workplace racism threatens organizational health and individual employee well-being. This mixed-methods study asks a sample of child welfare workers (n = 309) to share their experiences of workplace racism. Analysis explores themes and patterns in worker stories and tests relationships between individual characteristics, including if a worker identifies as White or not, and experiences of workplace racism. Qualitative results detail how White privilege impacts workplace interactions; quantitative results show significant between-group differences in the degree of workplace racism experienced by workers of color compared to White workers (p = 0.02), indicating that the average agreement of workers of color on the workplace discrimination and prejudice scale was higher than that of White workers. Study findings indicate that unaddressed racism affects the overall organizational climate, worker of color career advancement, and the inclusion of workers of color in leadership positions.

AB  - Objective: To describe and analyze the perceptions of people who experience tuberculosis/human immunodeficiency virus coinfection in relation to quality of life and health care.
   Methods: An exploratory, descriptive, qualitative study conducted with ten people experiencing coinfection who received care at a reference center in the city of Sao Paulo. A semi-structured questionnaire composed of closed questions and guiding questions was used for data collection. The analysis of testimonies was based on the Theory of Social Determination of the Health-Disease Process.
   Results: Participants mentioned that precarious conditions of life interfered in the quality of life and reported satisfaction with the care provided and the health care network. Experiencing tuberculosis/human immunodeficiency virus coinfection caused suffering, social isolation and stigma, which can contribute to suicidal ideation and lower quality of life. In the perception of participants, health professionals contribute to maintain the quality of life by developing bonds and humanized care.
   Conclusion: Interventions aimed at reducing social inequalities that support the reduction of stigma and prejudice and increase humanized interaction in health services in order to meet users' health needs can exert positive impact on the perception of quality of life and health care of those experiencing tuberculosis/human immunodeficiency virus coinfection.

AB  - Introduction: The discussion about the experiences of readers with comic books raises several points, from identification relationships, production of meanings and resignification to prejudices against this type of media support. Objective: This article aims to investigate the contributions of sequential narratives in the education of the reader, analyzing how such an entertainment object is able to cover concepts and information capable of generating relevant social impacts, identifying, and provoking social reflections. Methodology: The methodology used was a qualitative approach based on a literature review in which articles and scientific papers were raised about the contribution of comics to the reader's education and the teaching-learning process. Results and conclusion: The results showed that the interactions with comic books awakened in readers new ways of thinking and resignification of their roles in society, awakening new meanings caused by the impacts that such stories provoke. The studies also point to the ability to interpret the content present both in the texts and in the images of the comics, after all, the scenario of sequential narratives evokes questions and relevant facts that, when narrated by readers, contribute to the reflection and introjection of knowledge.

AB  - Both leftist and conservative Catholics often described the remarkable growth of the Protestant evangelical churches in Latin America as the "invasion of the Protestant sects". For the former, Pentecostals, along with the more recent wave of conservative evangelicals, helped to reinforce the existing social order in Latin America, thus representing a powerful current of regression and a tool to be wielded by authoritarian regimes. The latter, on the other hand, denied that the sects were a religious phenomenon at all and saw the spread of Protestant missions as the result of a US-promoted conspiracy to break the hegemony of the Church of Rome in that quintessentially Catholic continent. Numerous academic works undertaken in various disciplines of the social sciences (sociology, political science, anthropology), however, have judged this "conspiracy theory" - even if largely true - insufficient in explaining why evangelical missionary groups have been so successful in winning a substantial popular following in Latin America, given the criticism of the Protestant presence from both liberationist and conservative sides - two sides of the same coin, that is, the Catholic Church's "intransigent" opposition to modernity, the Reformation, and the privatisation of faith. This essay tries to prove the opposite by following the complex transformation of this multifaceted anti-US and anti-sectarian Catholic prejudice in the recent history of Latin America.

This focus section brings together three studies on Group-Focused Enmity that had been registered and peer-reviewed before they were conducted. All of the reports advance the Group-Focused Enmity literature in important ways and demonstrate the fruitfulness of the concept. They also show that using sophisticated methods can help us to address novel and exciting questions, and demonstrate the opportunities that preregistration offers for studies analysing secondary data.

T2  - HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REPORT
LA  - English
KW  - love
KW  - fear of vaccination
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - vaccination intention
KW  - METAANALYSIS
AB  - BACKGROUND
   In France, despite fear-based communication by the authorities and the media, vaccination against COVID-19 has received little support from the population. For a young population often convinced that severe forms of the disease affect older people, we hypothesized that communication based on the idea of love would be more effective than communication based on fear of vaccination.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   In a convenience online French sample (N = 480, Mage = 19.4), vaccination intention was asked after fear priming, love priming, no love/prejudice priming, or a control condition. Participants also reported their fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and the recommendation they would make regarding vaccination of a loved/unloved person.
   RESULTS
   Vaccination intention was higher in the love condition than in the fear and no love/prejudice conditions. Surprisingly, fear of vaccination was lower in participants who were presented with fear-inducing questions.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Implications of these results are discussed in relation to the fear of vaccination and the transpersonal value of the idea of love. The results suggest that COVID-19 is experienced as a threat both to oneself and to those one loves most. Therefore, calls for fear in the media and on social networks seem less likely to motivate a young population to vaccinate than the reminder of intense emotional ties to loved ones.

AB  - Objective: to know the experiences of family members of adolescents with gender incongruence. Method: this is a qualitative case study, supported by the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention Models theoretical-methodological framework. Data collection took place through semi-structured interviews, participant observation in family groups and document analysis, with eight family members. Data analysis was performed following the precepts of content analysis. Results: with family assessment, two categories emerged: "Challenges in the face of gender transition", which highlighted the problems related to the expectations created at birth, new names, pronouns and gender fluidity and the fear of prejudice, and "Supporting aspects in the face of the possibility of gender transition", which revealed family support as a strong point. Conclusion: knowing the experiences allowed us to understand the challenges that family members face when facing physical and emotional aspects of their children's gender transition. It was noticed that the act of seeking help and offering support is important for a healthy transition. The findings provided a better understanding of family issues and provided suggestions on how nursing can develop care for this population.

AB  - This article explores the branches of the International Federation of University Women (IFUW) in the interwar period and up to the early 1950s as feminist organisations on the Balkans gathered women intellectuals with various fields of expertise and devoted its initial efforts to equal rights of education and professional career. By means of historical and social network analysis the associations of university women in Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey and their as attempt to create a scientific network of women academics on the peninsula are studied. The main question is to discuss whether or not the Balkan associations of university women were organizations which supported women's movement against the segregation in the University and the museums, which promoted their scientific work in domestic institutions, which assisted them before public prejudices, which gave them opportunities to make contacts with colleagues abroad, and which provide them with scholarships. The analysis of the Balkan associations is made with a comparison with similar women's scientific networks in the Western Europe.

KW  - WORK
AB  - This study aims to understand pre-service teachers' perceptions about mentor teachers' mentoring practices and their relevance to the level of their teaching self-efficacy. A survey was conducted with a sample of 210 pre-service teachers in the 3rd and 4th year of a 4-year bachelor program for elementary teacher education at the University of Prishtina. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 pre-service teachers who reported their highest levels of mentoring experience were with mentor teachers' personal attributes, whilst the lowest level of experience was with feedback provision. Furthermore, they reported their lowest levels of self-efficacy beliefs were in the classroom management domain. Results showed that a lack of close mentoring relationships combined with a lack of institutional (faculty) support and commitment to student professional development had a negative impact on pre-service teachers' perceptions of their experiences. Findings indicate that the quality of mentoring may be enhanced when mentors display attributes such as hospitality, openness to collaboration, non-prejudicial approaches, space for engagement, and encouragement to take initiatives. More information about system requirements, more feedback, more support, and closer rapport with mentors can contribute to higher teaching self-efficacy for pre-service teachers.

AB  - In response to U.S. government restrictions imposed as part of a nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic, charismatic worship leader Sean Feucht began a series of worship concerts. Feucht positioned these protests as expressions of Christian religious freedom in opposition to mandated church closings and a perceived double-standard regarding the large gatherings of protesters over police violence against Black and Brown persons. Government restrictions challenged the sine qua non liturgical act of encounter with God for evangelicals, Pentecostals, and Charismatics: congregational singing in Praise and Worship. However, as Feucht's itinerant worship concerts traversed urban spaces across the U.S. to protest these restrictions, the events gained a double valence. Feucht and event attendees sought to channel God's power through musical worship to overturn government mandates and, along the way, they invoked longstanding social and racial prejudices toward urban spaces. In this essay, I argue that Feucht's events reveal complex theological motivations that weave together liturgical-theological, social, and political concerns. Deciphering this complex tapestry requires a review of both the history of evangelical engagement with urban spaces and the theological history of Praise and Worship. Together, these two sets of historical resources generate a useful frame for considering how Feucht, as a charismatic musical worship leader, attempts to wield spiritual power through musical praise to change political situations and the social conditions.

TI  - Oliver C. Cox and the political economy of racial capitalism
T2  - DIALECTICAL ANTHROPOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - CASTE
KW  - RACE
AB  - Oliver C. Cox was one of the most important and accomplished US-based sociologists, labor historians, and socialist thinkers of the twentieth century. He produced a series of classic works on racial prejudice and race relations and the foundations and development of capitalism. Despite some recent interest in his work, likely due to the renewed interest in the concept of racial capitalism, in-depth analysis of Cox's work remains underdeveloped. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, the paper shows that the development of racial prejudice was, for Cox, not only an invention of capitalism as a particular moment in history, but it was also always undergirded by the requirements of capitalist political economy. Second, I show the dynamics that Cox believed were required to establish the conditions for racially prejudiced working-class subjects. Part of capital's ideological alibi was, for Cox, the development and sedimentation of working-class racial antagonism. Yet, Cox showed that racial antagonism among the working class was inherently contradictory and counter to working-class interests and was traceable to the social, political, and economic apparatus of the elite class. Because the elite class necessarily relies upon the exploitation of the labor supply, it likewise relies upon racial antagonism to maintain labor quiescence. The work of the social scientist, then, is to explain such asocial phenomena in materialist terms, thereby redirecting working-class energy toward solidarity and the horizon of socialist revolution.

AB  - Many Chinese Canadians (CCs) have experienced increased racism and xenophobia since the beginning of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study focused on how this rise of anti-Chinese discrimination, in addition to the threats posed by the pandemic itself, affects not only CCs' well-being, but also their Chinese and Canadian identities. We surveyed 874 CC adults from across Canada, M (age) = 42.09; 47.7% females; 628 foreign-born, first-generation (G1) and 246 Canadian-born, second or later generation (G2). The reported rates of discriminatory experiences were alarming: More than half of the respondents reported that they had been treated with less respect because of their ethnicity (G1: 60.6%; G2: 56.8%), and over a third reported that they had been personally threatened or intimidated (G1: 35.2%; G2: 39.8%). Generational status moderated CCs' pandemic experiences, such that G1 CCs perceived more health, financial, and cultural threats due to the pandemic, but G2 CCs reported more personal and group discrimination. Perceived discrimination was associated with CCs' negative affect even after controlling for pandemic threats. The type of discrimination had different implications for heritage and mainstream cultural identities. For both groups, personal discrimination was negatively associated with Canadian identity, whereas group discrimination was positively associated with Chinese identity. Only about 10% of CCs who experienced harassment reported their encounters to authorities or on social media; CCs' perceptions that others saw them as perpetual foreigners undermined their reporting of harassment. The findings' implications for acculturation, identity, anti-racism strategies, and empowerment in reporting harassment are discussed.
   Public Significance Statement COVID-19 pandemic poses various threats for all Canadians, but Chinese Canadians have also faced increased racism. For example, the present study found that two-thirds of respondents had been treated disrespectfully and over a third were openly threatened or harassed during the pandemic. As a result of this discrimination, not only is Chinese Canadians' physical and psychological well-being undermined, but also their sense of belonging to Canadian society. Generational status affected the relative impact of pandemic-related challenges, such that foreign-born Chinese Canadians experienced more health, financial, and cultural threats, whereas Canadian-born Chinese perceived more personal and group discrimination. As the prejudice and discrimination against Chinese Canadians are likely to continue, there are ongoing challenges for research and the community to work together in combating racism, encouraging anti-racism reporting, and supporting Chinese and other Asian Canadians' resilience and recovery from the pandemic.

AB  - Background Every person has a persona (or mask) which is the facade that every person shows to the world. Thus, males use facade to reveal or conceal their true feelings and emotions. Also, the male uses mental health facade to protect themselves from prejudice and judgment. Thus, the study aimed to explore the experiences of male Saudi nursing students of mental health. Method Husserl's descriptive phenomenology was used as a guiding lens to explore. Eleven participants were involved in the study by using the referral sampling technique. An unstructured interview was performed to gather information from the participants. The seven steps of the descriptive Colaizzi process were followed to investigate and examine the obtained data. The credibility, dependability, confirmability, transferability, and reflexivity criteria were observed to ensure the rigor of the study. Results The findings have two major themes. The first theme is the unadulterated smile that describes optimism in the family and mutual guarantee. The second theme is the orchestrated smile, which describes avoiding diverting burdens, social responsibility, protection of self, and reputation. Conclusions The findings document that the mental health facade of male Saudi nursing students is associated with the expectation of family optimism, mutual guarantee, the expectation of society, and self-protection.

AB  - Hydrogeochemical and Health Risk Assessments of trace elements are integral to groundwater resource assessment, utilization, and human health. Investigation of groundwater chemistry and trace elemental impact on local inhabitants were attempted in Shanmuganadhi basin, Tamilnadu, India. About 60 groundwater samples were collected during the pre-monsoon period and analyzed for hydrochemical composition, including major and trace elements (Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu Pb, Mn, and As) to isolate chemical characteristics and human health risk assessment. Groundwater geochemistry is prejudiced by geochemical reactions uniting cation exchange, dissolution and precipitation, adsorption, and anthropogenic contributions. About thirty-two percent of groundwater samples recorded higher F-(>1.5 mg/L) than the prescribed limit suggests sources from rock weathering and silicate dissolution. Nitrates (>45.0 mg/L) suggest sources from agricultural influences. Water types indicate alkalis (Na+ + K+) dominating alkali earth (Ca2+ - Mg2+) and strong acids (Cl- and SO42-) looming weak acid (CO32- and HCO3-) irrespective of water samples. The geochemical stability diagram suggests precipitation of silica, carbonate, and magnesium and dissolution of sulphate minerals along the groundwater flow path. Significant correlation between major ions and trace elements (Pb, Mn, Ni, and Cu) suggests origin from rock weathering, human impacts, and cultivation practices. Non-carcinogenic human risk for trace elements was higher in children compared with adults via ingestion and dermal exposure. The carcinogenic result suggests that Cr in CHK (7.1 x 10(-2)) and HBG (4.3 x 10(-)(2)) have the most excellent chance of cancer risk. The environmental risk category attempted using Comprehensive risk factor (CRI) suggests Pb (3.2-CHK, 2.6-HBG) with potential cancer risk. The comprehensive evaluation index recommends environmental damage between mild to moderate, indicating continuous exposure of traceable elements might result in cancer cause to the inhabitants. The study suggests water quality seems to be prejudiced by various geological and anthropogenic causes and endorses counteractive measures and proper execution of existing laws to protect groundwater resources in the study area.

AB  - Background: Online grocery stores offer opportunities to encourage healthier food choices at the moment that consumers place a product of their choice in their basket. This study assessed the effect of a swap offer, Nutri-Score labeling, and a descriptive norm message on the nutrient profiling (NP) score of food choices in an online food basket. Additionally explored was whether these interventions made it more motivating and easier for consumers to select healthier foods and whether potential effects were moderated by consumer health interest.
   Methods: Hypotheses were tested with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a simulated online supermarket. Dutch participants (n = 550) chose their preferred product out of six product options for four different categories (breakfast cereals, crackers, pizza, and muesli bars). Participants were randomly allocated to one of eight groups based on the interventions in a 2 (Nutri-Score: present, not present) X 2 (swap offer: present, not present) X 2 (norm message: present, not present) between subject design. The primary outcome was the difference in combined NP score of product choices, for which a lower score represented a healthier product.
   Results: Swap offer (B = - 9.58, 95% CI: [- 12.026; - 7.132], eta(2) = 0.098) and Nutri-Score labeling (B = - 3.28, 95% CI: [- 5.724; -.829], eta(2) = 0.013) significantly improved the combined NP score compared to the control condition (NP score M = 18.03, SD = 14.02), whereas a norm message did not have a significant effect (B = - 1.378, 95% CI [- 3.825; 1.070], eta(2) = 0.002). No evidence was found that interventions made it more motivating or easier for consumers to select healthier food, but situational motivation significantly influenced the healthiness score of food choices for both swap offer (b = - 3.40, p < .001) and Nutri-Score (b = - 3.25, p < .001). Consumer health interest only significantly moderated the influence of Nutri-Score on ease of identifying the healthy food option (b = .23, p = .04).
   Conclusions: Swap offer and Nutri-Score labeling were effective in enhancing healthy purchase behavior in the online store environment.

AB  - This article discusses flaws of Indonesia's criminal procedural laws through an analysis of the Jessica Wongso case. After a televised trial in 2016, Wongso was convicted of murdering her friend Salihin, by putting cyanide in her coffee at a Jakarta cafe, and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. The conviction was upheld on appeal in late 2018. The police obtained very limited evidence against Wongso, leaving prosecutors unable to determine the cause of Salihin's death, much less to prove convincingly that Wongso was the perpetrator. By contrast, the defense mustered significant exculpatory evidence. But the judges, at first instance and on appeal, took an uncritical view of the prosecution evidence and ignored the defense case. Throughout the investigation and trial, Wongso was not accorded the presumption of innocence, partly because of Indonesia's flawed or absent formal legal infrastructure for arrests, detentions, searches, and disclosure of prosecution evidence to the defense. It is also because highly prejudicial press coverage before and during trials is not prohibited and because judges lack professionalism. All this suggests a strong need for reform-not only to Indonesia's criminal procedure law, but also to the way it is applied in practice.

AB  - The perpetration of gender-based inequality is a despicable practice; it is often normalized in the name of cultural norms that exacerbate favoritism to a particular gender and tyrannical prejudice against the other. Judith Butler; one of the most celebrated theorists contends that gender fluidity is conspicuously relevant for ages and persists to be a popular and significant area of research for various researchers. It is striking that most people perceive sex and gender roles as biologically determined. Judith Butler rejects this idea and tendentiously and tenaciously argues that gender is a social construction. She thus gives a new direction to the debate of Gender Identity. She suggests that anyone can be male or female indifferent to his or her biological sex. Interestingly Indian epics are found supporting Judith Butler when a close reading of famous Indian epics is made. Lord Shiva who is known for his masculinity is also known for his half woman form. His 'Tandav' is admired. Lord Vishnu is well known for his feminine associations. Ironically it happens in the same society where dancing men are humiliated as it is aptly highlighted by Mahesh Dattani in his renowned play Dance like a Man which highlights a man's agony as he finds his passion in dance, so called feminine sphere. Dattani problematizes these issues and compels the reader to contemplate on various stereotypes. The Indian epics with all their magnanimity and plurality create enormous scope for the re-interpretation and re-presentation of gender fluidity across genre and media. The present paper seeks to re-examine various mythological figures who display a broad understanding of genderidentity that modern society hesitates to accept.

AB  - In India, many women from former untouchable caste groups (Dalits) are domestic workers. Despite attempts at seeking formal, legal recognition, they continue to be seen by the state as part of a broad, ambiguous category of "informal workers" whose work is stigmatized and not legislated for. In this essay, I suggest that the discourses and practices of a neighborhood-level Dalit domestic workers' union in Mumbai reconceptualize domestic work as "formal" work. The workers assert themselves as formal workers (kamgaar) owing to their long histories of work in specific neighborhoods, relationships of trust with employers, and their ability to negotiate long-standing employment with them. Though domestic work does not align with the state's definition of formal work (for example, through the presence of written contracts), for the workers, it was their own qualities, origins, social positions, and relationships that defined the formality of work rather than the other way around. Centering respect and dignity in their own work, their union also facilitated the articulation of the caste and gender-based prejudices that have not only kept domestic workers outside the ambit of formal recognition but also have brought about routine encounters with violence and harassment for Dalit women in the local neighborhood.

AB  - Tony Harrison is a contemporary British author whose poetry is highly influential in encountering the issue of identity and class struggles. As a working-class student, Harrison was subject to prejudice and discrimination for his working-class accent. This paper investigates two of his highly admired poems, "On Not Being Milton" and "Them & [uz]" from a cultural standpoint, mainly concentrated on John Fiske's theory of power and language. The role of language in the context of his poems is probed. The multiaccentuality of language is represented in his poetry and these two poems become the site of struggle for the imperialising and the localising power. It is intended to illuminate the sought space of identity which Harrison is constantly referring to as a member of the English working-class society. Lastly, the social and personal relationship between Harrison and Milton has been explored positing Harrison in a transcendental context in his relationship with Milton.

AB  - This review aims to examine the discrimination and prejudices toward the accent of non-native English speakers and cyberbullying as the ripple effect of these negative consequences. Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework of conducting a scoping review, 60 studies from 2012 to 2021 were retrieved from the ERIC and Google Scholar databases. The studies were reviewed from two aspects: (1) psychological impact on speakers with a non-native English accent, (2) attitudes toward non-native English accents from the victim's and perpetrator's perspectives. The findings suggested that speaking with a non-native English accent drew negative cognitive, affective, and behavioral experiences. Biases toward non-native English accents were due to the general derogatory perception of an accent and the comprehensibility of speakers' accent and pronunciation. "Accent acceptability" can be inculcated at all levels of education, not only through multicultural education but also through the concerted effort of policy makers and practitioners to seriously address this social issue. Accent awareness can dispel unwarranted and undesirable judgements of non-native English accent speakers. Future studies should be conducted on the effects of social and mental health experiences, particularly of non-native ESL and EFL teachers, given that this may be the only profession required to teach "live" during the pandemic and thus be subjected to public praise or ridicule.

AB  - Scientific objectivity and reliability are matters of fundamental importance both to science and in the public sphere, where they tend to be regarded with scepticism due to reporting of faulty or biased information, particularly in certain domains. In science studies, these qualities have been questioned in the light of two main characteristics of scientific activity: the inadequacy of data to determine theories, which opens the door to the possible influence of epistemic and value-based assumptions and prejudices, and the social character of scientific work, which may magnify their effect. Science education has a role to play in promoting informed trust in science and in improving science by preparing students to act positively either in the research field as future scientists or in the public domain as informed citizens. In this article, we systematize questions, responses, and arguments relating to the objectivity and trustworthiness of science that have been propounded in the philosophy, history, and sociology of science and which may contribute to an epistemologically sound conception of the subject in science education. We examine the kinds of bias that can affect science, the mechanisms available for dealing with them, and the arguments against treating them as a basis for blanket scepticism. The positions and arguments examined in this analysis generally imply that science is trustworthy and valuable, but confidence in science should be qualified, depending on the circumstances of each research program and the community that produces it, and they suggest means for improving the function and social role of science.

AB  - Background In the COVID-19 pandemic, Switzerland introduced broad nationwide face mask mandates only by October 2020, later than other Western European countries. This study aims to assess the underlying values and considerations of individuals to wear face masks in the absence of face mask mandates in the COVID-19 pandemic in German-speaking Switzerland. Methods As part of the "Solidarity in times of a pandemic" (SolPan) research commons, we interviewed 31 participants living in the German-speaking part of Switzerland in April 2020 and 25 of them again in October 2020. Qualitative inductive thematic analysis was applied for data analysis and interpretation. Public health ethics principles guided the interpretation and organization of findings. Results Five themes were identified: Trust and governmental policy; perceived benefits of mask-wearing; perceived risks of mask-wearing; social exclusion and prejudice; and decision-making in the absence of mandates. In light of increasing infection rates in October 2020, many participants started to consider the benefits higher than the risks and were willing to accept face mask mandates in that context, despite earlier reservations. Conclusions The absence of face mask mandates underline individual autonomy but may also suppress personal responsibility due to social influence. Face masks are only temporarily acceptable in liberal Western societies and face mask mandates should be enforced only when epidemiologically necessary.

AB  - In the 1990s, Canadian historian Peter Hart claimed tens of thousands of native southern Irish Protestants experienced something akin to "ethnic cleansing" at the hands of the IRA in the early 1920s. Hart's research revised the "Irish nationalist revolution" (ca. 1917-1923) as an essentially ethnic conflict, and this article re-examines his evidence and methodology. Exaggerating the number of forced migrations, Hart's analysis rests on erroneous statistical proofs which he supported with a gross evidence selection bias. To better understand Hart's revision, his work is compared with Michael A. Bellesiles' Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture (2000), which also exhibited similar but also very different statistical errors. A central argument in this article is that erroneous statistical proofs are best understood as social constructs, where they articulate the prejudices of their host academies. Greater awareness of this problem is needed if it is to be avoided in the future.

AB  - In this article I maintain that when employers could free workers from the space constraint of the office without incurring unbearable economic losses, it is morally wrong not to grant workers the possibility to work remotely, as this violates the humanity formulation of Kant's categorical imperative. The article therefore aims to contribute to the development of Kantian business ethics, taking into account a series of empirical evidence gathered in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. I firstly discuss the Kantian concept of meaningful work and explain why, due to a prejudice that existed with respect to remote work before the Covid-19 pandemic, the issue of freedom from the office was not given normative relevance. I then introduce a Kantian argument in defence of remote work and proceed to discuss two objections. The first objection is that remote work may well foster productivity, but it creates problems in terms of innovation and training of new staff. The second objection is that remote work hinders rather than fosters meaningful work because it deprives employees of social relations and inhibits workplace identity. I conclude by explaining why neither objection undermines the normative argument that workers should be allowed to work remotely as long as the "bearable costs" clause is met.

AB  - Ideological convictions are known to shape attitudes and behavior in various life domains. Based on existing psychological analyses of political ideology, we use an ideological dual-process approach to explain people's vaccine hesitancy, which distinguishes between authoritarian (right-wing authoritarianism [RWA]) and hierarchical (social dominance orientation [SDO]) facets of conservatism as potential antecedents of vaccination attitudes. In a large international study performed in Germany (N = 1,210), Poland (N = 1,209), and the United Kingdom (N = 1,222), we tested the roles of SDO and RWA in predicting vaccination hesitancy, as well as cross-cultural universality of the pattern of relationships between political ideologies and attitudes toward vaccines. In all three countries, high SDO was associated with higher vaccine hesitancy, whereas high RWA was associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. These findings contribute to our understanding of the distinctive roles that these two facets of right-wing ideology might play in the domain of public health.

AB  - Risk-taking is sometimes admired and sometimes disparaged. In this research, we examine previously unexplored questions concerning how membership in social groups is related to expectations and perceptions of risk-taking. We propose that prototypes of risk-takers incorporate racial associations. We conducted five studies (N-Total = 1,603, predominantly White residents of the United States) examining whether prototypes of risk-takers-primarily reckless and responsible ones-activate racial stereotypes and discrimination. We first focused on whether participants perceive Black (vs. White) men as more likely to engage in risk-taking, broadly construed (Study 1). Next, we tested whether the trait attributions (Studies 2 and 3) and mental images constructed with the reverse correlation task (Study 3) of reckless risk-takers are more stereotypically Black (and less White) than responsible risk-takers. In Study 4, we employed an investment game to investigate participants' willingness to trust targets we depicted using the racialized mental images of reckless and responsible risk-takers derived from Study 3. A final study examined whether thinking about reckless risk-takers evokes Black stereotypes broadly, including even positive stereotype content. Findings confirmed that reckless risk-takers were imagined as more phenotypically Black and as having more stereotypically Black traits (both positive and negative), compared with responsible risk-takers. Theoretical and practical implications for this novel stereotype content in the domain of risk are discussed.

AB  - Public Significance Statement Dehumanization foments aggression and violence, so understanding the psychological mechanisms underlying it is crucial. Our results suggest that one such mechanism is psychological essentialism, laying the groundwork for interventions that aim to attenuate dehumanization by targeting this sociocognitive process.
   Dehumanization has played a prominent role in myriad human atrocities, which inspired us to investigate its social-cognitive basis. Since dehumanization consists of perceiving another to lack a defining human essence, scholars have suggested the process is grounded in psychological essentialism, the belief that members of a group all share an underlying essence. Indeed, Americans' essentialist thinking predicted their blatant dehumanization of various national outgroups (Study 1). After demonstrating this relationship, we attempted to mitigate dehumanization by reducing the tendency to think in an essentialist manner. Subjects led to hold an incremental theory about human traits (Study 2) or led to question the biological basis of racial differences (Study 3) subsequently expressed less psychological essentialism (limited to the specific aspect of biological essentialism in Study 3), and these reductions in essentialism predicted lower dehumanization. Despite these indirect effects, we generally failed to observe mean differences in dehumanization between experimental conditions, so we encourage future research to investigate third variables that may suppress the effect of essentialism-reducing interventions.

AB  - Psychological science aims to make the abstract measurable and quantifiable. As psychologists it is our challenge and charge to capture complex abstractions (e.g., authoritarianism, prejudice, depression) accurately and with transparency. But recent concerns have been raised about the proliferation of constructs across psychology sub-disciplines, with construct redundancy now rife. Critics charge that we do not take seriously construct validity, especially discriminant validity, which exacerbates the replication crisis. Here the author outlines the problem and discusses at a conceptual level how latent modeling can aptly capture constructs and their interrelations without error, isolating and helping to circumvent construct validity problems. At the core of the issue lies a mathematical reality that seems to be largely ignored in psychology: if correlations within and between indicators of constructs are roughly comparable, their latent factors will correlate near-perfectly and thus be redundant. Thoughts about how the field arrived at this juncture are discussed, along with a recommendation to avoid using cute labels (e.g., jingle-jangle fallacies) to represent very serious problems (better labeled as construct redundancy fallacies). Recommendations for thinking straight about constructs, their validation, and their uniqueness, are offered.

AB  - This study explores the mechanisms of racial discrimination in U.S. independent filmmaking. To answer this question, I combine the theoretical toolkits on Hollywood discrimination and Bourdieu's theory of cultural production. I employ in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 30 U.S.-based independent filmmakers of color, and observations of public discussions at film festivals in the greater Los Angeles area. I find that despite independent film's inclusive and non-commercial discourses, many of the mechanisms of racial exclusion that underlie Hollywood's lack of diversity also exist in independent film: the economic uncertainty of creative labor, racialized market logics, the economic stigmatization of artists of color, and the reliance on closed social networks for career advancement. Furthermore, I also find that non-commercial factors in the field of independent film also constrain the ability for filmmakers of color to make art reflective of their experiences, form mutually beneficial collaborations with other artists of color, or invest their time in projects that are culturally innovative. These findings suggest that even at the margins of mainstream cultural production, mechanisms of racialization can still operate where racial prejudice and racialized economics outweigh artistic independence.

AB  - This interdisciplinary essay combines science, social sciences, and the humanities to argue in favor of a less rigid understanding of the traditional gender binary of male and female. Relying on recent scientific studies on the sex/gender of the body (internal organs like the brain and chromosomal constitution, for example), this essay mentions results of scientific studies that challenge the binary understanding of gender. These studies point to a much more fluid biological spectrum of the binary male/female-to a trans fluid nature of gender. A less rigid understanding of the nature of gender of all human beings-not just those identified as trans sexual-might help in eradicating prejudices that lead to discrimination and harassment towards the trans community. As the public policy literature reviewed in this article documents, even with laws and policies to protect them from discrimination and harassment, the trans community is still subjected to both. One reason is that laws and policies are still subjected to the interpretation of policy makers and administrators whose decisions, consciously or not, are not immune to biases and prejudices. To further illustrate the scientifically proven trans fluid nature of gender, I will analyze two recent cultural products: One is from Latin America, the Chilean film "Una mujer fatastica," and the second is an autobiographical essay by a transgender Chicano Professor of Women and Gender Studies-Francisco J. Galarte's "Transitions: The Dolorous Return of a Chicana/o Transfronterizo." By analyzing these two cultural products, my aim is to illustrate how these works illustrate gender fluidity in everyday life.

AB  - Objective Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, social stigma towards COVID-19 infection has become a major component of public discourse and social phenomena. As such, we aimed to develop and validate the COVID-19 Public Stigma Scale (COVID-PSS). Design and setting National-based survey cross-sectional study during the lockdown in Thailand. Participants We invited the 4004 adult public to complete a set of measurement tools, including the COVID-PSS, global fear of COVID-19, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, Bogardus Social Distance Scale, Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index. Methods Factor structure dimensionality was constructed and reaffirmed with model fit by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and non-parametric item response theory (IRT) analysis. Psychometric properties for validity and reliability were tested. An anchor-based approach was performed for classifying the proper cut-off scores. Results After factor analysis, IRT analysis and test for model fit, we created the final 10-item COVID-PSS with a three-factor structure: stereotype, prejudice and fear. Face and content validity were established through the public and experts' perspectives. The COVID-PSS was significantly correlated (Spearman rank, 95% CI) with the global fear of COVID-19 (0.68, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.70), perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (0.79, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.80) and the Bogardus Social Distance Scale (0.50, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.53), indicating good convergent validity. The correlation statistics between the COVID-PSS and the Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index were <0.2, supporting the discriminant validity. The reliability of the COVID-PSS was satisfactory, with good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.85, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.86) and test-retest reproducibility (intraclass correlation of 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.96). The proposed cut-off scores were as follows: no/minimal (<= 18), moderate (19-25) and high (>= 26) public stigma towards COVID-19 infection. Conclusions The COVID-PSS is practical and suitable for measuring stigma towards COVID-19 in a public health survey. However, cross-cultural adaptation may be needed.

AB  - This article argues that it is not Buddhism, per se, but rather Buddhist extremism, that is responsible for violence against relevant out-groups. Moreover, it suggests that the causes of Buddhist extremism, rather than being determined solely by textual and scriptural justifications for out-group violence, are rooted instead in the intersection between social psychology and theology, rather than organically arising from the latter, per se. This article unpacks this argument by a deeper exploration of Theravada Buddhist extremism in Sri Lanka. It argues that religious extremism, including its Buddhist variant, is best understood as a fundamentalist belief system that justifies structural violence against relevant out-groups. A total of seven of the core characteristics of the religious extremist are identified and employed to better grasp how Buddhist extremism in Sri Lanka manifests itself on the ground. These are: the fixation with maintaining identity supremacy; in-group bias; out-group prejudice; emphasis on preserving in-group purity via avoidance of commingling with the out-group; low integrative complexity expressed in binary thinking; dangerous speech in both soft- and hard-modes; and finally, the quest for political power, by force if needed. Future research could, inter alia, explore how these seven characteristics also adequately describe other types of religious extremism.

AB  - Background: Self-stigma is a dimension of stigma concerning how individuals internalize negative attributes and discriminate against their own selves. Dementia is a stigmatizing condition, and there is a paucity of research exploring the manifestations and implications of self- stigma in people living with dementia in various contexts. Aim: To examine how self-stigma manifests in the experiences of people living with early-stage dementia in Santiago, Chile. Participants: Six men and five women living with early-stage dementia of the Alzheimer's type, aged between 64 and 82 years old (mean = 70). Methods: One-on-one interviews were conducted, focusing on the experience of people living with early-stage dementia to provide insights on how self-stigma manifests. Interviews were analyzed with a qualitative content analysis approach using Corrigan's social cognitive model of self-stigma (2016). Results: Self-stigma manifested as devaluation and blame at a cognitive level, and as restriction of participation at a behavioral level. Families and dementia education emerged as contextual elements that influenced the internalization of negative attributes in the participants' experiences. Conclusions: Consistent with previous qualitative research, we found that self-stigma has negative consequences as it concerns emotions, self-prejudices, and self-discrimination. This study provides distinctive insights on the process of internalization of stigma and the influence of external elements. Self-stigma remains an understudied but important feature of the dementia experience, an understanding of which can lead to developing and testing supportive approaches upon diagnosis to minimize its adverse effects.

AB  - The use of force is arguably the defining feature of police. Yet this power is often controversial: a key node in the contest and debate that almost always swirls around police, with the question of race never far from such contestation. In this paper, we consider the influence of race in responses to use of force incidents among British-based samples. Using two text-based vignette experiments and one video study, our aims are threefold: (1) to explore the influence of suspect race in how people respond to police use of force; (2) to test the interaction between participant ethnicity and suspect race; and (3) to understand what attitudes and beliefs influence how people respond to police use of force. We found no effect of suspect race on how people judged police use of force. White participants were slightly more accepting of police use of force than black participants, but there was no interaction with suspect race. The strongest predictor of acceptance of police use of force was trust in police, and, controlling for other relevant predictors, racial prejudice was also a significant positive predictor of acceptance of use of force. To our knowledge this is the first study of its kind to be fielded in the UK.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of counter-stereotypes cognitive training on adolescents' aging stereotypes and to further investigate the best training method to intervene in aging stereotypes by comparing the effect of single and multiple intervention training methods on aging stereotypes and their retention effects. Three experiments examined the different intervention outcomes of different counter-stereotypes cognitive training on adolescent aging stereotypes. The study used a randomized block group experimental design and recruited a total of 183 middle school students for testing. Experiment 1 verified the effect of counter-stereotypes cognitive training by taking a single training task (evaluative conditioning technique), randomly assigning subjects to different conditions (training task or unrelated drawing task), and administering a follow-up test 24h after the posttest. Experiment 2a compared the effects of multiple versus single cognitive training, where we took multiple (adding the counter-stereotypes situational storytelling method) versus single training tasks and administered a follow-up test 72h after the posttest. Experiment 2b increased the number of training sessions based on Experiment 2a, with a second intervention training 72h after the end of the posttest and a follow-up test 72h after the second training. Experimental results suggest that evaluative conditioning techniques are effective in weakening subjects' aging stereotypes, but are less effective in maintaining them. Compared to a single training task, multi-tasking is more effective and the effects of the intervention are maintained for up to a week by increasing the number of training sessions.

AB  - Donald Trump's campaign slogan to "Make America Great Again" captivated the imagination of millions of Americans by contextualizing disparate sources of social resentment as emblematic of a broader story of American decline. Employing a "traditionalist civil religious jeremiad," Trump called for a reassertion of American exceptionalism, and extolled a romanticized golden age predating transformative social changes (e.g., sexuality, gender roles, racial equality). As such, his rhetoric legitimized the defense of white male privilege as a vital component of this restoration. While this use of civil religious themes emboldened those who harbor prejudicial views, it alienated others who interpret such rhetoric as an assault on the soul of the nation. Relying on a unique module within the 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we demonstrate that adherence to the tenets of American civil religion significantly exacerbated the effects of symbolic racism and modern sexism on support for Trump.

AB  - Critical discourse analysis (CDA) increasingly recognises the role played by multiple semiotic modes in the discursive construction of social identities and inequalities. One embodied mode that has not been subject to any systematic analysis within CDA is gesture. An area where gesture has been extensively studied, and where it is shown to bear significant semiotic load in multimodal utterances, is cognitive linguistics. Here, we use insights from cognitive linguistics to provide a detailed qualitative analysis of gestures in a specific discursive context - the anti-immigration discourse of Nigel Farage. We describe the gestures that accompany a range of rhetorical tropes typical of anti-immigration discourses and critically analyse their role, alongside speech, in communicating prejudice and legitimating discriminatory action. Our analysis suggests that gesture is an important part of political discourse which is worthy of further investigation in future CDA research.

TI  - THE GAY PERJURY TRAP

KW  - INFORMATION

KW  - EQUALITY
KW  - MEN
AB  - In Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court held Title VII's prohibition on sex-based employment discrimination applies to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Although the opinion is an important victory, if history is any guide, Bostock was only one battle in a larger war against invidious workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Prejudiced employers and managers will seek alternative, less obvious ways to discriminate. Judges and civil rights lawyers must prepare themselves to recognize and reject pretextual rationales for adverse actions taken against lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees. A better understanding of history can inform those efforts.
   This Article examines an unexplored chapter in the United States' history of anti-gay discrimination in the workplace: punishing gay workers for concealing their sexual orientation. Beginning in the 1960s, as federal and state law implemented procedural protections for public-sector workers, employers developed a new mechanism to evade those protections: the gay perjury trap. At its core, the strategy is simple. An employer asks job applicants about their sexual orientation. If they reveal that they are gay, decline to hire them. If gay workers conceal their sexual orientation and it is later discovered, terminate them for their dishonesty. Either way, gay workers are purged from the workforce.
   This Article provides historical examples of the federal government and local school districts using this strategy to terminate high-performing workers who were later discovered to be gay. After discussing the inherent unfairness of the gay perjury trap, this Article explains how prejudiced employers may attempt to deploy this strategy as a means of circumventing Title VII liability in the post-Bostock era. Finally, this Article discusses how courts should prevent employers from using the gay perjury trap in the post-Bostock work environment. Dismantling the gay perjury trap entails three components. First, courts should interpret Title VII as prohibiting employers from inquiring about an applicant's or employee's sexual orientation. Second, courts should not afford employers a general right to penalize gay workers for concealing or misrepresenting their sexual orientation. Third, courts should construe Title VII to protect employees who refuse to answer questions about their sexual orientation.
   Whether Title VII can effectively deter and remedy anti-gay discrimination will in significant part depend on courts' ability to recognize and prohibit employers from using the gay perjury trap. The post-Bostock Title VII cannot succeed if employers can use alleged dishonesty about sexual orientation as a means of punishing gay workers and avoiding liability.

AB  - Minority groups have long been underrepresented in politics. Support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights and the incidence of LGBT candidates have dramatically increased in recent years. But do voters (still) penalize LGT candidates? We conducted original survey experiments with nationally representative samples in the United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. To varying degrees voters penalize LGT candidates in all countries, with penalties strongest in the United States. Yet, progressives, people with LGBT friends, and nonreligious individuals do not discriminate against gays and lesbians, while transgender candidates face stronger bias. Electability concerns, outright prejudice, and identity cueing (i.e., LGT candidates seen as more liberal) explain voter bias. This study contributes to the literature on minority candidates and disentangles correlated candidate attributes, exploring the intersectionality of bias. Understanding the barriers to the election of LGT people is crucial to improve the representation of marginalized communities.

AB  - Racial tensions continue to ignite social unrest in the United States. Structural racism is increasingly recognized as a public health issue. It is therefore necessary to continue addressing the interaction of race and medicine, including anesthesiology. While many may overlook the impact that racial discrimination has had on the development of anesthesiology, understanding pain through a racialized lens has always been entwined with this medical specialty since its origins. Considering the first public demonstration of ether anesthesia in 1846 occurred 15 years before the American Civil War (1861-1865), it is naive to pretend that anesthesia has been insulated from racial prejudice. We increasingly recognize the effects of variables, such as housing and education, which are important as social determinants of health. Across ethnic and racial lines, statistically significant differences persist in pain assessment and analgesia delivery. To understand these irregularities without relying on unsupported theories, we must challenge our current understanding of race in medicine. By reviewing the history of anesthesia through a racialized lens, we may better explore our biases and develop strategies towards racially equitable care. This article focuses on anesthesia's roots on the plantation in the American South, the medical perpetuation of racial disparities, and the challenges we face in healthcare today.

AB  - Recent years have seen a surge of interest in implicit bias. Driving this concern is the thesis, apparently established by tests such as the IAT, that people who hold egalitarian explicit attitudes and beliefs are often influenced by implicit mental processes that operate independently from, and are largely insensitive to, their explicit attitudes. We argue that implicit bias testing in social and empirical psychology does not, and without a fundamental shift in focus could not, establish this startling thesis. We suggest that implicit bias research has been conducted in light of inadequate theories of racism and sexism. As a result, such testing has not sufficiently controlled for subjects' prejudiced explicit beliefs and emotions, and has not ruled out the possibility that explicit prejudice best explains test subjects' discriminatory associations and behavior.

AB  - Purpose The label "Personality Disorder" continues to divide opinion. Challenges to the terminology of personality disorder led by people with lived experience and supported by critical practitioners and academics are tempered by acknowledgement of certain positive social consequences of obtaining a diagnosis. This study aims to engage service users and staff in a process of inquiry to better understand the complexities of views on the terminology of Personality Disorder. Design/methodology/approach This study set out to qualitatively explore the views of a range of people with lived, occupational and dual lived experience/occupational expertise, relating to the diagnostic label of Personality Disorder, via participatory and critical group debate. The World Cafe approach is an innovative methodology for participatory inquiry into subjective views suited to exploring the contested subject matter. Findings This study identified contrasting opinions towards the label of Personality Disorder and provides insight into the concerns described for both keeping and losing the label. Although many felt the words "personality" and "disorder" are not in themselves helpful, certain positive views were also revealed. Perspectives towards the label were influenced by the way in which diagnosis was explained and understood by patients and practitioners, alongside the extent to which service provision and evidence-based interventions were offered. Research limitations/implications The findings have the potential to contribute to the ongoing critical debate regarding the value of the Personality Disorder construct in the provision of care and support. Specific emphasis upon the relational framing of care provision offers a means to ameliorate some of the negative impacts of terminology. Perspectives are influenced in the way the label is understood, hence, attention is required to enhance these processes in clinical practice. There is much more study required to overcome stigmatisation, prejudice, and lack of knowledge and understanding. Further research identifying means for challenging stigma and the factors contributing to positive clinical interactions are required. Originality/value This study brings together a wide range of views and experiences of mental health professionals, individuals lived experiences and those who align to both lived and occupational expertise. A safe space was provided via the uniquely co-produced World Cafe research event to bring together discussion and debates from mixed perspectives makes this a novel study. The focus being on perspectives towards contested language, labelling and social impact adds to scholarship in this field.

AB  - In recent years, LGBT issues have received substantial media attention and engendered heated public debate in Ghana. This paper analyzes the prejudiced construction of LGBT issues in the Ghanaian news media and how this contributes to a discriminatory discourse that demeans LGBT people and puts them at the periphery of Ghanaian society. The study employs a critical discourse analysis framework and a dataset of 385 articles, comprising news reports, op-ed pieces, and editorials. The analysis reveals that news content on LGBT issues is biased and inflammatory, and it frames LGBT people as expendables and undesirables. This is realized by exploiting three discourses, or forms of othering, that culminate into the (re)production and naturalization of moral panic: a discourse of amorality/immorality and societal destruction, a discourse of alienization, and a discourse of medicalization or pathologization. The paper concludes with a call for a more balanced and ethically/socially responsible news reporting, especially since LGBT issues in Ghana hold implications for national cohesion and security.

AB  - The global demographic shift toward an aging population is predicted to result in a significant burden of mental health conditions and psychosocial disability. There has been a greater awareness of ageism and its toxic effects creating a paradigm shift to include a human right, ethical, and social justice-based approach to augment the biomedical model of mental healthcare. The concept of dignity lies at the heart of human rights and must be a central concept integrated into public health and mental healthcare. Dignity denotes the self-respect and worthiness of an individual as well as social consideration of his/her identity. Dignity in older persons is multi-dimensional and includes several factors such as privacy, independence, inclusion, autonomy, etc. There are several determinants such as frailty, dependence, sensory, cognitive impairment and socioeconomic vulnerabilities, which tend to compromise dignity in the elderly and hence their fundamental rights. One such construct is that of ageism which comprises stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination based on age. Ageism and related forms of stigma impair dignified healthcare in older persons and deprive them of their rights. Mental health professionals are uniquely positioned to incorporate the strategies to promote dignity in their clinical care and research as well as advocate for related social/health policies based on a human rights approach. These intersections are discussed in this paper in light of the United Nations Convention on Rights of the Older Persons.

AB  - As the coronavirus pandemic exponentially mushrooms across the globe, xenophobia comes after it almost immediately. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 began, Asians and Asian Americans have been subject to various types of anti-Asian violence. From a pastoral theological perspective, this social phenomenon is deeply troubling because Asians and Asian Americans continue to be victimized by racial biases and social prejudices. How should we then address this communal crisis theologically? I answer this question by uncovering the hidden stereotypical, sociocultural narratives that have historically contributed to scapegoating people of Asian descent. In doing so, I critically appropriate Rene Girard's social analytic framework and theological insights, especially engaging in his ideas such as mimetic desires, the scapegoat mechanism, and the sacralizing of violence. I argue that to dismantle and shift the scapegoating narrative, it is imperative for the racially victimized and socially marginalized to resist the toxic mechanism of victimization in solidarity.

AB  - What are the consequences for older adults who confront ageism and the perpetrators who engage in ageist behaviors? We compared young (n = 265), middle-aged (n = 338), and older adults' (n = 235) impressions of an older target and the perpetrator of an ageist action. Participants read a vignette about a pedestrian offering unwanted help to an older woman crossing the street. We manipulated the type of ageism (benevolent or hostile), the reaction of the older target (acceptance, moderate confrontation, or strong confrontation) and assessed perceptions of perpetrator appropriateness and how evaluations of warmth, competence, and overall impression of the target changed over time. The perpetrator's act of benevolent ageism was perceived to be more appropriate than hostile ageism, and middle-aged and older adult participants reported the benevolent act to be more acceptable than young participants. This finding supports an age stereotype assimilation account. For target perceptions, accepting a hostile ageist behavior led to lower warmth and competence ratings but accepting benevolent ageism reduced warmth but not competence evaluations. Age differences in target perceptions were predicted by social identity theory, in that older adults rated the older target more positively overall. Perceptions of targets who confronted varied by type of ageism and the intensity of the confrontation. When participants perceived the target's reaction to be disproportionate to the ageist act, the target was viewed more negatively overall. The findings suggest that ageism directed toward older adults is perceived to be normative by adults of all ages and that confrontations of ageist behavior result in negative perceptions of the older target.

AB  - With the increased desire to engage in antiracist clinical research, there is a need for shared nomenclature on racism and related constructs to help move the science forward. This article breaks down the factors that contributed to the development and maintenance of racism (including racial microaggressions), provides examples of the many forms of racism, and describes the impact of racism for all. Specifically, in the United States, racism is based on race, a social construct that has been used to categorize people on the basis of shared physical and social features with the assumption of a racial hierarchy presumed to delineate inherent differences between groups. Racism is a system of beliefs, practices, and policies that operate to advantage those at the top of the racial hierarchy. Individual factors that contribute to racism include racial prejudices and racial discrimination. Racism can be manifested in multiple forms (e.g., cultural, scientific, social) and is both explicit and implicit. Because of the negative impact of racism on health, understanding racism informs effective approaches for eliminating racial health disparities, including a focus on the social determinants of health. Providing shared nomenclature on racism and related terminology will strengthen clinical research and practice and contribute to building a cumulative science.

AB  - Emerging methods for studying cultural dynamics allow researchers to investigate cultural change with newfound rigor. One change that has recently attracted the attention of social commentators is "concept creep," the semantic inflation of harm-related concepts such as trauma, bullying, and prejudice. In theory, concept creep is driven distally by several recent cultural and societal trends, but psychology also plays a proximal role in developing and disseminating expansionary concepts of harm. However, there have been few systematic attempts to document concept creep and none to explore factors that influence it. The present work reviews concept creep from the perspective of cultural dynamics and lays out a conceptual framework for exploring processes implicated in it. Illustrative analyses are presented that apply computational linguistic methods to very large text corpora, including a new corpus of psychology article abstracts. They demonstrate that harm has risen steeply in prominence both in psychology and in the wider culture in recent decades, and that harm-related concepts have inflated their meanings over this period. The analyses also provide evidence of dynamic relationships between the prominence and semantic breadth of harm-related concepts, and between psychology and the culture at large. Implications are drawn for theory and research on concept creep.
   Public Significance Statement This study indicates that concepts of harm have broadened their meanings and become more prominent in psychology over the past half century. It suggests that similar changes have occurred in the culture at large, and that the respective changes may be dynamically linked. These findings signal that psychology is implicated in an important cultural shift.

AB  - Drawing on semi-structured in-depth interviews with Romanian immigrants in Ontario, Canada, conducted between 2014 and 2018, this article explores how the experiences acquired by the Romanian immigrants through migration and multicultural intercourse facilitate the development of personal wisdom. We show how our research participants perceived these geographical processes of migration and place-based multiethnic cohabitation to account for their growing wiser than their earlier selves. Specifically, we organize the description of these perceptions into three interrelated themes: (1) changes in perspective, (2) the learning of new things, and (3) the role of place in fostering wisdom. Against this background, the article also highlights the boundary conditions within which these processes may or may not foster the development of wisdom, acknowledging that not all migratory and multicultural experiences lead to prosocial and adaptive outcomes. Our discussion of these boundary conditions with the research participants coalesced into five recurrent themes: (1) adaptation to the new environment and social system, (2) the role of the host environment as a boundary condition, (3) the problem of unmet expectations, (4) the magnitude of the cultural shocks, and (5) the language barrier. Bearing the complex politics of these boundary conditions in mind, we argue that the experience of international migration and subsequent cross-cultural interaction can be usefully understood as a 'fertile ground' for the flourishing of personal wisdom, which itself can act as an individual and collective resource for cohabitation in multicultural settings.

AB  - This study concerns discursive mobilisations of race and racism in the Swedish debate on equality data, in the case of a controversial statement made by a Swedish Green Party MP. In March 2019, female Muslim MP Leila Ali Elmi argued publicly for introducing equality data in Sweden, in opposition to prevailing colour-blind and antiracialist norms. Her statement was controversially formulated in terms of 'registering' people 'by race', leading to forceful criticism in the mainstream press and on social media, particularly on Twitter. In a material representing this criticism, we analyse discourse participants' argumentative strategies, focusing on mobilisations of race and racism as acts of subject positioning, performative of a moral identity. Participants positioned themselves as morally righteous, liberal antiracists by virtue of their own antiracialism (Goldberg, 2009, The threat of race. Wiley-Blackwell, Hoboken, NJ) and colour-blindness (Bonilla-Silva, 2010, Racism without racists. Rowman & Littlefield, Lanham, MA), while constructing equality data as a racist practice, and as a threat to a liberal order. They also constructed advocates of equality data, and specifically Ali Elmi herself, as being irrational race ideologues, to be morally condemned for espousing a return to racial thinking comparable to that of German Nazism or scientific racism. The findings point to the exceptional status and character of what we call a colour-blind antiracialism in Sweden, and further show how far 'liberal arguments for illiberal ends' can go in reinforcing a moral status quo and counteracting antiracist reform.

AB  - Many more autistic women than men do not receive diagnosis in childhood. In addition, they are often socialised from an early age to conceal or 'camouflage' their differences in order to fit in. Gendered prejudices often dictate workplace roles which serve to further disadvantage women. Employers are often unaware of how to ensure their workplaces are accommodating for autistic women, and it may seem inconvenient or unnecessary to make adjustments. This article seeks to highlight some issues related to promoting the meaningful recruitment and inclusion of autistic women in the workplace. It draws on qualitative research data to highlight the intersectional dimensions of being an autistic woman at work. The emerging themes are discussed with a view to improving knowledge about how to improve workplace environments and practices thereby support autistic women to succeed. Points of interest Autistic women 'camouflage' or 'mask' aspects of their autism in order to conceal or compensate for their differences. This may mean they appear to cope and consequently, their needs for support or adjustments at work are overlooked. The research methods use the narratives of autistic women to illuminate the difficulties and advantages of being both autistic and a woman in the workplace. This research suggests that sexist expectations of women to interact as non-autistic person would at work, particularly in relation to emotions, impacts upon their opportunities to progress in their chosen careers. The research discusses barriers and support at work. It contributes to improving awareness of the diverse and complex challenges faced by autistic women.

AB  - This paper examines employment-related gender discrimination during the initial stages of a hiring process. It specifically focuses on recent college graduates in China. By examining firms' responses to fictitious resumes with randomly generated information on gender and other key attributes of applicants (e.g., school reputation, student's academic achievement, and leadership experiences), this study is able to separate the effect of gender on a student's potential for getting an on-site interview from the confounding effects of other factors. The findings reveal that, with all other factors remaining constant, female applicants, on average, are less likely to be invited by hiring firms to on-site interviews as compared with their male counterparts. Furthermore, gender discrimination in computer and mathematics, architecture and engineering, and sales occupations appears to be driving the results of this study. The qualitative evidence based on interviews with firm recruiters suggests that the findings of this study are generally consistent with the role congruity theory of prejudice in psychology literature. While the finding that the quality of a job candidate (academic achievement and leadership experience) does not reduce gender discrimination offers some evidence to support a taste-based discrimination view, we do not have enough evidence to support a statistical discrimination view.

AB  - In this paper I argue that there are possible cases in which the demands of justice and the norms of epistemology cannot be simultaneously satisfied. I will bring out these normative clashes in terms of the now-familiar phenomenon of testimonial injustice (Fricker 2007). While the resulting argument is very much in the spirit of two other sorts of argument that have received sustained attention recently - arguments alleging epistemic partiality in friendship, and arguments that motivate the hypothesis of moral encroachment on the epistemic - I suggest how the argument from epistemic injustice differs from, and is stronger than, both of those arguments. The implications of the present argument are several: we must (i) reconceive the role of identity-prejudice in testimonial injustice, (ii) modify the way we think about how justice and epistemology bear on testimonial transactions, and (iii) understand the mutuality of speech exchanges in ways that do not privilege any particular participant's epistemic perspective.

AB  - Purpose The attitudes of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 vaccines ensure that health services are able to run without interruption and potentially have a role in the messaging about vaccination that they convey to the public. Hence, healthcare workers' attitudes ultimately have a significant role in controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to qualitatively investigate the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. Methods The study used the phenomenological approach. The sample consisted of 36 healthcare workers who were employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online using focus group interviews. A total of four focus group interviews were conducted. Findings Following analysis of the data, the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey toward the COVID-19 vaccine were divided into three themes: "influencing factors," "priority group" and "trust." Conclusions Vaccination was found to create negative emotions among some of the healthcare workers. Their opinions about the COVID-19 vaccines were affected by the negative emotions and burnout they experienced during the pandemic. In addition, they saw the vaccination process as impacted by contraindications and uncertainty about the duration of the protection, the balance of the benefits and harm of the vaccines, and by vaccine myths and prejudices about the country where the vaccine was developed. Healthcare professionals expressed the need for trust to be established in the whole vaccination process. They suggested that different vaccine options should be offered, that the appointment and process notification system for vaccination should be improved, that evidence-based information about vaccines should be provided and that a safe environment should be created. Practice Implications Vaccine hesitancy can be addressed by careful attention to the application of vaccination programs, correct and effective use of social media, transparent, and precise management of political processes, and the provision of evidence-based information about the vaccines.

AB  - In this contribution the focus is on nationalism, i.e. the view that one's own country and people are unique and superior, implying a negative comparison with regard to other national groups and countries. The research questions we set out to answer are: (1) what are the cross-national differences and trends in nationalism across Europe? (2) Which individual and national characteristics can explain these differences and changes in nationalism in European countries? We use high-quality cross-national data from 20 countries from the 'National Identity' modules of the International Social Survey Programme, collected in 1995, 2003 and 2013. Considerable differences between countries were found; however, within countries the level of nationalism remained rather stable over the period from 1995 to 2013.

KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - Dr. Margaret-Ann Armour's career as a research chemist, educator, and advocate spanned more than 40 years. Much of her work took place within a disciplinary culture ignorant of the scholarship supporting organizational change towards inclusive excellence. Her contributions are extensively covered in other articles in this special issue, and her achievements are all the more remarkable given that her colleague, Dr. Gordon Freeman, held gender-biased attitudes that he shared in a peer reviewed article in a national science journal. Three decades later, another Canadian chemist, Dr. Tomas Hudlicky, published a peer reviewed essay in an international chemistry journal that included his views on the negative impacts of diversity initiatives on organic synthesis research. Both articles were retracted, but clearly a faulty and pervasively biased peer review system enabled the distribution of prejudiced opinions that were neither informed by demonstrated expertise, nor supported by data. These two events are reflective of challenges that Dr. Armour faced in her efforts to diversify chemical sciences. We need to build on her critical work to increasing awareness about inclusive excellence in chemistry, as well as educating scientists on what constitutes an informed opinion. Here, we use Freeman and Hudlicky incidents as case studies to indicate how pervasive bias can be superficially perceived as scientific scholarship. Furthermore, we use analogies of analytical processes to illustrate how talent gets systemically excluded. Finally, we provide recommendations to chemistry community members for improving outcomes in terms of synthesis of new knowledge, ideas, and solutions, toward leveraging all the available human talent and creating an environment that is both excellent and inclusive.

AB  - Gender bias in leadership is an egregious yet common reality in the societal mores of male-dominant cultures. Contentious ecclesial debates about gender bias pit prejudices against female leadership roles when girded by biblical tropes engaged to disparage female character and leadership behavior. Sexualized imagery in the textual narrative is misappropriated to libel females who are leading change with ethical and behavioral competencies lauded in their male counterparts. In the politically charged context of recent national elections, the newly installed Vice President of the United States was publicly labeled a "Jezebel" to connote a racially and sexually derisive trope calling into question a woman's scruples in private spheres as well as disparaging her agency. As I refer to Tamura Lomax's extensive analysis of this trope, I examine in this article the hermeneutical misappropriation of Bathsheba imagery, wherein the behavior of biblical figure King David is normalized as the beloved of God while Bathsheba is villainized. The presumptive insinuation is that women use sexual guiles to advance careers, social station, or positional power. Judgmental inequities in contemporary and biblical examples raise an urgency to counter negative gender/power tropes from the Bible to the boardroom.

AB  - Little data are available for women diagnosed with a dual diagnosis. However, dual diagnosis in women presents increased stigma, social penalties, and barriers to access to treatment than it does for men. Indeed, it increases the probability of suffering physical or sexual abuse, violent victimization, gender-based violence, unemployment, social exclusion, social-role problems, and physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Thus, a transversal sex and gender-based perspective is required to adequately study and treat dual diagnosis. For this, sex and gender factors should be included in every scientific analysis; professionals should review their own prejudices and stereotypes and train themselves specifically from a gender perspective; administrations should design and provide specific treatment resources for women; and we could all contribute to a structural social transformation that goes beyond gender mandates and norms and reduces the risk of abuse and violence inflicted on women.

KW  - PLACE
AB  - In 1980, Baltimore Voices, a play written from the transcripts of 200 interviews with elderly working-class Baltimore residents taken as part of the Baltimore Neighborhood Heritage Project (BNHP), was seen by thousands of people in Baltimore and on public television. Created by left-leaning oral and public historians, the play was intended to center the voices of white and African American Baltimore residents. However, Baltimore Voices fumbled its opportunity to present a nuanced past to the public through a cascading series of decisions revolving around the ethical question of who had the authority to interpret the oral histories for the stage play and how to frame them for public audiences. Specifically, the play ignored the role of whiteness in shaping Baltimore's neighborhood history. Instead, the creators saw individual prejudice as the key issue shaping race relations in the city. They forced the stories of Black Baltimore residents into a white ethnic immigrant narrative frame, eliding the privileges that allowed white immigrants to rise in social status and distorting Black history. And they imagined the oral histories and play as modular, with the goal of presenting the history most palatable to the audience. While the theater company practiced sharing authority by giving BNHP narrators multiple opportunities to give feedback during script development, the question remains: when certain community members are more vocal than others, who gets to represent the community? Using extensive archival material, this article discusses Baltimore Voices as a case study of an oral and public history project during a formative moment for both fields. I suggest that progressive oral and public historians at times abdicated their ethical responsibility to frame and contextualize oral history to present complicated histories to the public. Examining whiteness requires this interpretive perspective because the power of whiteness is in its invisibility.

AB  - This critical review is one of the first to take a lifespan approach to examine the emotion regulation (ER) and coping strategies used by African Americans in response to racial-related adversities (e.g., discrimination, racism, prejudice) and to discuss why African Americans may engage in these specific strategies. The current review found that African Americans continue to experience racial discrimination throughout the lifespan. The most prominent coping and ER strategies among African American in response to racial discrimination appear to be negative emotion expression suppression, avoidant coping, social support, and religion/spirituality. The review discusses various factors that may underlie these patterns (e.g., power differentials, African Americans' history and African culture) and also limitations of current ER and coping research. By examining stability and changes across the lifespan, time, and varying situations, more inferences about patterns of coping and ER and contributing factors can be made to better determine ways to help decrease or mitigate the effects of racial stress on African Americans' lives.

AB  - Translation plays a crucial role in today's globalised and interconnected world. Yet, it seems that no one can prevent an unqualified person from translating (Pym et al. 2012). This situation raises a number of fundamental questions: is it a problem that anyone can translate and, if so, to whom and how?; is translation a formal profession and, if not, should it become one?; if it is a formal profession or if it becomes one, should it be regulated and, if so, why and how? Before answering these questions, mostly by the affirmative, this article examines the current status of translation as a profession as well as the main causes and effects of this status. It shows that the concept of risk of prejudice due to incompetent translation should be at the heart of the positioning of translation as a profession. It also shows that prejudicial texts (see definition) must imperatively be translated by qualified translators and that social interest, namely ensuring public protection against erroneous translations, should take precedence over professional interest, i.e., the promotion of translators, for the full recognition of the translation profession.

KW  - EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE
KW  - GENERICS
AB  - This paper applies the framework of epistemic injustice to the context of the asylum process, arguing that asylum seekers are typically at risk of this kind of injustice, which consists in their not being considered credible and not being listened to due to prejudices toward their social identity. More specifically, I address hermeneutical injustice in the adjudication of LGBTQ asylum claims, as well as the possibility of developing practices of hermeneutical justice in this context. I start with a general analysis of epistemic injustice in the asylum process, examining the different ways in which stereotypes and prejudices hinder the process (section 1). Next, I focus on hermeneutical injustice in LGBTQ cases (section 2). In section 3, I expand on the possibility of developing hermeneutical justice. Finally, I conclude by hinting at hinge epistemology as a feasible framework for research on hermeneutical injustice and justice, and at broader theoretical themes stimulated by this reflection.

AB  - The number of people with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been increasing worldwide. Anxiety about potential infection, fear of severe illness, death, economic problems, and loneliness and isolation brought on by social distancing are increasingly being experienced by people. Therefore, it is imperative to address and improve such mental health-related problems during COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the current mental health care and psychological intervention statuses related to COVID-19 in Japan. In a questionnaire survey, 55 of 69 (80%) mental health and welfare centers and 194 of 931 (21%) psychiatric institutions across Japan responded. COVID-19 patients, their family members, and the general public often consulted the mental health and welfare institutions through telephone. The questionnaire included various information of mental health difficulties related to COVID-19 such as the numbers and contents of the consultations, and the type of the interventions. The contents of consultation included psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and alcohol problems) and psychosocial problems (interpersonal problems, prejudice, and discrimination). Overall, 9% of mental health and welfare centers provided psychological first aid as psychological intervention and 28% of consultations involved cases requiring urgent care. In Japan, consultations about COVID-19-related mental health problems occurred mainly in mental health and welfare centers. There is urgent need to establish a system that enables mental health triage and brief psychological interventions that are feasible in the centers.

AB  - Prenatal nutrition is a key predictor of early-life development. However, despite mass campaigns to stimulate healthy nutrition during pregnancy, the diet of Dutch pregnant women is often suboptimal. Innovative technologies offer an opportunity to develop tailored tools, which resulted in the release of various apps on healthy nutrition during pregnancy. As midwives act as primary contact for Dutch pregnant women, the goal was to explore the experiences and perspectives of midwives on (1) nutritional counselling during pregnancy, and (2) nutritional mHealth apps to support midwifery care. Analyses of eleven in-depth interviews indicated that nutritional counselling involved the referral to websites, a brochure, and an app developed by the Dutch Nutrition Centre. Midwives were aware of the existence of other nutritional mHealth apps but felt uncertain about their trustworthiness. Nevertheless, midwives were open towards the implementation of new tools providing that these are trustworthy, accessible, user-friendly, personalised, scientifically sound, and contain easy-digestible information. Midwives stressed the need for guidelines for professionals on the implementation of new tools. Involving midwives early-on in the development of future nutritional mHealth apps may facilitate better alignment with the needs and preferences of end-users and professionals, and thus increase the likelihood of successful implementation in midwifery practice.

TI  - Hauntings Across the Divide: Transdisciplinary Activism, Dualisms, and the Ghosts of Racism in Engineering and Humanities Education
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE MATHEMATICS AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
LA  - English
AB  - In this paper, we report on an intervention across continents and disciplines that brought together differently positioned students in South Africa and the USA. A collaboration between our classes-an introductory Geographic Information Systems (GIS) class in South Africa and a composition class in the United States-was facilitated and investigated by us. The point of departure of the intervention was to service socially just and anti-racist pedagogies through experimentation. Drawing on posthumanist, feminist, and new materialist theory, we investigate the hauntings of several prejudices and stereotypical tropes that foster racism. We link the concept of hauntology to Plumwood's (1993) theorization of dualisms. We then draw a cartography of geomatics education in South Africa, focusing on the subjectification of geomatics graduates in particular and engineering graduates in general. We then zoom to our collaboration, and focus on several interactions amongst the cohorts to show instances of hauntings that perpetuate anti-Black, anti-Muslim, and related silences. We find that analysis of dualisms can highlight racist hauntings, and can also provide guidance on how to flatten hierarchies. Our transdisciplinary activism allows us to harness the positivity of difference to trouble binaries. We conclude with some thoughts on pandemic pedagogy in an unequal world.

AB  - This study seeks to investigate whether welfare chauvinism exists in a large country with tremendous regional disparities and massive internal migration. Set in the context of coastal Guangdong Province, it examines Chinese people's attitudes toward welfare entitlements for rural-to-urban immigrants. The study finds that chauvinistic attitude does not fracture along the lines of intergroup competition in the labor market; instead, it stems primarily from perceived competition over scarce welfare resources. Normative values and generalized trust powerfully mitigate welfare chauvinism. The larger relative number of migrants in the local community substantially increases the appeal of chauvinism, thus suggesting the occurrence of negative intergroup interactions. The empirical evidence is discussed against the broader context of rural-to-urban immigration in China and the developmental logic of its social policies.

AB  - In this article, I question the production of certain cultural and geographic zones under the new emergency protocols mandated through COVID-19 governance, by drawing upon the theoretical model of Foucault's 'perfectly governed city' (1977, p. 198). I argue that in the first few months of 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response, the rapid absorption of state directives into the home (two-person rule) and the body (social distancing) set a precedent for a new standard of state boundary-crossing that should be monitored by cultural studies academics with prejudice. Using Berger and Luckman, I point to the State's use of habitualisation through repetition that can be used to monitor and control citizenry at a later time but for different purposes. The purpose of this article is to show that these measures represent a condition of potential COVID-style governance, even after the threat to public health has subsided. In particular, its potentiality lies in the effects of disciplining or training the body (particularly through social distancing practices), routinisation and habitualisation, and the normalisation of bodily surveillance in everyday life.

AB  - Using The Players' Tribune, we interpret how NBA players discuss race within a racialized sporting organisation that is celebrated and marketed as cosmopolitan and a model for social engagement. We find that during the Black Lives Matter movement players draw on and move between varied visions of sport, the NBA, and its relationship to race. Players reject post-racial conceptions of sport and society and highlight the realities of structural racism and interpersonal prejudice within the NBA and society. At the same time, players affirm notions of the NBA as removed from social problems and a leader for positive racial dialogue. These discursive shifts and collisions indicate that while individualistic and less critical conceptions of sport and race persistently circulate, they are also vulnerable to more race-conscious, structural, and critical articulations. Thus, we argue player engagement with sport, race, and politics on platforms like TPT help set the stage for the current wave of anti-racist actions and statements from high-profile athletes across global sport post-2020 and is linked to how the NBA politically orients itself as a racialized professional sports organisation.

AB  - People with disabilities face attitudinal barriers including prejudice, stereotypes, and low expectations. Many young people without disabilities may doubt that people with disabilities can be fulfilling partners in any loving adult relationship. The objective of the present research was to assess the willingness of non-disabled youth to engage in conjugal relationships with persons with disabilities in Wolaita Sodo town, Ethiopia. Both descriptive and explanatory study designs were used and quantitative data were collected. A self-administered questionnaire was designed and distributed to randomly selected 403 (202 females & 201 males) unmarried youth. Data analysis was undertaken using SPSS software in which both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were utilized for data presentation. The result showed that most (85.5%) of the young people without disabilities participated in the survey were not willing to have any type of personal relationships with persons with disabilities and the main reason for 44.2% of these respondents being the fear of reaction from family members. Furthermore, it was found that the level of willingness of youth without disabilities to engage in romantic love and marital relationships was not influenced by the socio-economic status of people with disabilities. Moreover, the result of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the willingness of respondents to have marital and romantic love relationship with persons with disabilities is significantly associated to the sex (OR = 2.376; P < 0.05; 95%CI = 1.210, 4.664), raised-up area (OR = 2.512; P < 0.01; 95%CI = 1.319, 4.783), age (OR = 2.886; P < 0.05; 95%CI = 1.012, 8.228) and the presence of person with disability in the family (OR = 3.945; P < 0.01; 95%CI = 1.648, 9.442) of respondents. The findings of the present research demonstrate that people with disabilities have continued to face stereotypes and discriminations. Such stereotypes extend to assuming them as asexual and unfit to carryout roles that arise from love or marital relationships which violates the rights of PWDs to form their own family and have children. It is therefore, important to raise the awareness of young people about the differences between disability and sexuality and that physical disability has nothing to do with sexuality and relationship formation.

AB  - We report the process of adapting and validating the BIAS Map (Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes) used to measure perceived stereotypes and related social structure, emotions, and behavioral tendencies toward the Roma-Slovakia's most stigmatized ethnic minority group. In two surveys (Studies 1 and 4, n = 705) and group-based (Study 2, n = 92) and individual (Study 3, n = 12) cognitive interviews, we integrated quantitative reliability, scalability, factor structure analysis, and qualitative inductive thematic analysis. We identified potential problems in the instruments' ecological validity and explored the limits of intergroup context-specific interpretation to improve its psychometric properties. Besides developing a more reliable and valid measure, we make an argument for utilizing the emic-etic mixed methods approach to enhance the intergroup context-sensitive adaptation and validation procedure of universal measurement instruments in social psychology research.

AB  - Prior studies suggest that scientific knowledge may improve attitudes towards sexual minorities such as gays and lesbians. But in what context does this ring true? The present study aims to test whether scientific literacy can predict attitudes towards gays and lesbians when considering the variables pathogen avoidance and religious fundamentalism in a moderated moderation model. A total of 1,398 participants (female = 74.9%, M-age = 25.15, SD = 5.84) completed our online survey. We found that an increase in scientific literacy can indeed predict an improvement in attitudes towards sexual minorities, specifically gays and lesbians. However, this effect was weakened in the condition of high pathogen avoidance, specifically for one of the dimensions of pathogen avoidance-germ aversion. When considering the value of religious fundamentalism in a three-way interaction, we found that scientific literacy can remain effective in predicting attitudes towards sexual minorities only within the condition of low germ aversion. Thus, threat avoidance such as germ aversion, contrary to religious fundamentalism, may diminish the benefits of scientific literacy in improving attitudes towards sexual minorities.

AB  - In 1882 the criminal registry, a bureaucratic tool used to assemble information about the criminal biographies of German citizens, was implemented in all territories of the German Empire. This article demonstrates that the registry, evidence that states were accumulating ever more knowledge about the population, was from the beginning surrounded by critical reflection on its functioning. Worried about the scale of the work involved, in the interests of administrative efficiency bureaucrats wished the use of the registry to be curtailed. Prussian officials stressed that private parties should be denied access to the registry, while scholars pointed out that the registry was not intended to support forensic investigation. Journalists and worried citizens argued that the use of the registry in German courts was responsible for a culture of excessive suspicion. By portraying the emotional effects of the registry on German citizens, critics therefore sought to mobilize empathy for the 'victims' of the registry and started to demand a 'right to be forgotten'. The Expungement Law of 1920 was designed as a solution to many of these problems and can be viewed as the endpoint of an important liberalizing process in German society. Yet, for many contemporaries the law was largely ineffective, for it did not combat social prejudices against citizens with a criminal record.

AB  - Multicultural youth are more likely to experience negative emotions (e.g. depressive symptoms) due to social prejudice and discrimination. Nevertheless, previous studies that analyzed the emotional aspects of multicultural youth mainly compared the characteristics of multicultural youth and those of the other youth or identified individual risk factors using a regression model. This study developed models to predict the depressive disorders of multicultural youth based on the Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST), Classification And Regression Trees (CART), gradient boosting machine (G-B-M), random forest, and deep neural network (deep-NN) using epidemiological data representing multicultural youth and compared the prediction performance (PRED PER) of the developed models. Our study analyzed 19,431 youths (9,835 males and 9,596 females) aged between 19 and 24 years old. We developed models for predicting the self-awareness of health of youths by using QUEST, CART, G-B-M, random forest, and deep-NN and compared the balanced accuracy of them to evaluate their PRED PER. Among 19,431 subjects, 42.9% (5,838 people) experienced a depressive disorder in the past year. The results of our study confirmed that deep-NN had the best PRED PER with a specificity of 0.85, a sensitivity of 0.71, and a balanced accuracy of 0.78. It will be necessary to develop a model with optimal PRED PER by tuning hyperparameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, number of iterations, and activation function, number of hidden nodes) of deep-NN.

KW  - haunting

AB  - This essay focuses on the way the main characters in Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca (1938) cope with the haunting influence of the past and attempts to read their struggle through the theoretical approach developed by Jacques Derrida in his Specters of Marx (1993). This approach, termed "hauntology" by Derrida himself, revolves around the notion of the "specter" haunting the present and emphasizes the need to find new ways of responding to it, especially because of the existing ontological failure to do so. The essay complements this reading with the earlier comparable theory of the "phantom" and "transgenerational haunting" developed by psychoanalysts Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok. A "hauntological" reading of Rebecca through these tools yields results that are significantly different from traditional approaches. Suggesting that the main characters in Rebecca are complete failures in dealing with the specter in a Derridean sense, the essay argues that the novel expects from the discerning reader a more insightful approach and a better potential to understand the specter. It is suggested further that a proper acknowledgement of the specter in Rebecca reaches beyond this particular novel, having subtle but significant implications concerning not only literary analysis but also social and cultural prejudices.

AB  - Pharmacological neuroenhancement refers to the non-medical use of prescription drugs, alcohol, illegal drugs, or the so-called soft enhancers for the purpose of improving cognition, mood, pro-social behavior, or work and academic performance. This phenomenon is undoubtedly more frequent than previously supposed especially amongst university students.
   The aim of the present paper was to carefully review and comment on the available literature on neuroenhancement, according to Prisma guidelines.
   The results showed a great use of all prescribed drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, nootropic compounds, and especially stimulants) as neuroenhancers amongst healthy subjects, although probably the real prevalence is underestimated. The use of illicit drugs and soft enhancers is similarly quite common. Data on the improvement of cognition by other compounds, such as oxytocin and pheromones, or non-pharmacological techniques, specifically deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, are still limited.
   In any case, if it is true that human beings are embedded by the desire to overcome the limits of their intrinsic nature, neuroenhancement practices put into question the concept of authenticity. Therefore, the problem appears quite complex and requires to be deepened and analyzed with no prejudice, although within an ethical conceptual frame.

AB  - While West Indians constituted a much larger immigrant group in the port of Limon, Costa Rica and its environs, Chinese also migrated there during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In hopes of maintaining their culture and in response to the prejudice they faced, both groups formed their own tightknit transnational subcommunities. Nevertheless, they also interacted with each other. These interactions ranged from tension and conflict on the one hand, to routine, peaceful interaction and even collaboration on the other. In particular, class differences and the marginalization these groups experienced combined to produce this complex relationship. Tension and conflict often emerged due to both sides hoping to move up the social ladder and because of the economic power that many Chinese held as shopkeepers and lenders. Nevertheless, as groups experiencing social marginalization and living in proximity to each other, they could develop neutral or positive social and economic relationships.

AB  - Purpose
   Gender inequality is a significant social problem of urban transportation planning. In this context, the main purpose of this study is to determine the stereotypes about the genders of drivers in Turkey. Additionally, the study also aims to reveal the relationship between the talents and behaviors of drivers and gender perceptions.
   Design/Methodology/Approach
   This study used a hybrid model which allows the use of qualitative and quantitative methods together. The survey method and focus group meetings were utilized at the stage of data collection. In the study, the quota sampling method was applied. The sample consisted of 1239 participants who lived in the province of Konya in Turkey, had a driver's license, drove more than 10 minutes a day and were between 18 and 68 years old. The questionnaires presented to the participants consisted of three parts. The first part included items on the demographic structure of the sample and driving information, the second part included the female driver evaluation form, and the third part included the male driver evaluation form. These driver evaluation forms were prepared as Likert-type scales in the form of a 37-item sets of perception/bias created by benefiting from the literature and focus group interviews.
   Findings
   Men are perceived more positively in terms of vehicle maintenance and driving ability. It is stated that female drivers have more positive driving behaviors than male drivers. The participants who are female, university graduates or whose spouse drives the car have biases that are significantly free from gendered role attitudes.
   Research Limitations/Implications
   The fact that the study was conducted only in a sample from Konya and the small number of focus groups that were interviewed constituted the limitations of the study.
   Social/Practical Implications
   Gender inequality is a significant social problem of urban transportation planning. To achieve social integration and utilize urban services more effectively, it is needed to try to eliminate prejudices/negative perceptions towards gender in traffic.
   Originality/Value
   This study, where determination of stereotypes regarding the gender of drivers and driver perceptions were focused on, is significant especially in terms of the literature in Turkish and has a unique value.

AB  - Public Significance Statement Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals described their lived experience of hypervigilance, a chronic and pervasive stress response to direct and indirect experiences of stigma and discrimination.They were hypervigilant for potential harm as they interacted in public and private and when interacting with certain family members, coworkers, community members, and strangers they perceived to be prejudiced against LGBTQ people. Hypervigilance was often accompanied by negative emotions and social avoidance/isolation.
   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals are at risk for poorer health outcomes in part because of stigma, discrimination, victimization, and resulting trauma and stress. Stigma-related stress can lead to hypervigilance, or a chronic and pervasive state of alertness and readiness to respond to potential threats in the environment. The current study is one of the first to explore LGBTQ-identified individuals' lived experiences of hypervigilance. In a brief online format, participants (N = 245) completed demographic items and were asked to describe their experiences of hypervigilance and its impact on their lives. Participants reported over 30 negative emotions that accompanied hypervigilance; anxiety, fear, and exhaustion were the most common. Negative emotional reactions occurred in public and private settings and with family, coworkers, strangers, and others perceived to be prejudiced. Participants self-monitored and socially withdrew in efforts to protect themselves from stress and risk of harm. Service providers and researchers should assess hypervigilance in LGBTQ individuals and examine the impact on health and well-being while working to combat stigma and advocate for protective and equitable social policies.

AB  - Recreational boating is a significant nature-based activity, which is especially popular in the Mediterranean region. This study analyses this activity in the last decade in the Portofino MPA, a popular recreational boating area in the Ligurian Region (northwest of the Italian peninsula) in order to evaluate the maximum turnout and to provide management considerations to better achieve conservation and environmental management of a MPA. Monitoring activities were carried out during the summer from 2006 to 2016 and allowed locating the most critical sectors of MPA in consideration of different factors and kinds of boats. From the results of this long-term monitoring, the first conducted in Italy, it is evident that only some anchoring sectors of the Portofino MPA may suffer impacts from recreational boating and that the boats have different spatial and temporal distribution depending on the different summer months, on the public holidays and on weather conditions which mainly affect the boats units < 10 m (73% of the monitored boats). Due to direct impact of the anchorage on the seafloor, which hosts peculiar natural habitats, and the fairly constant presence of the recreational boaters over the years, different solutions for better protect the seabed without excessively prejudicing the enjoyment of recreational boating are discussed. Since the San Fruttuoso seagrass-friendly mooring area is one of the most visited sectors in the MPA, an increase in the number of seagrass-friendly moorings combined with a higher delimitation of the areas with special habitats may represent an optimal strategy.

AB  - During the interwar years, gendered inequalities in newspaper newsrooms and social prejudice against 'mobile' women combined to force women who wanted to work as foreign correspondents to seek alternative routes to raising their voices on international affairs. Women's reportage can be found in a range of platforms from the mainstream press to early journals of humanitarian communication and literary magazines. When women reported for major newspapers they were often precariously freelance and the gendered nature of their treatment by newspaper hierarchies emphasised their, and all women's, outsider status when it came to international politics. Women's international journalism, often rooted in the humanitarian tradition, concentrated on telling the lives of minor characters and ordinary people, and offers insights into individual human suffering at a time of great international anxiety. Their writing, often anonymous or in overlooked niche publications, represents a missing actor on public opinion at this critical time.

AB  - Purpose This paper aimed to research attitudes of women working in the Croatian public relations (PR) industry regarding office culture (networking, banter, dress codes, etc.). Design/methodology/approach This paper uses Bourdieu's habitus theory and analyses the experiences of women working in the Croatian PR industry with a focus on office culture. The study is based on 21 in-depth interviews with women working in the Croatian PR industry. Thematic analysis has been used to analyse data. Findings Although female employees (76.84%) dominate the PR industry in Croatia, the so-called masculine patterns still prevail in the PR sector. Results show that women are often exposed to gender discrimination but at the same time, they also perpetuate gender-based prejudices. Practical implications Employees in the PR industry should consider working on their own gender stereotypes that impact their patterns of behaviour. Relinquishment of the ideas of patriarchal essentialism would consequently change career progression opportunities, and it would particularly improve networking among women, which could lead to career advancement opportunities. Social implications Structural changes are needed in society to avoid women perpetuating inequality through masculine behaviour and unrealistic expectations that many women cannot meet. Originality To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper is the first paper that explores gender-biased office culture in the Croatian PR industry. In doing so, the paper also applies Bourdieu's habitus theory, thus contributing to studying cultural masculinities from a Croatian perspective. The paper also introduces the concept of gender-biased behaviour.

AB  - This article analyses how British popular music culture defined and responded to Krautrock, a subgenre of West German underground rock, during the 1970s. It examines and contextualises British and West German interactions in popular music immediately before Krautrock and at the time of its early definition. The article then explores how so-called Krautrock bands related to the British public and press and how they were described and understood in relation to their nationality. The article suggests that stereotypes and prejudices, shaped by the memory of World War 2, remained a significant aspect of British discourse on West Germany into the 1970s. However, interest in Krautrock gave rise to social and cultural interactions that inspired some to challenge and renegotiate ideas of Germany and Germanness. To some, bonds made through music, culture and politics proved more profound than the history of conflict between Britain and Germany.

AB  - National stereotypes are inherently evaluative, often negatively, and potentially prejudicial. While research has examined stereotypes from an organisational perspective, this is overwhelmingly in experimental settings involving students (Landy, 2008); in other words not in workplaces, and not involving employees doing their jobs. Through a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of 53 authentic business meetings, this study finds that among certain communities, national stereotypes are used in workplace narratives, and argues that such narratives constitute a contextual, situated social practice. The novel methodology pinpoints and categorises all stereotypes in business-meeting narratives, before discussing what role they play in indexing the identities of the stereotyped and the stereotyping. Finally, evaluation, ideology and power are critically engaged with to explain their use or non-use, thus making a theoretical contribution to studies of evaluation, workplace narratives, and stereotyping in discourse. While ethically problematic, and potentially detrimental to business success, their use may be motivated by local workplace goals.

AB  - Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP) are more likely than individuals with typical development (TD) to report a sexual minority orientation (e.g., Bejerot and Eriksson, PLoS ONE 9:1-9, 2014; DeWinter et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 47:2927-2934, 2017; Qualls et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 48:3974-3983, 2018). This study operationalized and tested the fit of an existing model of sexual orientation to examine which factors are associated with increased sexual minority orientation (Worthington et al., The Counseling Psychologist 30:496-531, 2002) in individuals with TD, BAP, and ASD. The model was found to have adequate fit, chi(2) (130) = 374.04, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.07; CFI = 0.95; SRMR = 0.08. Heterosexism was found to be the only predictor of sexual minority orientation and a significant predictor in the BAP and ASD groups, with increased daily heterosexist experiences predicting greater sexual minority orientation in these groups.

AB  - Previous research located two opposite findings and frequently used threat perceptions and value-support to explain the relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants: Religious individuals have negative attitudes toward immigrants because they support conservative values and feel threatened by unfamiliar groups. Second, they are open toward immigrants because they integrate prosocial and altruistic teachings of religion into their daily lives. Both lines have been confirmed repeatedly, which is puzzling. I argue that we need to consider all three factors (religiosity, value-support, threat perceptions) simultaneously and explore their mutual interactions. In this study, I test this line of argumentation empirically with data from the European Social Survey (Round 7). The analyses reveal that religiosity has the weakest direct effect on attitudes toward immigrants. Threat perceptions, on the other hand, have the strongest direct effects, followed by value-support. However, religiosity affects the attitudes toward immigrants indirectly via threat perceptions. These findings highlight that religiosity, value-support, and threat perceptions are closely linked and need simultaneous consideration to make reliable claims about their effects.

AB  - Ethnic minority patients face challenges concerning communication and are at higher risk of experiencing health problems and consuming fewer healthcare services. They are also exposed to disparaging societal discourses about migrants which might undermine healthcare institutions' ambitions of equitable health care. Therefore, healthcare professionals need to critically reflect on their practices and processes related to ethnic minority patients. The aim of this article is to explore healthcare professionals' experiences of working with ethnic minority patients by using the critical incident (CI) technique. In two focus group sessions, participants discussed challenging events in their encounters with patients. The critical incidents show that healthcare professionals may experience unfamiliar situations related to their work performance, prejudice toward patients, and labeling by patients the professionals do not identify with. The professionals' reflections are discussed in relation to social discourses on migration and their work conditions, and the possible influence on the professionals' preconceptions and the patient-professional relationship in health care. Reflections about work experiences with ethnic minority patients and aligned societal discourses should be included in healthcare workers' professional development. Critical incident reflections at work may contribute to better-coping strategies for healthcare professionals and improved patient-professional relationships with ethnic minority patients.

AB  - Purpose This study sheds light on a hitherto understudied group in family business literature: widows. We explore the roles a widow may take following the unexpected death of her owner-manager spouse when she had no salient role in the business prior to the death. Design/methodology/approach We used a qualitative approach to research, to study inductively the roles considered and taken by three widows who unexpectedly succeeded as owners of Swedish privately held family firms. We conducted semi-structured interviews with widows and children in top management. Findings We construct a typology of four main roles a widow can take and analyse the underlying dimensions that they represent. We also analyse to which extent the choice of role widow can be explained by psychological ownership and double-loss theory. The typology can be used as a tool for family business owners and their advisors as the basis of an open and non-prejudiced discussion of the choices available to a widow. Originality/value We have investigated the factors that influence a widow's decision whether to take over the business or not, as suggested in previous research by, for example, Martinez et al. (2009). We explore the roles a widow can consider and adopt. The study advances our understanding of how businesses can remain as family firms also in the event of the unexpected death of an owner-manager (De Massis et al., 2008). We hereby contribute to the literature on sudden successions and on women in family businesses.

AB  - This article contributes to the growing literature concerning Disability Hate Studies. The study employs the concept of intersectionality and examines experiences of hate crimes recorded as racist or homophobic but where the victims/survivors also have a disability or mental health condition. The data was derived from 33 case-studies. Although very few hate incidents/crimes were conceptualised as disablist, disability played a significant role in the experiences of victims/survivors. The article proposes that criminal justice agencies should move away from understanding hate crime as a singular interaction to conceptualising the possibility that this can become a harmful hate relationship that progresses overtime. Points of interest The study examines cases of hate incidents/crimes that affect disabled people within the North-East of England. The research suggests that hate incidents/crimes are not always motivated by prejudices towards disability, but are often due to racist or homophobic bigotries. The findings demonstrate that the process of defining a particular type of hate as either racist-, homophobic- or transphobic-motivated crime often masks the fact that many of these victims are also disabled people. The study indicates that hate crimes are often not a one-off event, but can be the accumulation of many hate incidents that result in cumulative negative impacts and can escalate into more severe offences over a prolonged period. The article concludes by suggesting that to develop an effective hate crime intervention, social services and criminal justice agencies must consider the possibility of a power relationship, i.e. a hate relationship, between the perpetrator(s) and the victim(s).

AB  - The researcher examined the experiences of Black British female managers (BBFM) who worked for Children and Young People's Services (CYPS) operating in the UK. The following research questions guided this study: How do Black British female managers experience racial microaggressions and how do they cope with it? Purposive and theoretical sampling were used to recruit 10 BBFM who worked for CYPS and who had similar demographic characteristics (i.e., racial/ethnic background and managerial experience). Interview transcripts were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006a). Over 200 codes were identified and extracted from individual interview transcripts. Organizing the codes into categories resulted in five themes that highlighted the challenging practices that BBFM perceived thwarted their careers (i.e., The Organizational Culture, On the Outside Looking In, Stereotype Threat, Prejudice, and Discrimination and Institutional Racism and Espoused Practice vs. Reality), and one theme that described their coping strategies (i.e., The Silent Catastrophe). Although the study is centered on a multisectorial sample, two main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, gendered racism curtails the career development of BBFM in ways that are not experienced by their White counterparts. Second, BBFM perceive that their experiences in CYPS was fundamentally negatively disproportionate and aversive. The implication is that CYPS leaders must give racial and gender equality, diversity and inclusion greater priority.

AB  - Customary international law as a source of general law is given a primary place in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute. However, it is historically a concept created by legal doctrine. The very idea of custom supposes legal persons are natural persons living in a dynamic, evolving community. This was the assumption of the historical school of law in the 19th century when the concept of custom was developed. Now the dominant notion of legal personality is the State as an impersonal corporation and international legal theory (Brierly and D'Amato) can see well that the death of the historical school of law has to mean the death of the concept of custom. What should replace it? Two steps need to be taken in sequence. Firstly, following the Swedish realist philosopher Haegerstrom, we have to ascertain the precise constellations of the conflictual attitudes the populations of States have to the patterns of normativity which they project onto international society. Secondly, we should follow the virtue ethics jurisprudence of Paul Ricoeur and others, who develop a theory of critical legal doctrinal judgement, along the classical lines of Aristotle and Confucius, to challenge and sort out the prejudices of peoples into some reasonable shape, whereby these can be encouraged to understand and respect one another.
   Then one will not have to endure so many silly interpretations of international law such as the one declaring that there are only rocks in the South China Sea and not islands. Such interpretations have nothing to do with the supposedly ordinary legal language analysis of a convention and the State practice surrounding it. They have to do entirely with a continued lack of respect by Western jurists for non-Western societies and nations.

AB  - Different views have long been expressed about poetry, its essence and purpose. Poetry and the environment, together, are constantly changing and being influenced by each other. Poetry as a social necessity has always been a tool to promote worldly and spiritual purposes. Nasser Khosrow and Sanai, bipolar poets whose dark thoughts and ideas could not be found in the dark pole of their poetry and thought, and as a result of their inner intellectual and revolutionary awakening, marked a turning point in the history of culture and literature of this rich border. They figured out and made the poem, which they had previously employed in their worldly needs and lowly interests, as a means of spreading morality and religion, and they were epochmaking. Regardless of some of the intellectual contradictions that result from going through different mental states, their poetry has been a mirror of their society's pain and aspirations. This study, while explaining the characteristics of good and committed poetry and its mission, deals with the subject of intellectual awakening, its causes and contexts in the poetry and thought of these two poets, and examines the effect of this awakening on their intellectual orientation, whether it is possible between dark and light poles. Their thought was absolutely different, or this demarcation - in terms of their intellectual contradictions - is merely the result of views based on prejudice, absolutism and sanctification.

AB  - Introduction. In high-income countries, sexual minorities are at a higher risk for disordered eating behaviors. It is not known whether these findings can be extrapolated to Mexico. Objective. Determine whether there are any differences in disordered eating behaviors among Mexican youth according to sexual orientation and analyze the potential role of experiences of violence and discrimination as mediators of these differences. Method. Data from a representative sample of Mexican youth (12 to 29 years old, n = 27,876) were analyzed. Three groups were identified: young people who were not in love (NIL), who were in love with people of the opposite sex (ILOS), or in love with people of the same sex (ILSS). Restrictive behaviors, secret eating, and self-induced vomiting were identified through a scale created for the survey. Results. ILSS men had a higher risk of restrictive thoughts and behaviors (B = .31), secret eating (OR = 2.21), and self-induced vomiting (OR = 3.65) than ILOS youth. Among women, there was only a difference in self-induced vomiting (RM = 2.49). In both sexes, being a young ILSS had an indirect effect on restrictive behaviors through its association with experiences of violence, discrimination at school, and sexual violence. Discussion and conclusion. Mexican sexual minority men are at a higher risk of disordered eating behaviors, whereas sexual minority women are at a higher risk of purging. Part of the differences in restrictive behaviors were explained by the increased risk for experiences of prejudice faced by sexual minority youth.

AB  - In the context of recent policies aimed at deterring immigration and criminalizing undocumented Latino immigrants, we examined factors predicting implicit and explicit attitudes toward this population. We hypothesized that more positive implicit and explicit attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants would be displayed by Latinxs (compared to non-Hispanic Whites) and by individuals having personal connections to undocumented immigrants or a high level of intercultural sensitivity. Latinx (n = 376) and non-Hispanic White (n = 214) college students (70% female, Mage = 21) participated in this cross-sectional study and completed two Implicit Association Tests and measures of explicit attitudes, personal connections, and intercultural sensitivity. As predicted, Latinx participants held more positive implicit and explicit attitudes than non-Hispanic White participants. Intercultural sensitivity and personal connections to undocumented immigrants were associated with more positive explicit attitudes. Identifying factors that increase a sense of commonality and cultural sensitivity with undocumented Latino immigrants may be helpful in diminishing the profiling and criminalization of this community.
   Public Significance Statement
   Latinx and non-Hispanic White college students have distinct experiences and social connections to immigrants that account for their attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. Results suggest that personal connections with undocumented immigrants and openness to interacting with individuals from distinct cultures in a respectful manner were related to more positive attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. These factors may be important in reducing hostility toward undocumented immigrants of Latinx origin.

AB  - Background: Despite the implementation of multidrug therapy by WHO to treat Hansen's disease (HD), new case detection rates are still high indicating active transmission. Aims and Objectives: To study the clinical profile of HD in central India along with its epidemiological characteristics. Materials and Methods: Medical records of clinically diagnosed Hansen's patients were recruited retrospectively during January 2015 to December 2018. Case records were evaluated with respect to demographic, clinical, histopathological, and bacteriological investigations, development of reaction, and deformities. Patients were classified based on Ridley Jopling classification and treated accordingly. Statistical analysis was done using proportion, mean, and percentage. Results: A total of 400 new patients were enrolled and males outnumbered females. Maximum cases, 115 (28.75%), were in the age group of 31-40 years. Sixteen (4%) cases belonged to the pediatric age (less than 18 years) group. Most common clinical spectrum was borderline lepromatous (n = 156, 39%) followed by lepromatous HD (n = 120, 30%). Eleven patients had pure neuritic HD and nine had histoid HD. Grade 2 deformity was found in 52 and grade 1 deformity was found in 16 patients. Most common lepra reaction was type 2 lepra reaction (n = 112, 28%). Thirteen (3.25%) patients were of relapse of HD among which maximum eight were BL HD followed by LL HD three (0.75%) and TT HD two (0.5%). Conclusion: Early diagnosis is very important for timely and proper implementation of treatment which will prevent sequelae and physical disabilities that can have an impact on the individual's social and working life, which are responsible for stigma and prejudice regarding the disease. Detection of this huge number of cases signifies a high burden of HD in this area even in the post elimination era.

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between right-wing authoritarian (RWA) beliefs and mental health stigma, patient case conceptualizations, and treatment recommendations using secondary analysis of a sample of treatment providers. A total of 246 providers (86 medical students, 67 doctoral psychology students, and 93 licensed clinical psychologists) completed online surveys including measures of RWA beliefs, mental health stigma, and qualitative items regarding conceptualization and treatment recommendations regarding a patient vignette. RWA beliefs were significantly associated with mental health stereotypes, microaggressions, and desire for social distance, and a significant interaction was found for provider type and RWA such that this relationship was strongest for medical students compared with psychologically trained subsamples. High RWA beliefs were also associated with less consideration of the vignette's presenting complaint, a lower likelihood to recommend treatment follow-up, and a higher likelihood to recommend simple "lifestyle changes." Findings suggest that RWA beliefs may be a distinguishing correlate among providers regarding mental health stigma and are an important potential target for antistigma interventions for treatment professionals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: History has taught us that Mexican culture has been largely supported by women, despite gender prejudice from the society. Neurosurgery has not been the exception. Therefore, we investigated the challenges and influence of female neurosurgeons in Mexico.
   METHODS: We conducted a review of the literature and an analysis of the internal database of the Mexican Society of Neurological Surgery focusing on 3 topics: 1) the historical presence of women and gender inequality in Mexico; 2) the life and legacy of the woman who became the first neurosurgeon in Mexico and in Latin America; and 3) the participation of women in neurosurgery in the past 3 decades.
   RESULTS: In Latin America, the first woman in neurosurgery was Maria Cristina Garcia-Sancho, who completed her neurosurgical training in 1951. Currently, women represent 6.2% of the total members of the Mexican Society of Neurological Surgery (MSNS). This percentage is still low, although data collected in this study suggest that it might increase in the next few years because 16.7% of Board Directors of the MSNS are women, the next elected president is a female neurosurgeon, and 14.5% of neurosurgery residents are women.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although a steady increase has occurred of women in neurosurgery in Mexico, there is still work to do, especially to overcome the barriers related to the old assumptions of the cultural and social roles of women.

KW  - Health literacy
KW  - Linguicism
KW  - Racism
AB  - Sri Lanka, once a colony of Britain, gained independence in 1948. However, especially the health sector continues to use English as its main medium of communication. Such language bias leads to marginalization of those less fluent in English, and hinders achieving a higher level of health literacy. Discrimination of people or social groups based on their language is termed linguicism. Tackling linguicism requires an understanding of its historic roots and an exploration of potential links to colonial racial prejudices. Published literature presents evidence that traces linguicism to language policies of the British colonial government (1815-1948). Though an exhaustive survey of historical records is not presented, there is reasonable evidence to suggest a close link. British colonial rule derived its justification from supremacist and racist ideology. As a result, English became the medium in all forms of official communications, a situation that persisted after independence. A similar situation exists in many parts of the worlds. We should recognize language-based discrimination and linguicism as public health issues. They are detrimental to health of vulnerable groups and have the potential to worsen health disparities.

AB  - This paper contributes to a small but significant body of research addressing issues of prejudice in science education. It is written in the form of a critical incident analysis that uses the framework of intersectionality to examine deficit ideologies and biases inherent in science as a body of knowledge as well as science teacher education. If left unchecked, these prejudices can filter through into school science education, reinforcing the stereotypes of who can contribute to the field of science. The paper makes a call for science teacher educators to support teacher candidates as they move past an academic understanding of diversity in science education to examine their personal dispositions. Suggestions are made for approaches that can be adopted to facilitate the forms of deconstruction necessary for progress to be made in this area.

AB  - Despite a relationship between gender and support for populist causes in cross-national research, including in the 2016 US Presidential election, the role of gender has been missing in analysis of support for Brexit, most likely because women and men showed no average aggregate-level differences in voting Leave or Remain. This misses an important explanation for Britain's vote to leave the European Union. We demonstrate how gender-based resentment motivated Leave votes in the EU referendum through perceptions of discrimination against men, among men. Using novel survey measures, we demonstrate (i) the distinct nature of perceptions of discrimination towards men in comparison with discrimination towards women; (ii) the sociological sources of perceptions that men are discriminated against; and (iii) the role of these perceptions in Brexit support. Our findings reveal that the Brexit referendum provided an opportunity to express broader social grievances than have, to date, been identified as relevant. The paper therefore offers a novel contribution to understanding the cultural backlash behind Britain's vote to leave the EU, and by so doing, insight into the potential for gender-based backlash effects in elections where gender isn't significantly primed, unlike the 2016 US presidential election where gender was a major political focus.

TI  - The Language of the Gukurahundi Genocide in Zimbabwe: 1980-1987
T2  - JOURNAL OF LITERARY STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The Gukurahundi genocide in Zimbabwe claimed more than 20 000 lives in the Matebeleland and Midlands provinces of the country at the hands of the state and its militia for political and tribal reasons. This article seeks to demonstrate how language, through hate speech, naming, symbolisation, dehumanisation, and classification, justified and rationalised Gukurahundi. While the linguistic conventions used by state actors before and during Gukurahundi did not cause genocide, it created two social climates, one that legitimised tribal and political hatred, thus eliminating any social sanctions preventing genocide and the other that unmasked the state-sponsored genocide clothed as a necessary military exercise against dissidents. This article employs Allport's (1954) Scale of Prejudice and Stanton's (2016) eight stages of genocide as a tool of making sense of the social processes that create society's progression from prejudice and discrimination to genocide; how through language conventions, the unthinkable becomes acceptable through the erosion of moral, social, religious and rational boundaries. Linguistic conventions show how power is enacted through discourse, how language acts prepare and maintain the way for physical and material acts, and how the same language conventions generate permissions for Gukurahundi, the Rwanda genocide and the Holocaust, amongst others. To demonstrate the permissibility conditions for non-linguistic behaviours like Gukurahundi, this article addresses the metaphor of Gukurahundi, the dehumanisation of the victims, political and religious constructions and the re-construction of the 'other'.

AB  - Social behaviour and filial background define the formation and development of a character that is bound by cultural influence in South Asian fiction. Ru Freeman weaves numerous characters and their stories in a single lane as a synecdoche of Sri Lankan history. On Sal Mal Lane (2014) showcases the different social groups defining the Sri Lankan conflict in the 1980s with the presence of child characters who are unaware of the extent of the ethnic conflict swirling in the background of the narrative. This paper tries to define the concepts of heroes, villains, and victims through the socio-emotional development of the characters to determine the contradiction between their intentions and subsequent actions. The study uses Character Theory and elements of Affect Control Theory for critical analysis. The paper analyses the change in personality traits of child characters in response to the violence wrought by Sri Lankan ethnic prejudices and the extent of destructive development from the unstable familial and societal environment.

AB  - The dehumanization processes represent a failure in the attribution of thinking skills to other human beings. Based on ethnicity, gender, sexual preference, and nationality, social prejudices are reinforced in basic neurocognitive structures. Still, their manifestation is conveyed by personal goals and normative beliefs, which develop in an environment of a dyadic relationship or intergroup contexts. Therefore, this paper aims to peruse the perspectives for a theory of dehumanization, supporting them with neuroscientific research on the neural basis, and exploring the forms of dehumanization that African Americans suffered when they were victims of lynching in the United States.

AB  - In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, disabled people remain a significantly underrepresented part of the workforce. Recent data suggests that about 20% of undergraduates in the United States have disabilities, but representation in STEM fields is consistently lower than in the general population. Of those earning STEM degrees, only about 10% of undergraduates, 6% of graduate students, and 2% of doctoral students identify as disabled. This suggests that STEM fields have difficulty recruiting and retaining disabled students, which ultimately hurts the field, because disabled scientists bring unique problem-solving perspectives and input. This essay briefly explores the ways in which ableism-prejudice against disabled people based on the assumption that they are "less than" their nondisabled peers-in research contributes to the exclusion of disabled scientists and suggests ways in which the scientific community can improve accessibility and promote the inclusion of disabled scientists in academic science.

AB  - The media, including popular media such as music and films, often generate conversations about different spectrums of society. Due to an overabundance of imagery and sounds from the media, including television, film, advertising, social media and the internet, audiences are constantly bombarded with stereotypes and ideologies about other races and identities. As an exponentially growing popular culture industry, Nollywood - the Nigerian movie industry - positions itself as a source of knowledge and popular discourse about issues emanating from the continent and other places. With this growth, Nollywood seems to have been given a spot in the political circle of identity politics, giving it the power to represent the 'Others'. This study interrogates the theme of identity construction in African films by focusing on the ways in which some select Nollywood films of the early and late 2000s and early 2010s frame and construct foreign races and foreign societies, using critical ideological analysis and the framework of critical race theory. Representations and portrayals of difference in the analysed movies could be serving some 'revenge' of sorts, transgressing age-long representations of Black people in Blaxploitation films. The multiplex representations as seen in the analyses serve the primary purpose of such stereotypes: to reproduce and to reaffirm prejudices that over time become naturalized and normalized. The study thematically specifies the significant use of labels, stereotypes and certain orthodoxies that aim to frame and characterize foreign societies in popular Nigerian films and suggests some broader implications of the findings.

AB  - Background
   Sexual Orientation is an enduring pattern of romantic or sexual attraction, with the attractions broadly incorporated under heterosexuality and non-heterosexuality. Societal and other factors seem to affect individuals' perception of their self-identified orientation. Thus, this study sets out to document the distribution of sexual orientation, level of self-reported satisfaction, and factors associated with sexual orientation among unmarried university students.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study involving 550 respondents sampled using a multi-stage sampling technique. Data collected via a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed via IBM SPSS version 20.0.
   Results
   Most respondents (93.6%) were heterosexuals, 4.7% bisexuals, 1.3% lesbian women and 0.40% gay men. More heterosexuals (80.4%) were fully satisfied with their self-identified sexual orientation compared to 57.2% of non-heterosexuals. Respondents who had religious upbringing and those whose parents were currently married were less likely to have sexual orientation outside of heterosexuality.
   Conclusion
   The most prevalent sexual orientation was heterosexuality, with more heterosexuals also expressing satisfaction than others. With the level of dissatisfaction expressed by those who are not heterosexuals as well as the factors associated with heterosexuality, it is plausible to conclude that societal values and/or prejudices constitute major factors in individuals self-identifying with some particular sexual orientation and the satisfaction derived therein.

AB  - Several scholars have noted that entrepreneurship, innovation, and market dynamism more generally ??creative destruction?? are largely absent from Smith?s characterization of what his ?liberal plan? tends to bring about. Indeed, in reading Smith?s body of work, one gets the impression that Smith?s opinion of innovation ranged from oblivious to skeptical. I argue, however, that the scant attention to innovation and market dynamism is not an oversight on Smith?s part; nor did Smith believe that innovation was typically undesirable. Instead, I argue that we must read Smith esoterically. Smith recognizes that prejudices against commercial activity are ancient and deep?even natural. Market dynamism generates moral and social tumult. Innovation breaks from, and sometimes disrupts, traditional ways of living. A liberal order tends toward greater cultural detachment and moral fragmentation. Smith downplayed the tumultuous effects of market dynamism, and, on the surface, he did sometimes disparage the effects of innovation. Beneath the surface, however, Smith recognizes that innovation is an inherent component of the liberal package?a mixed blessing but, at any rate, an integral part of the liberal plan. In his work the careful reader can find guidance on how people can adjust to, and make the best of, a liberal order. The economic growth promised by liberalism hinges on innovation; the virtues of tolerance and reserve must be learned. To make the liberal plan palatable, Smith recognizes that he must adopt a pedagogy that leaves some of his teachings indirect or nonobvious.

KW  - visual politics
AB  - This article develops the concept of "mimetic weaponization" for theory-building. Memes recurrently serve as identificatory markers of affiliation across social media platforms, with ensuing controversies potentially proving newsworthy. Our elaboration of weaponization refers to the purposeful deployment of memetic imagery to disrupt, undermine, attack, resist or reappropriate discursive positions pertaining to public affairs issues in the news. For alt-right memetic conflicts, impetuses range from "sharing a joke" to promoting "alternative facts," rebuking "political correctness" or "wokeness," defending preferred framings of "free speech," or signalling cynicism, distrust or dissent with "mainstream" media, amongst other drivers. Of particular import, we argue, is the politics of othering at stake, including in the wider journalistic mediation of a meme's public significance. Rendering problematic this contested process, this article focuses on Pepe the Frog as an exemplar, showing how and why variations of this mimetic cartoon have been selectively mobilized to help normalize - ostensibly through humour, parody or satire - rules of inclusion and exclusion consistent with hate-led agendas. Digital journalism, we conclude, must improve its capacity to identify and critique mimetic weaponization so as to avoid complicity in perpetuating visceral forms of prejudice and discrimination so often presented as "just a bit of fun."

AB  - This article seeks to re-address the problem of Cordelia - not as a vessel of male prejudice, fantasy or repression but as an image of truth and the social life of that truth as it moves across the play world. Focusing on King Lear, I will examine the complex value of silence, not as negation or nothing, but as an ethical value through which the play explores the contested space of the unsayable. Considering Lear's investment in power, monstrosity and self-knowledge, I investigate the story of Apollo's crow, Aesop and Ovid, and what happened to the bird who told the truth and became 'the opposite of white'. Re-imagining the unspeakable, as well as the unknowable, this essay argues that King Lear rehabilitates the power of nothing through a sceptical analysis of the value of acceptance and restraint, unhinged from their stoic or Christian contexts.

KW  - explicit instruction
KW  - reinforcement of grammatical features
KW  - plural marking
KW  - preverbal particles
AB  - The Afro-Hispanic creole, Palenquero, has been spoken (together with Spanish) in the village of San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia, for centuries. Until recently, Palenquero was endangered due to prejudice, but language revitalization efforts are underway, and younger speakers are learning Palenquero, but with little reinforcement out of school. The school instruction involves no grammatical explanations, almost no student production, or critical feedback. Adult speakers usually do not address younger speakers in Palenquero, thus leaving school-acquired forms suspended without reinforcement. This represents a unique scenario of heritage acquisition of a language with no bidirectional communication between younger and adult speakers. The present study focuses on the use of preverbal particles and prenominal plural marker by heritage speakers of Palenquero before and after explicit instruction. Communication activities explicitly presented the prenominal plural ma and preverbal particles, such as zero morpheme (simple present), ase (habitual), ta (progressive), a (perfective/simple past) and tan (future). Participants performed better at the post-test and results suggest that explicit explanation of grammatical rules, practice, repetition, and corrective feedback improved the usage of ma and tan. This result lines up with previous studies that posit the amount of time and exposure that learners need in order to acquire complex morphology.

AB  - As a member of the team that created elements 104 and 105 at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, James Andrew Harris [1932-2000] was the first African American credited in the discovery of an element. This factoid has been posted on social media, used in a quiz game, and repeated on numerous Web sites. The story (if any context is offered at all) is often the same-a narrative beginning with prejudice, which is overcome with perseverance, and a discovery as pay-off. It is a good story, and this article does not doubt its veracity. But there are questions that need asking. These questions can be basic: what role did Harris play in the discovery of these elements? Or, they can be complicated: what did Harris do before or after these discoveries? At present, there is a surprising lack of detailed information about James Harris's life and career that is easily discoverable. This article is both a call to chemistry students and educators to help uncover more of Harris's story as well as an example of how three simple guidelines can aid the discovery process.

AB  - Structural prejudices and unconscious biases within the construction industry have negatively impacted the construction workforce. Workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion are major concerns in the construction industry. The goal of the present study is to enable the assessment of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry by identifying and determining the level of influence of applicable indicators revealing diversity, equity, and inclusion at the workforce level. A two-round survey and a panel of 16 experts were utilized to achieve the research goal. After collecting and analyzing the responses, 10 indicators were found to be influential in terms of achieving a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment and were therefore considered measures of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion. These indicators are (1) ethnic and racial diversity at the company level; (2) gender diversity and inclusion at the workforce level; (3) a corporate policy statement on diversity and inclusion; (4) gender/ethnic diversity in leadership/management positions; (5) knowledge and skill diversity; (6) equitable pay/compensation at the industry level; (7) equality, social justice, and nondiscrimination policy statement; (8) pay structure transparency; (9) equitable pay/compensation at the company level; and (10) merit-based transparent recruitment and promotion. The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a means of assessing workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry. It is expected that utilizing the identified indicators would help managers and human resources specialists/professionals in construction perform a thorough assessment of the level of diversity, equity, and inclusiveness of the workforce within their organizations and identify opportunities for enhancing the workforce diversity, equity, and inclusiveness.

AB  - Y With the growth in political, ethnic, and religious conflicts across the globe, intolerance is manifested across different societies especially in the context of (forced) migration and refugees. The purpose of this study is to examine intolerance as a complex social problem. Specifically, this research seeks to explore the perceptions and conceptions of (in)tolerance between refugees from Syria and host communities in Lebanon identifying the degree and the different forms in which tolerance and intolerance materialize. This will allow different agents such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policymakers, and relevant authorities to develop adequate interventions to tackle this phenomenon through a social marketing approach and improve (refugee) crisis response plans. The situation has emerged following the Syrian conflict (2011-present) and the arrival of 1.5 million refugees into Lebanon. This number thus constitutes a challenge to both the hosts and the refugees in Lebanon, a small country. A qualitative study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews to investigate the perceptions and conceptions of the target audiences, citizens, refugees, leaders, and NGO staff/volunteers. Results show the existence of a phenomenon of intolerance; its relevant aspects, namely discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes, racism, and scapegoating; and the rise of violence-tension and fear as emerging themes of intolerance manifestations in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon.

AB  - Background
   Domestic violence is one of the most critical issues worldwide, often reported in newspapers and faced with prejudices and cliches. Violence against women in particular continues to be an obstacle to reaching equality, development, peace and the achievement of respect for women human rights. Primary prevention strategies aim to increase awareness and critical capacity of the phenomenon in the general population. They are therefore not only a clinical challenge, but also a social, cultural and political one.
   Objective
   The objective of this literature review is to identify primary prevention programs and interventions related to interpersonal violence
   Methods
   A literature search was conducted through major databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO/PsycLIT, Excerpta Medica/EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), Cochrane Library. National data were collected from, the ISTAT website, the Ministry of Health and the Interior and the Institute of Health.
   Conclusions
   The analysis of primary prevention programs highlighted two elements of criticality: insufficient involvement of the perpetrators of the violent behaviour (men) compared to the involvement of women, and lack of attention to specific risk and protective factors for each level.

AB  - This qualitative case study utilized critical media literacy to guide the analysis of the depiction of racially and ethnically diverse college students in contemporary popular films. Participants in this study were racially and ethnically diverse undergraduate students enrolled at a private, predominantly White institution in the United States. Three primary themes emerged from this study. First, students of color were more apt to recognize stereotypical portrayals of people of color in the films, whereas White students' responses were more attuned with color-blind racial ideology (CBRI). Second, media-centered discussions provided an outlet for students of color to share their personal experiences with racism, stereotyping, and prejudice. In doing so, students of color seek to build the cultural competence of peers who may hold CBRI beliefs. Finally, this study presents a need for critical media literacy. Regardless of race and/or ethnicity, the undergraduates who participated in our study communicated an importance of examining media messages, such as stereotypes of people of color, from a critical perspective. For college and university administrators, such as chief diversity officers, this study is significant in presenting a means for engaging students, faculty, and other stakeholders in dialogue about racial issues in the hopes of fostering a more welcoming campus racial climate for students of color.

AB  - In 1967, the University of Maryland's School of Library and Information Services created a public library in Prince George's County, Maryland, named the High John Experiment, to give Librarianship and Information Science students experience serving disadvantaged communities and to discover new methods to better serve these communities. From the creation of High John to the present day, University of Maryland publications and unaffiliated works credit High John as a groundbreaking experiment that propelled interests in diversity and inclusion in public libraries. High John's creators published a 73 paged report for the United States' Office of Education, accompanied by published articles, that confirms a violation of ethics toward the community High John served. The community was not involved in the implementation or planning of the library and many of the services and materials the library offered were based on prejudiced assumptions instead of community input or research. Although High John garnered supporters, the validity and ethicality behind High John's intent and methods were called into question during the experiment. The controversy led to debates within the field that resulted in conversations about Librarianship and Information Science pedagogy and appropriate methods in outreach and community engagement for disadvantaged communities. Now that the passionately fueled debates on High John have ceased, the experiment is a distant memory. Although this experiment led to debates about diversity, inclusion, and equity in information access within the United States, this experiment is relevant to information readers on a global scale. Because Librarianship and Information Science has a history rooted in elitism and oppression worldwide, High John warrants further exposure and examination from a diverse pool of contemporary perspectives. Through the application of modern community outreach and engagement practices, this article builds on a critical historical analysis of the experiment and argues High John failed in its mission and violated the community's trust that it purported to serve.

AB  - W. E. B. Du Bois often appropriated and deployed the metaphor of "Prometheus," drawing from Hesiod's Theogony, Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound, Goethe's poem "Prometheus," and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Throughout Du Bois's career, he employed this figure in order for the reader to better understand the racialized social order in general and White supremacy in specific. In what follows, I cover the eighteenth and nineteenth century use of the Prometheus metaphor in regard to critiques of racism and slavery. I then establish how Du Bois stepped into this tradition to advance a multifaceted critique of global White supremacy that continues to resonate today. Precisely, Du Bois rendered this character in six patterned forms: (1) as an embodiment of de jure and de facto segregation; (2) as newly conscious Black people that would soon revolt against White supremacy; (3) as the paradoxical capture and harm of White people by their own design; (4) as the prejudice, discrimination, and racism born of White supremacist politics; (5) as the struggle of Black folks against White supremacy; and (6) a Black-centered spiritual worldview of eventual liberation. Together, these six deployments signal the early manifestations of both critical race theory and Afrofuturism-two modes of inquiry that help us to reconsider not only the material repercussions of racial inequality but the pathways and roadblocks toward racial utopia.

AB  - This paper deals with the challenging issue of illegal building in Italy with a view to clearing up the picture on this subject matter. This phenomenon is scarcely treated from an analytical/scientific point of view, especially in international literature. However, it is very present in the social and journalistic debate. Our research highlights the objective lack of data needed to gauge this offence, which is less endemic than is believed. Furthermore, it proves that existing data are insufficient to produce results, which often range between reality and prejudice, depicting some areas of the country in an extremely negative way. The first part of this paper describes the extreme complexity in acquiring ?real? data and the total nation-wide lack of technical-administrative structures and methods capable of producing acceptably reliable information. In the second part, an emblematic case study is presented and its history traced back. We show that the multiform phenomena associated with illegal building create an enormous and rhetorical stratification of actions that ultimately do not lead to any appreciable result. This underscores the powerlessness of the administrative, regulatory and technical apparatus towards this particular infringement of territorial law.

TI  - Navigating Exclusion as Enemies of the State: The Case of Serbs in Croatia and Croats in Serbia
T2  - GEOPOLITICS
LA  - English
AB  - Since the break-up of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Serbia have emerged as nationalist states that serve the political interests of ethnic Croats and Serbs, respectively. Despite these regime shifts, historical communities of Croatian Serbs and Serbian Croats still remain within these states. This paper sheds light on the experiences of these minority groups who embody ideological threats to their regimes' nationalist goals. I argue that Serbs in Croatia are heavily marginalised by dominant political narratives that have cast them to bear the brunt of the state's post-war grievances. As a result, they experience institutional discrimination that limits their range of economic and social opportunities. Conversely, Croats in Serbia face less explicit prejudice, though post-war stigmas have pushed many to redefine their ethnic affiliations. Both minority groups are experiencing a steady population decline as the rise in nationalist rhetoric has dissolved their rootedness to these territories. This paper examines a majority-minority dynamic in the context of the literature on modern 'ethnocratic' states and presents a case study for how ethnic minorities navigate through social prejudices and find ways to negotiate access to participation in everyday society, given the structural exclusion from institutions they face as communities deemed hostile by their state.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the conditions of life of patients with mental and behavioral disorders admitted to a specialized hospital in an inner city in the state of Sa similar to o Paulo, Brazil, and their possible relationship with inequities and social exclusion. The information about the conditions of life was gathered through medical records and structured interviews with the patients. The data collected were compared with the recent literature on the subject. We conclude that the conditions of health, life and social vulnerability are associated with changes in family and social relationships, stigma, discrimination and prejudice, and barriers to the exercise of citizenship for these patients. Findings confirm the need for equity in this group's access to the exercise of human rights.

AB  - Objectives: The 'Black Lives Matter' (BLM) movement in 2020 exemplifies efforts to counter prejudices and the colourist narrative. Harmful use of topical skin lightening agents continues worldwide despite interdiction or restricted use under domestic, European and international regulations.
   Study design: Commentary.
   Methods: Narrative review.
   Results: In this Short Communication, we consider the significance of societal perspectives of skin colour, glocalized whiteness, efforts to attain self-esteem and social mobility through skin lightening practices, and the role of cosmetic products in fuelling this phenomenon.
   Conclusions: Addressing the inadvertent (or indeed conscious) vehicles of systematic racism and sustaining of skin colour prejudices and stereotypes of fair skin beauty by cosmetic companies is warranted. Targeted health messaging is an imperative. (C) 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gender stereotypes continue to exist and are transmitted through media, and through social, educational and recreational socialization, which promote gender prejudice and discrimination. This paper argues that contemporary management culture does not critically engage with the social theories of gender studies, which could help in developing gender-neutral affirmative action-oriented managerial perspectives. The paper outlines different aspects of gender stereotyping and their impact on women's career progressions from a managerial perspective, which engages with the critical theories of gender studies. The paper contributes to existing literature by identifying the antecedents of gender stereotypes and their impacts on the career progressions of women in management. It advances theoretical understanding of three clear conceptual shifts, that is, (a) Women in Management, (b) Women and Management and (c) Gender and Management. The theoretical transition from Women in Management to Women and Management led to progressive conceptual shifts in management literature but gender stereotypes continue to exist in society.

AB  - The positive role of religion in reducing prejudice has remained a neglected theme in Psychology of religion, concerning itself mostly with prejudice and fundamentalism. Recently, noting the absence of a positive antithesis to prejudice and fundamentalism, faith development theory presents xenosophia as going beyond mere tolerance to a creative engagement with other religious faiths to develop new insights and broaden one's own worldview. The current research undertakes a study of Muslim faith contents to get insights into how these beliefs shape construction of self in relation to other faith communities. Conducting inductive thematic analysis of faith development interviews from 12 Muslim participants from three major religious affiliations in Pakistan (equally divided for gender and ages ranging from 31 to 76 years) in an earlier research, the research analyzes a range of xenological patterns from xenophobia to xenosophia with associated potentials for inter-faith dialogue. Focusing on residents of a country with a dense Muslim population, the study carries implications for religious socialization and religious education in a globalized world.

AB  - Objective:
   We aimed to investigate the relationships between use of media to obtain information on radiation and radiation anxiety among community residents in Fukushima, 5.5 years after the nuclear power plant accident.
   Methods:
   A questionnaire survey was administered between August and October 2016 to 2000 randomly sampled residents in Fukushima prefecture. Radiation anxiety toward health and regarding discrimination and prejudice were assessed with 4- and 3-item scales, respectively. Participants nominated their most-used media for acquiring information on radiation by choosing up to 3 sources from 12 information sources listed (eg, local newspaper, TV news, websites, social networking sites [SNS], local government newsletter, word of mouth). We investigated associations of most-used media types and radiation anxiety, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and anxiety regarding radiation's health effects immediately after the accident, using multivariate linear regression analyses.
   Results:
   Valid responses were obtained from 790 (39.5%) residents. Acquiring information about radiation by word of mouth was related to higher radiation anxiety toward health. Regarding radiation anxiety concerning discrimination and prejudice, SNS use was related to higher anxiety, whereas acquiring information through Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) TV news was related to lower anxiety.
   Conclusions:
   Interpersonal interactions rather than gaining information from media - characterized by unidirectional information exchange - may increase radiation anxiety.

AB  - Objectives: At the end of 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It subsequently spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to investigate the degree of knowledge of young Italians about COVID-19 and their current attitudes toward the SARS-CoV-2 and to determine if there were prejudices emerging toward Chinese.
   Methods: An online survey was conducted on February 3, 4, 5, 2020, with the collaboration of Italian website "Skuola.net". Young people had the opportunity to participate by answering an ad hoc questionnaire created to investigate knowledge and attitudes about the new coronavirus, using a link published on the homepage.
   Results: A total of 5234 responses were received, of which 3262 were females and 1972 were males. Most of the participants showed generally moderate knowledge about COVID-19. Male students, middle school students, and those who do not attend school, should increase awareness of the disease; less than half of responders say that their attitudes toward the Chinese population has worsened in the last period.
   Conclusions: Global awareness of this emerging infection should be increased, due to its virulence, the significant risk of mortality, and the ability of the virus to spread very quickly within the community.

KW  - transprejudice
KW  - trans women
AB  - Prejudice towards trans women is an under-examined but a critical social problem in Turkey. Patriarchal femininity sanctions women who do not comply with the idealised female bodies and feminine norms. On the other hand, ideals of hegemonic masculinity necessitate that men avoid femininity. In that sense, prejudice against trans women ostensibly stands at the intersection of hegemonic masculinity ideology and femininities that diverge from patriarchal feminine norms. Therefore, this study examines the mediatory effect of femmephobia in the link between masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women as measured by negative affect and social distancing motivations. Results indicate that femmephobia significantly mediates the relationship between the endorsement of masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women. Among three mandates of masculinity ideology, the endorsement of the antifemininity mandate was the most solid indirect predictor of negative affect and social distance through femmephobia, followed by mandates of toughness and status, respectively. Although participant gender does not have an indirect effect on the outcome variables, it has a direct effect on men's social distancing intentions but not on negative emotions. The results are discussed in the light of existing literature which intersects with the devaluation of femininity.

AB  - This article introduces this Themed Issue, Linguistic Diversity as a Challenge to Legal Policy, and reports a small, peer-reviewed study of the integration of research about language issues in legal contexts in Australian legal education. The article explains that interdisciplinary law and linguistics research has emerged to better understand potential inequalities and injustices. This research speaks to concerns shared across many legal systems because both multilingualism and inter-lingual prejudice are common phenomena across nations. The Themed Issue's eleven contributions draw scholarly attention to specific, current problems in legal contexts which relate to language practices and/or policies about language, arranged around the familiar three branches of the state (legislature, executive, judiciary). The Themed Issue is aimed at endowing readers with motivation and basic knowledge to tread new, language-aware routes towards solutions based on collaborative research and policy reform. In regards to integrating such research into legal education, our NSW and ACT study found few course offerings which focus on an intersection of linguistic and legal scholarship. We therefore suggest the development of electives or the inclusion of such material in core subjects (timely given the 'Priestly 11' compulsory subjects are under review at the time of writing).

AB  - Background: Weight stigma contributes to the present epidemic of obesity, and obese people with stigmatization are at risk of acquiring adverse physical, behavioral and psychological health outcomes
   Objectives: to identify the source of obesity stigma and to examine the effect of obesity stigma on adults with overweight/obesity in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A cross sectional study was done on a sample of the Saudi population from different regions. A pre-designed questionnaire was used to collect data about exposure to negative behavior by others because of obesity, ways and sources in which participants face discrimination and prejudice and participants were asked about their feelings and effect of obesity on their life and daily activities.
   Results: Often, because of obesity, 25.6% of the participants were exposed to negative behavior by others, 18.2% were exposed to bad comments from children, 25.2% were exposed to physical barriers and 25.4% were exposed to bad comments from the family. The most important sources of discrimination against obese people were by family members (42.4%) and (27.9%) face this discrimination by self-love, and self-acceptance. Participants with an age ranging from 21-29 years had a significant higher frequency of those who reported exposure to negative behavior by others, bad comments from children, family and others, and encountered more physical barriers and obstacles compared to other age groups.
   Conclusion: Obese individuals should be health educated to accept themselves and in the national discourse on obesity, weight stigma must be discussed.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between two forms of religious discrimination (religious prejudice and environmental discrimination) and life satisfaction in a sample of Muslim Americans. Based on the framework of minority stress theory, we hypothesized that higher levels of religious prejudice (distal stressor) and environmental discrimination would significantly relate to higher fear for safety (proximal stressor) and, in turn, would relate to lower life satisfaction. A total of 192 Muslim American participants (Age M = 27.87) completed an online survey about their experiences. Women made up almost 75% of the sample. Findings revealed that higher religious prejudice as well as environmental discrimination were both significantly related to lower life satisfaction and that fear for safety partially mediated both of these relationships. Findings help illustrate that Muslim Americans are impacted by the social-political climate of Islamophobia and can experience religious discrimination in different ways. In addition, women and younger participants expressed higher fear for safety when compared to men and older participants. Professionals who work with individuals from the Muslim community are encouraged to consider the chronic and ongoing impact of stress that Muslim Americans face especially within some Islamophobic environments in the United States.

AB  - Being some major problems of our contemporary world, racism and ethnocentrism demand persistent critical scrutiny. One oft-neglected aspect of these problems is how such prejudices are shared and communicated among the members of the dominant group. This study examines Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Sweat (2015), as a dramatic representation of how racism and ethnocentrism are reproduced and communicated as a social cognition. To this aim, the study tries to employ Teun Adrianus Van Dijk's cognitively-based discourse analysis and focus on some micro-level aspects of racism as a social cognition rather as an abstract historical phenomenon. Contextualizing the play within its socio-historical moment, three trends of schematic attitudes and mental models regarding ethnocentrism_ as Van Dijk's theory outlines_ are identified from and studied in the play. The findings demonstrate the socio-cognitive dimension of the discourse of racism, particularly the way it is reproduced and communicated among the dominant in-group members. Moreover, the discussion offers some insight on Lynn Nottage's latest dramatic endeavor in a hard-hitting portrayal of the intersections of race, class, and political economy and in drawing attention to the real meaning of diversity and inclusion in contemporary America..

KW  - postmodern art
KW  - contemporary art eaching
AB  - Purpose: Conducting contemporary art lessons with a traditional art history view and a chronological approach leads to misinterpretations - and even to prejudices - of contemporary art as it is not progressing chronologically, cannot be assessed within specific stylistic forms and defined with strict lines, unlike previous traditional art disciplines. Based upon this problem, in this study, a new course process was planned in which contemporary art pieces are compared to traditional pieces focusing on the five major themes contemporary art differs from traditional art.
   Within the scope of this research dealing with this process, answers have been sought to the questions how comparative art history education through themes influences the perception of art, professional, personal, social progress of pre-service teachers and what sort of changes this method creates. Methodology: Research findings designed as action research were obtained by reviewing activity forms prepared for the lesson and semi-structured focus group interview. Gathered data were interpreted by the descriptive analysis method. Findings: The findings obtained in this study suggest that this method helps pre-service teachers define art with a broader perspective, better understand and embrace contemporary art, develop awareness about social issues conveyed through contemporary pieces, explore different expression possibilities for art practices and to form new opinions about art education in a professional sense. Implications for Research and Practice: Pre-service teachers expressed positive views for the comparison technique and providing an environment for expressing oneself freely. Within this context, it is suggested to design discussion-based art history lesson plans around specific themes. (C) 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - The paper argues that the different dimensions of collaboration - intercultural, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary - contribute to mutual understanding and empathy. Their intersection fosters self-reflection and reveals shortcomings, blind spots, and prejudices about other cultures, disciplines, and social groups. The course aimed to overcome technology-driven design practices that tend to (re)produce stereotypes or social exclusions - often unconsciously. To make students aware of such problems, we introduced them to Feminist Science and Technology Studies, which show how dimensions such as age, class, and gender affect socio-technological participation. Moreover, we introduced user-centered and participatory design methods (contextual interviews, scenario-based design, design forecasting) that the teams had to adapt to pandemic conditions to conduct participatory research and propose design scenarios. The empirical course evaluation by the students indicates that the pedagogical concept, which we conceptualized as an extended version of a 'Third Space', allowed for intercultural, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary learning experiences and improved collective student and team performance, transcending culturally- and disciplinary-specific situatedness.
   In our analysis, we reflect on the power of the different forms of collaborations and their contribution to teaching future researchers, designers, and engineers how to engage with another's point of view. We consider this ability a prerequisite for acting responsibly in a globalized digital world. Results from the study are contextualized in current debates on internationalization and digitalization in the educational sciences and translated into recommendations for practitioners.

AB  - The outbreak of Covid-19 has been highly racialised and stigmatised around the world based on the origin of the virus and its highly infectious nature. Profiling of Asians or mongoloid looking individuals as a suspect carrier of the virus and the resultant taunts and discriminations occur worldwide. In India, the pandemic has reinforce racism against Northeast Indians, which the country has been grappling with this social problem in the last one decade or so. Such discriminations were overt acts of racial prejudice that primarily stems from the nonrecognition or misrecognition of Northeast Indians, who are mainly mongoloid race, as Indians. During the pandemic, the fight by Northeast Indians was with the mindset of the rest of Indians as much as the virus itself. It was a fight not only against the presumption of being `non-Indian' with negative affiliation, or worse `unwanted Indians', but also to get due recognition and acceptance as equal Indians. The absence of stringent anti-racism laws may have resulted in the pervasiveness of overt acts of racism during the pandemic. However, such actions are best understood on the structural elements that underpin Indian societies. The legal measures to address this social problem will reduce overt acts of racism but addressing covert racial acts, which are structural in nature, is a long way to go.

AB  - Biotechnology describes a range of human activities in medicine, agriculture, and environmental management. One biotechnology in particular, gene technology, continues to evolve both in capacity and potential to benefit and harm society. The purpose of this article is to offer a policy bridge from unproductive descriptions of gene technology to useful methods for identifying sources of significant biological and socioeconomic risk in complex food systems. Farmers and the public could be voluntarily and involuntarily interacting with new techniques of genome editing and gene silencing in entirely new ways, limiting the usefulness of previous gene technology histories to predict safety. What we believe is a more consistent, verifiable, and practical approach is to identify the critical control points that emerge where the scale effects of a human activity diverge between risk and safety. These critical control points are where technical experts can collaborate with publics with different expertise to identify and manage the technology. The use of technical terminology describing biochemical-level phenomena discourages publics that are not technical experts from contesting the embedded cultural perspectives and uncertainty in "scientific" concepts and prejudice the risk discourse by ignoring other issues of significance to society. From our perspective as gene technologists, we confront the use of pseudo-scale language in risk discourse and propose an escape path from clashes over whether risks that arise spontaneously (from nature) can be perfectly mimicked by gene technology to a discussion on how to best control the risks created by human activity. Scale is conceptually implicit and explicit in gene technology regulation, but there is no agreement about what scales are most useful to managing risk and social expectations. Both differentiated governance (risk-tiered) and responsible research and innovation models could accommodate the critical control points mechanism that we describe.

AB  - For the creation of the play 'La Torera', its author, Carmen Elena Jijon, collects fragments of Anita Bermeo's life to reconstruct the main character of the play. The proposal is articulated, together with the collective imagination, with press articles and multiple creations by artists from the Republic of Ecuador, becoming part of a transmedial biography of 'La Torera' that goes beyond the entire work and it circumscribes in an even broader transfictional universe. In this context, the present article manages to demonstrate a parallelism between the figure of 'La Torera' with the artist Frida Kahlo, placing both Latin American women in the performance field as pioneers in their different environments. In this way, Anita Bermeo's legacy as an artist is finally rescued, taking her character beyond the cliche and social prejudices of that time in Quito-Ecuador, which overshadowed her creation.

Method: Exploratory, descriptive, qualitative study conducted with primary health care nurses based on Imogene King's Open Systems Theory (personal, interpersonal, and social). The data were obtained through interviews; a sociodemographic/professional questionnaire and a semi-structured script were employed, processed by the IRAMUTEQ software and analyzed through Descending Hierarchical Classification. Results: Study participants amounted to 32 nurses. Five classes emerged from the analysis: "diagnostic revelation process";"professionaltraining"; "preventive measures"; "barriers and potentials in the process of decentralization"; and "stigma and prejudice". Conclusion: In the process of reorganization of the healthcare model for people living with HIV in primary health care, an important contribution by nurses in strengthening the local healthcare decentralization was identified.

AB  - The purpose of the article - in a historical context to study the effectiveness of public organizations cooperation of the western region of Ukraine with local self-governments and state authorities (1988 - 2021) on the example of a unique "The Lion Society", Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Cultural and Scientific Society (CSS) "Rukh", Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Association of All-Ukrainian T. Shevchenko Society "Prosvita". The research methodology is based on the principles of objectivity and historicism, which provide for the analysis of individual phenomena and processes in their development and close connection with the system of relevant social relations; historical facts are considered against the background of political processes, which in its turn involves the use of the method of comparative analysis, which clarifies the essence of many significant events in the Ukrainian socio-political thought. The scientific novelty: the problems faced by public organizations and local self-governments and state authorities have been outlined; the achievements and prospects of the Ukrainian cultural and educational societies at different historical stages have been generalized; the programme of action between public organizations and local self-governments, and the state authorities has been elaborated. The Conclusions. Nowadays, an effective mechanism for cooperation between public organizations and local governments, and state authorities has been created and tested in Ukraine, but not implemented at the national level yet. The function of supporting the civil society can and must be taken over by both public organizations and local self-governments, and the state authorities. Unfortunately, they still have many prejudices against each other. The founders of "Prosvita" Society (the so-called "mother" of the Ukrainian societies) were deeply aware of the need to create the nation and its self-affirmation under the conditions of a foreign occupation. Assessing the achievements and prospects of the Ukrainian cultural and educational societies at different historical stages, it is necessary to focus on preserving the genetic memory of the people. After the proclamation of Ukraine's independence, the task arose of forming a civil society, reviving and developing the spirituality of the Ukrainian people. "The Lion Society", Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Cultural and Scientific Society "Rukh", Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Association of the All-Ukrainian T. Shevchenko "Prosvita" Society and the others elaborated the programme of action: introduction into the public consciousness of understanding the need for self organization of communities, an active citizenship, the priority of traditional Ukrainian national values; support of the Ukrainian language, history, culture, church, Christian morality; promoting the formation of a comprehensively developed highly educated, nationally conscious, socially active personality.

AB  - The possible future of mankind features prominently among SF topics. Despite a long record of failures, like unsuccessful grappling with the scourge of war, present day humanity has come a long way to assume a degree of unity it has never enjoyed before. The process of globalization has its anti-globalist opponents, but its idealistic aim is a better world without racial, social, economic and in some areas even national barriers separating people. This picture of multiracial, multicultural but otherwise ontologically uniform humanity amounts to a vision of a sentient species that is close to achieving its mature form. However, what may look like the final stop of our journey is treated by both the advocates (e.g. Ray Kurzweil) and critics (e.g. Fukuyama) of humanity's trans/posthuman development as the beginning of a new stage of our existence. A question arises if the new paths of evolution involve a danger that humans will fall victim to a policy of metaphysical laissez faire that will put the race's unity and continuity in jeopardy. Will the old walls of racial prejudice and social inequality between people that we have striven to break down be replaced by new ones? The objective of this paper is to use Bruce Sterling's Shaper/Mechanist universe as a literary illustration of the new barriers that the prospective trans/posthumanity may have to face and seek to surmount or leave behind.

Authors conclude that despite the progressive policy conducted first by the post-WW2 Yugoslav government and then by the Serbian government in contemporary Serbia, the position of women in sports has remained essentially the same. Prejudice, misunderstanding and overall gender inequality are typical of both periods. This fact reveals the weaknesses of progressive policies lacking an adequate material basis, since the social conditions of rural areas are the main reasons for such inequality. Furthermore, authors point to the complexity and significance of the phenomenon and prove that the struggle for gender equality in sports is far from over, as the position of women in Yugoslav and Serbian sport has shown only slight improvement since the difficult initial steps.

It provides recommendations on culturally relevant, responsive, and sustaining teaching strategies based on the cultural competence model (Pedersen, 1994; Sue, 2001; Sue et al., 1992) and curriculum reframing. Teachers of Black, Indigenous, and students of color around the world will find this article particularly useful because there are limited research-based recommendations applicable to schools in the U.S. and around the world.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to investigate the content of Covid-19 news in the media before and after the declaration of the first Covid-19 case in Turkey, as well as the compatibility of their medical massages with World Health Organisation (WHO) data.
   Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, Covid-19 news in Turkey's most visited webpages of five newspapers and five internet news sites was examined retrospectively for two months categorized as the periods of one month before and one month after the first Covid-19 case declaration in Turkey. The news was evaluated according to their content, sources, content and headline compatibility, evidence and accuracy levels in terms of WHO reports, its potential to evoke social negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, panic, and to produce negative bias against China. Statistical analysis was performed by using the SPSS 21 program and the results were expressed as numbers and percentages.
   Results: It was determined that in total of 7915 news, the most content was about the protection and prevention methods. In the news before and after the first case declaration in Turkey, the content-headline incompatibility rates were 50,8% and 1,1%; incompatibility rates of the medical information in the news with WHO reports were 7,1% and 2,9%; the rates of referencing were 74,3% and 66,9%, the rates of the news having the potential to produce anxiety and fear in the reader were 56,9% and 19,6% and to produce prejudice and negative attitudes towards China were 19,7% and 4,6%, respectively.
   Conclusions: It seems that the declaration of the first Covid-19 case changed the news making pattern of the media to a more responsible behaviour for the public. We suggest that it is a rational approach to use the power of the media correctly in enhancing public awareness towards Covid-19 pandemic.

KW  - RESILIENCE
AB  - Background. The issue of solitude is fragmentary in gerontological investigations, and is generally interpreted as loneliness: a negative experience of lack of relationships with other people.
   Ageing people have many variants of loneliness, often connected with their own prejudices or satisfaction with their social contacts.
   In loneliness, opportunities and rights to the sovereignty of one's life space can be preserved.
   Objective. To study loneliness as a fact of life, a multi-dimensional phenomenon, including the feeling of loneliness itself, lack of communication, and ability to be alone. We suppose that senior adults with different levels of psychological well-being are specific in this acceptance of loneliness and ability to find resources in this situation.
   Design. The participants comprised 129 residents of Kamchatka Region aged 60-82. In the first stage, using C. Ryff's "Psychological Well-Being Scale" with mid-values cluster analysis, the respondents were divided into groups with different levels of psychological well-being.
   In the second stage, the data of the "Differential Questionnaire on Experiencing Loneliness" and "Subjective Perception of One's Own Life" questionnaire were used for correlation analysis of interrelations between psychological well-being and the "positive loneliness" subscale, revealing the participants' ability to find resources in loneliness.
   Results. The research shows that experiencing loneliness in the gerontological cohort is non-homogeneous; it is interconnected with personal attitudes towards positive loneliness, with psychological well-being. It changes the activities of the elderly and the extent of experiencing loneliness.
   Conclusion. There is cultural mitigation of loneliness in gerontological cohorts and also in their shift from a negative mindset towards an existential one.

AB  - Introduction: The field of disability studies is a contested area of research that has transformed significantly over the past three decades. The move away from the medical model of disability in the early 1980s created opportunities for the voices of people with disabilities to be heard. However, research into the lived experiences of this population has historically relied on proxy accounts and, where first-person accounts have been included, people with disabilities have often been excluded on the basis of cognitive-communicative (dis)ability and language proficiency. This article explores the ways in which space and place influence the lived experience of disability in a rural South African context.
   Methods: A qualitative approach underpinned by the principles of narrative inquiry was adopted. Thirty participants with a variety of impairments were interviewed over a period of 3 months. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.
   Results: Findings reveal a complex web of physical and socioemotional aspects that influence the spaces and places in which stories are lived and told. Overriding themes include exclusion on the basis of physical mobility; exclusion from healthcare, education and social services; exclusion from the employment sector; exclusion from participation in sociocultural activities; and the creation of 'safe places', which provide insight into the physical and psychosocial dimensions of inclusion.
   Conclusion: A case is made for social activism and for communities to confront the anxieties, silences, prejudices and injustices that exist in policy documents, healthcare consultations and community engagements.

AB  - Background: Homophobia or the reaction against homosexuals could be based on the structural ideology of the society, on its institutions or on power relationships, which can incite contempt, sometimes even to deadly violence, regarding those not complying the national culture reference model. Such behaviors are born from the belief that homosexuality must be fought against and opposed as it threatens social order, and could be increased augmented by the campaigns of politicians spread in the mass media.
   Methods: The aim of this study is to investigate and compare homophobia in Italy and Spain, two Mediterranean countries related from a cultural and traditional background and for general acceptance of homosexuals, and to verify the role of current national culture on recently rising homophobic attitude. Italian and Spanish subjects were studied by means of self-administered questionnaires consisting of: Modern Homophobia Scale to evaluate homophobic attitudes, Homophobia Scale to evaluate the affective, cognitive and behavioral components towards homosexuality, Stereotype Content Model to identify stereotypes about homosexuality, the scale of 11 Emotions and the subscale of Prejudice Attitude Test assessing the social distance, to assess the prejudicial behavior across the two countries.
   Results: Results showed that despite homophobia levels are low for both populations, with positive emotion and stereotype, Italians showed a greater social distance and a lower quantity and quality of contacts with homosexuals than Spanish. Comparing for political orientation, ideological right-flaw Italians resulted in significantly higher personal discomfort, aggressiveness and cognitive negativism, and lower quantity of contacts than Spanish. Social distance was higher scored in right-flaw than left-flaw oriented subjects from both Italy and Spain, with Italians scoring higher than Spanish. An alternative interpretation of homophobic attitude in Italy, known for recently rising attempts to homosexuals, was provided in comparison with Spain. Political orientation could provide for the differences observed in social distance in each country, but not between them. Specifically, this study's results indicate that genderist and homophobic campaigns from the Italian right parties could have transmitted values and attitudes of greater prejudice and rejection towards homosexuals.
   Conclusions: This research contributes to the objective of raising awareness about the mechanisms underlying the homophobic matrix conveyed from national culture, politics and mass media, and its consequences on psycho-social disease.

AB  - This paper explores the ways in which Bollywood films, as a form of historical fiction, can be utilized in the classroom, arguing that properly contextualized discussions of such films can be more impactful than historical monographs in highlighting the contested nature of the past. Focusing on the 2001 film Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (Khan & Gorawiker), the article shows how the filmmakers offer a compelling, albeit vastly oversimplified portrayal of political dynamics, caste prejudice, gender relations, and communalism in nineteenth-century colonial India. While containing various generalizations and inaccuracies, the basic historical literacy offered by the film can serve as an effective catalyst for conversation and learning in the upper-division classroom, particularly when combined with appropriate scholarly readings. More importantly, however, the paper contends that Lagaan must be analyzed within the contemporary political and cultural context of rising majoritarian nationalism on the subcontinent and the concomitant decline of liberal-secular policies and political orientations. Lagaan advances a Gandhian vision of India's past, with a specific emphasis on religious and caste/class unity, that has become increasingly marginalized in post-Hindutva India, thus demonstrating how India's past is continually constructed and reconstructed according to the dictates of the present.

AB  - The spiritual dimension of patients has progressively gained more relevance in healthcare in the last decades. However, the term "spiritual" is an open, fluid concept and, for health purposes, no definition of spirituality is universally accepted. Health professionals and researchers have the challenge to cover the entire spectrum of the spiritual level in their practice. This is particularly difficult because most healthcare courses do not prepare their graduates in this field. They also need to face acts of prejudice by their peers or their managers. Here, the authors aim to clarify some common grounds between secular and religious worlds in the realm of spirituality and healthcare. This is a conceptual manuscript based on the available scientific literature and on the authors' experience. The text explores the secular and religious intersection involving spirituality and healthcare, together with the common ground shared by the two fields, and consequent clinical implications. Summarisations presented here can be a didactic beginning for practitioners or scholars involved in health or behavioural sciences. The authors think this construct can favour accepting the patient's spiritual dimension importance by healthcare professionals, treatment institutes, and government policies.

AB  - We studied the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation processes of Syrian refugees in Turkey using semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews among 15 participants. The study explored the themes and issues emerging in the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation processes such as life-satisfaction, contact with the host community and future plans of Syrian adults. Berry's acculturation model (1997) is used to form the theoretical basis of this research. Our findings revealed that psychological and socio-cultural adaptation of Syrian refugees are strongly influenced by economic concerns, pre-migration expectations, religion and perceptions of Turkish natives' expectations/attitudes towards Syrians. From the perspective of the informants, economic concerns and uncertainty regarding duration of stay have a negative impact on refugees' acculturation, leading to delayed psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. Positive perceptions of Turkish natives' expectations/attitudes towards Syrians are perceived to increase motivation to seek social support, which promotes well-being and life satisfaction in Turkey. Yet, negative perceptions such as prejudice and discrimination, may pose a risk for psychological health and low socio-cultural adaptation. One major finding of the paper is the two-fold impact of religion on Syrian refugees: Religion can be considered a binding/equalizing function subsuming refugee and native groups under a superordinate identity. Nonetheless, it also appears to generate social distance when perceived as a threat to the secular national identity. The findings of this research can be used to minimize factors that undermine favorable acculturation outcomes and promote factors that facilitate high levels of psychological and sociocultural adaptation.

AB  - The emergence of an understanding of culturally responsive teaching has established new roles for teachers, and it has become important for teachers to take a role that integrates cultural differences in the teaching environment by stepping out of traditional roles. It is thought that it is important to reveal the characteristics of culturally responsive teachers and their importance in the teaching process. The research aimed to identify the characteristics of teachers within the framework of practices culturally responsive teaching. The research consists of three phases. In the first and second stages, teacher characteristics were investigated within the framework of culturally responsive teaching practices, and in the third stage, these characteristics were compared with scaling methods based on ranking judgments. Data from the study was collected from 266 teachers who served in public schools during the 2019-2020 school year. Data obtained in the study was analyzed by the scaling method with sorting judgments. As a result of the findings, being democratic in the life of culturally responsive teachers, thinking that students are different, being patient in the education and training process, knowing the student's past life, having an innovative perspective, giving importance to professional development, tending to live a loving life, it has been seen that they are listed as not being prejudiced, having universal values and being understanding towards the people around them. It has been proposed that the characteristics determined within the scope of the results obtained in the study should be acquired by teachers through in-service training, by the curriculum in teacher candidates and that teachers should be aware of practices culturally responsive teaching.

AB  - In view of certain sociocultural and economic meta-processes, workforce diversity or diversity management become an increasingly important entrepreneurial success factor. Yet, the scholarly examination of diversity in the tourism and hospitality sector is still in its infancy, a fact that applies to qualitative studies in particular. This article addresses the perception of diversity and diversity management within one of the world's leading aviation corporations, the Lufthansa Group. Following the methodological principles of qualitative social research, this study reports the results of a survey of Lufthansa flight attendants, a stakeholder group that interacts like no other in the area of overlap between the corporation and its customers. Specifically, the survey focuses on Lufthansa's diversity strategy-based on the principle of "value creation through appreciation" -and how it is perceived by representatives of the cabin crew, in an attempt to identify potential conflicts and prejudices that may arise in the face of employee heterogeneity.

TI  - From science to literature: The limits of Aldous Huxley's interdiscursive utopia
T2  - WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Throughout much of his writing career, Aldous Huxley contributed to the interdiscursive construction of literature as a utopia, a common ground between scientific and literary discourses. This article explores both the explications and limits of Huxley's interdiscursive utopia, focusing primarily but not exclusively on his most famous and highly ambiguous novel Brave New World (1932). Read against the background of pertinent criticism and contextualized in 1920s and 1930s debates about the changing prominence of science and the scientist in Britain, Huxley's enterprise manifests a considerable preserve of social prejudice and hierarchical thinking. This circumstance detracts substantially from the interdiscursivity of his utopia and compromises literature's claim to a holistic representation of social reality.

TI  - Post "Post-Truth": Still a Long Way to Go
T2  - REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE PHILOSOPHIE
LA  - English
AB  - After recalling the progress made in the diagnosis of the post-truth phenomenon, thanks to recent experimental findings (from cognitive and social psychology) and theoretical work (post-truth versus half-lies and propaganda, degrees in epistemic vice and scale of responsibility), we indicate four other ways to improve our awareness of the scope and mechanisms of post-truth: we introduce some qualifications so as to distinguish between a post-truth world and an Orwellian universe, the negative and positive sides of emotions, an utter contempt for facts, and the sharp dichotomy between facts and values, and between science denialism and blind scientism. Finally, objective truth being taken for granted, we make some suggestions for a "way out": we should be aware of our cognitive biases and of possible sources of manipulation, cultivate our epistemic virtues, and keep evidence as a prior demand. We should also work in a "scientific spirit," i.e., refuse any compromise with society, morality, or practice so as to ensure freedom of conscience within an academic and democratic "space of reasons." But even more urgently, we should avoid some still too frequent misunderstandings about truth itself and about knowledge (which we identify), and remember that post-truth is serious because it is a threat to reality itself: hence we should also take care of our metaphysical prejudices and work to find better ways of ensuring metaphysical knowledge.

AB  - The federal elections were held in Brazil in 2018. The ballot resulted in a victory for the far-right candidate, air Messias Bolsonaro. The question that arose after the victory of the far-right was: How could this have happened? One of the instruments that undoubtedly contributed to this unexpected victory was a peculiar aspect of his political campaign: memetic communication. Through the use of memes in the social media (above all WhatsApp), Bolsonaro's project transformed these violent discourses against political opponents, feminism, racialised persons and poverty into a series of discourses legitimised through humour and irony. It was a simplification through the memes affecting the static system of cognitive and metaphorical frameworks. During the pre-election period in 2018, we carried out digital ethnographic research in the WhatsApp groups of supporters of Bolsonaro's project ("Bolsonarism"). In this period, we collected a sample of 132 memes belonging to WhatsApp groups composed of up to 256 members, who did not know each other and were geographically dispersed. The analysis we carried out demonstrates the trivialisation and legitimisation of violence against political opponents and other social groups. Much of this legitimisation was camouflaged under the mask of supposed humour and irony, which in reality was insulting, prejudicial and dehumanising.

AB  - This special issue illustrates that the securitisation of migration is not a linear process but a spiralling phenomenon, which involves different actors, and their policies, practices and narratives, in a spiralling progression that both self-fulfils and reinforces migration-security nexus' dynamics. By proposing a cognitive ontology to understand the social construction of migration as a security threat, the introduction to this special issue proposes a categorisation of cognitions, mandates, constituencies and interests of state and non-state actors. Through a dichotomisation of these categories, it is possible to clarify how and why they either socially construct or deconstruct migration as a threat. In particular, the special issue identifies in prejudicial cognitions one of the main reasons for which a variety of actors enact practices and produce narratives that contribute to both securitising migration and reinforcing its nexus with crime, and the consequent social construction of 'migration crises'. The different contributions to this special issue prove the arguments here exposed with a different analysis of how migration has been dealt with at either governmental or non-governmental levels.

AB  - Background:
   The therapeutic itinerary is not limited to the identification and availability of health services offered, but relates to the different individual searches and sociocultural and economic possibilities of each patient. In this study, we discuss the therapeutic itinerary of transsexual people seeking healthcare, from the user's perspective.
   Objective:
   The aim of this study was to discuss the therapeutic itinerary of transsexual people seeking healthcare, from the user's perspective.
   Design and participants:
   Individual interviews were performed with 10 transsexuals at the Trans Space of a University Hospital of Pernambuco, using the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the theoretical reference and the Bardin's thematic content analysis as the reference methodological framework.
   Ethical considerations:
   This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the Federal University of Pernambuco under protocol no. 91284218.5.0000.5208.
   Findings:
   The comprehensive care for transsexual people was evidenced through four categories analyzed: low demand of transsexuals in health services; use of social name in health services; care permeated by prejudiced and discriminatory attitudes; and health system and professionals who are not able to meet transgender health issues.
   Discussion:
   Transsexual people are stigmatized and experience prejudice in their daily health, in a way they do not enjoy fundamental rights, as if they had fewer rights, or infringe the principle of universality of access to health. Thus, for effective and comprehensive care, the health team must keep up to date on the public policies existing in the healthcare of transsexual people and reconstruct what they understand by gender.
   Conclusion:
   Knowledge about the therapeutic itinerary of transgender people may support evaluation processes of health service networks to ensure the access to and reorganization of these services. Understanding this dynamic allows fostering discussions about the structure of health services at all care levels for the care of this population.

AB  - From the late 19th century, and especially during apartheid (1948-1994), Afrikaans became inextricably tied with white people, white domination and apartheid. This association has persisted after 1994, and calls to preserve Afrikaans are often derided with claims that the preference for Afrikaans is also a preference for racial segregation. In such anti-Afrikaans views, Afrikaans is seen as synonymous with white people and apartheid despite the fact that Afrikaans was never exclusively spoken by white people. This prejudice towards Afrikaans is also shown towards the Afrikaanse Taalmonument, which was unveiled in 1975 to commemorate this language.
   Using machine learning and a large dataset of social media posts from Instagram, we show that not only white people visit this monument to Afrikaans, but also take pictures here and post about it on one of the largest social media platforms. As such, we show that the interest in this monument - just like the language itself - is not exclusively tied to one race. We also make suggestions for further research, such as using machine learning for image recognition using social media datasets that could illuminate how other South African monuments are seen in the contemporary world.

AB  - Authoritarian predispositions and contextual threats are both thought to result in intolerance and prejudice towards immigrants and other minorities. Yet there is considerable dispute as to how authoritarianism and threat interact to produce an "authoritarian dynamic." Some scholars argue that threats increase intolerance by "galvanizing" authoritarians. Others claim that authoritarians are always intolerant toward outgroups, with threat instead "mobilizing" nonauthoritarians. Using experimental manipulations of immigrant cultural threat embedded in nationally representative samples from 19 European societies, this study offers a test of these competing hypotheses. While we find some evidence for the "galvanizing" hypothesis, we find no evidence for the "mobilizing" hypothesis. The effects vary considerably across national samples however, with immigrants from Muslim societies being particularly likely to activate authoritarian predispositions. These findings show how the migration of culturally distinctive groups has the potential to activate authoritarian dispositions, thereby pushing the issue of immigration to the center of political debates.

AB  - Background: Suicide is a serious social and public health problem. Social stigma and prejudice reduce the accessibility of mental health care services for high-risk groups, resulting in them not receiving interventions and committing suicide. A suicide prediction model is necessary to identify high-risk groups in the general population.
   Methods: We used national medical check-up data from 2009 to 2015 in Korea. The latest medical check-up data for each subject was set as an index point. Analysis was undertaken for an overall follow-up period (index point to the final tracking period) as well as for a one-year follow-up period. The training set was cross-validated fivefold. The predictive model was trained using a random forest algorithm, and its performance was measured using a separate test set not included in the training.
   Results: The analysis covered 372,813 individuals, with an average (SD) overall follow-up duration of 1.52 (1.52) years. When we predicted suicide during the overall follow-up period, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.849, sensitivity was 0.817, and specificity was 0.754. The performance of the predicted suicide risk model for one year from the index point was AUC 0.818, sensitivity 0.788, and specificity 0.657.
   Conclusions: This is probably the first suicide predictive model using machine learning based on medical check-up data from the general population. It could be used to screen high-risk suicidal groups from the population through routine medical check-ups. Future studies may test preventive interventions such as exercise and alcohol in these high-risk groups.

AB  - From 1974 to 1984, Democrat Lilly Fong (1925-2002) served on the Nevada Board of Regents, the first Chinese American woman to win an election in Nevada and to hold that position. Fong laid the foundation for Republican Cheryl Lau (b. 1944) to be elected as Nevada's secretary of state (19911994), the first Asian American to hold a major statewide office in Nevada. This study focuses on how and why these women emerged from the shadows into Nevada politics and suggests why they failed in later attempts to win an office. As second- and later-generation Chinese American women, they shared the strong Chinese cultural traditions, beliefs, and prejudices and were products of the changing role of education for women and the emergence of women in Chinese and Chinese American public life. They also were affected by the women's movement in the United States and the Chinese emphasis on education, which led them both to advanced degrees and teaching. Gender and racial discrimination, anti-Chinese legislation and attitudes, and history and cultural traditions, especially the belief that women should be confined to domestic activities, were among the many barriers they had to overcome. They became active at a time when Chinese American political organizations became more influential and widespread, especially in cities with large Chinatowns. They, like many of their generation, had historical role models and contemporary ones, including Democrats Patsy Mink (1927-2002) of Hawaii and March Fong Eu (1922-2017) of California (to name just two). They shared similar backgrounds, including parents who were active in the community, the financial support of their husbands, a concern for U.S.-China relations, and, from time to time, their appeal to the mainstream community. They both believed in the Confucian adage that "education is the equalizer of mankind." What they both lacked in their later campaign efforts were mentoring on tactics and the ability to quickly challenge negative media publicized by their opponents. They needed strong pan-Asian support, but, until 2000, Nevada had a small Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) population. They also needed broader support among voters of other races and ethnicities. Both women, who had female challengers at one point or another, lost to EuroAmerican women, which suggests that gender was not the major factor in those reelection failures. They had responded to the call for AAPI involvement in politics and, by their efforts, laid the foundations for recent successes of other AAPI women in Nevada and the West.

AB  - Did some early Christian groups worship the emperor or other Graeco-Roman gods? In his essay 'Going All the Way? Honouring the Emperor and Sacrificing Wives and Slaves in 1 Peter 2.13-3.6', Warren Carter has proposed a provocative reading of 1 Pet. 2.13-3.6, arguing that this author exhorts the audience to participate in cultic sacrifices to the emperor as part of a strategy to overcome the social-prejudice currently faced by the audience. In this article I offer an analysis of Carter's position, as well as offer a detailed response to his argument. I begin by responding to his suggestions regarding Paul, the Apocalypse of John and the Governor Pliny. This is followed by a detailed look at two specific strands of evidence in 1 Pet. 1.18 and 4.3 and the audience's experience of suffering, which indicate that Carter's thesis is mistaken.

AB  - The study aims to identify whether algorithmic decision making leads to unfair (i.e., unequal) treatment of certain protected groups in the recruitment context. Firms increasingly implement algorithmic decision making to save costs and increase efficiency. Moreover, algorithmic decision making is considered to be fairer than human decisions due to social prejudices. Recent publications, however, imply that the fairness of algorithmic decision making is not necessarily given. Therefore, to investigate this further, highly accurate algorithms were used to analyze a pre-existing data set of 10,000 video clips of individuals in self-presentation settings. The analysis shows that the under-representation concerning gender and ethnicity in the training data set leads to an unpredictable overestimation and/or underestimation of the likelihood of inviting representatives of these groups to a job interview. Furthermore, algorithms replicate the existing inequalities in the data set. Firms have to be careful when implementing algorithmic video analysis during recruitment as biases occur if the underlying training data set is unbalanced.

AB  - The two authors intend to underline the continuities and discontinuities that organize the Milan Approach, after the splitting from Selvini Palazzoli and Prata; they intend to tell the teachings of Luigi Boscolo and Gianfranco Cecchin from the beginning of training in 1978 till nowadays. After having spoken of some important stages in the work till the death of the two masters, the article underlines two major new aspects. 1. We speak about the corporeal turn: embodied experience as preconceptual know-how from which concepts are structured. We speak about the connections between bodies and social issues that enact forms of knowledge and understanding. 2. In this period of war, violence, and tyranny, we speak about epistemology and ontology as complementary stances: the need to let others disclose themselves, by allowing them to speak their own terms of engagement. The therapeutic effort is one of deactivating the dangers of one's own presuppositions and prejudices that limit one's capacity to describe and make hypothesis. There are social ontologies, communities with strong moral intensity, historical and social realities that need therapists to take position, since they need to take side and be aware of the categories they utilize. Historical and social ontology deals with the continuous change of symptoms in connection to the continuous change of the social panorama in the context we live in. We live by the bodies we are.

TI  - Moxibustion therapy on myofascial pain syndrome An evidence-based clinical practice guideline
T2  - MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - moxibustion clinical practice guideline
KW  - myofascial pain syndrome
AB  - Background: Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a chronic systemic pain disorder. Among the common treatments, moxibustion has an irreplaceable therapeutic effect and is an effective Traditional Chinese Medicine therapy for MPS. However, the lack of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has prompted the publication of guidelines on the use of moxibustion in the treatment of MPS. Methods: The clinical practice guideline will base on the Institute of Medicine, the World Health Organization guideline handbook, the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II, Reporting Items for practice, Guideline in Healthcare and recommendations thereof will be made on the basis of systematic reviews. We will establish a guidelines development team that will draft clinical questions in the form of population, intervention, comparison, results and conduct a literature search and quality of evidence assessment. The experts will make recommendations after 2 or 3 rounds of Delphi investigations. We will carefully consider the patient's values and preferences and conduct a peer review. Ethics and dissemination: The guidelines will not contain any personal data and will not prejudice individual rights, so no ethical approval will be required. The guidelines will be subject to rigorous peer review and may be published in a journal or circulated at relevant conferences. Results: The guidelines will be published in relevant peer-reviewed journals. Conclusion: This guideline will make it easier for clinicians to treat MPs in the clinical setting and improve the effectiveness of treatment for MPS. Study registration: The study is registered with the International Practice Guideline Registry Platform (IPGRP): IPGRP-2020CN030

AB  - Previous research highlights that important differences exist between victim groups, but the impact victim status can have on perceptions of police legitimacy remains underexplored. The following paper contributes to this body of literature by utilizing the National Security and Preparedness Survey (NSPS, 2011-2012) to explore the risk/protective factors for victimization and differences between prejudice motivated crime (PMC) victims, non-PMC victims and non-victims in the Australian context, using Multinomial Logit Regression models. This study provides new insights into key differences between victim groups and perceptions of government and police legitimacy in the victimization context.

AB  - When the Australian Association of Adult Education (AAAE) was established in 1960, Australia was locked into a global conflict between capitalism and communism, known as the Cold War. With anti-communism at fever pitch, AAAE's founders who were fighting to retain some influence with Australian universities and with government funding authorities needed an origin story which would appeal to these prejudices. Not surprisingly, therefore, histories of 'the profession' produced in the first decades largely dismissed the role of the many radical adult educators and left-wing organisations which had been instrumental in extending adult education to the working class in the first half of the twentieth century. One of the main sources for these early histories was a memoir of David Stewart, founder of the Workers Education Association, written in 1957 by a university adult educator, Esmonde McDonald Higgins. In this paper, I tell a different story, through a close examination of Higgins' own role in this early history, to show how 1960s 'official' adult education lost touch with its own roots in radical working class politics, roots which are only now re-emerging, through the study of popular education and social movement learning.

AB  - This paper examines anti-Muslim sentiment in America. Existing research has documented rising hostility to Muslims in Western countries, but has been much less clear about what drives such sentiments or exactly what sort of "other" Muslims are understood to be. Our interest is in the cultural construction of Muslims as a problematic or incompatible "other." We explore the extent, content, and correlates of such views. Building from recent work in critical race theory and the study of cultural boundaries in national belonging, we argue that Muslims are distinct in being culturally excluded on religious, racial, and civic grounds at the same time. Using nationally representative survey data with specially designed measures on views of Muslims and other groups, we show that nearly half of Americans embrace some form of anti-Muslim sentiment, and that such views are systematically correlated with social location and with understandings of the nature of American belonging.

AB  - People rely on their lay theories, or mindsets, to make meaning of their experience in intercultural contact. Given that proficiency in the local language is a crucial social marker of immigrants' integration, we argue that language mindsets (i.e., beliefs about whether language learning ability is fixed or changeable) guide members of the receiving society to make inferences about immigrants' language ability (e.g., "can immigrants improve their language ability?"). This social inference, in turn, predicts their willingness to interact with immigrants and support immigrants' language education. In a correlational study (n = 231) and an experimental study (n = 106), we investigated whether and how language mindsets influence participants' support for immigrants' intercultural contact. We found that trait and experimentally-induced fixed (vs. growth) mindsets led to negative judgments of immigrants' potential to develop their skills in the local language, which in turn predicted avoidance of contact with migrants and opposition to governmental funding of immigrants' language education. The effects held even after controlling for participants' political orientations, perceived difficulties of the English language, and judgments of target immigrants' language fluency. These findings suggest that promoting growth mindsets about language ability can lead to more positive intercultural attitudes that impact the acceptance of migrants. We discussed the implications of language mindsets for understanding the processes of intercultural communication and forming positive intercultural relations.

KW  - Violence against women
AB  - Violence against women is one of the main forms of violation of human rights. According to the World Health Organization, Brazil ranks 5th in the countries that kill the most women in the world in the domestic and family context. This violence stems from a prejudiced, discriminatory, patriarchal, sexist and racist culture. To combat it, it is necessary, in addition to effective public policies, the integration of the Public Power with the areas of education, through educational actions that disseminate human rights and the ethical values of unrestricted respect for the dignity of the human person with the perspective of gender. In this sense, by means of a bibliographic survey, with a critical analysis of the theme addressed, this work aims to highlight the importance of sex education and the promotion of gender equity in the educational process of learning and socialization, concluding that this education contributes with the formation of critical thinking and with social development and collaborates with the construction of an egalitarian culture, with gender equality and facing all forms of violence, discrimination and prejudice against women.

AB  - This paper analyzed how the teacher can use the representativeness of women from Brazilian history as a methodological strategy, aiming to contribute to minimizing the impacts caused by ethnic and racial prejudices and limitations of gender roles. The hypothesis was that, taking female representativeness to the school environment, inequalities between genders can be minimized with the recognition and identification of female protagonism in important Brazilian historical moments, commonly related only to the male gender. The methodology used approached the story of historical characters portrayed in a book by means of a cards game with audio resources and field observations, reaching the qualitative result of improving students' self-esteem, self-image, and school performance, concluding that prejudice, coupled with gender-limiting roles, and low self-esteem can be factors associated with poor school performance and body image disorders.

AB  - As educational institutions, Spanish universities today involve a diversity of subjects inhabiting them, which supports the imperative of turning schools into more inclusive communities. This study attempts a preliminary determination of the existence of racial and cultural prejudices and stereotyped beliefs about African immigrants in a sample of education students at the Autonomous University of Madrid. A quantitative, non-experimental, descriptive-exploratory study was performed with a sample of education students. Subtle and manifest racism scales and the scale of stereotyped beliefs about Africa and Africans were administered. The statistical analysis shows that people who identify with left-wing political ideologies have fewer stereotypes about Africa and less manifest and subtle racism, while people with right-wing or centre ideologies, or who argued that they do not identify with any ideology, revealed similar levels of subtle racism. The results of the study highlight the fact that education students have subtle and manifest prejudices, as well as stereotyped beliefs about African immigrants.

AB  - Background: Functional mobility (FM) is the person's ability to move to accomplish daily living tasks and activities. FM limitations are common in Parkinson's disease, increase with disease progression, and can be highly disabling. Although several studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) field use this concept, only recently, a formal definition has been proposed.
   Objective: We aimed to explore patient's and health professional's perspectives of FM in PD.
   Methods: A focus group methodology has been used. Four focus groups, with a total of 10 patients and 10 health professionals, were performed. Six patients were early stage and four advanced stage. The health professional's group was composed of five neurologists and five physiotherapists. The suitability of the new concept, the impact of FM limitations in PD patient's daily routine, and the potential benefit of walking aids have been discussed.
   Results: All participants were able to provide a spontaneous definition of FM, matching with the proposed concept. All agreed that PD affects patient's FM, increasing the limitations with disease progression, and with the existence of a serious prejudice with walking aids that hinders its use. Early-stage patient's perspective seems to be more in line with neurologist's perspective, while the views of advanced-stage patients were closer to physiotherapist's views.
   Conclusion: FM concept was considered as intuitive and useful. FM limitations have an important physical and social impact in the advanced stage of the disease. Although patients and health professionals acknowledge walking aid's benefit improving patient's FM, the prejudice associated with this type of tools limits its recommendation and use.

AB  - Most research on sexual prejudice explicitly or implicitly assumes that an individual's sexual orientation identity is known to observers. However, there has been little large-scale survey evidence examining differential rates of disclosure among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals, and there remains much to be studied as to why and when LGB individuals choose to disclose their sexual identity to others. Using data from a nationally representative sample of LGB Americans (N = 1,085), we assess the contexts and conditions under which LGB individuals disclose their sexual identities. Results show that bisexual women and men are significantly less likely to disclose their sexual identity across several important social domains, such as family and the workplace. This disclosure gap is partially explained by measures of identity commitment but surprisingly not by measures of perceived social acceptance. We discuss implications of these findings for sexuality and identity research.

AB  - Article 8 of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities requires governments around the globe to raise awareness on issues of disability in their societies, combatting stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices. Little comparative data is available on lay people's social representations of intellectual disability and associated stigma, which could inform actions in line with the convention. The present study compared intellectual disability literacy and stigma among adults in the general population in the UK, Austria and Germany (N = 1046), and examined the effects of providing an intellectual disability label on these outcomes. Although participants came from highly developed European countries and prior contact with people with intellectual disabilities was common, the findings pointed to some striking differences between countries. Participants in Austria and Germany were much less likely than those in the UK to identify symptoms of a possible intellectual disability in an unlabelled vignette. They were also much more hostile towards social contact, a difference that was maintained when participants were informed of the intellectual disability label. Labelling showed controversial effects on stigma, both in its effects on social distance and on beliefs about suitable causes and interventions. Overall, the social acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities appears to be much less advanced in Austria and Germany than in the UK, and awareness of intellectual disability much lower, indicating a need for action at societal level.

AB  - Social adjustment, and feeling isolated, is one of the critical issues faced by the Hijra's from our society, due to sexual prejudices and stigmas. However, no one bothers how they actually feel, how they see themselves? The idea behind the paper is to identify the impact of looking-glass self (self-concept) on happiness, self-esteem, and satisfaction with life, among transgender from Hijra community, to accentuate the reality of how they feel, what is their self-concept, and its relationship with the mentioned constructs. The current study was conducted in India; snowball sampling is used to contact the respondents of the mentioned category, and variance-based structural equation modeling techniques on second-order construct, using two-stage approach, were used to study the relationships between the constructs used for the current study. The outcome of the study depicts that there is a presence of significant relationships between the mentioned variables, which show that the respondents are strongly maintaining their self-concept but that does not mean anyway that they are also happy and enjoying the social treatment given to them. This study is for the social workers, government as well as for the society, who pretends as a flag bearer of quality and promotes diversity in India. It will be an eye-opener for all those who really want to support such marginalized community as they have already achieved a place in the gender column under the gender category as other "Third Gender." The current study is original and contributes in understanding the truth behind the real journey of the mentioned community. How they feel, what they expect is still untapped; this paper will raise voice for them to contribute in respectful living in Indian society.

AB  - I shall discuss, from a personal perspective, research on risk perception that has created an understanding of the dynamic interplay between an appreciation of risk that resides in us as a feeling and an appreciation of risk that results from analysis. In some circumstances, feelings reflect important social values that deserve to be considered along with traditional analyses of physical and economic risk. In other situations, both feelings and analyses may be shaped by powerful cognitive biases and deep social and partisan prejudices, causing nonrational judgments and decisions. This is of concern if risk analysis is to be applied, as it needs to be, in managing existential threats such as pandemic disease, climate change, or nuclear weapons amidst a divisive political climate.

AB  - Around one-sixth of the European population have a disability, yet there are few self-declared disabled politicians. Despite scholarly and political interest in the under-representation of various social groups, little attention has been paid to disabled people. This article identifies and analyses the barriers to elected office faced by disabled people by drawing upon interviews with 51 candidates and elected politicians in the United Kingdom. It reveals barriers which occur throughout the political recruitment process, from initial participation to selection and the election campaign. They broadly fall into: (a) a lack ofaccessibility, including the built environment and documents; (b) a lack ofresourcesto make events and activities accessible; and (c)ableism, including openly expressed prejudices but also a lack of awareness and willingness to make processes inclusive. While people with different impairments encounter some distinct barriers, all of them have similar experiences of obstacles and exclusion which go beyond those faced by people from other under-represented groups seeking elected office.

AB  - Response instructions-inviting participants to respond from a certain perspective-can significantly influence the performance and construct validity of psychological measures. Stereotype Content Model (SCM) and then the BIAS map ("behaviors from intergroup affect and stereotypes") were originally developed as universal measures of shared cultural stereotypes-participants' perceptions of what most of the people in a society think about the target group-and their related social-structural antecedents, emotions and behavioral tendencies. Yet a number of studies have adopted a different response instruction focusing on individual stereotypes-what the participants personally think about the target group. So far, there is little evidence to suggest how these two different response instructions (individual vs. shared cultural perspective) might influence the performance of the BIAS map, especially when applied to target groups that elicit different normative and social desirability concerns. To provide novel evidence, we conducted an experiment with a representative sample of ethnic Slovaks (N= 1269). In a 2 x 2 factorial design, we found response instruction (individual vs. shared cultural perspective) and target group [stigmatized ethnic minority (the Roma) vs. non-stigmatized ethnic minority (the Hungarians)] had significant effects on the BIAS map and their interaction had significant effects on the social structure and behavioral tendencies (but not on stereotypes and emotions) scales. Exploratory analysis also points to partial influence on the mediation hypothesis underlying the BIAS map and minor effects on its scale properties. Our evidence suggests that the difference between individual stereotypes and shared cultural stereotypes partially depends on the target group in question and that they should be treated as two potentially separate constructs.

KW  - Greece
AB  - This paper explores the link between memory and history 'from below' as well as the (non-) use of histories of past migration in Greece. It analyses how the memory of the 1920s Asia Minor refugees was guarded by Greek state over the course of time. It explores how state agents (historiography, education system, commemorations, etc.) acted as guardians of collective memory 'from above', presenting a rosy past that ignored the experiences of these refugees in Greece. It also examines how this process of constructing historical memory 'from above' (re)produced national belonging through homogeneity, without taking notice of refugees' diversities or problems faced during their settlement in the social, cultural or economic space of Greece. The paper adopts a critical approach to the cultural and social spaces in which refugee memory was selectively constructed as the only past that has to be remembered, stored and recalled, and aims to rescue from oblivion memories that were condemned to silence in the contemporary national narrative. These silenced memories could help us to write a history 'from below' and find analogies with the experiences of contemporary refugee flows as well as to combat ever-present xenophobia, prejudice and racism in the present society.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflect the relationship among social, economic, and environmental aspects of society. Massive online open courses (MOOCs) represent an opportunity to promote lifelong learning (SDG 4), complementing university education or providing knowledge to society free and openly. The objective of this work is to analyze experiences in one MOOC about wastewater treatment applied to higher education in civil engineering (SDG 6). The proposed educational methodology and the achieved participation results are studied. The MOOC had three editions and was hosted on the Miriadax platform. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, initial motivation, and satisfaction level were collected from questionnaires. The results highlighted the importance of design decisions to obtain a high completion rate: defining a target audience, without prejudice to the course's open character, where the prior knowledge of students is crucial. The teaching methodology is based on autonomous and progressive learning, with short and direct master classes, social support, with the motivation of students to continue their training with opening complementary topics in the forums, following up on their doubts, and their combination with social networks.

AB  - Drawing on data from interviews with twenty-five German citizens, this paper aims to shed some light on the migration experience of contemporary middle-class Germans who migrated to the United States. The interview data suggest that while these individuals have achieved successful socioeconomic integration and do not encounter discrimination or negative prejudices, they exhibit a strong sense of their German identity, rejecting such common labels such as "immigrant," "expatriate," or "German American." Instead, they continue to negotiate their identity as "Germans living in America." Like most immigrants, they engage in "transnational activities"; however, in contrast to the transnational activities sought out by unskilled migrants and global elites, these migrants tend to favor personal, social, or cultural activities over economic or political activities.

AB  - This article describes a new method of participatory arts-based research in which poets and social scientists form a collaborative research collective. This collaborative poetics method harnesses participants' skills and knowledge to produce innovative, creative pieces, which can deepen understandings of social scientific issues and communicate this knowledge in engaging, accessible ways. The method was developed in a pilot study in which seven young spoken word poets and one poet/social scientist explored their lived experiences of discrimination. These experiences were elucidated through poetic autoethnographies, which were disseminated in a chapbook and live spoken word performance. Audience feedback indicated that the autoethnographies were powerful and thought provoking. For the co-researchers, the project was a transformative experience, facilitating changes in their focus, exploration, and communication of issues around discrimination and encouraging them to respond differently to instances of discrimination, prejudice, or abuse. The pilot study thus provides strong, preliminary support for the value of the collaborative poetics method.

AB  - In the thought-provoking papers that constitute 'Stranger Races: Reflections on Alterity in Constructions of the Self', the authors make clear that our always already social confrontation with alterity is complex, multifaceted and context sensitive. They also make clear that thinking about alterity is a central, if not the central, element of anthropological study, an endeavour that sheds light on such socially destructive forces as primitivism, essentialism, racism, and ethnic and religious discrimination. In the essays, the authors also stress, albeit indirectly, that the dynamic linkages between self and other cannot be reduced a set of rules or an abstract formula. Indeed, the tangled nature of processes that play out in the construction of identity cry out for ethnographic elaboration. For me, the most important contribution that the authors make devolves from their exploration of the turbulent conceptual space between self and other. It is the space between self and other that is important to explore. As the essays in this special issue demonstrate, in the creative space between self and other, we are able to extend anthropological practice to the public domain in order to showcase alternatives to xenophobia and prejudice and to advocate for social practices that celebrate mutual respect. That is a path that leads to a powerfully productive anthropological future.

KW  - WOMEN
AB  - The reception and study of pre-Conquest legal texts can never be fully disentangled from the historical and political contexts within which they transpired. Indeed, the historiography of early English law has been shaped as much by the desires, prejudices and ideological commitments of its historians as it has by the texts themselves. Modern scholarship has not 'risen above' its predecessors but is instead guided (and at times governed) by the history of the laws' reception from the post-Conquest period onwards. The boundaries of the Old English legal corpus are far more fluid than often recognized and its survival has been determined by political forces and social trends that reshaped and recontextualized it in ways that those involved in its composition may not have intended or even understood. To better understand how the modern study of Anglo-Saxon legal culture has been and continues to be shaped by these influences, this article first outlines a brief history of the reception of early English legal texts from the Conquest onwards before turning to a review of the major themes and trends in contemporary scholarship. As will become apparent, for modern scholars, the interpretation of legal records, the historical narrative they appear to construct and even the parameters of the corpus itself have all been shaped by the nostalgia, biases and scholarly priorities of their predecessors.

AB  - Purpose of Review HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a safe and effective preventive intervention that could play a central role in ending the HIV epidemic. However, low uptake in general, and among certain social groups in particular, underscores the need to identify and address barriers to PrEP use. PrEP stigma has emerged as a key factor interfering with PrEP interest, uptake, and continuation. The purpose of this article is to describe and contextualize PrEP stigma and to offer recommendations on how to address it in future PrEP implementation initiatives. Recent Findings PrEP users are commonly stereotyped as sexually irresponsible, promiscuous, and immoral. These stereotypes and associated prejudice manifest at multiple levels and discourage PrEP interest and uptake, disrupt PrEP adherence, and motivate PrEP discontinuation. Intersecting forms of stigma may influence the nature, magnitude, and impact of PrEP stigma across social groups and otherwise hinder PrEP use. Current PrEP implementation strategies that narrowly focus on risk and target stigmatized groups with disproportionately high HIV incidence have yielded limited success and are counterproductive to the extent that they perpetuate stigma. Implementation strategies involving more inclusive messaging and further integration of PrEP within healthcare may help to reduce PrEP stigma and mitigate its impact, ultimately increasing PrEP use. PrEP stigma is a barrier to PrEP interest, uptake, and continuation that manifests at multiple levels. Understanding and addressing PrEP stigma requires consideration of its origins and intersections. Targeted, risk-focused implementation strategies perpetuate stigma and undermine use.

AB  - When the state of emergency was declared in Tokyo, it was less a mandatory order than a request for cooperation and for jishuku (self-restraint). Along with the ambiguous status of such a request in a time of pandemic, this confusion was further compounded by uneven enforcement. While wealthier, middle class areas were left relatively unpatrolled, the areas around the redlight district of Kabuki-cho in Shinjuku, Tokyo, were very strictly monitored despite the lack of any conclusive data at that time regarding the infection patterns or rates. In targeting workers in the "night business," the Tokyo Metropolitan Government reenacted centuries old prejudices against those working the sex trades. This paper focuses on how the advent of COVID-19 affected the lives of people working in the settai (business entertainment) industry, in particular hostesses in hostess bars, kyabajo (hostesses in clubs), and male hosts. Their voices tell us how, through the government's actions as well as mass media and social media discourse surrounding their work, these laborers were stigmatized, resulting in a worsening of their already precarious positions as they have been expected to do difficult and increasingly dangerous work, almost always without any contract or insurance protection, in a time of pandemic.

AB  - To survive in the long term, business needs to profit, controlling environmental impacts with social responsibility. Sustainability programs involve the integration of social and environmental issues in business models and organizational processes. The assessment of sustainability programs is a problem of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This work presents applications of MCDA for the assessment of sustainability programs in the textile industry. Applied methods for MCDA are analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for the order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The reasons to apply AHP and TOPSIS include providing an assessment index, ranging from 0 to 1, and that the MCDA model is expected to have more criteria than alternatives. Therefore, an application of other methods, such as data envelopment analysis, could be prejudiced. Concepts from the triple bottom line, economic, social as well as environmental criteria were inserted in the proposed model. Sustainability programs of six leading companies from the Brazilian textile industry were evaluated. The main finding of the research is that AHP and TOPSIS resulted in similar evaluations for sustainability programs. Both methods resulted in the same rank of alternatives. However, with TOPSIS, companies' sustainability indices were more disperse, varying from 0.10 to 0.92 against a range from 0.23 to 0.69 with AHP.

AB  - This article proposes to observe the relationship between the legacy of Constantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht in Brazil, from the 1950s to the present, demarking the influences of both in the transformation of acting practices in the country as established from two moments: first, the construction of an inaugural epic mode of acting in the left-wing experience of the theatre company Teatro de Arena in Sao Paulo from 1953 to 1972; and second, the "new" acting of performers in contemporary variations on a public, democratic, and experimental theatre in dialogue with the social and political dilemmas of Brazil, specifically in Cia Livre, Cia Bartolomeu, and Cia Sao Jorge. This analysis will enable us to discuss how the arrival of Brecht merged with the dissemination of Stanislavski's newly introduced practices in the country, in a conjunction that led to the invention of a hybridized and particularly Brazilian way of acting. We will also examine how the re-emergence of a political theatre, after the slow reopening of the country in the late 1980s that succeeded the Brazilian Civilian-Military Coup in 1964, brought back the "need for Brecht" as well as the "need for Stanislavski", both of which were embraced by the young artists of the national theatre without prejudice towards specific acting styles. Thereafter, we can glimpse contributions of what we consider to be the inherent plasticity of Brecht and Stanislavski's legacies to the mutability of the art of acting.

AB  - The stereotype that older adults are forgetful is pervasive and leads to age-related prejudice and discrimination. We aimed to explore the influence of ego-depletion on forgetful stereotyping of older adults. Our participants were 65 adult college students (females = 23, mean age = 21.5 years, SD = 0.19 years). They engaged in ego-depletion/non-depletion tasks and stereotype self-report measures successively. Using a Stroop mismatch test and task measuring the level of stereotyping the older adults as forgetful, our findings following t-test between group comparison indicated individuals in a state of ego-depletion would judge the older adults as more forgetful than those not in this state. This result suggests that ego-depletion is related to increased stereotyping of the older adults as forgetful.

AB  - There remains a limited understanding of current levels of transgender-related knowledge and acceptance among members of the general public. This study sought to develop and psychometrically evaluate a transgender knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (T-KAB) scale in the general US population. We developed and evaluated the reliability and validity of the T-KAB scale in two phases. In phase one, we developed the T-KAB scale through a robust, iterative process that included a literature review; expert feedback from cisgender and transgender professionals engaged in psychometrics and transgender health; review of prior qualitative interviews with transgender individuals, healthcare providers with a range of experience caring for transgender patients, and members of the general population; and pilot testing. In phase two, a geographically diverse convenience sample of 195 adults recruited online from the US general population completed the T-KAB scale and measures to assess scale validity. Factor analyses revealed a 22-item, 3-factor measure representing: acceptance of the gender spectrum, social tolerance, and comfort and contact related to transgender people. The scale demonstrated strong internal consistency (alpha = .97) and evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. Additionally, members of the general population were found to have moderate levels of transgender acceptance overall and across the three subscales. The T-KAB scale is a valid and reliable psychometric tool. Future application of the scale should seek to identify socio-demographic, cultural, and geographic factors driving lower T-KAB scores in order to identify subpopulations that would benefit from interventions to improve transgender-related knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs in the general population.

AB  - There's a growing recognition by scholars that local-indigenous knowledge can make important contributions to both disaster risk reduction and managing environmental change. This paper interrogated the local-indigenous knowledge and practices of the Mamanwa indigenous peoples in Basey, Samar, after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November 2013. Data for this study were drawn from ethnographic fieldwork from late 2018 to early 2020. This paper is broken up into three parts. The first part presents how Mamanwas utilize their local-indigenous knowledge in times of disaster in relation to 1) emergency evacuation and post-Haiyan relocation; 2) food and livelihood security strategies; 3) weather forecasts from animals, and 4) celestial bodies, and 5) the role of community elders as local hazard forecasters. Next, the study analyzes the lack of regard to integrate local-indigenous knowledge into disaster risk reduction (DRR) state policies such as the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act and the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act as well as the low regard on local-indigenous knowledge of non-indigenous people manifested in social prejudice and discrimination. Despite these, local DRR practitioners find innovative ways to integrate local-indigenous knowledge in local programs and activities. Following Haiyan, the elderly Mamanwas also dedicated special activities to ensure the transmission and pres-ervation of their local-indigenous knowledge in the younger members of their community. The authors argue that in addition to the inclusion and better articulation of local-indigenous knowledge in relevant State policies, the meaningful participation of local communities including Indigenous Peoples should be the focus of local DRR actors.

AB  - This article examines dozens of textual artifacts from 1985 to 2018 that illustrate the significant cultural place that Poe's "The Masque of the Red Death" occupied as a touchstone during the early years and subsequent decades of the AIDS crisis as its plot, characters, and imagery became useful vehicles for thinking through numerous issues around the epidemic and for supporting various positions in the social and political debates that developed. A consideration of how these works use "Masque" to reinforce or confront their times' prejudices, to advocate for political resistance and activism, and to address individual and collective grief provides the opportunity to understand how Poe's writing serves its future audiences in ways that its author and its earlier readers could never have imagined.

AB  - The minority stress model describes the unique stressors that impact sexual and gender minorities above and beyond general stressors and includes both external (distal) and internal (proximal) sources of stress. Proximal stressors are the thoughts and feelings that are elicited and maintained because of direct and indirect experiences with prejudice events and are typically conceptualized to include anticipated stigma, internalized transphobia, and gender identity concealment. Recently, gender dysphoria has been proposed as a proximal stressor due to its interactive nature with both external triggers and mental health symptoms. However, gender dysphoria has not been tested empirically in prior published models of gender minority stress. Trans and nonbinary participants (N = 297) over the age of 18 were recruited via postings on social networking websites. Participants identified as trans feminine (n = 128), trans masculine (n = 110), nonbinary (n = 49), and agender (n = 10), and ranged in age from 18 to 67 (M = 28, SD = 9.42). Through a confirmatory factor analysis, it was shown that internalized transphobia, anticipated stress, gender identity concealment, and gender dysphoria reflect the latent factor proximal stress. Findings from this study suggest that gender dysphoria should be understood as a proximal stressor. As such, clinical interventions that target how individuals internalize experiences in a cisnormative society could have a positive impact on the severity of gender dysphoria. Additionally, modeling gender dysphoria as a proximal stressor can help future research disaggregate gender dysphoria from negative mental health symptoms such as anxiety or rumination.

AB  - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) has a prevalence rate of 2.4 % among U.S. adults; however, little is known about BDD among sexual minority men. Minority stressors (fear of rejection, sexual orientation concealment, internalized homophobia, discrimination/prejudice) may be risk factors for BDD in this population. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to estimate the occurrence of BDD in a sample of sexual minority men and investigate associations between minority stressors and BDD. Participants were recruited via social media, and survey data were collected from 268 sexual minority adolescent boys and adult men (M = 24.59 years, SD = 5.37 years). Regression models included either positive BDD screen or levels of BDD symptoms as dependent variables and the four aforementioned minority stressors as explanatory variables. The occurrence rate of positive BDD screens was 49.3 %. Gay-related rejection sensitivity and sexual orientation concealment were uniquely associated with greater BDD symptoms, and sexual orientation concealment was uniquely associated with greater odds of positive BDD screens. Given the high occurrence of positive BDD screens in the current sample, compared to the national prevalence, sexual minority stressors may be worthy to explore in etiological models of BDD in this population.

AB  - Migrations have become an important factor in social stability. Caused either by extreme circumstances or increasing professional mobility they affect the life of both local people and newcomers. Local and migrant population live side by side and inevitably share and exchange their experience. The locals have distrustful attitudes towards refugees and vice versa. The role of social prejudices, so-called cliches, turns out to be significant if not crucial. The authors scrutinize migrants' stereotypical images of the Urals and its provincial population and compare them with cliches that the population of the Urals had about evacuated people. Both evacuees and locals perceived each other as 'strangers. It is concluded on the factors determining Soviet people's prejudices such as lack culture, ethnical differences, low living standards and low mobility. The article deals with the nature of domestic and ethnic, often antisemitic, conflicts. Another point of the research is to find out if there is a way to overcome the stereotypes impeding the atmosphere of trust and social solidarity. The experience of the Soviet people lived in the rear during the Soviet-German war shows some paths towards social stability. In the case of the USSR, the elimination of cliches was due to the national-scale tragedy of the war and the sense of common grief as well as to the single economic market and internationalist politics of the Soviet government. The subject matter of the article lies at the intersection of social and military history. The study is based on published and archival materials. Among primary sources, there are archival documents, memoirs and personal diaries, former Soviet residents' interviews and memoirs. Some of the materials have been published or filmed in documentaries.

AB  - Rape is the most demoralizing type of crime violating human rights worldwide. Research has primarily focused on children and women's experiences of rape, even though victims include men and little documentation available concerning their experiences of reporting these incidents. The study aimed to investigate men's experiences when reporting rape to the police. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to collect and analyze qualitative data from a purposive sample of eleven men who were rape victims. The findings of the study revealed three superordinate and twenty-two subordinate themes. First, motivation for reporting rape to the police included self-protection from re-victimization, being killed, and prevalent prison cultural practice, seeking justice and answers for rape, moral duty, family support, and encouraging reports of the crime. Second, perceived barriers for reporting rape included fear of stigmatization and ridicule, unknown perpetrators, internalized homophobia, men's preconceived prejudices, perceived justice system delays, fear of being killed, and protecting their reputation. Third, negative experiences when reporting rape included a long waiting period at the reception before opening a case file and the delayed responses of police investigating the rape scene. Also, there was discouragement from the police, disparaging behavior of police, victim-blaming, lack of communication with the victim about case progress and experiences of police homosexual intolerance. The findings show that most men were motivated to report rape to the police despite the perceived barriers and negative experiences they had with the police. Thus, this provides baseline evidence for strategies to be developed to encourage the reporting of rape. Each police station must provide dedicated personnel for professional and sensitive handling of all rape victims, including men. Furthermore, future studies should be conducted to evaluate rape victims' satisfaction with the services provided by the police.

AB  - Transgender (trans) women are at higher risk of sexual violence than cisgender women, with trans women of color reported to be at highest risk. This study examined subjective experiences of sexual violence for 31 trans women of color living in Australia, average age 29 (range 18-54), through in-depth interviews. An additional photovoice activity and follow-up interviews were completed by 19 women. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis and feminist intersectionality theory, identifying the following themes. The first theme, "'A sexually tinged violation of boundaries': Defining sexual violence," examined women's definition of sexual violence, including staring and verbal abuse, nonconsensual touching and sexual assault, in both public and private contexts. The second theme, "'Crossing people's boundaries': Sexual harassment in the public domain," examined the frequent sexual harassment women experienced in their daily lives. This included the subtheme, "A hostile gaze: Public staring and 'weird looks'" and "Mockery and transphobic abuse: Verbal abuse is sexual violence." The third theme, "'Crossing bodily boundaries': Experiences of sexual assault," included the subthemes "'Unwanted sexual touch': Groping and forced sex by strangers," "Danger in relationships: Sexual assault and manipulation," "Sexual violence in the context of sex work," and "'We're turned into something we're not': Fetishization and the sexual other." The poor health outcomes experienced by many trans women are closely associated with their exposure to sexual violence and the social inequities and transphobia to which they are subjected. Trans women of color may experience additional prejudice and discrimination due to the intersection of gender, sexuality, race, and social class. Our research suggests that understanding these intersectionalities is integral in understanding the sexual violence experiences of trans women of color.

TI  - Paiens unt dreit? Reversed dichotomy and the East inBoeve de HaumtoneandBevis of Hampton
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - It is usually accepted that Saracens are evil and Christians are good in medieval narratives. The common medieval thought towards binary opposition can be pointed out by theChanson de Roland:'paiens unt tort e Chrestiens unt dreit'. However, it seems that there is religious prejudice and ignorance towards the Saracens and their geographical location, the East. The Anglo-NormanBoeve de Haumtoneis an early medieval narrative that focuses on cross-cultural interaction within a framework that combines political, social and religious events with geographical exploration both in the East and the West. Similarly,Bevis of Hamptonis the Middle English version that reshapes the socio historical and religious events on which their sources have focused. The aim of this article is to explore the idea that another East existed during the Middle Ages. This article will address the question of what relationBoeve de Haumtone and Bevis of Hampton mighthave to crusading geography. It will be argued how and why the East is not portrayed as a scary, evil place as it is in other contemporary romances, and the evidence for this may be presented by the hero's preference for living in the East for the rest of his life.

AB  - COVID-19 is unique in that it is spread through everyday contact with other people. Therefore, social protective measures, beyond medical protective measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, border closures, and human tracing are initiated to control the spread of COVID-19. Such responses have produced secondary issues such as drastic changes in people's way of life and work, housing instability, economic shock, and privacy issues. This paper examines the four domains of urban and regional issues related to the secondary impact of COVID-19, including (1) social distancing, urban structure, community, and density; (2) housing affordability; (3) lockdowns, border closures, reshoring, and regional economic recovery; and (4) smart city technology, contact tracing, and privacy. The following six recommendations have been proposed. First, institutional and cultural factors are more important than urban features, such as population density. To handle infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it is important to build systems, technology, infrastructure, and urban structures that can strengthen resilience instead of implementing a directionless policy of dispersion. Second, it is necessary to improve accessibility to essential services at the community level, including medical facilities and food supply. Third, continuous effort should be made to boost housing affordability, as it is directly related to people's basic life. Fourth, measures are needed to protect those people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. There is also the need to restore global trade and economic relations. Fifth, since data technology-based COVID-19 control raises the human tracing and privacy issue, we must ensure the principles of privacy management, such as transparency and voluntary consent, are being met. Finally, since COVID-19 is spread through people, individuals may become anxious and fearful of others without grounds; this may increase prejudice and hatred, including xenophobia. Significant social effort is needed to overcome such ill-defined anxiety and fear and maintain a healthy civil society.

AB  - The current transnational climate (British Council, 2014) in Europe is likely to continue to generate institutional and classroom situations which dictate that difference and otherness be the norm rather than the exception. Unfortunately, in the 1960's, Black and minority ethnic (BME) migrants from the former British colonies had less-than-favorable educational experiences in Britain due to prejudice and stereotyping mainly arising from cultural differences. Since then there have been a plethora of studies, policies, and reports regarding the perpetuation of discrimination in educational institutions. Today, British higher educational institutions have finally begun to recognize the need to reduce progression and attainment gaps. However, their focus tends to only consider the student "Black and Minority Ethnic attainment gap" with almost no attention being given to educators', or more specifically there is a distinctive lack of thought given to the female BME educators' progression and attainment in British HEIs. As such, this paper draws theoretically and conceptually on critical cultural autoethnography, to illustrate the value of conducting research into a female's BME educators' personal and professional experiences, and "gives voice to previously silenced and marginalized experiences" (Boylorn and Orbe, 2014, p. 15). In doing so, I highlight how higher educational institutions underutilisation of such competencies and contributions have and continue to perpetuate BME underachievement. I conclude the paper by questioning the accountability of providing support for BME educators progression and attainment, challenge educational leaders to consider the value and utilization of cultural knowledge, and implore all educators to reflect on how their personal experiences influence their professional identity.

AB  - In the Western world, gender/sex is traditionally viewed as binary, with people falling into one of two categories: male or female. This view of gender/sex has started to change, triggering some resistance. This research investigates psychological mechanisms underlying that resistance. Study 1 (N= 489, UK) explored the role of individual gender identification in defense of, and attempts to reinforce, the gender/sex binary. Study 2 (N= 415, Sweden) further considered the role of individual differences in need for closure. Both gender identification and need for closure were associated with binary views of gender/sex, prejudice against nonbinary people, and opposition to the use of gender-neutral pronouns. Policies that aim to abolish gender/sex categories, but not policies that advocate for a third gender/sex category, were seen as particularly unfair among people high in gender identification. These findings are an important step in understanding the psychology of resistance to change around binary systems of gender/sex.

AB  - In this paper, the author problematizes the distinction between experience near and experience distant by suggesting that this bifurcation has everything to do with whether we think in terms of Cushman's one complex world or split worlds. The ground between experience near and experience distant is the ground on which our histories, cultures, traumas, and differences exist. The author questions whether the cherished belief that the gold standard of hearing from the patient and staying close to the patient's experience and view of reality is enough anymore. Our therapeutic passive receptiveness-our willingness to be taught- could be felt by our patients as disinterest, prejudice against, superiority, or non-reflected upon privilege. We need to be ready and willing to communicate or signal our openness, respect, and curiosity about the lived experience, histories, and cultures of those different from ourselves. Ethical labor is made up of the empathic stretch to know and research those aspects of our patients lives and familial cultural and social histories that simply cannot yet be delivered in affectively accessible forms. We must try to understand that what may feel like experience distance is so very much more than that.

AB  - This article discusses two complementary themes that play an important role in contemporary South African political philosophy: (1) the racist tradition in Western philosophy; and (2) the role of ubuntu in regaining an authentic African identity, which was systematically suppressed during the colonial past and apartheid. These are also leading themes in Mogobe Ramose'sAfrican Philosophy Through Ubuntu. The first part concentrates on John Locke. It discusses the thesis that the reprehensible racism of many founders of liberal political philosophy has lethally infected liberal theory. This view neglects the distinction between genesis and justification. Political liberalism has since cleansed itself of the prejudices of its spiritual ancestors. Liberal human rights exclude racism as a matter of principle. The second part discusses the claim that the ubuntu philosophy provides a better basis for a constitution in a modern society than political liberalism. A major problem is that ubuntu is an essentially contested concept. Some philosophers consider ubuntu to be a moribund notion (Matolino); others see it as a vital concept par excellence. In the latter case, it is elaborated from sundry incompatible political views, ranging from African nationalism (Ramose) via humanist communitarianism (Metz) to liberalism (Mboti). Conclusion: as an essentially contested ideological concept, ubuntu should not be a decisive constitutional standard for the application of state force. In contrast, the constitutional model of political liberalism provides a reasonable alternative, as it is designed precisely to solve the problem of social plurality and ideological contest.

AB  - This paper discusses the impact of COVID-19 on older people and people with disabilities. It draws attention to the violations of their human rights in the context of COVID-19 which in turn reveal the hierarchical social order of our society. Although statistics show higher deaths of older people in regard to COVID-19, these numbers co-exist with rampant discrimination towards these groups with underlying messaging that their lives are dispensable. The paper highlights violations at different levels-discursive, ethical, and everyday-and shows how they are underpinned by ageism and disablism which stereotype older people and people with disabilities with prejudicial messaging and actions by states and societal actors. At the same time, the paper also highlights the value of human rights discourses and instruments which are mobilized by the disability movement and groups upholding the rights of older people, to question these rights infringements in the context of COVID-19. The politics of these groups which call for principled equality and inclusion of older people and people with disabilities in times of COVID-19 exhibit a much-needed disruption of our social order, an undertaking that needs to be continued in COVID-19 times and after.

AB  - Gender violence is generally conceived as a phenomenon concerning only adults. Nonetheless, it is also perpetrated within teenagers' relationships, as many empirical studies have shown. We therefore have focused our attention on a non-probabilistic sample consisting of 400 adolescents living in Naples (Italy), to study the association between sexism and the justification of violent attitudes. Generally, sexism is recognised as a discriminatory attitude towards people, based on their biological sex. However, it is conventional to talk about sexism as a prejudice against women. The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) for adolescents was used to evaluate the two dimensions of ambivalent sexism, i.e., hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS). Moreover, the questionnaire regarding attitudes towards diversity and violence (CADV) was administered to assess participants' attitudes towards violence. A Partial Least Square-Second Order Path Model reveals that girls' ambivalent sexism is affected more by benevolent sexism than hostile sexism. On the contrary, among boys, hostile sexism has a higher impact. Finally, benevolent sexist girls justify domestic violence more than boys do.

AB  - The scientific novelty of the study consists of the unique, organic, integrative, synchronous and diachronic approach ofthis topic in the Romanian academic space after 1990. The author uses a diverse scientific methodology - inductive, deductive, cartographic, historical, statistical-mathematical, and analytical - from the intersection of political geography, geopolitics, geoeconomics, geostrategy, geo-culture and history. From the beginning of the book, he reveals an interdisciplinary vision, presenting his perspective through the complicated kaleidoscope of the main schools of geopolitics (American, German, French, British). Following in parallel, chronologically and thematically, the relations between post-totalitarian Romania and the USA, Germany and Russia, the author builds his conceptual, scientific and methodological edifice on a series of pillars, present in all five chapters: frontier, history, geopolitics, geostrategy, geoeconomics, geoculture. Benefiting from an impressive bibliography, the author offers an original and surprising view of the Romanian, American, German, and Russian geopolitical realities, managing to detach himself from prejudices, taboos, stereotypes, and leaving the sphere of official, formal and dull language, so often used in the Romanian space by politicians, journalists, and by some pseudo-specialists in geopolitics, security, etc.

AB  - This essay integrates Moravian studies, missiology and historical theology. It begins with a brief survey of the historiography of Moravian missions in colonial North America. It then surveys various reasons for periodic hostility against Moravians in New York and Pennsylvania between roughly 1740 and 1790. It recovers the ethnic and cultural diversity, prejudices and defensive actions of colonists that were a significant component of life in these contested spaces and turbulent times, thus demonstrating that so-called 'religious' persecution remains a complicated phenomenon. It suggests Moravians might have avoided certain instances of misperception and consequent 'persecution' had they adapted themselves culturally in ways they did not. Moravians were often perceived by other colonial Europeans as a threat to the security and stability of developing locales, and remained largely on the social periphery in colonial North America as a consequence of being both wrongly and rightly understood. As an international and transnational religious community pursuing its own global dispersal for the sake of mission, Moravian political neutrality and perceived 'foreignness' was misunderstood in times of war by English and Dutch colonists, especially, as sympathy for the enemy or even evidence of espionage, though the religious and secular fear of their being Catholic seems to have been eventually resolved. Because Moravians in the British colonies fraternised with Native Americans for the sake of mission and were part of an international fellowship also befriending Caribbean slaves, they were sometimes slandered by colonists who feared them as instigators of rebellion by these marginalised populations. Finally, the Moravian sense of being set apart by God from the broader society and called to suffer for the sake of their righteous difference and gospel influence, when acted upon, provoked hostility from colonists who perceived them as a threat to local balances of power, denominational order or family cohesion.

TI  - "A Mixed Assemblage of Persons": Race and Tavern Space in Upper Canada
T2  - CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - FIRST NATIONS
KW  - COMMUNITY
AB  - This tavern story about an 1832 Saturday night on the town in Brantford, Upper Canada, addresses the complexities of racialized relations in "public places" generally and the tavern's bar room in particular. It juxtaposes tavern-goers who engaged in "heterogenous" sociability with the "'high pressure' prejudice" of a "'Yankee'" barkeeper. It challenges us to understand what such moments of multiracial public life meant in a society permeated by racialized thought and practice. There was a strange contradiction between White settlers' marginalization of Black and First Nations peoples and the sometimes easy accommodation afforded them in the public houses. Although accommodation to people of colour was also illegally, and sometimes violently, denied, tavern stories complicate historical interpretations focusing on conflict. Without questioning these analyses, or the evidence supporting them, the stories suggest that something more subtle was also going on. They invite serious attention to the colony's many taverns as sites where people chose to relax racial boundaries as often as they chose to enforce them. Maybe it was just the whiskey and the wine; without comparable work on other public spaces, the typicality of a tavern-based history will remain an open question. But because "Indians" as well as the "blacks and whites" all went there, the taverns show how race, as one socially constructed category, shaped ordinary, everyday human interactions.

AB  - This study explores the reciprocal perceptions, main tendencies, prejudices and expectations of the societies in Turkey and North Cyprus. To this end, 160 participants from both societies were interviewed. The specific social processes that result in various judgements, thoughts and tendencies observed in the semi-structured interviews were evaluated by the discourse analysis method. Although the research findings and analyses are not representative of the whole populations, they still shed light on common perceptions. In fact, the results counterintuitively revealed that people from both societies exhibit increasing suspicion, if not negativity, about each other despite the widely accepted nationalist narrative of 'motherland-babyland', which is believed to be the main dynamic of the relations.

AB  - Centuries before W.E.B. DuBois named the colorline-i.e., racism-as the problem of the 20th century, skin color stratification was a persistent phenomenon. In 1983 Black feminist, scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winning author Alice Walker termed "colorism" as "prejudicial or preferential treatment of same-race people based solely on their [skin] color". Using the tools of genealogy, I conducted a critical family history of my parents, Lem and Mae's, pursuit of their American Dream. Such exploration digs deep to decipher the nexuses of a family's evolution. Dr. Maya Angelou routinely shared stories about her past to impart the importance of embracing one's history. For my parents, the American Dream meant opportunity, which included home ownership. Their American Dream began as African Americans in the United States' Jim Crow south. Lem was a light-skinned man; Mae a dark-complexion woman. They met, married, and bought a small home in segregated Columbia, South Carolina. Bearing the cloak of oppression, my parents joined millions of southern Blacks in the Great Migration relocating to northern cities-my parents landed in Boston, Massachusetts. Throughout their journey, Lem and Mae reached back to their ancestors, and drew from within themselves to improve their circumstances.

AB  - Despite the strong influence of religion in today's world, religious education at university is rather sparse. Universities must be proactive in overcoming negative prejudices and combating symbolic and religious illiteracy that curbs appreciation of other cultural realities. This paper carries out a diagnosis of future social and educational agents in order to discover their attitudes to the challenge that they will have to face in the fostering of intercultural and interreligious dialogue. The results would lead us to believe that initial and continuous education should be introduced in order to foment a profound understanding of the religious dimension.

AB  - This manuscript lays the groundwork for considering racial threat as a collective emotion. Although sociologists regularly study racial threat, a disconnect exists between Blumer's theoretical framework (1958) and modern empirical measurement. Research has largely measured racial threat as perceptions of competition or increases in racism. Neither, however, squarely fits the symbolic interactionist framework that Blumer championed. This manuscript frames racial threat as an affective group response that is generated through sustained interaction with social groups and group representations. After showing how Blumer's threat conceptualization fits the parameters of a collective emotion, I demonstrate how quantitative measurement and experimental research design can be used to capture threat as Blumer outlines it. Then, using factor analyses and regression, I illustrate that collective threat is distinct from other collective emotions and operates according to Blumer's theoretical predictions. The manuscript concludes with a discussion of how ongoing attempts to measure collective threat and the evolution of racism in the United States highlight the continued relevance of Blumer's work.

AB  - We show that educational outcomes of sexual minorities are consistent with efforts to mediate future discrimination. Gay men and lesbians obtain more years of schooling than heterosexual men and women, between 0.6 and 1.2 years. This difference is robust to controlling for observable characteristics for men but not women. Gay men and lesbian women also complete different college majors. Gay men are more likely to choose majors with lower levels of prejudice, higher levels of workplace independence, and occupations that emphasize relationships even though they pay less. Similarly, lesbian women choose majors with less prejudice and more workplace independence.

AB  - A large body of research has demonstrated that intergroup contact is a powerful tool for reducing prejudice among majority group members. Yet, research among minority group members has revealed a more complex picture. The present contribution advances recent research on sedative effects of intergroup contact on support for ethnic activism, by investigating how identity dynamics undermine ethnic minorities' claims for better conditions and equal rights. More precisely, we disentangled the mediating roles played by reduced ethnic and increased national identification as a consequence of intergroup contact, while considering the moderating role of dual identification. Results from a cross-sectional study among an understudied immigrant minority, Kosovo Albanians in Switzerland, indicate that dual identification moderated the sedative effect of intergroup contact on support for ethnic activism via decreased ethnic identification, while no support for conditional processes of intergroup contact via increased national identification were found. Intergroup contact was linked to reduced ethnic identification, which in turn related to increased support for ethnic activism, but only when dual identification was low. Conversely, when dual identification was high, ethnic identification was unrelated to support for ethnic activism, and intergroup contact reduced ethnic activism directly. To conclude, we discuss the mobilizing role of dual identification, and reflect on how ethnic and national components of dual identities affect the politicization of stigmatized minorities.

TI  - Implicit Bias, (Global) White Ignorance, and Bad Faith: The Problem of Whiteness and Anti-black Racism
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
AB  - In Britain, policy-makers tend to view racism as a social attitude rather than an institutional/structural phenomenon. Not until the publication of the MacPherson Report (1999) was the idea of 'institutional racism' officially recognised. According to Jules Holroyd, implicit bias as a concept can help us understand and combat the kind of unwitting prejudice the Macpherson report describes. This article explores whether implicit bias is indeed a viable framework for understanding institutional/structural racism. To do so, I bring together Charles Mills' notion of 'global white ignorance' and Lewis Gordon's interpretation of 'bad faith'. Through Mills' and Gordon's analyses, which together illuminate both the structural and psychic dimensions of racism I offer an account of the psychodynamics of racism far more consistent with our observations of how racism actually operates in Britain. Specifically, we see that institutional/structural racism is neither unconscious nor is it unmotivated as implicit bias would suggest. As such, I reject implicit bias as a useful or necessary explanatory framework for helping us understand institutional racism as a structural phenomenon.

AB  - Race and caste are two important historical and social categories that had a significant role during the European colonial period and in the colonies. Christian missionary activities during the colonial period often colluded with the colonial institutions in perpetuating certain accepted worldviews that benefited the colonial authorities. The central argument of this paper is to highlight the impact of a racialized worldview that was prevalent among European colonial powers, its transmission to the colonial context, and its continuing social legacy within Christianity. This paper, through a post-colonial analysis of British mission history and its work in a South Asian context, raises some pertinent questions regarding the tacit role of race and caste in the Christianizing mission. It also argues the need for careful post-colonial analysis of mission practices to challenge reactivation of entrenched structures of discrimination and prejudice.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aimed to assess the current situation of Chinese dental bachelor interns on HIV/AIDS-related knowledge and their attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, paper-based survey involving 147 dental students from three Chinese dental schools was conducted. Students were recruited to complete the questionnaire regarding their knowledge, awareness and attitudes concerning HIV/AIDS anonymously and voluntarily.
   Results: A total of 144 students responded to the study, generating a response rate of 98.0%. Although 97.0% of the dental students believed dentists were at high risk of HIV infection, 97.2% of students expressed no prejudice towards HIV/AIDS patients and stated their willingness to provide oral healthcare service for such patients. No statistically significant differences in the responses on attitudes and some basic knowledge were found between students who had received the relevant education about infection control and the students who had not. However, regarding most questions about oral manifestations in adult and paediatric patients living with AIDS, the students who received relevant education showed more knowledge than the students who did not (p<0.05). The cognitive level about respecting HIV/AIDS patients' autonomy and privacy was generally low in all the students.
   Conclusions: Most of the dental students in this survey held positive attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients and good grasp of some basic knowledge about HIV/AIDS. On the other hand, the questionnaire results reflected gaps in education, such as respecting HIV/AIDS patients' privacy.

AB  - Purpose/Objective: Health care providers' attitudes of marginalized groups can he key factors that contribute to health care access and outcome disparities because of their influence on patient encounters as well as clinical decision-making. Despite a growing body of knowledge linking disparate health outcomes to providers' clinical decision making. less research has focused on providers' attitudes about disability. The aim of this study was to examine providers' explicit and implicit disability attitudes. interactions between their attitudes. and correlates of explicit and implicit bias. Research Method/Design: We analyzed secondary data from 25,006 health care providers about their disability attitudes. In addition to analyzing people's explicit and implicit attitudes (Disability Attitudes Implicit Association Test), we used Son Hing, Chung-Yan, Hamilton. & Zanna's (2008) model of two-dimensional prejudice to compare provider's explicit and implicit attitudes. Finally, we used linear regression models to examine correlates of providers' explicit and implicit attitudes. Results: While on average, provider's explicit attitudes (M = 4.41) indicated little prejudice, their implicit attitudes (M = 0.54) revealed they moderately preferred nondisabled people-they were aversive ableists. Correlates of providers' explicit and implicit attitudes also included age, gender. political orientation, and having relationships with disability (friends, family, and being a person with disability). Conclusions/Implications: This study revealed that despite a majority of providers self-reporting not being biased against people with disabilities, implicitly, the overwhelming majority were biased. This study's findings can be used to better understand how provider disability bias can contribute to inequitable health care access and health outcomes for people with disabilities.

TI  - The metamorphosis: a literary analysis of the Arab Muslim refugee's interpersonal struggles of integration in London
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - MULTICULTURALISM
KW  - GLOBALIZATION
AB  - Contemporary literature reflects a newly emerging paradigm of the Arab Muslim refugee's identity. The current conflict in the Middle East created a surge of migrants to European nations. The resulting social phenomenon enforces a series of interpersonal and international struggles for both the refugees and their hosts. In this paper, I carry out a comparative interpretation of Kamila Shamsie's Home Fire and Mohsin Hamid's Exit West in order to demonstrate the Arab Muslim refugee's identity reinvention and metamorphosis in Britain, particularly in London. As I demonstrate in this paper, the many protagonists in both literary works allude to specific phases of the naturalization process, as social group's prejudiced and stereotypical conceptualization of the 'other' is identified. Paradoxical accounts of empathy and apathy are recorded and conflicting social roles are highlighted. The literary works suggest the genesis of new multi-national Arab Muslim identities as potential (re)solution to the interpersonal struggles of integration.

AB  - Populist right-wing politicians and voters tend to dismiss climate change. To investigate possible reasons for this, we tested correlations between climate change denial and variables linked to right-wing populism (Study 1: N = 1,587; Study 2: N = 909). The strongest predictor of climate change denial was an index capturing exclusionary and anti-egalitarian preferences (opposition to, e.g., multiculturalism and feminism), followed by traditional values (Study 1) and Social Dominance Orientation (Study 2). Populist antiestablishment attitudes correlated only weakly with climate change denial, and this correlation vanished when exclusionary and anti-egalitarian preferences were controlled for. Also, the effects of authoritarianism (Study 2) and (low) openness vanished in the full models. Climate change denial did not correlate with (low) agreeableness, which is a personality trait linked to populism. However, both antiestablishment attitudes and climate change denial correlated with pseudoscientific beliefs (e.g., anti-vaccination attitudes) (Study 1). To conclude, we did not find support for a notable linkage between climate change denial and populist antiestablishment attitudes. Thus, when addressing climate change denial, it could be more beneficial to focus on the ideological worldviews that are being protected by denial, such as endorsement of the existing societal power relations, than on the antiestablishment arguments used by some who deny.

TI  - Eventful Conversations and the Positive Virtues of a Listener
T2  - ACTA ANALYTICA-INTERNATIONAL PERIODICAL FOR PHILOSOPHY IN THE ANALYTICAL TRADITION
LA  - English
AB  - Political solutions to problems like global warming and social justice are often stymied by an inability to productively communicate in everyday conversations. Motivated by these communication problems, the paper considers the role of the virtuous listener in conversations. Rather than the scripted exchanges of information between individuals, we focus on lively, intra-active conversations that are mediating events. In such conversations, the listener plays a participatory role by contributing to the content and form of the conversation. Unlike Miranda Fricker's negative virtue of testimonial justice, which neutralizes the listener's identity-prejudices in their credibility judgments of the speaker's testimony, we consider the positive virtues of a good listener. These positive virtues enable listeners to productively contribute to the conversation by helping create the fertile epistemic space of a non-adversarial, caring relationship that facilitates critical and creative thinking.

AB  - Transgender subjects in Manipuri society have experienced cultural legitimacy as well as prejudice and therefore have had an ambiguous status from early to modern times. From their early prototypes, pheitas, to their modern counterparts, nupi sabis, transgender subjects have played vital roles in the administrative, cultural and artistic life of Manipuri society. Legitimacy as well as stigma marked their participation in social and economic life. This article traces the emergence of the nupi maanbi community, a community of man-to-woman transgender subjects and argues that the current nupi maanbi identity, embedded in this distinct community, is firmly located in the economic niche that the subjects inhabit as professionals in the increasingly popular fashion and beauty parlours in contemporary Manipur.

AB  - Australia today is a culturally diverse nation with people from over 190 different countries claiming 300 different ancestries. But despite an official commitment to diversity, contemporary Australian society continues to experience tensions between multicultural policies and a legacy of Anglo privilege and cultural dominance. To assess this, the Challenging Racism Project conducted a national survey, commissioned by the Special Broadcasting Service, to gauge the nature and extent of racist attitudes and experience of racism across Australia during July-August 2015 and November 2015. Results show that sociodemographic characteristics show little contemporary relationship to racist attitudes. Age, once associated with "old" racist attitudes, is no longer significant. On the other hand, Anglo privilege is empirically linked to racism through notions of social dominance. We conclude that it is to the media, and to public discourse generally, to which future research attention, using critical discourse analysis, should turn in efforts to make Australia a fairer, more tolerant, multicultural society.

AB  - Dust samples from roads classified based on traffic volumes (low, medium and high traffic) were collected from Muscat, Oman, and then analyzed for a dozen heavy metals. Their contents varied widely with mercury and iron, having the lowest and highest concentrations (0.59-0.80 and 406.10-429.00 ppm, respectively). Contrary to most metals detected, mercury and arsenic did not only exhibit increasing trends from low to high categories, but they also were significantly correlated to each other and traffic volumes, suggesting that both might originate from vehicular emissions. While the calculations revealed that the potential ecological risk index (RI) for selected metals in the dust samples was at a considerable level, the hazard index (HI) was within the safe threshold value (HI < 1). Overall, our findings imply minor prejudicial health risks to the general public nevertheless, children would be relatively more vulnerable to the impact of metals associated with dust.

AB  - Purpose
   After the closing of four of the five historically Black college and university (HBCU)-based library and information science (LIS) graduate programs (leaving only that of North Carolina Central University), there is a need to revitalize HBCU-LIS degree program pathways to increase racial diversity in LIS education.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This mixed-methods study entails survey and interview research with HBCU librarians. The researchers explored participants' professional experiences and perspectives on creating partnerships between HBCU institutions and LIS graduate programs.
   Findings
   Participants demonstrated substantial experience, expressed high levels of job satisfaction, viewed pipeline programs favorably and believed that LIS can be strengthened through the inclusion of HBCU educational practices and students.
   Practical implications - This study provides recommendations and a model for forging culturally competent and reciprocal HBCU-LIS degree program partnerships. Social implications - Community-led knowledge of HBCUs can disrupt rescue and deficiency narratives of these institutions. Such prejudices are detrimental to HBCU-LIS degree program partnerships.
   Originality/value
   Past HBCU-LIS degree program pipeline partnerships did not culminate in research or published best practices. This paper presents literature-derived and community-sourced guidelines along with a model for future initiatives.

AB  - Communities living in Latin American slums present more vulnerability of diseases, high rates of infant mortality, and low life expectancy, generally as a result of the high levels of soil contamination. Furthermore, in our case study of the 4th District of Porto Alegre, the community depends on recycling materials from waste for their livelihood. In consequence, the public spaces are used as a garbage dump, accentuating health problems and making social interactions difficult. In this context, our applied research group aims to construct social spaces, improving the inhabitants' quality of life through participative methodologies that encourage the use of the public spaces of these districts without prejudice of the economic system based on garbage. Our strategy relies on the actions and interactions of humans and the place in sub developed urban areas.

AB  - Violence between police and young black men is a longstanding issue that has gained national attention in recent years due to high-profile violent encounters. We conducted 48 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from different groups (young black men aged 14-24 years, parents, educators, police officers, and staff in youth serving organizations). Stakeholders were asked to (1) identify causes of violent encounters between police and young black men; (2) describe police officers who serve in their communities; and (3) describe interactions between police and young black men. Data were collected and analyzed using thematic analysis and content analysis methods. All stakeholder groups except police felt that violent encounters between police and young black men were caused by officers lacking a connection with communities. Fear and distrust across stakeholder groups was also seen as a cause of violent encounters; youth feared police after having seen or heard of violent encounters, while officers feared youth due to the availability of firearms and previous assaults on officers. Several stakeholder groups recognized that racism and prejudice among police was another cause of violence between police and young black men. Positive interactions between police and youth were seen as the result of established, trusting relationships developed over time. Future efforts to prevent violent encounters between police and young black men should engage multiple stakeholder groups. One avenue for engagement is through community mobilization efforts that foster collaboration, build community trust, and encourage implementation of policies, programs, and practices that prevent future violent encounters.

TI  - Sailing into Troubled Waters: A German Naval Captain Faces American Justice in World War I
T2  - PENNSYLVANIA MAGAZINE OF HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY
LA  - English
AB  - The trial of Captain Max Thierichens of the Imperial German Navy in Philadelphia in 1917 was a national sensation. His ship, the Prinz Eitel Fredrich, first sought refuge in the United States in 1915, but eventually the popularity of the captain and his crew became a liability as the country edged closer to war. In the hands of the infant Bureau of Investigation and the print media, Thierichens's amorous adventures became federal crimes linked to an international campaign against sex trafficking. A propaganda windfall, these charges reflected the anti-German sentiments generated by the FirstWorldWar, as well as other early twentieth-century social anxieties. In spite of his conviction and imprisonment, the actual facts of the case are still unclear. The personal and political purposes of the trial, however, are not. Ultimately, these highlight the vulnerability of American institutions to political pressure, popular prejudice, and social fears, especially in wartime.

AB  - The story about the "Good Samaritan" in the gospel of Luke appears in the midst of a halakhic discussion between Jesus and a Judaean "lawyer" over who constitutes a "neighbor" (Luke 10:25-37). While scholars have often interpreted this pericope as a call for social inclusivity, the ways that Luke relies on and perpetuates prejudicial Judaean stereotypes about Samaritans have seldom been analyzed. This study draws on social-scientific and critical theory on ethnicity and the plethora of recent scholarship on Samaritan-Judaean interactions in order to explore the ways in which Luke's text conveys prevalent ethnic stereotypes about Samaritans. It argues that Luke, like earlier and contemporaneous Judaean sources, appropriates an ethnographic representation of Samaritans as "proximate others" as part of a process of identity formation.

AB  - The internationalization of academic production has changed the publishing culture in all corners of the world with increasing participation of scholars from semi-peripheral countries in international journals (belcher, 2007). While there has been growing interest in how multilingual scholars see this internationalization process, little is known about Brazil. To address this gap, a survey was distributed to scholars (N = 290) from different research fields in this country. The analysis of the data revealed important disciplinary differences, suggesting the existence of a peripheral group of scholars inside this semi-peripheral country. The scholars from the exact and biological sciences reported that they publish in English much more frequently than Portuguese, and few reported language-related issues. They contested the existence of a nativeness bias, although some perceived prejudice against Latin-American research. Scholars from the humanities and the social sciences publish substantially less in international journals, reporting challenges particularly with language. Overall, the data suggest that international publication has become part of the disciplinary culture in Brazil in the hard sciences while the humanities and the social sciences seem to remain in a peripheral position. This appears to be particularly true for disciplines such as education and language and literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Travel writing, an important influence on tourism, is often criticized as hegemonic/colonial by postcolonial studies. This study notes that postcolonial studies invariably solely search for such intentions in representations of societies. A critic of such approach is made by analysing travel writing texts where a postcolonial approach would find hegemonic/colonial intentions, while such intentions are likely absent. This is done by showing that travel writing representations of Portugal (an important tourist destination for tourism which tourism is very significant) are similar to social science representations of the country. These are to a great extent produced by Southern European and Portuguese scientists, making underlying hegemonic/colonial intentions unlikely. It is concluded that the attribution of such intentions to travel writing and other discourses by postcolonial studies should be rethought. One should therefore be careful in using postcolonial studies findings. An alternative mechanism underlying the production of unfavourable representations is proposed that may generate unfavourable representations even when producers of representations do not hold prejudiced views, with crucial implications on tourism and cultural identity.

AB  - In this paper, I examine whether agents who commit testimonial injustice are morally responsible for their wrongdoing, given that they are ignorant of their wrongdoing. Fricker (Epistemic injustice: power and the ethics of knowing, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2007) argues that agents whose social setting lacks the concepts or reasons necessary for them to correct for testimonial injustice are excused. I argue that agents whose social settings have these concepts or reasons available are also typically excused, because they lack the capacity to recognise those concepts or reasons. Attempts to trace this lack of capacity back to an earlier culpable wrongdoing will often fail, due to there being no point at which these perpetrators knowingly chose to develop their prejudices. Attempts to ground culpability under some Attributionist accounts of moral responsibility will also fail. This is because perpetrators' lack of awareness of what they are doing makes it the case that they are not expressing objectionable evaluative judgments in the way required for blameworthiness. Finally, I argue that our temptation to blame agents who commit testimonial injustice is not completely unfounded. Appealing to Watson's (Philos Top 24(2):227-248, 1996) attributability/accountability distinction allows us to make sense of how some responses to the jurors are appropriate, despite their being excused.

AB  - This paper studies the sociolinguistics of quotative be like in Trinidad and its relation to Trinidadian English Creole (TrinEC). Corpus evidence shows a significant association of be like use and young age as well as female gender, in line with global trends. Questionnaire data reveal that it does not detract from the perception of a speaker as educated and of high social status as long as utterances are grammatically standardized English (StE). TrinEC grammar triggers contrasting perceptions but the data also point to traditional social prejudice against TrinEC being transcended. This ties in with the finding that be like users tend not actually to be averse to using TrinEC. Overall the sociolinguistics of be like in Trinidad is shaped by global trends as well as the local sociolinguistic configuration.

AB  - Affective information about other people's social behavior may prejudice social interactions and bias person judgments. The trustworthiness of person-related information, however, can vary considerably, as in the case of gossip, rumors, lies, or "fake news." Here, we investigated how spontaneous person likability and explicit person judgments are influenced by trustworthiness, employing event-related potentials as indices of emotional brain responses. Social-emotional information about the (im)moral behavior of previously unknown persons was verbally presented as trustworthy fact (e.g., "He bullied his apprentice") or marked as untrustworthy gossip (by adding, e.g., allegedly), using verbal qualifiers that are frequently used in conversations, news, and social media to indicate the questionable trustworthiness of the information and as a precaution against wrong accusations. In Experiment 1, spontaneous likability, deliberate person judgments, and electrophysiological measures of emotional person evaluation were strongly influenced by negative information yet remarkably unaffected by the trustworthiness of the information. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and extended them to positive information. Our findings demonstrate a tendency for strong emotional evaluations and person judgments even when they are knowingly based on unclear evidence.

AB  - Throughout the discourse surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict many methods have emerged to examine the ways in which artists engage with the issues through popular culture. As hip hop spread globally, its universal themes and ability to constitute community led to the use of rap as a vehicle for political commentary. This paper explores how the Palestinian hip hop group DAM provides a commentary on the experiences of Palestinian-Israelis through carnivalesque methods to create shocking juxtapositions. Using an inter-textual method, we can see that humor allows DAM to freely speak "their truth," defusing tensions and providing a new perspective on the conflict, opening dialogue, and regaining control over a painful history. This case study raises questions of authenticity, agency, and parody in hip hop. The genre blurs the threshold of true and false and allows artists to present a conventional hip hop persona, giving them the freedom to safely comment on social issues. Humor allows for further political commentary under the facade of a joke. By parodying painful racial, gender, and class stereotypes, artists reclaim their identity and further subvert prejudices against them. This case study challenges the notion of what protest music looks like, and how it functions to promote change.

AB  - Objective To explore the perception of medical students from a private medical college in Perak, Malaysia, on primary care practice and induce the factors influencing their perception and willingness to consider primary care as a career pathway.
   Design Qualitative study using focus group discussions. Participants' responses were audio recorded, transcribed, grouped under various domains and listed out and analysed.
   Setting A private medical college in Perak state, Malaysia.
   Participants Forty-six medical students from years 2 to 5 were included. Eight focus groups were formed with two focus groups from each academic year (six students each in seven groups and four students in one group). Students were informed through their respective student leader of each year and received a participant information sheet and an informed consent form which were completed and returned if they decided to participate in the focus group discussions.
   Results The participants had different levels of understanding of primary care depending on their level of exposure to primary care. Senior students with more exposure had a better understanding about primary care and its services. Attractive factors towards choosing primary care as a career included short working hours with a more balanced family and social life, being able to treat patients as a whole with continuity of care and closer relationship with patients. Unattractive factors included routine, unchallenging and boring practice, poor salary, work overload and administrative work in government clinics, being less recognised by other specialties; and the poor perception by other doctors that those pursuing primary care were not 'brilliant enough' for more 'sophisticated disciplines like surgery or paediatrics'.
   Conclusion This study showed that the medical students' level of exposure to primary care played a crucial role in determining their understanding of primary care practice and their choice of career in primary care. Issues to be addressed include remuneration, workload and the prejudice against primary care as a career pathway. Suggestions included introducing early exposure to fun and challenging primary care postings in the medical curriculum and producing well trained, skilled and enthusiastic role models.

AB  - Although intergroup contact can reduce prejudice, opportunities to experience such contact are often constrained by systems of segregation. Work on this problem has focused on divisions entrenched within institutions of residence, education, and employment. Our research employed a complementary approach, which treated segregation as the outcome of individuals' movements over time within everyday life spaces. Taking as a case study Catholics' and Protestants' use of public environments in north Belfast, we used GPS tracking technology, combined with GIS analytics, to explore the time geography of residents' activity space use over a 2-week period (Study 1). We also conducted a field survey to explore how psychological factors shaped their willingness to use activity spaces beyond their own communities (Study 2). Analysis based on around 1,000 hr of raw movement data revealed that north Belfast is marked by high levels of segregation, expressed via residents' limited use of public spaces, facilities, and pathways located in outgroup areas. However, use of shared spaces is also common, with Catholics spending more time in such spaces than Protestants. Structural equation modeling suggested that residents' self-reported willingness to use activity spaces outside their own communities was associated with both negative and positive intergroup contact-relationships partially mediated by realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anxiety over interaction across sectarian lines. Both kinds of contact and realistic threat were also associated with the time residents actually spent in spaces beyond their own communities. Opportunities for integrating psychological and geographic research on contact and segregation are highlighted.

AB  - Research on gay men has largely focused on health disparities and minority stress, but scholars have called for greater attention to resilience and the positive aspects of being a sexual minority. In the broader social psychology literature, research has found that capitalization-the act of sharing personal, positive life events with others-can benefit one's wellbeing. As such, the goals of the current study were to examine the extent to which gay men capitalize on positive experiences related to their sexual orientation, perceptions of responses to those capitalization attempts, and the influence of these interactions on negative affect. We used longitudinal data from 144 cisgender gay men who lived in New York City and participated in a weekly diary study. Analyses of within-person effects indicated that having and sharing a positive experience related to one's sexual orientation were not significantly associated with changes in negative affect. However, perceiving a more supportive response to one's disclosure was significantly associated with lower than average negative affect. These findings highlight the importance of others' responses to disclosures of positive experiences related to one's sexual orientation. Interventions focused on improving sexual minorities' mental health may benefit from addressing with whom they are sharing their positive experiences and the extent to which they are likely to perceive the responses as supportive.

AB  - The niqab provokes a heated debate in European societies and generates intolerance towards women who wear it. Some of the explanations used to criticize this Muslim garment refer to the idea that women wear the niqab as a form of patriarchal oppression. Furthermore-especially after the terrorist attacks perpetrated by Islamic extremists-the niqab is seen as a symbol of religious radicalization. We carried out 10 communicative daily life stories with Muslim women wearing the niqab in Spain, to explore the adverse experiences that they face, as well as the ways to transform them. Our analysis, informed by a communicative approach, revealed different forms of discrimination, such as prejudice, personal attacks and social isolation. Furthermore, it revealed some opportunities to transform these experiences, through the equality of differences, the egalitarian dialogue, and the support of faith-based organizations. Ultimately, our findings illustrated participants' persistent defense of their right to express their religious identity.

AB  - European mobility programmes have been seen as a promising method to promote European identity, particularly with a focus on young generations. In this article, I discussed the constructing role of the Erasmus exchange programme by employing the result of direct cross-cultural interaction. Data from Eurobarometer surveys and outcomes concluded from the semi-structured interviews revealed that socialising with other Europeans strengthened European identity but contact with the host country remained limited. Different from other studies, this paper also reveals that the national identity of the participants precisely empower as a result of coaction. Furthermore, for the first time in the literature, semi-structured interviews unveiled that cultural differences such as stereotypes and prejudices have no negative effect in promoting European identity among students. Rather, it generates a positive impact for the awareness of national identity.

AB  - A research project at an Australian regional university reframed "disability" by defining the diagnosis of a disability with an impact on learning as a learning challenge. Using the terminology of learning challenge, an anonymous, online survey found there was a significant number of students who chose institutional non-disclosure and excluded themselves from legally mandated support for learning. Using a sample of 111 students from this previously hidden group, qualitative analysis was performed on their stated reasons for non-disclosure using the conceptual lens of stigma mechanisms and theories at individual, situational, and institutional levels. This research found that internalised stigma is most common for students living with mental health issues (n=97), who anticipate discrimination and prejudice should disclosure be made. Further analysis for this group found students described stigma as having effected learning through poorer academic outcomes, reduced social support and academic help-seeking, and a perception that future professional identities excluded those living with mental health issues. Non-disclosure was perceived by students to be necessary to protect them from being discredited within their learning environment and, for some, in future employment. Structural elements of stigma, such as the qualification of disability and process of disclosure, were seen to be barriers. Perceived discrimination and the desire to protect students' ideal identity (not disabled) were also described. Institutions may find these results useful to develop changes that will result in improved academic outcomes, retention, and completion for students living with disability and stigma.

TI  - Testimonial Injustice and a Case for Mindful Epistemology
T2  - SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
CP  - Southern-Journal-of-Philosophy Workshop on The Epistemology of Justice
AB  - In her 2007 book Epistemic Injustice Miranda Fricker identifies testimonial injustice as a case where a hearer assigns lower credibility to a speaker due to "identity prejudice." Fricker considers testimonial injustice as a form of epistemic injustice since it wrongs the speaker "in her capacity as a knower." Fricker recommends developing the virtue of "testimonial justice" to address testimonial injustice. She takes this virtue to involve training in a "distinctly reflexive critical social awareness." The main goal of this article is to argue that Fricker's proposed training falls short of the target and that a cultivation of the capacity of being present-the ability to be mindful-would be necessary to develop the critical social awareness that Fricker requires. I want to explore the impact of compassion and open-mindedness-virtues cultivated in mindfulness training-on testimonial justice specifically and virtue epistemology generally. In attempting to develop an epistemic account informed by mindfulness-a mindful epistemology-my primary goal is to bring Buddhist insights on how to anchor the mind by training it to be fully present and attentive into the focus of mainstream Western philosophy. More specifically, I argue that doing so allows us to appreciate the crucial role that a prediscursive level of cultivation plays in the development of testimonial justice.

KW  - Marginality
AB  - Body-image is an aggregation of bodily experiences. The consciousness of body has always been a psychological, cultural and social concern of African American people in America. The African Americans are marginalised in terms of racial discrimination, ideological prejudices and cultural stereotypes. Body-image forms one of the several ways of the individual and communal internalisation of racism and sexism. The present study seeks to explore the relation between body-image and racial marginality. To contextualise this socio-cultural phenomenon, the study evaluates Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). Caged Bird in numerous ways suggests how body-image is closely linked with the cultural education in a community and the social acceptance of the racially marginalised position. To analyse critically how racism interferes with body-consciousness, the study aims to consult the works of philosophers like Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Yancy, and Sartre; feminists like Beauvoir, Spelman, Firestone; cultural historians like Gilman; and Afro-American writers like Gayle, Jr., and Cleaver for their valuable insights of race, body, and consciousness.

AB  - Incivility and hateful language in user comments are met with growing concern among politicians, the general public, and scholars. There are fears that such comments may decrease social cohesion and ultimately result in less prosocial behavior among citizens. We investigate whether hate, or even civil negativity in user comments alone, inhibit actual prosocial behavior through recipients' explicit and implicit attitudes. In an online experiment, 253 participants read user comments (neutral, civil-negative, hateful) about refugees and received five Euros which they could donate for a refugee aid organization or keep for themselves. The results show that participants confronted with hateful or negative user comments donated less money. The effect was mediated by both explicit and implicit attitudes toward refugees with hate having a stronger influence via implicit attitudes. The results are discussed in light of possible measures for reducing the behavioral impact of negative and hateful user comments.

AB  - The history of Giovanni Falconi's career and his vaccination campaigns is two hundred years old. It is however very relevant today because of the widespread negative social opinion against vaccination at that time, opinions which seem to have re-emerged even in the current century. In his very important role of "Vaccine Conservator" (a sort of national supervisor for the quality of vaccinations), he clashed with the prejudice of the people and with the anti-scientific attitudes of some of his illustrious colleagues. He investigated how to simplify the procedure with a smallpox needle that became known as "Falconi's Needle" or "Falconian Needle". Falconi also made several experiments on smallpox vaccine preparation and was a supporter of the use of "animal" and "humanized" formulas despite the prejudice regarding the latter. Due to his profound anatomical knowledge and the strength of mind that characterized him, he was able to follow evidence-based scientific principles in his methods. Thanks to this he managed to convince people not to oppose vaccinations. He also succeeded in bringing the number of vaccinated people to exceed the number of newborns, a great achievement that led to remarkable progress in Italy and the rescue of thousands of lives throughout Europe. Unfortunately, it was not possible to find a copy of this instrument, which required the author to have the needle reconstructed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Crisis occupies an ambiguous place in the writings of Hannah Arendt. Not only does crisis undermine categories of judgment, but in doing so it eliminates prejudices as well, forcing us to judge without them. Although Arendt never had an opportunity to fully develop her understanding of judgment, we know that she considered it to be 'the most political of man's mental abilities,' and her writings on education reflect this. In her essay, 'The Crisis in Education' she draws a connection between judgment and crisis, linking it to the work of the classroom. It is this relationship, between crisis and judgment, that I examine. In doing so, I turn to two figures central to Arendt's work - Immanuel Kant and Adolf Eichmann - each of whom embody opposing aspects of what it means to judge, epitomized by a conceptual tension between example and cliche.

AB  - Mental illness is a global public health crisis. Although rates of untreated cases stand as a primary problem, stigma is a significant obstacle. Yet, global differences in levels and roots of stigma remain poorly understood. Using the Stigma in Global Context-Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS) data, we analyzed data on two components of stigma-prejudice and discriminatory potential-attached to clinically diagnostic cases of depression and schizophrenia. We examined whether stigma was higher in the East than West. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the link between prejudice and discriminatory potential in the East was due, in part, to cultural differences in the attributions about mental illness. With SGC-MHS' nationally representative vignette data from over 11,000 respondents in 11 relevant countries (four Eastern, seven Western), analyses replicated past research of higher levels of stigma and more moral attributions in Eastern countries, particularly for depression. Moreover, prejudice-related disclosure spillover concerns predicted discriminatory potential (social distance) in the East, but not the West; this was driven by a greater emphasis on moral attributions in the East. Finally, exploratory analyses found that Western respondents endorsed higher discrimination for minority (vs. majority) group members with mental illness. In Eastern countries, the same pattern emerged for schizophrenia, but the reverse occurred for depression-greater stigma for majority as compared with minority group members. Together, these findings suggest that cultural differences in the sources of prejudice and attributions about the etiology of mental illness contribute, at least in part, to global differences in the profile of stigma.

AB  - Although sympathy is a powerful other-focused motivation, not all individuals will experience sympathy when it is appropriate. Immigrants, as a disadvantaged out-group, are especially in need of sympathy and, given the tensions of the immigration debate, are at-risk for low sympathy. Indeed, past research has found that sympathy is less likely to be experienced toward disliked out-groups. In the current research, we investigated the role of need for closure (NFC), or the general desire for epistemic certainty, on the experience of sympathy toward immigrants in Italy, a nation where the immigration debate is becoming increasingly fractious. Consistent with past research on the roles of NFC and the binding moral foundations (i.e., a concern for the well-being of groups) on prejudice toward out-groups, we propose that individuals with a high NFC, and who endorsed the binding moral foundations (i.e., a concern for the well-being of groups), would be particularly likely to have decreased sympathy toward immigrants in Italy. In line with past research and our hypotheses, in three studies we found that the binding foundations mediated the NFC effect on decreased sympathy toward immigrants in Italy. Conceptually, these individuals can strongly adopt traditional cultural norms as a way to acquire stable knowledge; this can make sympathy toward immigrants less likely, as they both stand outside "traditional" morality, as well can threaten the stability of natives' knowledge.

AB  - We introduce a cross-national survey experimental design which combines three different sources of potential variation in migration attitudes - migrant characteristics, native respondent characteristics and national context. Our survey experiment tests the impact of randomly assigned cues for migrant skills (professional or unskilled) and origins (European or non-European) in twenty-one national contexts. In order to make the origins cue both contextually relevant while retaining comparability across contexts, we use the largest poorer European and non-European source countries for migrants in each country as our origins cue. We find that the 'skills premium' observed in previous research is universal - in all of our contexts native respondents are more willing to accept skilled professional migrants than unskilled migrants, but with considerable variation in effect size between countries. We find that a significant preference for European over non-European migrants exists in the majority of our countries, but varies a great deal between contexts, and is insignificant in several countries, suggesting that this 'European premium' is more contingent than the 'skills premium'. The two treatment effects are unrelated at the national level, and show only a modest interaction at the individual level, suggesting preferences for high skills and European origins are largely independent of each other. We find no evidence that treatment effects are related to views about the overall impact of immigration at the national level or the individual level. However, some individual attitudes - in particular racial prejudice, social distance and support for anti-discrimination legislation - predict variation in responses to the experimental cues.

AB  - Field experiments have provided ample evidence of ethnic and racial discrimination in the labour market. Less is known about how discrimination varies in multi-ethnic societies, where the ethnic composition of populations is different across locations. Inter-group contact and institutional arrangements for ethnic minorities can mitigate the sense of group threat and reduce discrimination. To provide empirical evidence of this, we conduct a field experiment of ethnic discrimination in Russia with a sample of over 9,000 job applications. We compare ethnically homogeneous cities and cities with ethnically mixed populations and privileged institutional status of ethnic minorities. We find strong discrimination against visible minorities in the former but much weaker discrimination in the latter. These findings demonstrate how institutions and historical contexts of inter-group relations can affect ethnic prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Background Social attitudes to transgender persons and other gender minorities vary around the world, and in many cultures, prejudices and social stigma are common. Consequently, transgender persons face challenges related to discrimination and negative attitudes among the public. The purpose of this study was to compare life satisfaction, loneliness, mental health, and suicidal behavior among transgender students with cisgender students' experiences in a nationwide sample of Norwegian students pursuing higher education. Methods In total,50,054 full-time Norwegian students completed an online questionnaire (response rate 30.8%), of whom 15,399 were cisgender males, 34,437 cisgender females, 28 individuals who reported being binary transgender (12 transwomen and 16 transmen), and 69 individuals non-binary transgender persons. The measures included questions concerning gender identity, life satisfaction (Satisfaction With Life Scale), loneliness (The Three-Item Loneliness Scale), mental health problems (Hopkins Symptoms Check List), mental disorders, and suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and self-harm. Chi-square tests, Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis tests, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine differences between gender identities. Results Transgender students reported significantly more psychosocial burdens on all measures. There were no significant differences in any of the measures between the binary and non-binary transgender students. Conclusion The findings call for increased awareness about welfare and health for transgender students in Norway. Higher education institutions need to consider measures at various levels to establish a learning environment that is more inclusive for gender minorities.

AB  - Few studies have examined to what extent commonly held stereotypes reflect real intergroup differences in motivational goals. Taking a values perspective (Schwartz et al., 2012), the study examines value preferences among Jews and Russians in Russia, to assess the extent to which commonly held stereotypes reflect values of group members. Results showed that Jews reported substantially higher levels of universalism-tolerance, benevolence (both caring and dependability), and tradition values, and lower levels of power (both dominance and resources), and universalism-nature values, than Russians. Results indicated that the widespread Jewish stereotypes of power, achievement, and rootlessness/cosmopolitanism are ungrounded, while the stereotypes of liberalism and particularism are upheld by the reported differences in the value preferences between Jews and the majority population in Russia. The present study underscores the importance of value comparisons between ethnic minority and majority groups for understanding their motivational goals and thus fighting prejudices and discrimination.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the process of Internalized Sexual Stigma (ISS) in a sample of Egyptian gay men. Participants' experience of ISS was explained using the theoretical understanding that it represents an internal form of minority stress, which is the excess and harmful stress often experienced by individuals from stigmatized social categories due to their minority position. Thematic analysis of interviews with eight Egyptian gay males suggested that these men experienced internal minority stress as a result of the sexually-prejudiced messages they received from different sectors of their society, including its non-affirming religious institutions. Moreover, thematic analysis added cultural understanding to this theoretical explanation by producing an emerging theme that highlighted the possible role of societal pressure to meet gender expectations in perpetuating this problem. Recommendations for mental health professionals who conduct clinical interventions with gay men from diverse populations are provided.

AB  - Size scholars routinely discuss the negative effects of fat stigma within youth culture. For example, fat kids are more likely to be bullied than their thinner peers, increasing their risk for depression, loneliness, anxiety, and behavior problems. These studies, however, do not adequately address kids' active resistance to fatphobia and size discrimination. In this chapter, I highlight the importance of kids' resistance work at Girls Rock Camp. Pulling from my own experiences as a (fat) camp counselor, I explore the different ways campers push-back against fat stereotypes. While this push-back creates dialogue around size privilege and oppression, organizational obstacles for fat bodies result in conflicting messages about body positivity. Kids challenge size discrimination on an interpersonal level by showing their stomachs, writing anti-shame lyrics, and criticizing unrealistic beauty standards. Adult volunteers, though, continue to navigate organizational sizeism through inaccessible seating, a culture of fat talk, and anti-fat emotional labor. I argue that while Girls Rock Camp indeed helps kids fight against fat prejudice within youth culture, it simultaneously privileges thin adult bodies at an organizational level.

AB  - Cosmopolitanism and its application for education in western societies has been well examined. Yet cosmopolitanism in society and in education has not been systematically explored in many Asian societies. Facing a large number of people from diverse backgrounds, the society and its education system in Hong Kong are troubled by issues similar to those found in western postindustrial societies, related to cultural and national belonging and identity. Prejudice and racism towards ethnic minorities - particularly those from South Asia and Africa, is quite common. Additionally, animosity and hostility to mainland Chinese newcomers has increased and intensified in the context of Hong Kong's "repoliticization" after its 1997 handover. This article aims to explore how cosmopolitanism is understood, valued, and approached in Hong Kong education. We start by exploring the role of decolonization and nationalization in political education in Hong Kong. We then discuss cosmopolitanism, and consider how it impacts particular social and educational issues in Hong Kong. We also provide an analysis of discourses on cosmopolitanism taken from Hong Kong General Studies and History textbooks, to identify challenges faced in facilitating cosmopolitan values, a balance of identities, and global citizenship in Hong Kong education.

AB  - A series of policy decisions beginning in 1965 produced an exclusionist climate in the United States. Lyndon Johnson sought to eliminate prejudice from the nation's immigration system but inadvertently curtailed opportunities for legal entry from Mexico that created a large undocumented population. In waging the Cold War, Ronald Reagan launched an intervention in Central America that displaced many more thousands who also became undocumented residents. The Wars on Crime and Drugs of Presidents Nixon and Reagan created a prison industrial complex that imprisoned blacks and Hispanics. George Bush's War on Terror unleashed a rising tide of deportations swept Latino migrants into the immigrant detention system. Finally, President Trump transformed a humanitarian problem affecting Central American families and children into a manufactured immigration crisis for the nation as a whole. The result is among the most repressive and exclusionist context of immigrant reception in American history.

AB  - Despite increased attention among geographers to the diversity of spaces that can constitute informal sites of education, theater in general and spectacles more specifically have garnered relatively little geographical interest. In response, this paper draws upon Paulo Freire's philosophy to examine how the two major productions of the Zionist activist Meyer Weisgal-The Romance of a People and The Eternal Road-aimed to challenge historic representations of Jews by more powerful groups while raising funds and support for the Zionist cause. Although the shows were unable to hinder the Nazi threat, Freire's pedagogy demonstrates their power in enabling those subjected to prejudice to develop a voice, raise awareness of social and political concerns, and attract wider support. Consequently, spectacles' educational potential in disseminating ideologies and facilitating learning and empathetic relations within and between groups must be acknowledged.

TI  - Life-Stories of Labour Migrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina: Balkanist Discourse(s), Liminality and Integration
T2  - JOURNAL OF BALKAN AND NEAR EASTERN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The paper focuses on the role of the 'Balkanist discourse', as a collection of negative prejudices on the Balkan people and cultures, in constructing the individual and collective identities of labour migrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Particular emphasis is given to investigating to what extent the Balkanist discourse meta-narrative affects the integration of the labour migrants in host countries' societies and their reintegration into BiH upon their temporary or permanent return. Based on an analytical model that emphasizes the mutual conditionality of everyday and public discourses, i.e. the typology of Balkanist discourse variations, this study undertakes a discourse analysis of the life stories of 10 young labour migrants from BiH. The research results show that variations of the Balkanist discourse are a dominant referential framework for the migrants in interpreting their own experience and social phenomena in both host country and BiH, regardless of the migrants embracing these Balkanist discourse stereotypes as part of their personal identity or feeling resistance towards them.

AB  - In order for adolescents to learn about sex and relationships, the education must be of significance and meet their needs and interests. The study investigated adolescents' conceptions of learning and education about sex and relationships. A phenomenographic approach was used. Six focus group interviews were conducted with adolescents ages 18-19 in Sweden. The results showed that stable ground for learning implies select issues of importance, that is, values and prejudices, up-to-date knowledge, and practical skills. These issues should be dispersed throughout the school years in relation to the students' own maturity. This seemed to enable internalization of different aspects of sex and relationships. Learning about sex and relationships can create meaning for youth and generate progress by fostering autonomy and identity, correcting misconceptions, counteract prejudices, not in isolation rather in society in a defined culture.

AB  - This paper explores women's activism and political engagement in contemporary Pakistan. In this exploration with self-identified liberal and conservative groups of women, emerged their experiences and narratives about Feminism and Nationalism with a common moderator being religious affiliations. In this qualitative and phenomenological exploration, the informants belonged to various self-identified liberal and conservative women-led organizations. To this end, 20 women (age-range 23-48 years) were interviewed. Results indicated that gender roles and feminism were seen very differently between the two groups; gender and national identity were closely associated with Islamic values and there was a negative association between nationalism and feminist ideology. Women from liberal organizations, mostly feminists, emphasized pro-public-sphere engagement of women, rebelling against religious fundamentalism. On the contrary, many self-reported conservative women proclaimed nationalist, antifeminists (they did not identify as Islamic feminists) and pro-private-sphere engagement of women. Many of the liberal informants complained about Pakistan's misogynistic society and hurdles they faced in demanding equal opportunities for women. This research has implications for gender equality and female identity in the context of nationalism, women's mobility and entitlement to the public sphere. The study also has applied significance for prejudices and stereotypes that make it difficult for women, to break away from fixed categories of gender role expectations. This paper informs academics and practitioners on socially and politically engaged Pakistani women's views regarding these narratives. The study concluded that women's activism is influenced by their religious views and their religious interpretation of feminism and nationalism in Pakistani society.

AB  - Few studies have investigated the reasons why pregnant and puerperal women fail to seek or accept treatment for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries, where there is a high prevalence of this disorder. To help fill this gap, this study investigated the factors influencing the decision not to seek or to refuse treatment for perinatal depression in a low-income community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Qualitative research was conducted in two primary health care units in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2017-2018. Five focus groups were held with 26 women. Convenience sampling was used, and the sample size was determined by data saturation. A content analysis methodology was used to identify theme categories to objectively describe the group's manifest contents. Ten categories were obtained: stigma and misconception, self-image as a mother, socioeconomic stigma, lack of knowledge, lack of a health service approach to mental health, difficulty recognising depression symptoms, fear of children being removed, negative reaction to patient referral, denial of the problem and previous experience with the care unit. Perinatal depression is permeated with stigma and prejudice, and there is a belief that women with depression are unable to be good mothers. It is important to conduct programmes disseminating information about perinatal depression and implementing an approach that includes routine consultations so that women can access perinatal mental health services.

KW  - CONSTRUCTION
AB  - Studies of accounting in prisons have documented how the dominance of neo-liberal preferences in the management of prison systems has meant a focus on measuring cost-effectiveness and discharging accountability in a way which ignores important aspects of prison life such as decency and rehabilitation. The present work recognises the need for accounting studies to unmask the prejudiced, interested and potentially socially damaging use of accounting in prison reform by exposing how accounting is often a tool which can be used to discipline individuals consistent with the values of economic and political elites within a society. By applying a Foucauldian lens to the analysis of the prison systems of the major Italian States in the early 19th century, the study shows how accounting was an essential aid in ensuring that the correction of individuals was carried out consistent with the moral priorities of the liberal bourgeois society of the time. The specific visibilities created by means of accounting, upon which decisions on the life of prisoners were made and which still characterise modern prisons, reduced human life to a simplistic numerical representation. These were then used to reconstruct 'deviant' individuals as productive, obedient citizens, regardless of their specific circumstances. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Literary studies could get the reset that many realize the field needs by a refreshed attention to language-language understood not through the lenses of philology, Saussure, structuralism, poststructuralism, speech act theory, or Chomsky, but through Daniel Dor's bold, compelling, and generous new theory of language as "the instruction of imagination." Literary studies have missed much through not having a sufficiently searching and comprehensive theory of language to work with, one that pays due attention to the phenomenology of experience, the centrality of imagination, and the frailty, the fallibility, and the ongoing social negotiations of language. The contrasting examples are familiar-the openings of Bleak House, Pride and Prejudice, and Shakespeare's Sonnet 1-both to compensate for the novelty of the linguistic theory and to suggest how Dor's account of language can open up new perspectives on and new implications of what we already know well.

AB  - Objective To explore medical student perceptions and experiences of gender bias within medical education. Setting Gender bias-'prejudiced actions or thoughts based on the perception that women are not equal to men'-is a widespread issue. Within medicine, the pay gap, under-representation of women in senior roles and sexual harassment are among the most concerning issues demonstrating its presence and impact. While research investigating experiences of clinicians is gaining traction, investigation of medical students' experiences is lacking. This qualitative study analyses medical students' experiences of gender bias within their education to discern any patterns to this bias. Illuminating the current state of medical education gender bias will hopefully highlight areas in which student experience could be improved. Constructivist thematic analysis was used to analyse data, informed by William's patterns of gender bias, intersectional feminism and communities of practice theory. Participants Thirty-two medical students from multiple UK medical schools participated in individual interviews. Nine faculty members were also interviewed to triangulate data. Results Gender bias has an overt presence during medical student education, manifesting in line with William's patterns of bias, impacting career aspirations. Physical environments serve to manifest organisational values, sending implicit messages regarding who is most welcome-currently, this imagery remains 'too male, too pale horizontal ellipsis too stale'. Existing gender initiatives require careful scrutiny, as this work identifies the superficial application of positive action, and a failure to affect meaningful change. Conclusions Despite progress having been made regarding overt gender discrimination, implicit bias persists, with existing positive action inadequate in promoting the advancement of women. Institutions should mandate participation in implicit bias education programmes for all staff and must strive to revise the imagery within physical environments to better represent society. Gender initiatives, like Athena Scientific Women's Academic Network, also require large-scale evaluation regarding their impact, which this work found to be lacking.

AB  - Mahesh Dattani is one of the leading Indian dramatists who responded to the problems of sexuality on the canvass of Indian theatre. He examined various facets of subjugation and marginalization rampant in Indian society. His plays focus on the sub-urban Hindu family and its trifle with gender and alternate sexuality. His plots revolve around the damaging implications of patriarchal constructs and his characters strive for liberty and self-satisfaction beneath hegemonic masculinity, compulsive heteronormativity and prejudiced cultural domain. Regarding his famous play Dance Like a Man, this paper critically examines the existing socio-cultural domain which practices politics of exclusion of androgynous identities behind the facade of peacefully cohabiting heterosexual Indian family and shows how Dattani, has remarkably countered the presentation of the polarized association of gender roles with conventional practice through performance of his protagonist. Set against the backdrop of patriarchal mindset, this paper delineates that the victim of patriarchal norms is not a woman but a man, who has traits of androgyny. It gives a brief account to highlight the significance of androgyny and portrays how androgyny is directly proportional to creativity. It elucidates how androgynous men undergo searing experiences of stigma and social untouchability in a traditional setup and how patriarchal norms reinforce dominant powers of society to stunt the growth of their personality.

AB  - Objective: Assess components of the Psychosocial Attention Network (RAPS) in crack user care in a Rio Grande do Sul municipality. Method: Qualitative study based on Fourth Generation Evaluation. Data collection occurred in 2014, through participating observation and interviews based on the Hermeneutic-Dialectic Circle. Ten uses, eleven family members, seven managers and eight workers at a Psychosocial Attention Center participated. The Constant Comparative Method was used for data analysis. Results: Difficulties were observed in the network articulation with the general hospital, due to prejudice and the lack of structure of the team. SAMU's (Mobile Emergency Care Service) dependence on the Military Brigade for the service indicates a frailty of the network. The need to re-think the way therapeutic farms operate in the network is a consensus. Conclusion: RAPS is being implemented and its concretization depends on the involvement of professionals, managers and social control of users and family members.

AB  - Sustainability in tourism assumes the balance among the economic, environmental, cultural, and social dimensions that intervene in its activities to optimize its benefits, without any prejudice to society and the environment. In this sense, there is a worldwide movement to make the tourism sector agents aware, with the intention of broadening sustainable and practical actions. With this perspective, this study aimed to verify the current state of the activities performed by the tourism sector in Brazil regarding the determinations (criteria, principles and goals) developed by national and international institutions. Through descriptive research with a quantitative approach, stakeholders linked to the Brazilian tourism sector participated in this study. The results showed that in Brazil there is still a need for more involvement and cooperation among residents, tourists and tourism operators linked to the tourism sector, with a commitment to sustainably balance the economic, environmental, cultural and social dimensions of its activities. It was also found that the environmental dimension was portrayed as having the least compliance with sustainability, that is, the activities of the Brazilian tourism sector are the ones that are the most deficient and require the largest investment.

KW  - PSYCHOANALYSIS
AB  - Child psychotherapists regularly find themselves working across 'cultural difference', yet this reality is given little thought in trainings, be it in supervision, teaching, or in the training analysis. A growing body of literature in the psychotherapy professions emphasises the great anxiety provoked by 'cultural difference', and the ensuing defences that are ordinarily employed by individuals; this literature identifies an urgent need for psychotherapists to find more consistently thoughtful ways to engage with issues of race, culture and social class differences. Using Bourdieu's concept of 'habitus' to build a working definition of 'cultural difference' and a psychosocial methodology, I interviewed eight child psychotherapists to ask what fantasies about working with 'cultural difference' we might hold. Thematic analysis identified two fantasy structures: 'Difference as Dangerous', in which 'cultural difference' is variously associated with all kinds of badness, including sexual perversion, violence, child abuse, neglect and shame; and 'the Profession in Peril', in which it was felt that the child psychotherapy profession is threatened by 'cultural differences', both from without and from within. Using discourse analysis, two further fantasies were examined: 'Neutrality' in the therapist, in which the therapist is imagined to transcend 'cultural difference'; and 'The Location of Difference', in which it is imagined that one person in a pairing contains all the 'difference' and its negative associations, while the other is felt to be 'normal'. These four fantasies show how powerful projections are able to enter the consulting room. There is an urgent need for the child psychotherapy profession to give thought to 'cultural difference', in order to avoid reproducing prejudiced stances; this becomes imperative, as issues of 'cultural difference' become more politically explosive.

AB  - Aims and Objectives: The finishing and polishing of removable orthodontic appliances can produce acrylic dust containing methyl methacrylate, which is potentially prejudicial to health. The aim of this study was to determine the average amount of acrylic dust produced by the finishing and polishing processes involved in removable orthodontic appliance fabrication and the associated risk factors. Materials and Methods: This descriptive observational study constituted samples of 93 orthodontic appliances (62 upper orthodontic plates and 31 lower orthodontic plates) manufactured by sixth semester students of the Dental Technology Study Program, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, Indonesia, between February and May 2016, which satisfied the criteria. The amount of acrylic dust produced was calculated on the basis of the difference between the weight of an orthodontic plate after acrylic processing and the weight after finishing and polishing. Data were tested statistically using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney test, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test with P value < 0.05 and performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 24.0. Results: The results showed that the average acrylic dust produced in the fabrication of a removable orthodontic appliance was 1.23g (range, 0.29-3.54g). The average acrylic dust produced by the upper orthodontic plate (1.34g) was greater than that of the lower plate (0.94g). Results also showed that the finishing process produced more acrylic dust (0.94g) than the polishing process (0.27g). Conclusion: The acrylic dust produced by the removable orthodontic appliance production process undertaken by sixth semester Dental Technology students at Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, Indonesia, had an average weight of 1.21g. The finishing process produced more acrylic dust in comparison to the polishing process. Students' skill in producing orthodontic appliances and orthodontic plate design represents a major factor affecting the amount of acrylic dust produced.

AB  - Purpose. Based on the anthropocentric approach to the analysis of visual self-presentations of Artemisia Gentileschi in paintings, to present the artwork as self-objectifications of the artist, which give rise to a new cultural reality and are at the same time a means of knowing the essence of man. Theoretical basis. The principles and methods of philosophical and anthropological research in combination with biographical, historical and comparative, iconographic, figurative and stylistic methods were used when writing the article. Among philosophical and anthropological methods the principle of anthropological reduction was used, based on which the works by Artemisia Gentileschi were analyzed as her self-objectification, principle of extrapolation of a separate fact (rape) of the painter's life and anthropological interpretation of art evolution, when an attempt is made to know their creator through a series of chronological consistent works as figurative objectification. The biographical method was used when working with data on the painter's life, iconographic and figurative stylistic (techniques of composition, narrative, color characteristics) - when analyzing the art visuals: self-portraits, allegories and narrative paintings. The analytical work was carried out in stages as transition from an iconographic interpretation of paintings with gradual elimination of art and style characteristics as extra-anthropological cultural constants with subsequent anthropological reduction of cultural image. Originality consists in the author's method of analyzing the works of visual art in terms of anthropocentric approach, as well as in considering the artwork by Artemisia Gentileschi as her self-objectification as such that give rise to a new cultural reality. Conclusions. The artworks by Artemisia Gentileschi in diachronic deployment can be seen as the painter's self-objectification, which traces the evolution of self-expression from a person with traditional self-perception by social gender stereotypes (1610) to the phenomenon of personal life, which will determine further evolution of her self-identification (rape in 1611) and extirpation of sense of shame through virtual revenge (self-expression in the cycle of Judith), repentance ( cycle of Mary Magdalene), guilt (cycle of Lucretia), and formation of component of the painter's identity as exemption from social gender prejudices and stereotypes on roles and standards of behavior socially assigned to women (cycle of Susanna).

AB  - This article examines the case of La Palmada en la Frente (1970), a one-issue political cartoon magazine, drawn and written by cartoonist Lugoze and produced in the context of a scare campaign against the possible election of the socialist Salvador Allende (1969-1970). This ephemeral document belonged to a larger group of publications that used humor and cartoons as ideological weapons. An extensive examination of this source allows a recast of the relationship between popular culture and politics in the Chilean experience of the global sixties. This essay argues that political cartoons work as a portal through which to understand behaviors, social problems, prejudices, fears, stereotypes, and myths that can enforce and challenge the study of Latin American popular culture and the sixties.

AB  - Based on the social-cognitive information processing model and the theory of normative beliefs, this study tests if garners normalise aggression in games, and whether these normative beliefs explain their aggressive behaviour in games. Experimental cross sectional, worldwide data was collected through an online survey of garners (N = 1646). Participants were randomly assigned to read a vignette describing an instance of verbal harassment occurring either online (within a multiplayer game) or offline (within a board game cafe) and were asked how acceptable and tolerable they found the harassment. There was a significant moderate main effect of context which indicated that harassment was perceived as more normal in the online gaming scenario. Normative beliefs about cyberaggression significantly predicted both general and prejudiced cyberaggression. Additionally, normative beliefs partially mediated the relationship between age and general cyberaggression (small effect) and gender and general cyberaggression (large effect). As normative beliefs are dynamic and modifiable, cyberaggression prevention and intervention efforts should include modification of beliefs which support the legitimacy and acceptability of cyberaggression in games. These findings provide insight into how gamer culture around acceptability of trash talk relates to toxicity in games and suggest directions for further research.

AB  - Social workers have an ethical duty to recognize and support each person's spiritual identity and ameliorate diverse forms of religious bias. These ethnical mandates are increasingly salient in light of recent Federal Bureau of Investigation data indicating that Jews, Muslims, Christians, and other people of faith are frequent victims of hate crimes. These discriminatory actions do not occur in a vacuum, but are legitimized by widely disseminated, subtly detrimental messages-commonly referred to as microaggressions. To assist social workers in identifying and counteracting these negative messages, this article delineates seven types of spiritual microaggressions that are frequently encountered in societal discourse. It concludes by offering some suggestions to help create a society that upholds and defends each person's spiritual integrity and well-being.

AB  - This paper argues against dismissing as 'populist nationalism' every positive view of one's nation and ignoring patriotism as its antithesis. The European nation exists in two senses: as a large 'social group', a community of real people, and as an abstract community of cultural values promoted by intellectual elites grounded in a humanities-based education. The widespread prejudice that condemns every positive expression of one's relationship to the nation has proved counterproductive because it has prompted ever stronger spontaneous reactions in the form of primitive nationalistic egoism. This has weakened the commitment people feel towards their nation and the humanistic potential that the nation possesses as a cultural community of values. Consequently, anti-national European intellectual elites bear some responsibility - along with those preaching neoliberal individualism - for the success of populist demagogues and the decline in patriotic values. Given the state of education today, a revival of humanist culture for national elites seems impossible, making the continued rise of primitive nationalism appear unstoppable.

Inspired by the Malay proverb "Diluah mati mak, ditelan mati bapa" (Malay for 'between the devil and the deep sea), this study looked into local literature in relation to powerlessness and its social complexity where we argue that the Malays are often caught in-between entanglements that prohibit individualism, as due to societal prejudice.
   Methodology: This study employed thematic analysis where upon familiarizing with Azhari's short stories, namely Mariah and of Bunga Telur and Bally shoes, the researchers identified themes that help understand the types and causes of powerlessness as illustrated in the short stories before associating the Malays' state of powerlessness and their emotional suppression.
   Findings: Findings revealed that both genders suffer from the Malay prejudice and their own lack of emotional strength, causing both to be powerless captives in different contexts, unlike the Western societies where similar situations might lead to alienation.
   Contributions: The study contributed towards the understanding of social phenomenon, namely issues regarding powerlessness among the Malays. Such contribution is significant at developing potentials within building national talent, especially those regarding family and spiritual values.

AB  - Persons living with dementia and their carers experience stigma. Stigma intensifies social exclusion and threatens health and well-being. Decreasing stigma associated with dementia is a public health priority across national and international settings and is a key component of National Dementia Strategies. Research-based drama is an effective public health strategy for reducing stigma and enhancing well-being. In this article we focus on survey data from an evaluation of a research-based drama called Cracked: new light on dementia. Our analysis illustrates the effectiveness of Cracked in reducing stigma by: decreasing health care practitioners' and family carers' prejudice, fostering critical reflection about relational practices, and fostering a commitment to individual and collective action to address stigma. Cracked is well-positioned to respond to urgent calls for culture change, which include reducing societal misconceptions and stereotypes around dementia and promoting inclusive and meaningful engagement of persons living with dementia across all levels of society.

AB  - This article adopts a comparative approach to examine the ways in which both novels explore the theme of alienation in relation to questions of gender and race through the spatial strategies of the novels; of particular importance in my investigation is the act of walking in the city, and the forms of escape that two leading characters in the novels-Nell and Mr Ma-adopt in order to react against the social reality of the metropolis of London. My focus of inquiry, while choosing two works that are not often put together for analysis, also departs from previous studies that often focus on the two writers' use of humor and characterization, elements of which Lao She had acknowledged the inspiration that he drew from Charles Dickens's novels. I argue in this article that it is the spatial articulation of the two novels, and the characters' response to the various prejudices of their time and the constraints that they face as de facto "outsider" to the city that constitute the major connection between the two writers, both of whom drew inspiration from the city for their artistic composition and social critique.

AB  - By considering the theory of basic values, several studies have considered the different underlying value patterns of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Recently, the value theory has been developed into a finer set of conceptually distinct values. Specifically, the same key assumptions have been retained, but 19 instead of 10 motivationally distinct values have been distinguished. The aim of the present research is to analyze the relationship between ideological and value orientations, using the refined theory of basic values. In line with previous studies, it was hypothesized that SDO would be mainly placed on the self-enhancement vs. self-transcendence value opposition, while RWA on that of the conservation vs. openness to change. Results on two hundred participants confirm the hypotheses. In particular, dominant people are characterized by a sense of superiority, supremacy, and unfairness, while authoritarian people by the perception of social instability and passive conformism with rules and laws. Moreover, by considering the underlying dimensions of both RWA and SDO, our results provide evidence of some differences existing in their mirror on specific value priorities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   This paper aims to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental distress of the Vietnamese students in the USA. We explore different root causes of mental distress among international students who are away from their home country, their loved ones, and being isolated from school and community due to this outbreak.
   DESIGN
   In-depth interviews were conducted to probe the reasons for mental stress during the pandemic and the narrative textual analysis was subsequently performed to analyze the results. This research includes the interviews of 20 Vietnamese students in the USA during the COVID-19 era.
   RESULTS
   The textual analysis showed that the mental distress of these Vietnamese students were caused by limited access to on-campus facilities and activities, limited access to public services including grocery shopping, transportations, clinics, the possibility of being infected, isolated living condition due to the lockdown order, and inability to go back to the home country when wanted.
   CONCLUSIONS
   We found that both physical attributes (e.g., living condition, internet difficulty, overwhelmed healthcare system, restricted traveling, lack of personal interaction, limited access to public services) and psychological factors (e.g., anxiety of unfamiliar teaching modality, fear of viral infection, uncertain career aspects, cultural barrier and prejudice) directly led to the mental distress of these students. Moreover, other factors such as turbulent future job markets and potential racism toward Asians in relation with "Chinese virus" may cause the mental distress of these students.

AB  - Objective: to analyze the perception of workers and managers about the psychosocial care network in a medium-sized municipality in the inlands of the state of Minas Gerais. Method: qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study involving twelve participants from different points of the network. The semi-structured interviews were analyzed in the light of Pierre Bourdieu's framework of constructionist structuralism. Results: the actions offered by the services were based on the perspectives of resocialization, user embracement, group and multiprofessional care, and on approaches to harm reduction, recreation and daily organization. These were configured as the network resources/capital. Tensions were identified in family embracement and in relationships between families and users, as well as in the prejudice towards people with mental disorders. Final considerations: the social agents were willing to contribute to processes of change in order to overcome the focus on specialties, the lack of training of some teams, lack of infrastructure and of some components, especially those related to leisure and community life.

AB  - Public stigma associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly stems from judgments surrounding sensory overload symptoms. As individuals try and make sense of observed disordered behaviors of those with ASD, they are quick to develop dispositional attributions instead of acknowledging situational instigators. Interventions aimed at educating the lay public that disordered actions are a result of a biological causes have been successful in lessening perceptions of responsibility, yet foster an out-group perspective allowing prejudice attitudes and discriminatory behaviors to persist. The present study examines the short-term effectiveness of engagement with a virtual simulation, Auti-Sim, to combat stigma by giving lay people a first-person experience of sensory overload. To assess Auti-Sim, a between-subject, in-laboratory experimental design was employed. A total of 123 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions (virtual simulation engagement, observation of simulation engagement, or reading text vignettes). Participants completed a brief pretest questionnaire, encountered the intervention, and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Engagement with the virtual simulation resulted in heightened perspective taking, which subsequently increased emotional concern, helping intentions, and willingness to volunteer compared with the observation only or text vignette intervention. Positive attitudes toward those with ASD did not differ across interventions. Fostering a different understanding of disordered action through a virtual simulation has the potential to elicit perspective taking and subsequent empathetic outcomes. Perspective taking seems to encourage perceptions of in-group belonging rather than out-group categorization and thus might be a desired outcome for stigma-reducing efforts.

AB  - This paper is an attempt to point out how John Updike's novel The Coup (1978) conforms to the traditional Western notions and conventions about Africa and Africans. The methodology of this paper involves a textual analysis of The Coup whereby significant passages from the novel are cited and elucidated with regard to the ideas of Orientalism as a discourse to reveal how Updike employs such a discourse to render a distorted image of Africa and African cultures as he draws heavily on stereotypes and traditional prejudices as embodiment of the darker side of the human psyche. At the same time, this paper is meant to point out the seemingly authoritative stance of Updike through the sources he consults and the techniques he utilizes to endow his negative discourse with a tone of authority, knowledge, and expertise. This seemingly authentic stance provides Updike with the means to adopt a superior, Western voice of power in the creation of truth with regard to Africa as a nation and to the East/West relationship as a dichotomy. As the novel relates, Updike not only justifies the American intervention in Africa, but he does injustice to the humanity of the African personality which he diminished through racist stereotyping. It is, therefore, through utilizing this Orientalist/postcolonial approach and relevant data that this paper concludes that Updike displays absolutely no insight into the characters involved in this novel. Instead, he weaves African colonialism, Islam, the Cold War, socialism, capitalism, and exploitation of every variety into a novel with a few too many characters that are explored just enough to make them into two-dimensional cartoons of real human beings. As such, Updike's The Coup is no more than an attempt to assert the authority of the West, specifically the United States, as a superpower that surpasses the Soviet Union in its control over Africa and African resources.

AB  - In the framework of linguistic or national minorities in Europe, the Friulian case can be considered, from several points of view, an exemplary one. This applies not only to the historical development of its minoritisation and to the steadiness of its claims to recognition and protection but also to the way, during the last decades, that the community has been trying to promote its language and concretely affirm those fundamental rights related to the use of the language itself, through laws and actions of language policy and planning.
   The contribution aims to present the Friulian case, illustrating the evolution of legislation and policies and identifying their impact on the language itself, its formal and informal use, its social presence, the community's legitimation, self-representation and delimitation, and the establishment of language rights.
   It is an interesting path with noteworthy results. It is also a discontinuous itinerary, with ups and downs, in which most of the protection rules (Law 482/1999 and the Regional ones 15/1996 and 29/2007) have not found real application.
   Therefore, the language is still excluded from several fundamental contexts and, despite some encouraging data coming from the most recent sociolinguistic research, its public use and its presence in education and in the media are still victims of old prejudices, which inspire the contradictory choices of political and institutional decision-makers.
   Friulian is at the same time a resistant and emerging language and a strongly minoritized one.

TI  - MORAL PAROCHIALISM AND THE LIMITS OF IMPARTIALITY
T2  - HEYTHROP JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - One of the central problems of contemporary political and moral thought is how to reconcile the cultural and social roots of morality with its objectivity or rational warrant, whether in the personal or political sphere. David Golemboski's reconstruction of Adam Smith's impartial spectator (European Journal of Political Theory, onlinefirst February 23rd 2015) provides a useful first approximation to this problem. What interests me is not whether Golemboski's critique of Smith's impartial spectator hits the mark, but rather, to what extent Golemboski's reconstruction of Smith's impartial spectator succeeds at addressing the problem of moral parochialism, as Golemboski claims. I shall argue in what follows that upon examination, Golemboski's reconstructed impartial spectator, far from resolving the problem of moral parochialism, actually exposes the limits of the value of impartiality as a resource for overcoming parochial prejudice, and the necessity of framing the problem of parochialism less as a matter of social and cultural bias than as a matter of the conditions of possibility of sound moral judgment.

AB  - If we look through the history of mankind, we will realize that this planet has been the birthplace of human beings who by presenting their valuable thoughts have created changes in the life of humanity. One of them is Ahmad Jaam, who Less attention has been paid to introducing his moral, philosophical and philosophical thoughts, which this has led to the failure to identify and introducing him in some of the important books of theosophical men and Iranian thinkers. Therefore, this article prompted the introduction of his thoughts and mentality. Ahmad Jaam is a social thinker and reformer and a righteous Sufi and pure believer, a liberated man with ethical and philosophical and Shari'ah mystical thoughts who believes seeking the guidance of the Shari'ah as a way of treating moral diseases in the community. He is the advocate of establishing the justice in society and creation of unity among peoples and with the spirit that is devoid of any religious prejudice, put the basis on peace and compromise with the followers of all religions and sects. He looks the same at Zoroastrianism, Christian, Jew and Idolater, and Muslim. And he writes, "Submissive of anywhere is dear. It may be among the Zoroastrianism and the Jew and Christian and the wicked wherever are wicked, if it is in the Kaaba". He spent most of his life on the awakening of the audience and in a fight against ignorance and Sufi seeming of the Khanqaha, cortical mystics and erudite seeming of his era.

AB  - As the largest minority group in the United States, Latinas/os have experienced a long history of discrimination, prejudice, and stigmatization as gang members. A contemporary survey of law enforcement agencies reported that Latinos continue to be the largest proportion of any racial or ethnic group involved in gangs. To describe such a pattern, the framework of settler colonialism will be utilized to describe differential experiences based on race, gender, and how structural inequalities vary by region and time. Latinas/os have been particularly impacted by segregation, second-class treatment, and policies considered racially neutral. Gangs provide a topical area for examining patterns of racialization and social control. The authors of this article will outline the research literature on gangs and how settler colonialism has impacted the Latina/o population regarding the origination of gangs, reasons for joining, behaviors and activities, and the process for leaving these groups. The authors emphasize decolonization strategies including reducing structural inequalities and thereby reducing gang membership and risky behaviors. Until this can be accomplished, the authors hope for human rights, labor equity, and religious organizing efforts that can form into social movements of collective empowerment and justice.

AB  - One of the most extreme expressions of prejudice is likening groups to non-human beings. Previous research relates disgust to dehumanization of social groups. However, prior studies have not examined other negative emotions in relation to dehumanization. We examined whether three emotions - anger, disgust, and fear - are associated with dehumanization of social groups. In Experiments 1 and 2 we tested these relationships measuring reactions to real groups. We found that all three emotions were uniquely related to animalistic and humanity-denial dehumanization, but only fear was related to mechanistic dehumanization. Using an orthogonal emotion grid measure in Experiment 3, we showed anger to play a primary role in dehumanization among a variety of target groups. Finally, in Experiment 4 we manipulated whether a novel group was abnormal or harmful, and found that both groups elicited more dehumanization than the control group; however, the harmful group elicited dehumanization mediated by anger and the abnormal group elicited dehumanization mediated by disgust. From this evidence, we argue that other emotions besides disgust play an important part in the dehumanization of outgroups.

AB  - Across two studies, we examined the double-edged sword hypothesis, which outlines effects of weight-related beliefs and public health messages on physical and mental health. The double-edged sword hypothesis proposes that growth mindsets and messages (weight is changeable) predict reduced well-being and stigma via an increase in blame, but also predict greater well-being via an increase in efficacy and less stigma via a reduction in essentialist thinking. We tested this model in a correlational study (N = 311) and in an experimental study, randomly assigning participants (N = 392) to different weight-based public health messages. In Study 1, growth mindsets predicted greater onset blame and more offset efficacy. Blame did not predict any of the outcomes. However, offset efficacy predicted reduced risk for eating disorders, fewer unhealthy weight control behaviors, and less psychological distress. And, growth mindsets had a negative indirect effect on outcomes. In Study 2, we experimentally demonstrated that a changeable message about the nature of weight, designed to also reduce blame, indirectly decreased eating disorder risk, unhealthy weight control behaviors, body shame, and prejudice through increased offset efficacy and decreased social essentialism. This work contributes to our theoretical understanding of the psychological consequences of weight beliefs and messages on well-being and stigma.

AB  - In producing arguments against minority groups that are designed to avoid accusations of prejudice, speakers routinely deploy two discursive strategies. One strategy of "inoculation" seeks to ward off such accusations, while the other strategy of "attention deflection" directs attention away from the potential target group. Where despite use of one or both strategies accusations arise, the result is a puzzle that needs to be resolved through explanation. Here, in a discourse analysis of online discussions as to whether "blacking up" is to count as racism, we see contributors contest (a) whether absence of intention to offend inoculates individuals from accountability for potentially racist actions, (b) whether "blacking up" depicts toys/characters rather than people, and (c) whether attempted explanations of accusations of racism work to resolve the apparent puzzle that has arisen. Contributors do not reach any consensus. These findings point to the difficulties in attempting to challenge potential racism.

AB  - This article analyses the different assumptions about migrants in South Africa, coupled with levels of abuses and marginalisation of black African immigrants, which seem to be a source of depression and emotional pain for them in their strange land. Previous studies did reveal that African migrants face rejection, xenophobic attacks, abuses, marginalisation and socio-economic exclusion through rowdy practices of public officials and perceived institutionalised prejudice in South Africa. However, White Western and Indian-origin migrants are perceived to be better treated with dignity and respect in the same host country. This article investigates the argument that emotional pain suffered by the abused and traumatised Nigerian and other African immigrants could be responsible for the deviant behaviour of some of them in South Africa. Moreover, this article also scrutinises the notion people have that xenophobia in South Africa is Afrophobia. Most South African citizens are of the perception that all African immigrants are criminals, harbingers of disease and drug dealers, whose presence in their country is responsible for all their woes. On the other hand, Nigerian migrants are of the notion that they are the most hated at community and individual levels in South Africa. However, if appropriate social coalition policies are formulated and adopted by the government and all stakeholders, it can be of assistance in tackling the issues concerning citizens' suspicions, migrant abuses, marginalisation and social exclusion, which seem to be hampering the co-existence of citizens and African migrants in South Africa. We should bear in mind that almost all of us in South Africa are from somewhere or the other, as clearly explained in sahistory. org.za. The whites and Indian migrants, whom I call 'earlier alien settlers', are from Europe and Asia, respectively. I call black Bantus from Great lakes in Central Africa, 'earlier alien settlers', whereas the Khoikhoi who originated in the northern area of Botswana as the 'earlier dwellers', while Nigerians and Ghanaians from West Africa, Zimbabweans, Malawians, etc., are called the 'new alien settlers'. Do the 'earlier alien settlers' have the right to deprive the 'earlier dwellers' and the other 'new alien settlers' the right to have their space and settle in a democratic South Africa? Finally, an instructive pastoral care methodology is proposed in this article for traumatised migrants to be appropriately cared for and provided with wholesome wellness.

AB  - One of the challenges faced by contemporary societies concerns building a more inclusive society. This objective is particularly compelling in the current historical period characterized by growing social and cultural heterogeneity in European countries and an increase of prejudice and discrimination toward immigrants. Global citizenship (GC) can support inclusive attitudes and immigrants' acceptance. The aim of the study was to test the role of different forms of associative experiences and civic and political participation in promoting GC in the younger generations. Data were collected between October 2016 and January 2017 using paper and online questionnaires. The sample consisted of 1,732 participants (60.7% females; M-age = 19.73). The questionnaire measured demographics, mobility experiences, membership in organizations, latent and manifest political participation. Based on UNESCO conceptual model (2015), GC was operationalized as follows: openness and tolerance toward migrants and refugees, trust in people, democratic and civic values, knowledge and political awareness,personal and collective capacity to act politically. Results showed that members of volunteer organizations scored higher in all the dimensions of GC included in the study, compared to nonmembers, while the impact of other kinds of organizational membership and participation on GC was limited. Volunteer organizations proved to be a very important context for the development of GC in young generations.

T2  - HUMANITIES-BASEL
LA  - English
KW  - Charlotte Mew
KW  - Modernism
KW  - empathy
AB  - Charlotte Mew's strikingly original and passionate poetry remains under-examined by modernist critics, yet it holds great importance in presenting an alternative version of modernism that foregrounds issues surrounding gender, sexuality and otherness. Mew's work explores key modernist themes such as alienation, fragmentation and psychological disruption from the perspectives of those on the margins of society, and in doing so challenges narrow definitions of the movement by highlighting the multiplicity and plurality of voices and concerns within it. Whilst Mew's decentred position often informs painful reflections on shame, exclusion and powerlessness, the culmination of so many marginalised voices in the poems and Mew's overriding compassion for the vulnerable creates a powerful challenge to the centre that contests traditional accounts of modernism as defined by white, European men. This article will explore how female experience informs Mew's exploration of empathy between the marginalised and how personal experience of gender-based oppression inspires compassion for other vulnerable groups who suffer under similar power dynamics or social prejudices. It will consider how female experience shapes both the content of the poems and her choice of poetic forms that allow for concealment of self against the fear of exposure. It will also draw upon contemporary feminist readings of modernist literature and emotion to examine the ways in which gender informs Charlotte Mew's treatment of key modernist themes and how this challenges conventional understanding of the movement.

AB  - Of all individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) in Sweden 2015 were 90% born in other countries. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to avoid TB transmission. Lack of knowledge about TB and anticipated negative social consequences have proved to be significant contributing factors to delay in seeking health care. This study aimed to understand the perception of TB among people originating from a high-endemic region, currently living in a low-endemic region. A qualitative study design, with male and female participants from a high-endemic region divided into focus groups. A semi-structured interview guide was used to elicit their perceptions of TB. A qualitative content analysis was performed on the recorded material from the interviews. The informants noted that their attitude towards individuals with TB had changed, previously they had felt prejudiced towards them whereas now they felt supportive. It seems possible to diminish TB stigma by ensuring suitable health care is available in combination with correct information about transmission, infectiousness and treatment.

KW  - METAANALYSIS
AB  - Tragic acts of school violence such as what occurred in Columbine, Newtown, and, more recently, in Parkland and Santa Fe, provoke intense feelings of anger, fear, sadness, and helplessness. Understandably, in response to these incidents (and for other reasons), many schools have intensified the manner in which they monitor and control students. Some schools rely on combinations of security measures such as metal detectors; surveillance cameras; drug-sniffing dogs; locked and monitored gates; random searches of students' belongings, lockers, and persons; and law enforcement officers. Not only is there little empirical evidence that these measures actually make schools safer, but overreliance on extreme security measures can create prisonlike environments that are inconsistent with students' best interests. Specifically, overreliance on intense surveillance measures often engenders distrust and discord among members of the school community in the long term, leading to increased disorder and dysfunction. Extreme security measures also play a role in pushing more students out of school and into the criminal justice system, which can have devastating consequences on students and their families.
   Although all schools do and should monitor students to some extent, empirical evidence demonstrates that not all students experience these intense, prisonlike conditions. Rather, schools serving higher concentrations of students of color are more likely to rely on coercive surveillance measures than schools serving primarily white students. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that legitimate safety concerns do not fully explain these racial disparities, but that implicit racial bias influences school officials' decisions to rely on intense surveillance methods to some degree. Indeed, empirical studies repeatedly document that many people unconsciously and unfairly associate minorities, particularly African Americans, with aggression, violence, crime, and danger.
   Recognizing that our current constitutional jurisprudence establishes prime conditions for these racial disparities to develop, this Article proposes a reformulated legal framework to evaluate the constitutionality of coercive surveillance methods that is firmly grounded in the U.S. Supreme Court's current Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Applying this reformulated framework in connection with other strategies will ameliorate the effects of implicit racial bias, help address the disproportionate application of coercive security measures on students of color, and motivate school officials working in majority-minority schools to rely on alternative, evidence-based methods to enhance school safety without harming the learning climate.

AB  - Cross-efficiency evaluation approaches and common set of weights (CSW) approaches have long been suggested as two of the more important and effective methods for the ranking of decision making units (DMUs) in data envelopment analysis (DEA). The former emphasizes the flexibility of evaluation and its weights are asymmetric, while the latter focuses on the standardization of evaluation and its weights are symmetrical. As a compromise between these two approaches, this paper proposes a cross-efficiency evaluation method that is based on two types of flexible evaluation criteria balanced on interval weights. The evaluation criteria can be regarded as macro policy-or means of regulation-according to the industry's current situation. Unlike current cross-efficiency evaluation methods, which tend to choose the set of weights for peer evaluation based on certain preferences, the cross-efficiency evaluation method based on evaluation criterion determines one set of input and output weights for each DMU. This is done by minimizing the difference between the weights of the DMU and the evaluation criteria, thus ensuring that the cross-evaluation of all DMUs for evaluating peers is as consistent as possible. This method also eliminates prejudice and arbitrariness from peer evaluations. As a result, the proposed cross-efficiency evaluation method not only looks for non-zero weights, but also ranks efficient DMUs completely. The proposed DEA model can be further extended to seek a common set of weights for all DMUs. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applications of the cross-efficiency evaluation method based on evaluation criterion in DEA ranking.

AB  - Stigma represents an important social issue, one rooted in communication. The present study used a quantitative content analysis to examine the representation of the term stigma in one national and six regional news publications in the United States between 2000 and 2018. In the 1,524 stories examined, journalists explicitly defined stigma once. Stigma was discussed in relation to serious, often dehumanized conditions such as schizophrenia, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS. However, journalists and news sources frequently trivialized stigma by referencing it in relation to bad football teams, food, motor vehicles, and other objects that do not experience the full impact of stigma: stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination.

AB  - Up until now, the literature on sociological approaches to translation has mainly focused on the self-perceptions of translators. This article analyses the coverage devoted to non-literary translation and translators in the print media in Switzerland. What perceptions of translation are newspapers circulating? Are these hetero-images positively or negatively connoted? A qualitative thematic analysis is conducted on four daily newspapers in Switzerland - Tages-Anzeiger, St. Galler Tagblatt, Le Temps and 24 Heures (two important newspapers for each of the two major official languages) - over a period of one year (spring 2013 - spring 2014). The analysis shows the scarcity and negativism of discourse about non-literary translation in Switzerland: it is depicted as a risky, costly, lonely and peripheral business - results that would need to be compared across media and countries. Understanding the construction of external 'translation talk' may help social actors such as translators or professional societies fight against existing prejudices about translation.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze an emergent cultural clash between: (a) how media outlets and other control culture institutions have portrayed events related to Black Lives Matter, and (b) the complex reality of Black Lives Matter movements as they have developed through embodied, intersectional, and always socially situated forms of direct collective action. In focusing specifically on American mainstream media coverage of the killing of Trayvon Martin, we argue that, given the history of white supremacy in America, such journalistic accounts generally fail to provide an adequate socio-historical context for emergent social movements in the vein of Black Lives Matter. In framing such movements, at worst, as anti-American terrorist organizations, though more regularly as social constellations of misplaced anger, American control culture institutions have consistently reinforced a certain set of logical contradictions found across broader discussions about race throughout the history of America. Finally, drawing on the theory of play proposed by Gregory Bateson, we outline how a form of subverting mainstream journalistic framing techniques is enacted and embodied creativity through the communally oriented tactics successfully deployed by social movements like Black Lives Matter.

AB  - Objective The image of the wicked stepmother has created a prejudice against stepmothers, which makes it difficult for them to adjust to their stepfamilies. This study compared fairy tales from different cultures to reestablish the nature of stepmothers.
   Methods Grimms' Fairy Tales (GFT) was used to represent Western culture, with stepmother characters appearing in 15 out of 210 tales. "The Collection of Korean Traditional Fairy Tales" (KFT) was used to represent Eastern culture, with stepmother characters featured in 14 out of 15,107 tales. We examined the relationships between stepmothers and stepchildren in GFT and KFT.
   Results Daughters were abused more often than sons in both genres. In GFT, jealousy spurred the abuse in 12 of 15 cases, while in KFT greed was predominant in 12 of 14 cases.
   Conclusion The fairy tale portrayals of wicked stepmothers may be associated with the stigma children place on their stepmothers, which needs to be overcome.

AB  - It needs to be very clearly emphasized that discrimination on the basis of caste is an age-old phenomenon; indeed so predictable a phenomenon that it often occurs implicitly. If the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes have continued to suffer under the undue burden of a stigmatized identity and abiding discrimination in present-day India despite the ponderous safety net of statutory safeguards, the onus must lie with a deliberate form of marginalization or disparagement that aims to secure the exclusion of individuals on the basis of their membership of a particular group-through hate speech. This prejudice-driven crime has gone on to determine the way the dominant social class has been and continues, consciously and unconsciously, aiding and abetting the maintenance of status quo through their private utterances. This practice of unconscious and unpunished speech occurring casually in unsuspecting familial settings perhaps stands out in its greatest potential to damage, disrupt, cause a permanent mind change and ingrain and invigorate social apartheid.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to explore how small area deprivation is associated with attitudes towards mental illness in a large sample of individuals living in private households in England. Method Cross-sectional data from Health Survey for England (2014) were analysed using multilevel models. The exposure of interest was the deprivation level of the small area in which an individual resides as measured by Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score. The primary outcome was an individual's overall attitude towards mental illness, measured using a 12 item version of the Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) scale. Further outcomes were the two subscales of the CAMI, reflecting attitudes of (1) prejudice and exclusion and (2) tolerance and support. Individuals were nested within household and small geographical area. Results 5820 participants were included. Results from unadjusted models found strong evidence that individuals residing in the most deprived areas of England have worse attitudes towards mental illness compared to individuals living in the least deprived areas (estimated difference = - 3.5 points; 95% CI - 4.8 to - 2.2; P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, education level, ethnicity and weekly income there was no longer evidence for this association (adjusted difference = - 0.1 points, 95% CI - 1.3 to 1.2; P = 0.931). Similar patterns of results were found for the CAMI subscales. Conclusions The relationship between small area-level deprivation and attitudes towards mental illness is no longer observed when controlling for certain individual-level characteristics.

AB  - Development of educators' and students' global competence in higher education is increasingly important due to internationalization. Internationalization significantly influences healthcare education through an increase in the mobility of students. When conducting clinical practice in healthcare education, culturally and linguistically diverse healthcare students face the challenges of having limited learning opportunities and social isolation. Further investigation is required of students' experiences in this area while asking them to share their experiences. This study aimed to describe students' experiences of clinical learning environment and mentoring. A qualitative research design was used during 2013-2016. Data were collected from 133 culturally and linguistically diverse healthcare students, including exchange students and students studying in English language-taught degree programmes at eight Universities of Applied Sciences in Finland. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis. Students' experiences were related to their mentors' competence in mentoring, culturally diverse pedagogical atmosphere, and aspects of diversity that influence clinical learning. Students reported that they had experienced social isolation, discrimination, bullying, sexual harassment and prejudice during their clinical placements. These issues related to mistreatment of students need to be addressed. Also, structured clinical environments should be developed in which competent mentors assist students in reaching their clinical placement goals.

AB  - This article constructs a brief history of how lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) issues have intersected with South African psychology at key sociopolitical moments, filling a gap in current histories. Organized psychology-a primary focus of this analysis-since its first formations in 1948, mostly colluded with apartheid governments by othering queerness as psychopathology or social deviance. The National Party, both homophobic and racist, ruled the country from 1948 until the first democratic elections in 1994. The acceleration of antiapartheid struggles in the 1980s saw progressive psychologists develop more critical forms of theory and practice. However, LGBTI+ issues remained overshadowed by the primary struggle for racial equality and democracy. Psychology's chameleon-like adaptation to evolving eras resulted in a unified organization when apartheid ended: the Psychological Society of South Africa (PsySSA). Democratic South Africa's Constitution took the bold step of protecting sexuality as a fundamental human right, galvanizing a fresh wave of LGBTI+ scholarship post-1994. However, LGBTI+ people still suffered prejudice, discrimination, and violence. Additionally, psychology training continued to ignore sexual orientation and gender-affirmative health care in curricula. PsySSA therefore joined the International Psychology Network for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Issues (IPsyNet) in 2007, catalyzing the PsySSA African LGBTI+ Human Rights Project in 2012 and two pioneering publications: a position statement on affirmative practice in 2013, and practice guidelines for psychology professionals working with sexually and gender-diverse people in 2017. This article traces a neglected history of South African psychology, examining the political, social, and institutional factors that eventually enabled the development of LGBTI+ affirmative psychologies.

AB  - In opinion dynamics, how to model the enduring fragmentation phenomenon (especially the bipartite cleavage) of social opinions has long been a central problem. It is widely known that the confidence-based opinion dynamics provide an acceptable mechanism to produce fragmentation. In this study, taking the famous confidence-based Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model, we examine the robustness of the fragmentation coming from HK dynamics and its variations with prejudiced and stubborn agents against random noise. Prior to possible insightful explanations, the theoretical results in this paper explicitly reveal that the fragmentation of HK dynamics and its homogeneous variations finally vanishes in the presence of arbitrarily tiny noise, while only the HK model with heterogenous prejudices displays a solid cleavage in noisy environment. Moreover, it is found that noise could help regularize the group to form the innate bipartite cleavage. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report the results of two experiments which test the potential of arts engagement for promoting prosocial intentions. Experiment 1 (N = 216) tested the impact of a participatory arts intervention (vs. a control condition) on children's empathy and interpersonal prosocial intentions. Experiment 2 (N = 174) tested the impact of a participatory arts intervention (vs. a control condition) on children's prosocial intentions toward outgroup members under competitive and non-competitive conditions. Experiment 1 showed that the participatory arts intervention significantly increased children's interpersonal prosocial intentions, but not their empathy. Experiment 2 showed that, under competitive conditions, the participatory arts intervention significantly increased prosocial intentions toward outgroup members, an effect that persisted for six months beyond the intervention. Under non-competitive conditions, the participatory arts intervention consolidated improvements in prosocial intentions toward outgroup members. Overall, the results confirm the hypothesis that participatory arts engagement can promote prosocial intentions during middle childhood.

AB  - Domestic violence and refuge services in Australia
   In Australia and internationally, domestic violence is a major cause of homelessness for women and children and yet provision for accommodation for this user-group is not well documented or understood. When designing emergency accommodation, the concerns, preferences, and perspectives of individuals who access refuge services must be sought in order to create spaces that are conducive to the needs of this diverse and vulnerable group. An empathic 'lens' can provide meaningful insights that can inform the design of refuge services specifically targeted at addressing these needs. This paper describes an authentic interdisciplinary learning experience for nursing, architecture and landscape students at a university in Sydney, Australia, and presents the results of a study designed to measure the impact of this initiative on participants' empathy towards women and children who access refuge services as a result of homelessness and/or domestic violence. Empathy levels were measured using the Comprehensive State Empathy Scale, a validated measurement tool.
   An authentic interdisciplinary learning experience
   The learning experience consisted of collaborative meetings with stakeholders from the refuge sector, fieldwork, individual research, exchanging ideas and problem-solving in teams. Students then developed design guides for refuges that demonstrated their emerging understanding of the specific needs and perspectives of the issues faced by women and children who had experienced violence and found themselves homeless. Pre-post Comprehensive State Empathy Scale results indicated that the empathy levels of nursing and landscape students increased and those of architecture students decreased, however, these results were not statistically significant.
   Building empathy in teaching and learning
   The significance of the results from this study include an ability to compare the changes in empathy in students working collaboratively on a project and to ascertain possible reasons for this using a validated measurement tool. As empathy is one of the strongest negative correlates of prejudice, authentic teaching and learning activities, such as the one described in this paper, have the potential to positively impact the lived experience of women and children leaving situations of domestic violence.

AB  - Human beings do not have a fixed sex/gender but everyone is constantly (re)creating the concepts of femininity and masculinity. But gender still functions as a basis for discrimination in the existing social order. The authors point out the importance of knowing about and reflecting gender prejudices as well as gender stereotypes, forms and mechanisms of discrimination being at work in order to not reproduce gender inequalities in facilitated groups. This article summarizes principles and present insights into gender-sensitiveness that might be important for person-centred encounter-groups.

AB  - In this study, we explain differences in support for interreligious lawful and violent protests against the religious outgroup. Combining religiosity and social identity approaches, we take three dimensions of religiosity (namely, practices, beliefs and salience) into consideration related to support for interreligious conflict, next to relevant control characteristics. The analysis is based on survey data (N = 2026) collected among a random sample of Muslims (n = 1451) and Christians (n = 575) across the Indonesian archipelago. Our findings show that members of the Muslim community are, on average, more inclined to support interreligious conflict, both lawful and violent protests. Participation in rites of passage is a crucial aspect of religious practices found to be positively related to both kinds of protest. Religious beliefs show great importance but vary in their influence: particularistic views and intratextual fundamentalism are related to support for lawful protest, whereas religiocentrism is related to support both for lawful and violent protests. In contrast, salience reduces support for violent protest. As such, the findings offer a differentiated way to understand present-day interreligious conflicts among the general population in Indonesia.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of four US music educators during and after a 3-week adult choir camp in South Africa. Findings reveal that the camp positively influenced music teacher understandings and practices, both during and after the exchange. Throughout the camp, participants navigated race, privilege and prejudice and expressed value for a vast array of shared experiences with choir mates, teachers, and homestays. Participants reflected regularly on processes of learning new musics, describing growth through authentic and at times challenging activities. Furthermore, all participants recognized that firsthand experiences were essential to deep learning. During the camp, all participants expressed hopes of bringing new ideas and music home; 2 months after returning to their classrooms, 3 of the 4 participants reported the teaching of South African songs along with modified pedagogical approaches. Ultimately, participants shared that the trip had impacted them in various personal ways, noting increased tolerance, patience, kindness, confidence and hope.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) sexual minority people who are also racial minorities (people of color) face significantly more complex life stressors than their white counterparts, likely due to more stigma and discrimination. This article outlines some of the disparities in this double-minority population that contribute to trends in (1) higher rates of mental health disorders; (2) higher percentages of medical illnesses in general, including higher rates of HIV; (3) higher rates of substance use disorders; and (4) increased rates of violence. Much of the existing research literature pertains to either LGBTQ+ populations or racial/ethnic minority populations, and there has been little research addressing this double-minority population to date. Further research is warranted to better understand the effect of stigma, prejudice, and discrimination in double-minority populations and how to better address their social, health, and mental health disparities.

AB  - This essay places Wollstonecraft's late novel Maria; or, The Wrongs of Woman (1798) in conversation with Rousseau's thought on natural education in Emile (1762). In both texts, aesthetic sensibility is a foundation of religious belief and a crucial feature of a program of natural education that aims at freedom. Education falters, however, as Rousseau's student and Wollstonecraft's heroine are consigned to exile by a prejudiced society. Though Rousseau and Wollstonecraft make strong claims for the moral and liberating possibilities of aesthetic sensibility, they differ in their interpretation of exile. Wollstonecraft rewrites Rousseau's portrait of the self-sufficient exile to highlight her outcast heroine's estrangement from the vital forces that animate life and the mind. Natural education fails in Wrongs of Woman because the cultivation of sensibility remains separate from the work of reforming the social structures that discredit women's reason.

AB  - Rape culture is characterized by prevalent rape of women by male acquaintances, which is exacerbated in the aftermath by negative social responses including attributions of victim culpability. In prior research, collaborators and I found that, consistent with norm theory, perceiving sociolegal context as unclear and ineffective in expressing that rape of women is a crime (vs. perceiving that law clearly and effectively expresses that rape is a crime) paradoxically intensified negative reactions and culpability attributions toward a woman raped by a male acquaintance. In the current research, I tested the hypothesis that, amidst rape culture, structural racism-in particular, disparate hypersexuality stereotyping of Black men-paradoxically would intensify attributions of victim culpability toward a woman raped by a Black male acquaintance. In Study 1, 268 students at a university in the Southern United States stereotyped Black men and Black women as more hypersexual than same-gender counterparts of other races/ethnicities. In Study 2, 238 students from the same university attributed more culpability to an acquaintance rape victim whose perpetrator was Black (vs. perpetrators of other races/ethnicities), and this effect resulted in part from rape-propensity stereotyping that was disparately activated by the Black perpetrator. Taken together, the present research highlights that intersectional dynamics do not work exclusively within members of particular groups, where marginalized identities coincide, but also in the contextual space that invisibly but undeniably affects people's lives. Suggestions for combatting rape culture, structural racism, and their intersections are discussed.

AB  - Despite decades of declining crime rates, longstanding tensions between police and the public continue to frustrate the formation of cooperative relationships necessary for the function of the police and the provision of public safety. In response, policy makers continue to promote community-oriented policing (COP) and its emphasis on positive, nonenforcement contact with the public as an effective strategy for enhancing public trust and police legitimacy. Prior research designs, however, have not leveraged the random assignment of police-public contact to identify the causal effect of such interactions on individual-level attitudes toward the police. Therefore, the question remains: Do positive, nonenforcement interactions with uniformed patrol officers actually cause meaningful improvements in attitudes toward the police? Here, we report on a randomized field experiment conducted in New Haven, CT, that sheds light on this question and identifies the individual-level consequences of positive, nonenforcement contact between police and the public. Findings indicate that a single instance of positive contact with a uniformed police officer can substantially improve public attitudes toward police, including legitimacy and willingness to cooperate. These effects persisted for up to 21 d and were not limited to individuals inclined to trust and cooperate with the police prior to the intervention. This study demonstrates that positive nonenforcement contact can improve public attitudes toward police and suggests that police departments would benefit from an increased focus on strategies that promote positive police-public interactions.

KW  - New Orleans
AB  - "Structural violence" is a term used to describe inflicted systematic violence on a disenfranchised group by an established order, usually framed as a government or the social majority. The disenfranchised groups are marginalized and not provided with the same access to resources such as healthcare or food, the effects of which can be observed directly in their death. Bioarchaeologists often can detect the visible effects of this violence on skeletal remains, which provide a visual representation to and reinforcement of social prejudices inflicted in life and death. Discussed here is how the same concept of structural violence can be inflicted on the landscape through damage to or obliteration of cemeteries. We propose a definition of "landscape structural violence" exhibited through cemetery erasure as a reinforcement of preexisting social prejudices in death where the governments or the social majority, intentionally or passively, destroy, remove, or obscure a cemetery without consultation with the descendant community. This definition is applied to several examples of New Orleans cemeteries to determine the functionality of the definition and what activity is and what is not structural violence inflicted on the landscape.

AB  - Background: Mental Health problems are one of the leading disabilities worldwide. Individuals seeking help for their mental illness expect nurses to be cognisant of their needs without prejudice and discrimination. Existing evidences suggest a growing number of patient referral from primary healthcare to psychiatric consultations. This study aimed to explore primary healthcare nurses' knowledge and attitude towards mental illness and people with mentally illness.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study using the Mental Health Problem Perception and the Community Attitudes to Mental Illness questionnaires. Descriptive and multivariate regression using maximum likelihood procedures were applied.
   Results: Regression analysis showed significantly high correlation between knowledge and authotarianism (beta = 0.775, p = 0.007) and moderate inverse correlation with social restrictiveness (beta = - 0.517, p < 0.001). However, no significant correlation with benevolence (beta = - 0.057, p = 0.181) was detected. Nurses with higher educational level were significantly associated with authotarianism attitude.
   Conclusions: This is the first study examining knowledge and attitude of primary healthcare nurses in Brunei. The relationship between the study variables as well as demographic factors, in comparison to other countries, were discussed. Overall, negative attitude among nurses is still a challenging issue; therefore, developing reeducation initiatives and increase contact time, especially for healthcare front liners with negative attitudes regardless of education level, to favour change of attitude, is important to foster holistic care to people with mental illness and promote mental health in the population.

AB  - South African churches are struggling to form cohesive communities and strategies are needed to bring people together. Because of a deficiency in trust, people are reluctant to get to know each other, impacting on the quality of relationships and a positive sense of belonging and community. Congregations need to find ways to nurture an inclusive identity instead of the current norm of all-white or all-black churches, which can be perceived as being inaccessible or exclusive. innovative strategies like storytelling can unlock the power to understand each other breaking down prejudice, racism and xenophobia. Because intercultural socialisation is found wanting in congregations, sharing different perspectives and experiences can deepen engagements overcoming superficial interactions. This article expands on how storytelling can be used to facilitate an inclusive and intercultural congregational identity through identity formation, liberative practices of reconciliation, community building and as an educational resource.

AB  - While the profound effects of spatial mobility on social structures and patterns of interactions have long been recognized, the association of mobility experiences and tolerance towards immigrants has received limited attention. In this paper, we examine such patterns in Iceland, a country with a long history of emigration and return migration of the local population but a recent surge in international immigration. We find in-migrants and locals who have lived in the capital city area or abroad for at least a year to be more tolerant of immigrants than locals who have never lived elsewhere. These patterns of tolerance among more mobile respondents persist after controlling for other predictors such as age, gender, education and language skills, employment status, income, community integration, residential satisfaction and generalized trust. These results are discussed in the context of changing patterns of mobility and immobility in western countries.

AB  - This paper uses data from the 2014 Special Module of the European Social Survey on attitudes to immigration to investigate attitudes towards Muslim and 'White immigrants in Ireland. Drawing on theories of social identity, ethnic threat and social distance, the paper develops hypotheses about which factors influence attitudes to Muslim immigrants, and how and why they might differ from attitudes to White immigrants. Comparing these attitudes, we find evidence of an "ethnic hierarchy" in Ireland, with more positive attitudes to White than to Muslim immigrants. We also find that age and religious practice are associated with attitudes towards Muslim immigrants, but have only weak effects on attitudes towards White immigrants. The analysis reveals that an international terrorist attack had a negative effect on attitudes to Muslim immigrants but not on attitudes to White immigrants.

AB  - This article presents a new social framework for understanding the origins of trolling and its expansion from an obscure practice, limited to a handful of boards on Usenet, to a pervasive component of Internet culture. I argue that trolling originated, in the term of sociologists, as a form of boundary maintenance that served to distinguish communities of self-identified online insiders from others beyond the boundaries of their community and to drive outsiders away from their spaces. This framework can help us to better understand the transformations that trolling has undergone in the decades since its inception, as well as the persistence of misogyny and prejudice throughout the history of the practice.

AB  - Data from Project Implicit were analyzed to explore trends in ableism. Over 300,000 U.S. residents with and without disabilities completed the Disability Implicit Association Test and two measures of explicit prejudice. The most consistent predictors of bias across types of prejudice were gender and contact with individuals with disabilities: Women and those who had contact were less prejudiced. Temporal analyses indicated that mean implicit prejudice increased over time (2004-2017), yet explicit bias showed a decline over the same period. Among people with disabilities, implicit and explicit prejudice were related to lower contact with others who shared one's disability, as well as to perceptions that one's disorder affects few activities and/or is primarily mental or emotional. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - A happy face advantage has consistently been shown in emotion categorization tasks; happy faces are categorized as happy faster than angry faces as angry. Furthermore, social category cues, such as facial sex and race, moderate the happy face advantage in evaluatively congruent ways with a larger happy face advantage for more positively evaluated faces. We investigated whether attractiveness, a facial attribute unrelated to more defined social categories, would moderate the happy face advantage consistent with the evaluative congruence account. A larger happy face advantage for the more positively evaluated attractive faces than for unattractive faces was predicted. Across 4 experiments participants categorized attractive and unattractive faces as happy or angry as quickly and accurately as possible. As predicted, when female faces were categorized separately, a happy face advantage emerged for the attractive females but not for the unattractive females. Corresponding results were only found in the error rates for male faces. This pattern was confirmed when female and male faces were categorized together, indicating that attractiveness may have a stronger influence on emotion perception for female faces. Attractiveness is shown to moderate emotion perception in line with the evaluative congruence account and is suggested to have a stronger influence on emotion perception than facial sex cues in contexts where attractiveness is a salient evaluative dimension.

AB  - Sexual and mental health disparities are reported in Arctic Canada as in other Arctic regions that experience shared challenges of insufficient healthcare resources, limited transportation, and a scarcity of healthcare research. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer persons (LGBTQ+) report sexual and mental health disparities in comparison with their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, and these disparities may be exacerbated in rural versus urban settings. Yet limited research has explored sexual healthcare experiences among LGBTQ+ persons in the Arctic who are at the juncture of Arctic and LGBTQ+ health disparities. We conducted a qualitative study from May 2015 to October 2015 with LGBTQ+ persons in the Northwest Territories, Canada that involved in-depth individual interviews with LGBTQ+ youth (n = 16), LGBTQ+ adults (n = 21), and key informants (e.g. coaches, teachers, nurses, social workers, and healthcare providers) (n = 14). We conducted thematic analysis, a theoretically flexible approach that integrates deductive and inductive approaches, to identify and map themes in the data. Findings reveal geographical, social, and healthcare factors converge to shape healthcare access. Specifically, the interplay between heterosexism and cisnormativity, intersectional forms of stigma, and place limited LGBTQ+ persons' sexual healthcare access and produced negative experiences in sexual healthcare. Limited healthcare facilities in small communities resulted in confidentiality concerns. Heteronormativity and cisnormativity constrained the ability to access appropriate sexual healthcare. LGBTQ+ persons experienced LGBTQ+, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections stigma in healthcare. Participants also discussed healthcare provider recommendations to better serve LGBTQ+ persons: non-judgment, knowledge of LGBTQ+ health issues, and gender inclusivity. Findings can inform multi-level strategies to reduce intersecting stigma in communities and healthcare, transform healthcare education, and build LGBTQ+ persons' healthcare navigation skills.

KW  - Oppression
AB  - This paper intends to explain the problem of structural injustice. The Rawlsian theory of justice is problematic due to the reality of positional differences. The assumptions of Rawls are put into question. Oppression, according to Iris Marion Young, is social in character. Fair opportunity is not enough. To elaborate this critique, this study presents the exclusion of individuals with handicap, the problem of global justice, and the situation of women in patriarchal cultures. Some social rules and the behavior of people discriminate the powerless. For instance, particular standards in society promote the high sense of respectability for professionals but not the respect for the equal dignity of persons. Procedures, laws, and policies manifest the prejudice against others. Beyond Rawls, the pursuit of justice and democratic inclusion, it is argued, requires overcoming unjust structures.

AB  - Despite long-standing prejudices against doing so, it is time for sociology to reconnect with its roots in biological and evolutionary thinking. Sociology emerged as a discipline when the notion of evolution was actively used in biology, geology, and emerging social sciences. Throughout the nineteenth century, many of the most prominent early European sociologists examined the social universe from an evolutionary perspective; and this perspective was borrowed in much of early American sociology in the last decades of the nineteenth century and in the first decades of the twentieth century. By the end of the second decade of the twentieth Century, however, evolutionary analysis was rapidly disappearing in sociology in the United States, and by the 1930s, it was pretty much dead. And for the remainder of the twentieth century, it was viewed with a great suspicion, especially evolutionary approaches that sought to incorporate ideas from biology into the field. Despite the revival of stage models of societal evolution and the emergence of new ecological approaches in the 1960s and 1970s, evolutionary ideas from biology were still rejected by most American sociologists though much of the twentieth century. In this paper, we first present the history of this rejection of evolutionary, with the goal of encouraging sociologists today to recognize the distortions and misrepresentations of Darwinian and Spencerian ideas that fueled intellectual prejudices for so many decades. These prejudices only get in the way of sociology in the twenty-first century, where biological ideas have begun to pervade the social sciences. Thus, American sociologists should now take stock and reconsider how much evolutionary and biological analysis can help sociology and, equally if not more important, how an informed evolutionary sociology can influence those in the other social sciences and even those in the biological sciences.

AB  - Festivals are an increasingly more popular form of contemporary cultural activism. Countering prejudice through arts, using culture as a tool of communication, and creating an opportunity for marginalised groups to participate in public life, they represent a specific and novel means of civic activism. In this paper, I introduce a case study of the multicultural festival [fjuzn], aiming to enhance the public visibility of 'new minorities' and bring attention to the ethnic and cultural diversity in the city of Bratislava, Slovakia. Building on a festival ethnography and drawing on the perspective of boundary work [Jaworsky, B. Nadya. 2016. The Boundaries of Belonging: Online Work of Immigration-related Social Movement Organizations. Palgrave Macmillan], I show how the festival organisers work towards crossing and blurring symbolic boundaries in society. I offer a close interpretive reading of their attempts at capturing public places and cultivating a diverse language-scape, while showing how they simultaneously maintain, solidify, or even inscribe new boundaries. I conclude by raising critical points about the potential of activist cultural festivals to shift symbolic boundaries in the long run and serve as tools of social inclusion.

AB  - In Turkey, discrimination against women has cultural, sociological, and legal causes. Education, health, employment, and social life carry traces of gender discrimination. Gender inequality also occurs in the legal field. Especially in the criminal justice system, women experience disadvantages compared to men. Despite the gender-neutral laws, discrimination is widespread and affects law enforcement, which is dominated by patriarchal social codes and prejudices. This study aims to focus on women as victims and offenders in the Turkish criminal justice system, with examples and assessments from investigation of the corrections system.

AB  - Recent work on law's connection to literature has shown the immense overlap in narrative structuring, power dynamics, and social prejudices inherent to both literary and legal texts. Yet law-literature studies have often relied on nationalistic boundaries, overlooking the intense interchange of legal and literary ideas circulating across spatial and temporal divides. This article studies Italian novelle from a comparative perspective to uncover how concepts of law, justice, and authority circulate in literary texts across diverse geographies and legal systems. I specifically trace Shylock's case, from its origins in the Italian novelle genre to the utilizations of The Merchant of Venice in American legal training and courtrooms. This case study illustrates the power of literature to synthesize diverse legal environments, influence popular understandings of law, and provide a comparative perspective of justice to both legal scholars and public audiences.

AB  - Since Independence, Muslim politics in India has mainly been framed through the idiom of identity. While political engagements calling for democratization and increased participation in public life have occasionally occurred, scholarly interest in the ongoing shifts in Muslim political demands is recent and new. Simultaneously, the emerging literature on the politics of patronage and post-patronage networks in democracies of the Global South present anthropologists with new tools for studying the changing contours of the political mobilization of the urban poor. Using ethnographic narratives collected during fieldwork in Park Circus-one of Kolkata's many Muslim-dominated neighbourhoods-which remains stigmatized and socially and spatially set apart, this article highlights the emerging modes of political engagement among poor and lower middle-class Muslims. I carefully document their efforts to negotiate a perceived 'better' life within a fast-changing neoliberal urban landscape that is prejudiced against them. For many ordinary Muslims, this has involved a movement away from the traditional elite-led politics of identity towards more plebeian forms of assertion and activism aimed at eking out a respectable living by working through extant structures of the local administration and networks of power in the neighbourhood.

AB  - BackgroundContextualised within minority stress theory, this study explores the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) medical students and how they navigate medical school as sexual minorities. Past research indicates many LGBTQ medical students have witnessed medical school staff make prejudice comments about LGBTQ patients, leading sexual minority students to suppress LGBTQ identities and experience adverse mental health outcomes.
   MethodsFocus groups were conducted with 12 LGBTQ medical students from four different Michigan-based medical schools.
   ResultsFindings show that LGBTQ medical students have a difficult time managing their sexual minority status, but non-white LGBTQ medical students experience medical school at an intersection of sexual-identity oppression and racial discrimination. LGBTQ medical students abandon hopes of creating close relationships with faculty members and educators because they have witnessed them make derogatory comments towards LGBTQ patients. The burden of performing well academically and suppressing important aspects of the students' identities creates a stressful work environment that contributes to poor mental health.
   DiscussionBased on this study's findings, there are two recommendations. First, medical school staff should foster a more inclusive environment for students that disrupts the dominance of heteronormative standards, which ultimately underpins LGBTQ health disparities, more generally. Second, medical school faculty members should show their support to LGBTQ students so they can recognise allies and create supportive networks through these individuals. These relationships could encourage students to become successful professionally, but also promote confident and positive feelings about their identities.

AB  - Social impressions arise from characteristics of both perceivers and targets. However, empirical research in the domain of impression formation has yet to quantify the extent to which perceiver and target characteristics uniquely contribute to impressions across group boundaries (e.g., race, gender). To what extent does an impression arise from "our mind" versus "a target's face", and does this process differ for impressions across race and gender? We explored this question by estimating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) from cross-classified multilevel models of 188,472 face ratings from 2,230 participants (Study 1) and 219,658 ratings from 2,984 participants (Study 2). We partitioned the total variance in ratings on a trait dimension (trustworthiness, dominance, youthful/attractiveness) into variance explained by perceivers versus targets, and compared these ICCs among different groups (e.g., ratings of own-vs. other-group targets). Overarching results reveal (a) target appearance matters more for women than men, (b) target appearance matters more for impressions on youthful/attractiveness than trustworthiness or dominance dimensions, (c) differences in perceiver/target influences across race did not consistently replicate, and (d) these differences are absent in minimal groups, supporting the role of racial and gender stereotypes in driving these effects. Overall, perceiver characteristics contribute more to impressions than target appearance. Our findings disentangle the contributions of perceiver and targets to impressions and illustrate that the process of impression formation is not equal across various group boundaries.

AB  - This paper explores the ways in which national governments address the social inclusion of disadvantaged and disenfranchised groups in official strategy documents of the state. Data for this study come from a corpus of four key government strategy papers concerning Roma inclusion published by the Romanian Government between 2001 and 2015. This paper specifically looks at the ways in which strategy documents frame the problem of "crime" in the context of Roma inclusion. Texts were analysed using a critical frame analysis approach complemented by insights from discursive research. The findings highlight that although generally government policy on the Roma adopts and promotes a progressive/liberal agenda that aligns with EU strategic goals, pronounced ambivalence towards Roma people and subtle forms of racism are still present and persist.

AB  - In July 2018, the UK's Intelligence & Security Committee issued a report into diversity and inclusion across the intelligence and security community. The picture the report painted was far from satisfactory; in short, Britain's intelligence agencies did not 'fully reflect the ethnic make-up of modern Britain'. The report argued that Britain's spy agencies - MI5, SIS (or MI6) and GCHQ - should improve black, Asian and ethnic minority recruitment, highlighting areas for improvement, especially around the vetting of recruits. This problem stems from the post-war Cold War 'security state' and the development of security-vetting programmes from the 1940s, aiming to protect Whitehall from Soviet spies and 'fellow travellers' to those with so-called 'character defects'- drink, drugs and homosexuality. But this 'security state' also saw the newly emerging multicultural Britain as a major threat. The so-called 'Windrush Generation' of migrants from the Caribbean, and migration from the Indian subcontinent and Africa, forever changed the social complexion of Britain, but posed significant questions for security officials. What was Britishness? With first or second generation migrants entering the civil service, who was a 'UK eye' and what access to secret information should they have? To what extent was discrimination justifiable to protect state secrets, and how should officials respond to new legislation such as the Race Discrimination Act? As this article shows, new entrants to the civil service faced deeply engrained prejudices, and questions over their loyalty to Britain. As late as the 1960s (and beyond), 'coloured' members of the civil service were rejected from secret posts across government, including the Ministry of Defence and intelligence and security services, especially MI5 and GCHQ, with discrimination on 'security' grounds justified by the landmark 1968 Race Relations Act, which barred race discrimination for housing and employment elsewhere.

AB  - Despite the widely ratified United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, support for civil liberties is easily eroded in times of threat. Understanding which factors moderate the relationship between threat and support for civil liberties is critical, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we test a double moderation model in which support for the restriction of civil liberties in the face of threat is moderated by both right-wing authoritarianism and political sophistication. In a national representative dataset (N = 12,507), those low on right-wing authoritarianism became more like their high right-wing authoritarian peers in the face of threat. Also, those more sophisticated about political issues were less supportive of restrictions on civil liberties, but only when threat was low. We tested this model on both restrictions for the in-group, in terms of being wiretapped, and for the out-group, in terms of torturing suspected terrorists. Our results suggest that increasing political sophistication may have desirable consequences when considering the outcomes for in-group members, and we argue for increased efforts to expand the in-group we seek to protect.

AB  - Using the example of the British fish and chip shop, I explore the socio-historical connections among culture, taste and organizations. Specifically, the British 'chippie' illustrates how cultural tastes affect our comprehension of organizations. In examining this occupation in depth, we see how the fish and chip shop reveals the ways class and cultural prejudices affect how an organization is perceived. Considering an organization's history offers us a glimpse into how organizational tastes are shaped by broader social processes. Additionally, I explore taste and organizations through diverse theoretical lenses. First, the chippie constitutes an organizational example of Pierre Bourdieu's contrast between taste as luxury and taste as necessity. Second, the work of Hannah Arendt highlights the intersubjective nature of taste, and its connection with judgement. Third, exploring taste with Antoine Hennion's writings reveals the connection between practices and things. Examining taste through diverse theoretical lenses can thus open up productive lines of inquiry for taste and organizational studies.

AB  - Researchers in the medical, health, and social sciences routinely encounter ordinal variables such as self-reports of health or happiness. When modelling ordinal outcome variables, it is common to have covariates, for example, attitudes, family income, retrospective variables, measured with error. As is well known, ignoring even random error in covariates can bias coefficients and hence prejudice the estimates of effects. We propose an instrumental variable approach to the estimation of a probit model with an ordinal response and mismeasured predictor variables. We obtain likelihood-based and method of moments estimators that are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under general conditions. These estimators are easy to compute, perform well and are robust against the normality assumption for the measurement errors in our simulation studies. The proposed method is applied to both simulated and real data.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Burnout, a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a decreased sense of efficacy, is common among resident physicians, and negative emotional states may increase the expression of prejudices, which are associated with racial disparities in health care. Whether racial bias varies by symptoms of burnout among resident physicians is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the association between burnout and explicit and implicit racial biases toward black people in resident physicians.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study obtained data from surveys completed by first-year medical students and resident physicians in the United States as part of the Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation Study. Participants were followed up from enrollment in 2010 to 2011 through 2017. Participants completed questionnaires at year 4 of medical school as well as at the second and third years of residency. Only data from resident physicians who self-identified as belonging to a racial group other than black (n = 3392) were included in the analyses because of scarce evidence of racial bias in the care provided to black patients by black physicians. Resident physicians training in radiology or pathology were excluded because they provided less direct patient interaction.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Burnout symptoms were measured by 2 single-item measures from the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Explicit attitudes about white and black people were measured by a feeling thermometer (FT, from 0 to 100 points, ranging from very cold or unfavorable [lowest score] to very warm or favorable [highest score]; included in the second-year [R2] and third-year [R3] questionnaires). The R2 Questionnaire included a racial Implicit Association Test (IAT; range: -2 to 2).
   RESULTS Among the 3392 nonblack resident physician respondents, 1693 (49.9%) were male, 1964 (57.9%) were younger than 30 years, and 2362 (69.6%) self-identified as belonging to the white race. In this cohort, 1529 of 3380 resident physicians (45.2%) had symptoms of burnout and 1394 of 3377 resident physicians (41.3%) had depression. From this group, 12 did not complete the burnout items and 15 did not complete the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) items. The mean (SD) FT score toward black people was 77.9 (21.0) and toward white people was 81.1 (20.1), and the mean (SD) racial IAT score was 0.4 (0.4). Burnout at the R2 Questionnaire time point was associated with greater explicit and implicit racial biases. In multivariable analyses adjusting for demographics, specialty, depression, and FT scores toward white people, resident physicians with burnout had greater explicit racial bias (difference in FT score, -2.40; 95% CI, -3.42 to -1.37; P <.001) and implicit racial bias (difference in IAT score, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P =.002). A dose-response association was found between change in depersonalization from R2 to R3 Questionnaire and R3 Questionnaire explicit bias (for each 1-point increase the difference in R3 FT score decreased, -0.73; 95% CI, -1.23 to -0.23; P =.004) and change in explicit bias.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among resident physicians, symptoms of burnout appeared to be associated with greater explicit and implicit racial biases; given the high prevalence of burnout and the negative implications of bias for medical care, symptoms of burnout may be factors in racial disparities in health care.

AB  - Feminists have long argued that women who offend are judged by who they are, not what they do, with idealised images of femininity and motherhood used as measures of culpability. The ability to meet the expectations of motherhood and femininity are particularly difficult for women who experience a crisis pregnancy, as evident in cases where women have been convicted of concealment of birth. The offence prohibits the secret disposal of the dead body of a child, to conceal knowledge of its birth. Traditionally used to prosecute women suspected of killing their newborn children, analysis of court transcripts suggests the offence is also used to punish women who fail to meet expectations of motherhood. This paper analyses three contemporary cases in light of the historical origins of the offence, illustrating the legacy of prejudice against 'deviant' mothers. Finally, it questions the continued existence of this archaic offence.

AB  - In 1522 Island of Rhodes, entered under the sovereignty of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. After this date, the Turkish empery began on the island about 400 years till 1912 the Italy occupied the island. During this period, a rich and deeply rooted Turkish culture was emerged in the island materially and spiritually. Especially compared to the previous centuries, in the 19th century, many Western travellers visited the island of Rhodes, which was under Turkish rule; they made observations and make some points. Western travellers saw that closely on this Turkish ruled Rhodes Island, the Greek, the Jewish and the Turkish people living together in a tolerance and peace. They wrote many details about the island's social structure, economic and cultural life. It is possible to reach the impressions about the texture of the society and daily life of the island of Rhodes from their travel notes, however, more importantly, from these works of the Western travellers, the prejudices of the Eastern image of the Turkish sovereignty on the island of Rhodes are often found to be in vain. In this study, Western travellers of mainly British origin who came to the 19th century to the island of Rhodes, their impressions of the daily life such as social structure, population, religion, religious and cultural structures, customs and traditions, clothes and cleanliness on the island were analyzed. In addition, many observations of Western travellers such as agriculture, commerce, service sector, security, tax, ship building activities and livelihoods of the island were also evaluated.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to identify the essential needs of pregnant women and new mothers who were using crack that could help them to build a drug-free life. Methods: This case study with a qualitative approach was carried out with three pregnant women and two new mothers who were crack users. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews between October and December 2015. Results: Four categories appeared: "The need for protecting the child", "The need for family support", "The need for a trust relationship with professionals", and "Spiritual needs". Conclusions: Rebuilding a drug-free way of living is a collective undertaking involving the family not just as a resource, but also as an object of care. Professionals need to rethink their values and prejudices. Furthermore, governments must take this responsibility because their children will suffer if these women do not attend public health care services.

AB  - Food-type soybean, considered a functional and nutritious food, becomes an new alternative food in human nutrition, and its preserve is an option to the consumer market. The present study aims to verify the effect of maceration time of the grains and the acetic acid concentration in brine on the physical and chemical characteristics of a edible soybean preserves, and to evaluate the proximal composition, microbiological risk and sensory acceptance of the selected preserve. The methodology used was the response surface and the central composite rotational design. The presence of acetic acid in the brine was prejudicial to the quality of the edible soybean preserve - BRSMG 790A cultivar. The soybean preserve with the best characteristics was obtained with a maceration time of 100 minutes and without the addition of acetic acid. The product was microbiological safe, showed sensory acceptance and high nutritional value (15.5 g 100 g(-1) of protein and 7.0 g 100 g(-1) of lipid), free of trypsin inhibitor. The essential amino acids represented 17.2% of those in the dry grain, more than 50% the standard values proposed for the essential amino acids for children and adults. The selected preserve maintained 31.25% of the antioxidant activity of the grains and could be used as a viable technological option.

AB  - Bisexual individuals suffer poorer well-being than their gay and lesbian peers. The current work highlights the identity denial experiences of people who identify as gay, lesbian, and bisexual through self-reports and quantitative measures. Study 1 (N = 130) asked participants about unsupportive experiences during sexual identity disclosure and found that experiences of identity denial were more frequently reported by bisexual individuals compared to gay and lesbian peers. Study 2 (N = 202) examined the distinct relationship of identity denial experiences, above and beyond other prejudiced responses and discrimination, with well-being and self-concept outcomes. Results suggest identity denial is a frequent experience for bisexual individuals and is uniquely associated with lower psychological well-being and a less clear self-concept.

AB  - As a field, sociocultural linguistics has a long legacy of public scholarship that has worked to counter linguistic prejudices and inequalities perpetuated through language. Today, current community engagement within sociocultural linguistics increasingly takes a collaborative approach that includes students. In this article, I therefore explore how the field prepares both students and faculty for this work. In particular, I focus on courses with a service learning component, suggesting that these constitute key spaces for developing the commitments and capacities necessary for engaged work that advances sociolinguistic justice. I highlight the insights of existing scholarship on service learning in linguistics before turning to a more detailed discussion of pedagogical practice, drawing on current critical pedagogy literature that emphasize the importance of language and culture. Synthesizing two social movement perspectives, I propose a pedagogical framework that supports faculty and students in learning to accompany as an accomplice. I demonstrate the application of this model by discussing specific pedagogical strategies enacted in a community engaged course I taught on Language and Migration at a university in the United States. Ultimately, I suggest that developing social justice pedagogies is a crucial endeavor if we are to counter the ways that language has been used to justify inequalities and motivate violence towards racialized communities, both in the past and in the present.

AB  - Crimes based on hate crimes against a person or property based on malicious, malicious, and prejudiced motives against a particular social group. In today's world, many factors can lead to hate crimes. These crimes were initially about racial disagreements but today there are many factors that can be the basis for hate crimes, factors such as race, nationality, religious beliefs, gender identity and disability. Hate crimes potentially create serious problems for public order and public safety. These types of crimes cause social unrest and the distraction of cultural groups and damage solidarity. It also stimulates inter-group crises and eventually extremism in society. Internal conflicts that have the effect of widespread hatred are likely to enter a military phase. In hate crimes, there may not be anyone wronged and the whole of a social group has fallen victim to itself. The analysis and evaluation of hate crimes in the light of large-scale criminological and sociological theories shows that the commission of crimes in this area is complex and has many dimensions. Hate crimes are among the high-risk crimes that, due to the complexity of the psychological and criminological perspective, it is not possible to propose a preventive strategy to deal with it. The study investigates these crimes and tries to help in managing and controlling these crimes by examining the main factors involved in committing such crimes.

TI  - Combatting racism to create a better Australia: the potential of the national cross-curriculum priority of teaching Aboriginal histories and cultures
T2  - AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The need for anti-racism education in Australia is evident in the regular incidents of racism experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. By not providing an alternative discourse to the racism in society, students leave school carrying into their employment and other spheres of adult life the prejudices they have developed. Although teaching against racism is not directly addressed in the new Australian curriculum, the teaching of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures has been made a cross-curriculum priority. This paper examines the potential for the national cross-curriculum priority - and particularly the facilitation of a positive discourse about Aboriginal cultures, histories and achievements -to achieve anti-racism learning outcomes. It explores how a program of learning, co-designed with an Aboriginal Elder and educator, moved students to imagine the experiences of Aboriginal peoples, and, as a result, drop prejudices and adopt more positive thoughts and feelings towards them.

AB  - Norvelt is a New Deal subsistence homestead community in western Pennsylvania established to provide secure and comfortable homes, access to healthy food, and an affirming cooperative community to unemployed miners and their families. It succeeded in these aims, but its virtual exclusion of African American residents affirmed the racial prejudice and discrimination that permeated much of the New Deal. Creating an integrated community would have met with great resistance from white residents, who voted to exclude African American applicants, and from powerful regional voices already suspicious of what they considered to be a socialist experiment. Accommodating racial prejudice perpetuated injustices that denied African Americans access to opportunities available to whites.

AB  - Relations between Mexican emigres and U.S.-born Mexican Americans have often been strained due to economic rivalry, differences in language usage and social mores, and the concern that immigrants would fuel Anglo-American stereotypes about people of Mexican heritage. Devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe at San Antonio's San Fernando Cathedral during the 1920s and early 1930s provides an apt case study for an analysis of group relations between ethnic Mexican natives and newcomers. During this period Guadalupan devotion at San Fernando increasingly reflected the conflictive sentiments of exile: hope and fear, patriotism and protest, trust in celestial protection and humble acquiescence to divine reprimand, longing for home and struggles over cultural expectations in a new land, such as women's roles as daughters, mothers, and homemakers. At the same time, in the face of Anglo-American hostility and prejudice, the transformation of San Fernando's annual Guadalupe celebrations into intense exile rituals expressed confident assurance that ethnic Mexican residents were a chosen people, invigorating their faith and ethnic pride. The San Fernando case reveals both the possibilities and pitfalls for traditional religious devotions in fostering group cohesion between established residents and newcomers.

AB  - This paper asks what are the potential responsibilities to respect, protect, and fulfill international human rights law (IHRL) of a particular class of non-State actors: non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The paper focuses on those NGOs pursuing development in a post-genocide/post-mass-atrocity transitional justice context acting simultaneously in partnership with State governments, as proxies, and providing essential public goods as part of their development remit. It uses post-genocide Rwanda as an example to illustrate how respect and fulfillment of the IHRL pertaining to reparative justice are hindered by failing to hold NGOs responsible for IHRL. This paper defines reparative justice in accordance with the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of IHRL and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law. These are centered upon five principles: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition. I argue that many development NGOs in Rwanda, by not adequately incorporating reparative justice into their development and transitional justice remit and not acknowledging and responding to the distinctive rights and vulnerabilities of genocide survivors, are neglecting IHRL on the right to reparative justice. They have the capacity to prioritize reparative justice in their programming for genocide survivors and in their negotiations with the Rwandan government of how development aid will be disbursed in Rwanda, who will be its recipients, and the prioritization of those facing disadvantage so as not to further marginalize them. I argue, furthermore, that current soft law demands that NGOs should never enter into a contract for provision of development aid with a sovereign that knowingly entails - whether by commission or omission - a violation of IHRL. Though States are ultimately held legally responsible for the acts of NGOs this should not prejudice NGOs being held socially and morally responsible in some capacity and some degree, simultaneously. There is potential for new soft-law moral and social standards regulating NGO behavior to become legal obligations, if they eventually achieve widespread status and practice as customary international law.

AB  - The paper considers the importance of epistemic justice in democratic life, and the significance of education as a key space to foster the relevant epistemic capabilities. Epistemic in/justice offers resources to think about conditions of possibility (what Amartya Sen calls conversion factors'), given that societies train our sensibilities in ways which are flawed and prejudiced. It is proposed further that Amartya Sen's emphasis on public reasoning is central to epistemic justice. Using the space of education to make the argument, core ideas in the capability approach are first outlined. Epistemic justice is described, and the claim is then advanced that Miranda Fricker's epistemic contribution capability' is generative in education settings for developing democratic and public reasoning capabilities. To be fully involved in learning and development and fair-achieved outcomes in formal education, students would need opportunities to develop their epistemic capability of being able both to receive information and to make interpretive contributions to the common pool of knowledge, understanding, and practical deliberation. Conditions of respect, recognition and equal moral worth would be required so that all students should have access to the capability and to have their contributions taken up as integral to their flourishing. Thus, in universities and schools, epistemic virtues should be educated, trained, developed and scaffolded pedagogically, including cultivating emotions. The paper then considers the challenge of free speech and what this may demand of us educationally.

AB  - As the overdose crisis in North America continues to deepen, public health leaders find themselves responding to sensational media stories, many of which carry forms and themes that mark them as urban legends.
   This article analyzes one set of media accounts - stories of misuse of naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote distributed to people who use drugs - through the lens of social science scholarship on urban legends. We suggest that these stories have met a public need to feel a sense of safety in uncertain times, but function to reinforce societal views of people who use drugs as undeserving of support and resources.
   Our field has a duty to speak out in favour of evidence-based programs that support the health of people who use drugs, but the optimal communication strategies are not always clear. Drawing attention to the functions and consequences of urban legends can help frame public health communication in a way that responds to needs without reinforcing prejudices, with application beyond naloxone to the other urban legends that continue to emerge in response to this crisis.

TI  - Theatricality and the Construction of 'Skill'
T2  - PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - This article offers a counterpoint to recent proposals to renew contemporary British theatre through a 'turn to the crafts', in which emphasis is placed on the capacity of all artists to reflect on and reimagine the structures in which they are embedded, just as artisans find themselves thinking through the material with which they work. These proposals understate the extent to which theatre is distinguished from other art forms by the degree to which the framing of actions before an audience holds any such synthesis of the material and the conceptual at bay, however slightly. In the contemporary moment, theatre's most distinctive function might be to provide a space where ideas of skill are isolated and constructed, not merely executed. This argument is developed by highlighting the role that theatricality already plays in recent (and otherwise more general) theories of skill. For Richard Sennett, theatrical encounters are paradigmatic of the way in which collaborative social relations depend upon participants recognising the distinct, codified skills of others. In contrast, Tim Ingold's anti-theatrical prejudice is born of a desire to refuse the need for such abstraction and codification, in favour of reviving a 'dwelling perspective'. To recognise, instead, that theatrical works are inevitably interventions within an inhabited environment, as well as interventions in it, suggests that Ingold's 'dwelling perspective' is always-already compromised and commodified. This analysis provides the context for an interpretation of Secret Theatre's 2014-15 devised performance A Series of Increasingly Impossible Acts, to assess the extent to which the collaborative reskilling that explicitly informed the show's production was carried over (and was intended to be carried over) into its reception by audiences. The conclusion draws on Michael Fried to suggest that an ambivalence towards 'the crafts' in recent British theatrical culture is indicative of an ongoing ambivalence towards modernism.

AB  - This essay explores the intersection of race, religion, and nationality in marriage by concentrating on unions between Britons and 'Arabs' (those from North Africa and the Middle East) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Focusing on this area, most of which was not in the British Empire, allows an analysis of the intersection between the empire and the larger world. Marriage was a nexus in the intertwined prejudices of race, empire, class, and religion. Though the British primarily blamed polygamy for any marital problems, their own gendered law of nationality was equally at fault. Indeed, the centrality of gender was clearest in three circumstances. First, many women refused to be 'white women in peril,' instead exercising agency in their relationships. Second, British men who moved to the Middle East, converted to Islam, and married Muslim women, became legal hybrids who struggled to pass on British nationality to their wives and children. Third, British-born women married to Middle Eastern Christians faced similar problems, despite marrying other monogamists. In the 1930s, the British government formed a committee to address these issues, but the committee failed to find solutions, in part because the members, like the British state, supported racial/national coverture for women and thus refused to consider granting women equal rights in nationality. As a result, women married to men of different races and nations remained vulnerable to desertion and divorce in the interwar period. Such issues both confirmed the importance of an imperial frame of mind, but also the fact that the dilemmas went well beyond the formal empire.

TI  - "Song from the Soil": The Role of Nature in Yusef Komunyakaa's Poetry
T2  - ENGLISH STUDIES

KW  - AFRICAN-AMERICAN POETRY
AB  - Raised in the American South during the political and social upheavals of the Civil Rights era, poet Yusef Komunyakaa came of age at a time when his identity as an African American cast him constantly and self-consciously as a second-class citizen. Throughout his poetry, which is deeply informed by personal experiences of racial prejudice, Komunyakaa sheds light on the many ways that racial oppression in the US has been internalized by African Americans and how this oppression has affected all aspects of African American life. Komunyakaa's poetry, however, does not stop at the level of examination; it engages instead, in the act of recovery. This essay argues that through his poetic contemplations on nature and the supreme indifference of nature's processes, Komunyakaa discovers an ideal foil to racist constructions of African American identity. By utilizing the insights of postcolonial and critical race theorists in general, as well as engaging with the emerging conversation concerning African American poetry and eco-criticism, this essay identifies the obstacles to Komunyakaa's aims and the poetic strategies he uses to overcome these obstacles.

AB  - I am a critical post-Positivist - and hold it as a badge of honor. To be a Positivist means that you are humbly willing to put your theory to a test that can falsify it - that is, to show that it is wrong despite all that you have put into it. To be a post-Positivist means believing in that standard but also acknowledging the limitations of Positivism, including limitations of measurement and its theory-dependence as well as acknowledging that there are social processes in science too. A post-Positivist does not claim that other epistemologies are necessarily wrong. It is just that researchers who adhere to the falsification principle are willing to put their money where their claims are, rather than allowing in the temptation to endlessly massage theories so that they are constantly updated to be consistent with new facts. In that vein, Positivism, despite its limitations, can by virtue of the falsification principle put a dent in confirmation bias and the kind of heuristics suggested by Tversky and Kahneman that prejudice our seeing patterns even when they do not exist. It is in that spirit that this paper is written.

AB  - Discussions of intellectual disability are found in medical journals, published biographies, and disability research. However, outside the realm of medicine or personal reminiscence intellectual disability struggles for spaces of social, historical, cultural and imaginative representation. This article addresses these struggles for space and specifically focuses on the imagined space of narrative fiction. Being imagined spaces they should easily be able to accommodate people with disability, and yet, very few characters with intellectual disability are represented or more importantly have agency in narrative fiction. Drawing on work from feminist geographies and literary geographies this article addresses the limiting narrative structures that have been used against fictional characters who have a disability and ways authors may move beyond these limitations. Reconciling feminist geographies and literary geographies allows new critical spatial knowledge around disability to emerge. It is not enough to write characters with disabilities into narrative fiction if the structures surrounding them remain limiting and prejudiced. This article discusses the three main limiting structures in narrative fiction: character representation, narrative voice and genre. Looking at narrative fiction through feminist and literary geographies reveals how these limiting structures function as power hierarchies, and importantly, shows how these imposed structures can be subverted and changed.

AB  - The desa wisata terpadu policy was created in 1992 by the Indonesian government. Translated as integrated touristic villages, this model promotes an archetype of sustainable development adapted according to the characteristics of the local villages. Twenty-five years after the creation of this policy, it becomes relevant to examine its capacity to do so, by meeting the expectations of sustainable tourism, understood as a motor of global development and territorial integration. Because Bali remains the most important touristic destination in Indonesia, this study focus on this special case, and more especially on three villages considered as model examples: Penglipuran, Tenganan and Jatiluwih. For each, have been studying its economic sustainability, analyzing whether tourism brings local economic development; its social sustainability, evaluating the capacity of tourism to foster cohesion among the inhabitants by maintaining the traditional local organization; and its cultural sustainability, examining the complex effects of tourism on the preservation of local heritage. The methodology is based on a multi-case study, through a qualitative approach composed of 12 interviews with actors and inhabitants among the local population involved in tourism. Our results show that the three villages are successfully meeting the expectations of sustainable tourism by favoring economic growth that enables the local population to keep their community alive through community-based management that globally respects the traditional organization. However, their sustainability remains fragile and needs to be improved through an increasingly efficient socio-economic model. It includes more flexibility to involve young qualified inhabitants, without gender prejudice, in order to avoid the 'vicious circle' of a lack of qualified human resources limiting their capacity for economic growth. Those results may be of interest to researchers who are involved with tourism and sustainability issues, but also to institutions and professionals working on the establishment of sustainable models of tourism in Bali or elsewhere.

This paper aims to propose a multi-method interpretive framework, integrating a historiographical approach and an archival investigation, and use the case of business responses to disability in colonial and post-independence India to elucidate the proposed framework. Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a summary of a proposed framework for the historical study of marginalized social issues using an interpretive paradigm. It also outlines the advantages and limitations of the proposed framework. Findings This paper makes a methodological contribution in multi-method interpretive research design for the historical study of socially constructed issues, neglected because of deep prejudice and social exclusion, that offer complex challenges for modern businesses seeking inclusive workplace strategies. Originality/value This paper proposes a research framework that contextualizes social issues in history (historiographical study) and cases of business responses to these issues (archival study) for the examination of historically marginalized issues in the business-society relationship.

AB  - The German Democratic Republic (GDR; East Germany) had an ambivalent relationship with homosexuality. Under the principles of socialism, everyone was welcome to contribute to the greater good. The situation for queer people, here lesbians and gay men, was different: one of illegality and invisibility. A difficulty in analyzing these experiences is the theory and methodology necessary to find them and draw them together in a historical narrative. This essay offers a mode of analysis in which theories of affect illustrate long-term trends in East German conceptualizations of same-sex sexuality. By discussing a 1950 court ruling and a 1989 film, the essay demonstrates the persistence of homophobic prejudice and fear of homosexual seduction of young people and the links to historical and legal developments.

AB  - Sizeism has a negative impact on women and perpetuates fat shaming. Conventional therapeutic suggestions for addressing weight concerns focus on self-discipline rather than on the larger social, cultural, or political contexts of weight stigma. Feminist scholars, therapists, and activists have encouraged social activism to promote psychological well-being and challenge systemic weight prejudice. Results of research on health prevention and promotion efforts have begun to shift thinking away from weight loss and toward deconstructing and changing anti-fat attitudes. We highlight some individual and community-based fat activists to illustrate how their strategies and ideas challenge sizeism in a variety of areas, including the rhetoric of fat, body positivity, photography/art, nutrition/exercise, and diversity/intersectionality. Fat activism has utility within a therapeutic context, especially for those who have experienced sizeism. We strongly encourage therapists to work closely with clients on finding sources and types of fat activism that represent their unique identities, which may be more difficult for those with marginalized identities.

AB  - Social scientists are often reluctant to think that cruel words express actual personal cruelty-so when they hear people speak harshly about minorities or women, they tend to blame stress and anxiety, not hate. In that spirit, it is often said that voters who favored Donald Trump in 2016 supported him not because they vibrated with his vindictive rhetoric but rather because they were fearful about their finances. However, many recent studies, including my papers with Eric Hanley, undermine that claim. Financial worries were widespread and did not distinguish Republicans from Democrats in 2016. Rather, what typified Trump partisans was the vehemence of their prejudices-for a domineering leader who would "crush evil" and "get rid of rotten apples" and against feminists, liberals, immigrants, and minorities. My contention here is that grasping this point is essential if we hope to understand the kind of authoritarianism that Trump represents.

AB  - Racism is still a scourge of our time. Those who find themselves at the centre of this onslaught carry in their hearts and minds centuries of debilitating prejudice, recognising that their own experience of discrimination is simply another stage in its unfolding history and the ongoing social structure which underpins it. Carrying such weight is bound to have a deleterious effect on their personal lives and determines their responses to any discrimination felt and perceived. Reconciliation is required to heal the wounds inflicted by such false representation. I suggest that the Desert Christians offered insights into this matter and offered remedies for reconciliation, all of which constituted a stable base for self-renewal and a solid foundation in the struggle for social justice. Like twentieth-century liberation theologians, reading scripture encouraged them to be confident about finding ways, both personal and social, to be freed from oppression and anger and to support others who desired the same. Perhaps victims of racist abuse and hatred might look to both phenomena in finding possible ways forward for their predicament.

AB  - The prevalence of pseudo-scientific ideas and "neuromyths" among coaches, coupled with the need to improve the contents of their education programmes, has recently been highlighted in the scientific literature. In this opinion paper, we identify and discuss some common beliefs, prejudices and tacit assumptions in the field of sport sciences that can favour the presence of pseudo-science in education and professional practice, such as: (a) sport is too complex a phenomenon to be studied scientifically, (b) sport needs applied science, (c) in sport, practice and experience are more important than theory; (d) all theories are partly true and equally acceptable; and (e) there are "hard sciences" (biological) and "soft sciences" (social). In relation to the arguments outlined, several intervention recommendations are shared for the institutions and organisms in charge of training sport science professionals.

AB  - South African law has traditionally denied property sharing rights to people in non-marital intimate partnerships, but a series of new cases has created the possibility of enforcing universal partnership contracts to claim a share in partnership property. However, evidential biases within these progressive cases reflect a historical disdain for women's contributions to relationships and a widespread reluctance to believe women's testimony about the existence of agreements to share. These biases bear strong resemblances to the gender stereotypes which have been the subject of feminist critique in rape law. Central to both rape and universal partnerships is the issue of consent or agreement between men and women. This, in turn, depends on social beliefs about male and female entitlements in the realms of sex and intimate relationships. The paper highlights the commonalities and parallels between the legal treatment of women's evidence about the existence of contracts on the one hand, and the prejudice faced by complainants in rape cases.

AB  - The distribution and consumption of transgender time-lapse videos on YouTube have increased over the last few decades, providing trans communities with a valuable resource for self-making. On YouTube, vloggers can present images and videos of their bodies as they document their gender transitions through several practices that rely on temporality and time-space compression. As a genre, time-lapse videos comprise creative worldmaking practices where users document their gender transformations using hundreds to thousands of still photos or video segments which show their social, somatic, and biochemical changes. Although scholars have discussed different worldmaking and community organising practices that take place as trans vloggers display their gendered subjectivities online, there is sparse scholarship studying the recurrent patterns of behaviour on the comment space below these videos. In this article, I draw on critical discourse analytic studies of new media and stance-taking as I review and analyse discriminatory strategies - principally misgendering and ungendering - that YouTubers used to denigrate the self-identified gender of a given vlogger. Stance-taking enables us to identify and track reoccurring attitudes steeped in cisgenderism. At the same time, capturing how vloggers and trans allies respond to (intentional or unintentional) text-based forms of prejudice, can create teachable moments for YouTube spectators. While misgendering stances aim to pressure their targets into certain kinds of gender and sex embodiments, insurrectionary stance-acts co-opt and call out the language of discrimination, lending legitimacy and authority to trans vloggers to create, enact, and live their own genders.

AB  - This article establishes historically specific connections between American artist Roger Shimomura's paintings about Japanese American Incarceration and Incarceration Redress from roughly 1978 to 2003. Deploying a kind of history painting in the Minidoka series before turning to personal narrative in Diary and the juxtaposition of contrasting visual tropes in Stereotypes and Admonitions, Shimomura's varying approaches reflect connections to timely emphases on raising awareness, sharing testimony, and preventing reoccurrences associated with significant moments in the detainment's afterlife. Throughout these shifts in focus, Shimomura's use of visual stereotype increasingly frames incarceration within its broader social meaning, rather than through its historical progression or its personal resonances. I show how Shimomura's work comes to connect incarceration to its enduring social consequences, making it but one of many recent, racially motivated transgressions that provide greater lessons about the perpetuation of naturalized prejudice in the United States and its material effects.

AB  - What makes us willing to sacrifice our own self-interest for another person? Humans can forgo short-term individual gain to achieve long-term benefits(1-4)-but long-run self-interest cannot fully explain unselfish behaviour(5). Collaboration in our evolutionary past may have played a role in shaping an innate human sense of distributive justice(6), influencing who we consider deserving of our aid or generosity. Previous research has not been able to isolate this response to collaboration as an independent effect, distinct from other motivations to share(7,8). Here we present evidence of a pure collaboration effect, distinct from motivations of future reciprocity, in-group favouritism or concern for accountability. We demonstrate this effect among adult subjects in an economic setting, showing that the effect constitutes a psychological phenomenon with relevance for real-world social and political behaviour. This collaboration effect is substantial: it motivates sharing among people otherwise inclined to share nothing and increases the proportion of participants willing to give up half of their allotted money. We find evidence supporting our hypothesis that the collaboration effect operates by creating a sense of debt owed to one's collaborator.

AB  - Studies in Canada reveal the entrenched nature of the nation's mining paradigm that fundamentally undermines the interests of Indigenous peoples. However, very few research studies have explored the hidden biases and manipulations in the process of framing the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of mines, particularly if developed on Indigenous land. The objectives of the study were to explore what biases and manipulations played roles in framing the EIA of uranium mining on Indigenous (Inuit) land in Labrador (Canada). The study analyzed all the archived documents (print and audio/video) related to the EIA process of the Kitts-Michelin project in Labrador (Canada). The EIA of the Kitts-Michelin project was poorly designed, with ill-planned public dissemination. The study demonstrates how hidden biases and manipulation in the entire process of EIA have served the purposes of certain interest groups and willfully neglected community concerns. The analysis of EIA reveals the institutionalization of biases and exclusionary processes and also exposes institutional racism that is running much deeper than merely prejudice. Although Inuit representatives attended the environmental review panel hearings, the decision makers were predominantly non-Indigenous (external consultants and members of the EIA review panel) and the final decision makers were always non-Inuit (and not local). The study shows that in-depth analysis of existing EIA along with the unpublished documents and audio and video records of panel hearings can provide a comprehensive understanding of racial, social, and environmental inequities associated with historical mining activities in Canada's Indigenous territories.

AB  - ObjectiveIn 2013, the Philippines was struck by typhoon Haiyan, which damaged local hospitals and disrupted health care. The Belgian First Aid and Support Team erected a field hospital and water purification unit in Palo. This study aims to describe the diagnoses encountered and treatment provided.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, medical records of 1267 field hospital patients were reviewed for gender, age, complaints, diagnoses, and management and referral information.ResultsAlmost 28% of the patients suffered from injury, but most presented with nonsurgical diseases (64%), particularly of respiratory (31%), dermatological (11%), and digestive (8%) origin. Only 53% presented with disaster-related pathology, and 59% showed signs of infection. Patients needed wound care (47%), pain relief (33%), or antibiotics (29%); 9% needed procedures, 8% needed fluid therapy, and 5% needed psychological support. Children under 5 years of age were more at risk for infections (OR, 18.8; CI, 10.6-33.3) and injuries (OR, 10.3; CI, 6.3-16.8). Males were more prone to injuries than females (OR, 2.1; CI, 1.6-2.6).ConclusionsOne week after the acute phase of a typhoon, respiratory, dermatological, and digestive problems emerge to the prejudice of trauma. Only 53% of patients presented with disaster-related conditions. Young children are more at risk for injury and infectious diseases. These trends should be anticipated when composing Emergency Medical Teams and medical resources to be sent to disaster sites. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2019;13:265-278)

AB  - We investigated how the perception of being dissimilar to others at work relates to employees' felt inclusion, distinguishing between surface-level and deep-level dissimilarity. In addition, we tested the indirect relationships between surface-level and deep-level dissimilarity and work-related outcomes, through social inclusion. Furthermore, we tested the moderating role of a climate for inclusion in the relationship between perceived dissimilarity and felt inclusion. We analyzed survey data from 887 employees of a public service organization. An ANOVA showed that felt inclusion was lower for individuals who perceived themselves as deep-level dissimilar compared to individuals who perceived themselves as similar, while felt inclusion did not differ among individuals who perceived themselves as surface-level similar or dissimilar. Furthermore, a moderated mediation analysis showed a negative conditional indirect relationship between deep-level dissimilarity and work-related outcomes through felt inclusion. Interestingly, while the moderation showed that a positive climate for inclusion buffered the negative relationship between deep-level dissimilarity and felt inclusion, it also positively related to feelings of inclusion among all employees, regardless of their perceived (dis)similarity. This research significantly improves our understanding of how perceived dissimilarity affects employees by distinguishing between surface-level and deep-level dissimilarity and by demonstrating the importance of a climate for inclusion.

AB  - University campuses serve as second homes for students, teachers, administrators, and parents coming from diverse regions, religions, classes, castes, and different genders. Interaction and camaraderie between the major characters in the academe develop. The bonhomie that exists between the stakeholders of the academe has its own rules, rules that are marked by the interference of power. The one wielding more power by virtue of one's position, class, caste, or gender tries to dictate the terms of a particular relationship. Relations evolve as power relations, whereby a specific code of conduct regarding speech, behavior, thought, writing, love, and life is laid down for all-from administrators and professors to students and parents. This article studies how in a location as specific as Chennai University as described in Srividya Natarajan's No Onions Nor Garlic, the ideological prejudices and hierarchical divisions highlighted by the play of power affect the daily life of the academe and chart out the course of action for everyone, from professors, students, high caste, low caste to men and women, involved in power relations. On the basis of that, this article suggests power in general serves not only to suppress the powerless but is productive also, as countering power with power creates a proper kind of resistance that blurs the difference between the agent and the target of power in power relations.

T2  - PSYCHOANALYTIC DIALOGUES
LA  - English
AB  - What does it mean to discover an unspoken Nazi past in one's own family? In a moment defined by chance and circumstance, I discovered that my German grandfather had joined the Nazi Party. Using my family's struggle with memory as a site of inquiry, I examine the process of remembering, its transmission, and dissociation, particularly as it relates to past and present perpetrator groups. What lurks in the silences that are passed down between generations? How does our collective response to history's atrocities shape what we what we know and remember as individuals? How do we define the moral obligations of memory, or understand the power of dissociation more than seven decades after the Holocaust? When does complacency in the face of past or present injustice make us complicit? Any answer to these questions points to the complexity of memory and the ethical demands of history. Connections between collective crimes of the past and social injustices in the present are considered and different forms of historical awareness and personal responsibility are discussed. In the face of overt prejudice and racism, "history's call" and the work of psychoanalysis are inherently related.

   Methodology: This transverse research work was based on non-probability sampling method. Two hundred and five medical students were the participants of this research work. The duration of this research work was from July 2017 to October 2018. The measurements of prejudicial behaviors and consent to work together carried out on the basis of a little written description on four case with the utilization of PES (Prejudicial Evaluation Scale) & SIS (Social Interaction Scale). SPSS software version seventeen was in use for the analysis of the data. T test was in use for the calculation of the disparities among the average inventory score & every inventory item. Paired T test was in use for the analysis of the disparity in the behavior of the students of medical field after & before attending the medical institute.
   Results: Very high significant disparities were available in the behavior of medical students concluded by the general average scores of responses to the patients suffering with AIDS (44.45 +/- 9.32) & (24.22 +/- 11.69) versus patients of leukemia (49.65 +/- 10.73) & (20.67 +/- 7.84) of prejudicial evaluation scale & social interaction scale Intervention correspondingly. The comparison on these scales for every item on both of these scales concluded various items to be different for patients suffering with AIDS versus patients of Leukemia displaying negative bias to the group of stigmatization.
   Conclusions: The medical students found with negative prejudice for the patients suffering with AIDS & stated much lower consent to work together with AIDS in comparison with the patients suffering with the patients of leukemia.

AB  - HIV and sexuality stigma impede HIV prevention and care efforts. HealthMpowerment.org (HMP) is an interactive mobile phone- and web-based HIV prevention and care intervention for young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM; ages 18-30) in the United States. HMP included three forums where participants could share their experiences. In this study, we explored whether engaging in stigma-related discussions was associated with changes in YBMSM's stigma-related scores throughout the trial. YBMSM (ages 18-30; N=238) participating in HMP completed surveys at baseline, and 3 and 6month follow-ups that included a series of scales focused on HIV and sexuality (internalized homophobia; sexual prejudice) stigma. Sixty-two participants contributed to the forums (1497 posts). We coded instances where YBMSM's conversations were stigma related (915 posts, 61.1%), including discussions of anticipated (74/915, 8.1%), experienced (125/915, 13.7%), internalized (410/915, 44.8%), and/or challenged (639/915, 69.8%) stigma regarding sexuality and HIV. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined whether changes in YBMSM's stigma scores were associated with stigma-related discussions within the forum. We controlled for age, HIV status, income, and educational attainment in these multivariable models. YBMSM who discussed experiencing HIV stigma in the forums reported decreases in perceived HIV stigma over time (b=-0.37, p0.05). YBMSM whose forum posts indicated anticipated HIV stigma reported increases in HIV stigma over time (b=0.46, p0.01). Participants who challenged sexuality-related stigma in forums had lower internalized homophobia (b=-0.68, p0.01) at baseline. YBMSM whose discussions focused on experiencing sexuality-related stigma reported increases in internalized homophobia (b=0.39, p0.01) and sexual prejudice (b=0.87, p0.05) over time. Developing strategies to combat stigma remains a key priority. HMP created an online space where YBMSM could discuss HIV and sexuality stigma. Although a limited number of HMP participants authored the majority of these forum discussions, the discussions were associated with changes in the sample's stigma scores over time. Online interventions (e.g., social media, apps) should consider the inclusion of forums to address stigma and test the efficacy of forums to improve YBMSM's HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes.

AB  - In recent years, White-dominated communities have begun to attend more to issues of diversity and inclusion. To this effect, many communities have instituted formal diversity training sessions. Frequently, these include exercises designed to facilitate White people's awareness of how whiteness shapes their experiences. We investigated how generation and political orientation might shape individuals' responses to such interventions in a context in which commitments to social justice compete with concerns with abstract liberalism. A national online sample responded to a racial privilege checklist (or a control checklist), then expressed attitudes about an Airbnb.com policy that enables hosts' racial discrimination against guests. The present evidence indicates that while a White privilege salience exercise may increase anti-racist attitudes in moderate and liberal Pre-Millennials, it is associated with a backlash effect in Millennial conservatives and moderates, who express more racist attitudes when White privilege is salient compared with a control condition. We discuss potential mechanisms, as well as implications for diversity initiatives and limitations.

AB  - Managers of startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) tend to view subsidiaries as the preferred export mode. Yet this type of organization is associated with a high failure rate. Our in-depth interviews with more than 40 managers show that their bias in favor of foreign sales subsidiaries is rooted in unsubstantiated beliefs about control and the superiority of subsidiaries over other export modes. This article details the faulty reasoning that supports these prejudices and proposes a simple method for selecting more profitable and less risky international entry strategies.

AB  - Critical consciousness (CC) has emerged as a framework for understanding how low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth recognize, interpret, and work to change the experiences and systems of oppression that they face in their daily lives. Despite this, relatively little is known about how youths' experiences with economic hardship and structural oppression shape how they "read their world" and motivate participation in critical action behaviors. We explore this issue using a mixed-methods design and present our findings in two studies. In Study 1 we examine the types of issues that a sample of low-income and predominantly racial/ethnic minority youth (ages 13-17) living in the Chicago area discuss when asked to reflect on issues that are important to them. The most commonly mentioned themes were community violence (59%), prejudice and intolerance (31%), world issues (25%), and economic disparities (18%). In Study 2 we examine youths' quantitative reports of engaging in critical action behavior; more than 65% had participated in at least one activity targeting social change in the previous 6 months. We then examined relationships between youths' experiences with poverty within their households and neighborhoods, neighborhood income inequality, and exposure to violence and youths' likelihood of participating in critical action behaviors. Greater exposure to violence and neighborhood income inequality were related to an increased likelihood of engaging in critical action behaviors. This work highlights the diverse ways that low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth reflect on societal inequality and their commitment to effecting change through sociopolitical participation.

AB  - As there is a robust tendency to support system-legitimizing beliefs by appealing to stereotypes or ideologies, we examined the role played by the perception of the status quo in relation to the infrahumanization bias. We compared this bias in high versus low-status group members and tested the mediating role of system justification beliefs and ingroup identification. The results of a moderated-mediated regression model (N=238) showed that the perception of legitimacy of one's own status had differential effects on the infrahumanization bias: The perception of legitimacy was positively associated with the endorsement of system justification beliefs and negatively associated with ingroup identification among low-status group members, whereas the perception of legitimacy was positively associated with ingroup identification among high-status group members. In both groups, ingroup identification was positively correlated with the tendency to infrahumanize the outgroup, while the endorsement of system justification beliefs was linked to the infrahumanization among low-status group members only. The findings highlight that the Social Identity Theory and the System Justification Theory can be fruitfully combined to explain infrahumanization tendencies.

AB  - How do jurors construe and apply facts and law to decide the point at which a defendant's thoughts and actions cross the line from being legally innocent to criminal? And under what doctrinal circumstances are such lay constructions of criminality vulnerable to legal misunderstanding and bias? Although these are high-stakes questions, the black box of the jury room leaves the legal system largely in the dark about the answers.
   Shining an empirical light on this domain, this Article employs tools of psychology to investigate how lay decisionmakers construe and apply legal standards for criminal attempt-a doctrine that imposes liability when a defendant intends and initiates a crime but does not successfully complete it. There are two dominant standards for the act element of attempt, but both are vague and ambiguous in defining the point at which liability attaches. Jurors are thus implicitly required to determine not only whether the defendant's conduct has met the threshold for criminal attempt, but also where that legal threshold lies. The fundamental question of how lay decisionmakers without legal training are likely to execute this cognitively challenging task has never been empirically tested.
   To fill this practical and methodological gap, I present the results of three original experimental studies on lay constructions of attempt law. My findings uncover striking disconnects between legal expectations and lay determinations of criminal attempt. Contrary to legislative design, the common law's theoretically more defense-friendly "proximity" test (which draws the line of attempt liability closer to completion of the intended crime) emerges as more prosecution-friendly in lay applications than the Model Penal Code's "substantial step" test (which theoretically seeks to expand attempt liability). The proximity test also appears to be more susceptible to bidirectional biases that lead to discriminatory legal outcomes.
   Drawing upon psychology theory to explain these findings, I propose that the linguistic framing of the proximity test may unconsciously activate a sense of criminal "nearness" that anchors decisionmakers to harsher outcomes. The language of the proximity test may also be more likely to invoke a sense of threat, which can activate stereotypes that bias decisionmaking based on legally extrinsic factors, such as the defendant's implied religion and the type of crime he is charged with attempting.
   This Article's findings challenge the legal community's established understandings of attempt law, and also speak to lay constructions of criminal liability more broadly by providing new insights into how jurors may interpret the act requirement of a criminal offense in light of its mental state requirement. Furthermore, by illustrating how lay-legal disconnects can inadvertently undermine legislative intent and how the language of the law itself can trigger unfair prejudice, the results bear implications for any area of law in which jurors are tasked with applying opaquely defined legal standards.
   Having empirically identified potential doctrinal and cognitive entry points for legal misunderstanding and bias in lay adjudication, I then suggest some novel steps that the legal system could consider taking to address these risks. My proposals entail rethinking how legislatures formulate legal standards, how courts convey these standards to jurors, and how jurors deliver their verdicts. I conclude by highlighting some key psychological and doctrinal directions for future research. Empirically unveiling the psychology of how lay decisionmakers construct legal liability, and drawing upon these insights to help jurors better understand the law, could unfurl promising new pathways toward more informed and fair decisionmaking in the justice system.

AB  - The 3-factor structure of the Normative Multiculturalism Scale (NMS)-Contact with Diversity (CD), Multicultural Ideology (MI), and Multicultural Policies and Practices (MPP)-was tested and confirmed with community samples from New Zealand (N = 381) and the United States (N = 311). Correlations with criterion measures (e.g., perceived minority disadvantage and attitudes to diversity) supported the criterion validity of the subscales. NMS factors were then examined as predictors of social connectedness in a British community sample (N = 347). Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that MI predicted general trust, and MI and MPP predicted national attachment. While MPP was associated with greater perceived threat, this relationship was dampened by the joint influences of MI and CD. The research presents a novel perspective on multiculturalism by adopting a normative approach and examining the main and interaction effects of contact with diversity, multicultural ideology, and multicultural policies on interpersonal and intergroup outcomes.

AB  - Background: Although high educational attainment is linked to better health and lower health risk behaviors, this effect may be systemically smaller for racial and ethnic minority groups compared to Whites. However, it is still unknown whether these diminished returns also apply to marginalization based on sexual orientation. Aims: In a national sample of adults which was composed of people of color, we compared straight and homosexual people for the association between education attainment and obesity. Methods: The Social Justice Sexuality Project (SJS-2010) is a cross-sectional national survey of health and wellbeing of predominantly people of color who identify as homosexual. The current analysis included 2884 adults (age 24 or more) who were either heterosexual (n = 260) or homosexual (n = 2624). The predictor variable was education attainment, and the outcome variable was obesity status (body mass index larger than 30 kg/m(2) [kilograms per meter squared]). Demographic factors (age and gender), household income, nativity (US born vs. immigrant), and health (self-rated health and current smoking) were the covariates. Sexual orientation was the moderator. Results: In the pooled sample, high education attainment was protective against obesity status. Sexual orientation interacted with education attainment on odds of obesity, which was suggestive of stronger protective effects of high education attainment against obesity for heterosexual than homosexual individuals. Conclusion: High education attainment better protects heterosexual than homosexual people against obesity, a pattern similar to what has been observed for comparison of Whites and non-Whites. Smaller protective effects of education attainment on health behaviors of marginalized people are possibly, due to prejudice and discrimination that they experience. Discrimination may minimize stigmatized individuals' abilities to mobilize their economic and human resources and translate them to tangible outcomes. This finding extends the Minorities' Diminished Returns theory, suggesting that it is not just race/ethnicity but possibly any marginalizing and stigmatizing social identity that results in diminished returns of socioeconomic status resources.

AB  - Undoubtedly, the study on finding the causes of stagnation of Islamic sciences from the sixth century onward is among the important and valuable issues in the history of Islamic education. This was a period in the history of science when the glittering light of Islamic sciences went out and the evolution and growth that we see in the third, fourth and even fifth centuries left the Islamic society. The issue of stoppage of the Ijtihad chapter among the Sunni Muslims led to imitation and stagnation and the fanaticism of the four Sunni religions; the leadership of this approach was assumed by Hanbalis (Hanaabilah). In such an atmosphere, freedom of thought was accompanied by heresy and cooperation with the E'tezal school, which is indicated by the investigation of the books of that era. The present paper, which is based on the report by Ibn Rajab Hanbali (736-795), has been prepared with regard to the report of the book " Fa.l ` Ilm al-Salaf ` ala ` Ilm al-Khalaf". After briefly reviewing the biography, compilations, teachers, and religious and political conditions of the time of this Hanbali scholar, the amount of his attention to the sciences of his time and his excessive caution and fear concerning new sciences and also reliance solely on the righteous predecessors' legacy are examined. After classifying sciences into useful and useless (useful vs harmful knowledge) ones, he seeks to reject new sciences. His constant concern about and frequent attacks on new sciences (sciences outside the framework of the Book [ scripture] and the Tradition), especially philosophy and theology, and his defense and strong prejudice in this respect should be considered. Accordingly, the abovementioned book is the full-length mirror of the eighth century AH on the increasing stagnation of Islamic sciences.

AB  - This work uses a list experiment to directly test for differences in attitudes towards poor, racially different and racially similar immigrants to the Netherlands in terms of (1) overt support and (2) covert support and (3) the difference between the two (i.e., social desirability bias). Results show that the expression of opposition to immigrants is significantly masked, suggesting that anonymous acts (e.g., voting) could capture greater opposition. Racially similar immigrants are subject to greater opposition relative to racially different or poorer immigrants, but only when anonymity is offered to respondents. The implication is that overt estimates (i.e., openly expressed) are misleading as levels of support appear consistent across immigrant groups. Going forward, we suggest the utility of the list experiment to better account for observable downward bias in estimates at least on the aggregate level or in contexts with clear normative pressure to appear tolerant.

AB  - Obese individuals are increasingly seeking weight-loss surgery (WLS) for the treatment of chronic obesity. Given the growing prevalence of WLS, more investigation is needed on the social factors that impact decisions to undergo surgery. Weight stigma-prejudicial, biased, or discriminatory of treatment of obese people- is on the rise and has significant negative consequences for obese individuals. This study examined the impact of weight stigma on decisions about WLS in a diverse sample of 95 obese women seeking WLS (54.7% White; 31.6% Black). It was predicted that body mass index, comorbidities, and weight stigma would predict (a) higher mortality risk taking, and (b) lower decisional conflict. Binary logistic regressions were used to examine the hypotheses. Results indicated that body mass index, comorbidities, and weight stigma significantly predicted mortality risk taking. The model accounted for 11% of the variance in mortality risk-taking scores; however, only weight stigma significantly contributed to the model. The strength of the model increased after controlling for racial/ethnic differences. Among obese White women, the model accounted for 20% of the variance in mortality risk-taking scores. Each 1-unit increase in weight stigma led to a 6% increase in mortality risk taking. Weight stigma did not predict lower decisional conflict. Findings from this study suggest that weight stigma may be a factor in obese women's decisions about WLS. Obese White women may be at particular risk for weight stigma. The implications for bariatric care are discussed.

AB  - Although generic drugs are pharmacologically equivalent to their brand-name counterparts, prejudices against them remain strong. We assess the extent to which generic (versus brand-name) labels affect patients consumption of and adherence to medication.
   One hundred one patients who received dental implants agreed to participate in a study. In a pre-surgery survey, most patients reported a positive view about generic drugs. After dental surgery, the patients were prescribed a once-daily analgesic regimen (50 mg tramadol hydrochloride) for up to 7 days. All the patients received at no cost the same brand-name medication with either a brand-name label (n = 51) or a generic label (n = 50) and were informed of the retail prices associated with both labels. Telephone follow-up was conducted 24 hours, four days, and seven days after surgery to assess the number of prescribed pills consumed and when their use was discontinued, the number of non-prescribed pills consumed, pain levels throughout the follow-up period, the perceived efficacy of the analgesic, and the willingness to recommend it to a friend.
   The label manipulation impacted the participants behaviour and subjective assessments. Discontinuation before the end of the 7-day period was more frequent under the generic (vs. brand-name) label condition. The patients in the generic label group were also more likely to consume non-prescribed pills (non-adherence). Additionally, the patients in the generic label group reported higher levels of pain.
   Generic labels may negatively affect adherence to treatment even if patients report ex ante positive evaluations of the quality of generics drugs.

AB  - Objective This study examines how perceptions of the trustworthiness of others are influenced by an individual's sexual orientation. We hypothesize that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals will be more likely than heterosexual individuals to express generalized distrust and what we conceptualize as contingent trust. The latter is represented by responses of "it depends." Methods Using data from the 2008-2016 General Social Surveys, we conduct multinomial logistic regression analyses to examine patterns of trust in others, with a particular focus on differences across sexual orientation groups. Results We find that gay or lesbian individuals are significantly more likely than heterosexual individuals to say that their trust of others "depends." Bisexual individuals, however, do not significantly differ from heterosexual individuals. Conclusion This study contributes to the trust literature by considering the influence of sexual orientation as well as expanding upon the idea of contingent trust. Future research could build upon this by also considering the "depends" response as a conceptually unique attitude toward trust of others.

KW  - IDENTITY
AB  - The abundance of goods in the modern world has a tendency to prejudice interpretation of their value, but the way people value their goods is complex, relative and changeable - scarcity is just one factor. There is a long history of value theorization across the social sciences, but archaeological considerations of value remain uncommon and focused on prestige goods. In this paper, I review alternative conceptions of value through the lens of the modern world, with an example of Spode creamware used by a governor in the early decades of colonial Sydney. I argue that the process of devaluation, through discard and waste, offers a unique archaeological understanding of the shifting values people of the modern world placed on commodities.

AB  - Obesity is an important emerging problem in adolescence because it causes psychological distress and social prejudice. Using Ugazio's theory, this study aims to test if the construct 'winner/loser' and its associated meanings are used and considered important among obese adolescents. The personal constructs of 68 participants (young and adult; obese and normal weight) were elicited through the repertory grid test and analysed using the log-linear model. The power dimension was the most used in the obese groups (young and adult) but it was considered the most relevant among adolescents rather than women, regardless of the weight variable. The results allow us to provide several suggestions on a clinical level and on a wider social perspective.

AB  - The Australian team that toured India in 1935/36 comprised atypical cricket personnel. Their cultural and social unorthodoxy contributed to the tour being shunned by cricket officialdom in Australia. Tour manager, Frank Tarrant's method of team selection was meritocratic unlike that of customary cricket practice where social and cultural hierarchy informed team composition. This article outlines the unorthodox team composition and argues that the official cricket body objected to the exercise because of the professional nature of the tour, social (particularly class) discrimination and preconceptions of racial prejudices. The Maharaja of Patiala's generous financing of the tour identified it as a definitively professional exercise and encouraged participation considering the precarious status of the global economy following the Great Depression. The goodwill between Australia and India evidenced on tour challenged cricket protocol and reflects a pragmatic and growing recognition that diplomatic and economic unity was desirable in light of the imminent dissolution of the British Empire.

TI  - Workers age 50 and over in the Brazilian labor market: is there ageism?
T2  - REGE-REVISTA DE GESTAO
LA  - English
KW  - Ageing
KW  - Labour market
AB  - Purpose - This paper deals with the insertion of workers aged 50 years or more in the Brazilian labor market. Considering this question, the purpose of this paper is to raise evidence about the existence of ageism - prejudice against that age range. The paper identifies the characteristics of participation by workers age 50 or older in Brazil's formal labor market. The paper also identifies whether and how the specific issues of these workers are handled in the individual employment contract, with the human resources management (HRM) policies and practices of a group of companies.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study applied a quantitative approach in an analysis of the older population in the Brazilian labor market (Annual Social Information Report (RATS) database and "MEPT" survey database - 2011/2016). The RATS data are collected annually by the Ministerio do Trabalho e Emprego - MTE, coming from all establishments with or without formal employees, whether statutory (public servants) or private organizations. MEPT survey is an annual study focused on quality of the organizational environment and FIRM practices (organizations participate voluntarily). A qualitative approach was applied also in a document content analysis on information about FIRM policies and practices based on MEPT companies' research evidence reports.
   Findings - There is evidence of ageism among private companies in Brazil with better FIRM. These companies hire proportionally less old workers than the market and their HRM policies and practices scarcely handle with employees. The workers age 50 and over among the workers employed (private and mixed capital companies) have growing participation in the labor market. The profile of these workers is predominantly male, higher level education considering the market average, and working under longer lasting formal contracts comparing all workers combined. People involved in the individual hiring of workers from this age group do not even give this subject much attention.
   Research limitations/implications - The specific objective of verifying if and how the specific issues that workers of 50 years and older are dealing; in the individual hiring for work, encountered limitations based on the restricted character of the data presented. In particular, the information related to the best companies (MEPT) is representative only of its own group and thus is restricted to the private sector. Although this cannot be generalized, they offer support for reflections on the subject.
   Practical implications - This paper shows how companies with advanced FIRM handle with older workers in their policies and practices.
   Social implications - This work points out that that the aging of workers will be a problem to be discussed by the companies HRM in the future.
   Originality/value - This paper identifies the need to study how companies will deal with the increasing number of older workers.

AB  - Researchers posit that negative attitudes, prejudice, and discrimination (i.e., binegativity) from heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals may contribute to health disparities among bisexual individuals relative to heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals. Recent studies have focused on gay, lesbian, and heterosexual people's (e.g., others) attitudes toward bisexual people. No studies have investigated how bisexual individuals perceive others' attitudes toward bisexual people, which are generally known as meta-perceptions. As part of the 2015 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, we collected data from a nationally representative probability sample of 2999 adults, including from a subsample of 33 men and 61 women self-identified as bisexual. The Bisexualities: Indiana Attitudes Scale-bisexual (BIAS-b), a modified 5-item scale assessing bisexual people's perceptions of others' attitudes toward bisexual individuals, was included and was followed by an open-ended text box question. Quantitative scale data were analyzed using descriptive and gamma regression methods. Two coders thematically analyzed the open-ended text box data. The internal consistency of the BIAS-b was high (Cronbach's =0.85). An exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor solution. Participants responded to statements regarding others' attitudes toward them as bisexual people, including the domains of confusion, HIV/STD risk, incapability of monogamy, promiscuity, and instability (just a phase). Participants' text box descriptions largely aligned with these five domains, with the exception of HIV/STD risk. Additionally, some participants reported others' positive perceptions of them as bisexual individuals. In sum, we observed a range of meta-perceptions, primarily neutral to negative, but also including some relatively positive. These results show the need for interventions to promote acceptance of bisexual individuals among heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals.

AB  - In an environment where governments require more and more money to fulfill social obligations, and the business opportunity to pay taxes is decreasing, there are dangers of pressure from the authorities on business entities to increase payments. Often, without having enough evidence of the bad faith of the taxpayer, the authorities create artificial judicial prejudices. This requires the development of protective preventive mechanisms in economic activity, which should be directed to the disproof of inconvenient negative court practice. The purpose of this work is to develop new protective and preventive advice in economic activity, which will be based on the disproof of inconvenient negative court practice. Research Methodology: systematization of approaches to the consideration of tax disputes in courts, ways and methods of effective use of disproof of inconvenient negative court practice for the implementation of protective preventive mechanisms in economic activity. Results of the research - recommendations have been developed that allows for ensuring effective disproof of inconvenient negative court practice for the introduction of protective and preventive mechanisms in economic activity.

AB  - For decades, migration to Germany has been a relevant social phenomenon resulting in an increasing share of foreigners and Germans with migration background in the German populace. Additionally, since 2015, Germany has experienced a substantial increase in the immigration of people seeking refuge and asylum from civil war, economic and environmental catastrophes, and other adverse living conditions. These developments can be assumed to have led to an increase in intergroup contact between Germans and foreigners. We investigate this phenomenon in a multifaceted fashion by combining a social indicator and monitoring approach using repeated cross-sections over time with a new panel approach using a short-time panel to study causal relations. As a first step, we descriptively analyze the development of intergroup contact experiences of the German population with foreigners in various areas of life using data from the ALLBUS survey collected over 36 years between 1980 and 2016. Specifically, we detail the diverging contact experiences of participants with and without migration background as well as participants in the former Eastern and Western part of Germany. In a second step, based on Allport's intergroup contact theory that contact with outgroup members may improve attitudes towards these outgroups and other related findings, we examine the longitudinal processes between positive intergroup contact with foreigners and attitudes towards foreigners using four waves of the GESIS Panel collected over approximately one and a half years. We apply special rigor to these analyses by differentiating stable differences in intergroup contact experiences and attitudes between participants from within-person processes and discussing the implications of this differentiation.

AB  - The increasing recognition of the negative impact of income inequality has highlighted the importance of taxation which can function as a redistributive mechanism. Previous critical social psychological research found that talk about restricting the welfare state, that is funded through tax, is formed of ideology that supports the maintenance of income inequality. Therefore, this research explores how speakers use talk about tax to justify income inequality during a UK BBC radio discussion, 'Moral Maze: The moral purpose of tax' which involved public figures discussing the role of tax. This programme was analysed from a critical discursive psychological perspective. It was found that two contrasting constructions of tax were presented: tax as a collective responsibility or tax as an individual burden, whereby speakers drew on social justice and individualistic ideology respectively. Arguments for high tax rates are problematic due to the acceptability of inequality in a meritocracy. By presenting wealthy individuals as more deserving than the less affluent, arguments for higher tax come to be challenged.

AB  - The concept of open society is among possible projective alternatives that is related to the search for an acceptable arrangement of social and political structures of society, while largely reflecting the fundamental uncertainty of reality. The primary goal of this paper is in an endeavour to place the key political, philosophical and partly historical parameters of the concept of open society in the arena of contemporary political theory and practice, the analysis of strengths and risks of an open society concept in terms of its potential content, taking into account the cross/section of individual differentiated interests with circumstances, systemic pressures or ideological prejudices and making precise recommendations for a full-fledged implementation of an empirically verifiable form of coexistence, superior to any potential and/or existing totalitarian alternatives. Especially, we have outlined general framework of the concept of open society and the transformation of theoretical parameters of an open society into a political intention (system) in K. R. Popper and G. Soros theory of open society and the philosophy of critical rationalism.

AB  - While exposure to stereotyped minority characters reinforces prejudice, when viewers identify with counter-stereotyped characters prejudice tends to decrease. This study examines the juxtaposition of identifying with either a counter-stereotyped Black protagonist or a stereotyped supporting cast. Participants read a prompt (group vs. individual salience), watched an episode of Luke Cage, then reported their identification with the Black protagonist (Cage) and the social group (the Black community of Harlem). Findings suggest that individual identification with a counter-stereotype reduces symbolic racism, while social identification with a stereotyped group does not.

AB  - This paper aims to deepen our understanding of the social and historic dimension of the Wesleyan Mission Station, Plaatberg, located in the Free State province of South Africa. It argues that the footprint of the mission station, exposed during an archaeological study of this landscape, lays bare the individual, as well as the general Methodist philosophy and political ideals. By placing acts of enclosure at the centre of the study it forefronts the missionary mind-set, and the desire to emulate a European social landscape. The paper also reflects on how, within the context of the broader imperial campaign, the Methodists' ideal becomes a fleeting reality, but also how the mirage of a colonial town and country rapidly dissolved as the British withdrew from the Orange River Sovereignty. Finally, the paper considers the role of the boundary walls in the landscape, the region's shifting political borders and the less tangible boundaries of prejudice that conferred obligations, responsibilities and expectations on the people who lived at Plaatberg.

AB  - This article suggests a comprehensive review of the problems faced by the different generations and their specific traits. The discribed difference between generations is a main concern of thoughtful individuals, especially when the conflict situation takes place. The new approach to this problem gives society instead of blaming and judging more effective tool to cope with it. And this work explains why generations are so spaced apart by a wide gap in terms of values they daily share. Understanding of this social phenomenon opens up a way to generating an all-inclusive image of our society with utmost clarity and with neither prejudice, nor condemnation. And the vision of the whole picture gives society a chance to build up relationship and cooperation effectively without losing time for conflicts and misunderstanding. This work is devoted to generation issue and aimed at those who are desire to live at higher level of consciousness, sharing true values in spite of the gap between generation.

AB  - The hermeneutic theory of social practices treats the relations between the subjectivity involved in collective agency and the trans-subjectivity of concerted practices in terms of interpretive circularity. The paper argues that the conceptualization of a kind of such circularity operating within properly arranged social practices helps one to find a way out of the depressing dilemma between agency and structure. Actions and activities - as they are situated in and entangled with interrelated practices - neither causally determine nor impose norms on the ways in which practices are interrelated in their performances. An autonomous ensemble of social practices projects its being upon a horizon of possibilities which agents choose in accordance with their desires, plans, intentions, projects, moods, ambitions, presuppositions, prejudices, background and tacit knowledge. In the hermeneutic theory of practices, there is an important caesura that takes place in the passage from what human agency strongly determines to the authenticity manifested by the modes of being-in-concerted-social-practices.

AB  - Although the 1952 Rome Convention on Surface Damage does not account with as many ratifications as the 1999 Montreal Convention or its predecessors, it organizes what can be seen as an operators' friendly liability regime. In a recent landmark ruling in a matter that was pending before the Belgian courts for nearly twenty years, the Court of Appeal of Brussels held that airlines could not be held liable for the prejudice allegedly caused by their aircraft's noise emissions to the extent that these aircraft and their operations comply with the rules of air.

AB  - The study is aimed at exploring storytelling approach as a medium for the transformative teaching and learning of interfaith dialogue among undergraduate students. Due to their upbringing and environment, the students do not have the oppurtunity to know other religions and culture better. This is especially true for those who lived only among their own ethnic. Therefore, this research is aimed at promoting interfaith dialogue as well as fostering peace and harmony between students of the Department of 'Aqidah and Islamic Thought, Academy of Islamic Studies, University of Malaya; Department of Theology and Philosophy, National University of Malaysia and Centre for Religion and Society of Malaysia Theological Seminary. Through group conversation, fieldwork and workshop with the students, this study demonstrates that peace education through storytelling can be utilized as a tool of narrative truth-telling, aimed at restoring interpersonal relationships, healing traumatic experiences and promoting social coexistence (ta'ayush). This approach enables to foster interfaith dialogue among the students thus, contributes to the development of a culture of peace. The storytelling approach with a member from 'the other' group can be interpreted as a desire to proclaim the 'unheard' voices and feelings to be shared with 'the other'. It connects with the practice of active listening to overcome prejudice, leading towards the transformative learning process. Peace storytelling may therefore, be seen as an understanding 'the others'. This study also recommends the significance on creating environments to foster inter-religious dialogue, expanding formats of interfaith dialogue and increasing religious study through education and training.

AB  - The advent of critical race theory (CRT) in legal scholarship changed the way in which legal scholars think about race and racism in at least three ways. First, CRT scholars argue that the problem of racial justice is fundamental to American law, whereas the previous generation of civil rights scholars saw racial justice as a problem of institutional dynamics resolvable through ordinary legal process. Second, CRT scholars have infused greater social, disciplinary, and scholastic "reflexivity" into legal scholarship on race. Third, CRT scholars have developed a rich and nuanced language for understanding race and racism, replacing an earlier and less sophisticated legal conception of people of color as "discrete and insular" minorities facing unreasoning prejudice.

AB  - Early modern ornament might profitably be considered as a set of systems, each with its own rules. It signaled wealth and status. It offered pleasure and prompted curiosity. It cut across the apparent divide between the vernacular and the classicizing. It was relational, understood in the context of a given subject but not necessarily subservient to it. The notion of ornament as essentially supplemental and the prejudice against ornamental excess are both children of the late eighteenth century. Both ideas depend on a post-Enlightenment conviction of the work of art as an autonomous, aesthetically self-sufficient object, an idea not fully formed in the early modern era.

KW  - Fake news
KW  - Democratic elections
AB  - Purpose - Since the end of 2016, "fake news" has had a clear meaning in the USA. After years of scholarship attempting to define "fake news" and where it fits among the larger schema of media hoaxing and deception, popular culture and even academic studies converged following the 2016 US presidential election to define "fake news" in drastically new ways. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In light of the recent elections in the USA, many fear "fake news" that have gradually become a powerful and sinister force, both in the news media environment as well as in the fair and free elections. The scenario draws into questions how the general public interacts with such outlets, and to what extent and in which ways individual responsibility should govern the interactions with social media.
   Findings - Fake news is a growing threat to democratic elections in the USA and other democracies by relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans and their behavior.
   Originality/value - Essentially, "fake news" is changing and even distorting how political campaigns are run, ultimately calling into question legitimacy of elections, elected officials and governments. Scholarship has increasingly confirmed social media as an enabler of "fake news," and continues to project its potentially negative impact on democracy, furthering the already existing practices of partisan selective exposure, as well as heightening the need for individual responsibility.

AB  - Diversity is a very complicated issue to deal with and it is often not easy to understand it and understand its various nuances. Many times in common thought, the word "diversity" refers to something negative because what is not known inspires fear, and moreover it is even more difficult to make "communicate", and unite, the sphere of diversity with that of sport and movement. Instead with this work we want to put the accent on the "positive" value of the term starting from what is the approach of today's society and the world of sport on a delicate subject such as that of diversity, through two phases: a first purely theoretical work (with the use of literature recognition); a second job that takes into consideration the "traditional" rules of some disciplines such as handball, rugby and baseball, which are then compared with the adapted ones, focusing on what has changed (variation of playing times, variation of equipment used, cc) and what has remained unchanged. In conclusion, this article tries to make people understand that the so-called "different" brings new knowledge and, with its cultural baggage, its traditions, its way of thinking and being contributes to the enrichment of all and does not detract from anyone. There is a need for all the barriers of prejudice to be torn down and sport, in this case, can in all respects be a valid tool for integration and social inclusion.

AB  - Relationship health impacts many facets of both physical and mental well-being, including depression, heart health, and even children's health. For a variety of reasons, distressed couples often delay entering therapy despite its value in supporting wellness and preventing distress. One early intervention program, the marriage checkup (MC), aims to keep healthy couples healthy with a brief supportive checkup. The MC is based on motivational interviewing principles, and research on MC shows the program has a positive impact on relationship satisfaction, prevents decline, and improves health on other variables such as intimacy. However, past research on MCs has only focused on heterosexual couples. As such, this study explores the research question, "What is the impact of a relationship wellness checkup on lesbian couples' relationship satisfaction?" Using a single-subject design, specifically concurrent multiple-baseline, multiple-probe design, this study extends MC research to an underrepresented population. After conducting checkups over 10 weeks with three lesbian couples, findings show the intervention had a medium effect on satisfaction (nonoverlap of all pairs = .66). These results indicate a relationship checkup can increase satisfaction for lesbian couples. The findings also suggest checkups with lesbian couples can have a comparable impact to their use with heterosexual couples. This study concludes by advocating that the checkup may help lesbian couples stay healthy, providing support for this marginalized group of couples in a time of prejudice.

TI  - Two Sides of One Coin: The US-Guatemala Arbitration and the Dual Structure of Labour Provisions in the CPTPP
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LABOUR LAW AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
LA  - English
AB  - This article revisits and critically analyses the panel's decision and reasoning in the dispute between the United States and Guatemala under the labour provisions of the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement vis-a-vis the treaty interpretation rules under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. It further seeks to draw implications for the construction of labour provisions of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The article sheds light on the normative and theoretical rationales that underlie trade-labour linkages in general, and the labour provisions under such free trade agreements in particular. Ultimately, the paper makes a case for the dual structure of conditionality-based labour provisions, a legal characteristic that demands that each of them pursue two different goals, first, protecting labour rights as human rights (social goal) and second, securing the condition of fair competition in trade/investment and preventing a race to the bottom in labour regulation (economic goal). With this proposal, it attempts to put the long-overlooked, deontologically normative value that labour provisions pursue in its right place without prejudice to their role of levelling the playing field.

AB  - In 1943, two poems by Langston Hughes appeared in the Saturday Evening Post. Given his consternation over the Post's unauthorized, prejudicial reprinting of "Goodbye, Christ" on December 21, 1940, and the magazine's long history of problematic representations of black Americans, one might have expected Hughes to avoid rather than seek out this venue. Yet editorial shifts at the Post combined with wartime fixation on the ideals of freedom seem to have given Hughes an opening to convey his message of equality to the Post's three million subscribers and estimated ten million readers. As he noted in "Negro Writers and the War,"Hughes believed that US involvement in World War II could be used to "forc[e] democracy to recognize belatedly some of its own failings in regard to the Negro people." In particular, he called on creative writers to use publication in "general American magazines" to draw attention to the hypocrisy of fighting for freedom in a country that maintains Jim Crow. Focusing attention on the original site of publication reveals how Hughes shrewdly used the scope and reach of the Post to challenge the very social structures it had long espoused.

AB  - Background: A major public health problem is illegal abortion and its consequences and reliable data on abortions is globally unavailable. The Catholic Church advocates the protection of the human right for life that begins with conception. Religion was proven as an important predictor in forming abortion attitudes. Low points on openness and experience scales correlate with social prejudices and conservative orientation.
   The Aim: To determine the impact of religiosity and personality dimension on abortion attitudes using Questionnaire of Religion, Abortion Attitudes Questionnaire and Big Five Questionnaire.
   Subjects and Methods: An in - depth study was conducted on a sample of 310 citizens of Herzeg - Bosnian County in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The instruments used in the research were: a short questionnaire with socio - demographic features, a questionnaire of religiosity, an abortion questionnaire and a Big Five questionnaire.
   Results: Citizens of Herzeg - Bosnian County, 89.1% of them, believe that abortion terminates life. For legal prohibition of abortion 73.1% of the respondents' advocate, and Catholics are the most rigorous. Catholics mostly do not agree with the attitude that only a pregnant woman can decide on abortion in comparison to Islamic religion (chi(2) (4)=16.36; p<0.01). Only 13% of citizens are against the interference of the Church in the matter of abortion. The most insecurity can be seen in the attitude about the father's participation in the abortion decision. Almost half of citizens who oppose abortion would still leave it as an option for women.
   Conclusion: Citizens of Herzeg - Bosnian County support the legal prohibition of abortion and see it as a termination of life. Orthodox respondents are the least opposed to abortion and they also see themselves the least as believers. In Catholic and Islamic religions, religious identity and condemnation of abortion are expressed. Younger and mature people and male gender are important predictors of abortion condemnation. The influence of personality dimension on abortion attitudes was also not found in this research.

AB  - We investigated the racial or ethnic partner preferences among Australian gay and bisexual men (GBM) as part of a large study of sexual preferences among GBM, to identify whether racial bias was a factor in how GBM expressed their partner preferences. We surveyed 1853 Australian GBM about their partner preferences and preferred sex practices. We used logistic regression to identify whether factors such as age, gay social engagement, or men's own ethnicity or race were associated with ethnic and racial partner preferences. Mean age was 34.8years. Ethnic or racial background included: white or Caucasian (86.6%), Australian Aboriginal (2.7%), and Asian (6.6%). Mean attraction scores were highest for Caucasian men, and lowest for Aboriginal and Asian men. Under half (41.6%) were attracted to all racial or ethnic types; 7.7% were only attracted to Caucasian men. Being older and lower homonegativity scores were independently associated with finding all ethnic and racial types attractive. Being attracted only to Caucasian men was associated with younger age. Mental health was not associated with ethnic or racial partner preferences. Although men more commonly found most racial or ethnic types attractive, racial biases in partner selection were more evident among younger men, and among those who were less comfortable with their own sexuality. Addressing anti-gay stigma and broader exposure to gay community subcultures may be as important in countering racial bias.

AB  - Formally a taboo subject, public sexual harassment in Egypt has received increased media attention since the 2011 revolution. The scholarly literature on the topic, however, remains thin, particularly with regard to the social mechanisms that sustain an environment permissive of street harassment. Drawing on the rape myths literature, this article argues that naturalised and stereotyped understandings of the causes and implications of street harassment provide discursive resources to excuse harassers and blame victims for the harassment they suffer. It argues, however, that these understandings are better understood as narrative masterplots to be contested than as myths to be debunked, emphasising that falsity and prejudicial impact must not be conflated. It concludes with recommendations for activism and future research, arguing that it may be more effective to promote alternative interpretive frames than attempt to directly challenge currently dominant understandings.

AB  - Gender-based violence and violence against women (VAW) refers to any violation of fundamental rights. However, some forms of VAW are viewed as unproblematic, acceptable and deserved. Taking into account that sexist chants in football stadiums reinforce VAW, the purpose of the study is to determine how a group of adolescents can normalize or challenge an example of sexist chants. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted and the participants were asked to discuss to what extent the actions could be considered as gender-based violence. Most of the youth were highly unconscious of the sexist nature of the video and only a few recognized it as gender-based violence. Such awareness is essential in order to recognize the discrimination and prejudices, but especially, characteristic of VAW in football stadiums. Therefore, the implementation of a new pedagogy in order to reduce VAW in and outside the school is absolutely mandatory.

AB  - Given the immense harm inflicted on individuals and groups of color via prejudice and discrimination, it becomes imperative for our nation to begin the process of disrupting, dismantling, and disarming the constant onslaught of micro- and macroaggressions. For too long, acceptance, silence, passivity, and inaction have been the predominant, albeit ineffective, strategies for coping with microaggressions. Inaction does nothing but support and proliferate biased perpetrator behaviors which occur at individual, institutional and societal levels. This article introduces a new strategic framework developed for addressing microaggressions that moves beyond coping and survival to concrete action steps and dialogues that targets, allies, and bystanders can perform (microinterventions). A review of responses to racist acts, suggest that microaggression reactions/interventions may be primarily to (a) remain passive, retreat, or give up; (b) strike back or hurt the aggressor; (c) stop, diminish, deflect, or put an end to the harmful act; (d) educate the perpetrator; (e) validate and support the targets; (f) act as an ally; (g) seek social support; (h) enlist outside authority or institutional intervention; or (h) achieve any combination of these objectives. We organize these responses into four major strategic goals of microinterventions: (a) make the invisible visible, (b) disarm the microaggression, (c) educate the perpetrator, and (d) seek external reinforcement or support. The objectives and rationale for each goal are discussed, along with specific microintervention tactics to employ and examples of how they are executed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Health professionals increasingly recognize the role that social determinants play in health disparities. However, little focus is placed on how health care professionals themselves contribute to disparities through biased care. We have developed a curriculum based on an antioppression framework which encourages health professionals to evaluate their biases and combat health care disparities through an active process of allyship.
   METHODS: Teaching methods emphasize skill building and include lectures, guided reflections, and facilitated discussions. Pre- and postsurveys were administered to assess participants' confidence level to recognize unconscious bias and to be an ally to colleagues, patients, and staff. In total, we conducted 20 workshops with a total of 468 participants across multiple disciplines.
   RESULTS: The survey response rate was 80%. Using a paired t-test, the mean difference in the pre- and postsurveys revealed a statistically significant improvement across all measures. Participants showed the greatest improvements (large effect size d>0.8) in their understanding of the process of allyship, their ability to describe strategies to address, assess, and recognize unconscious bias, and their knowledge of managing situations in which prejudice, power, and privilege are involved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results show that an antioppression curriculum can enhance health professionals' confidence in addressing bias in health care through allyship. For those who value social justice and equity, moving from the role of bystander to a place of awareness and solidarity allows for one's behaviors to mirror these values. Allyship is an accessible tool that all health professionals can use in order to facilitate this process.

AB  - BackgroundDiscrimination is a well-established stressor that is substantially associated with poor health and a known contributor to health inequalities. However, the role of discrimination in health service use is less explored. This study will take an intersectional approach to investigate differences in health service use and examine the role of discrimination experiences.MethodsData on health service use were assessed in a diverse inner London sample of 1052 participants in the South East London Community Health (SELCoH) Study. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to define classes of intersectional social status using multiple indicators of socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity and migration status. Adjusted associations between intersectional social status and discrimination experiences with health service use indicators are presented.ResultsUsing latent class analysis allowed us to identify an intersectional social status characterized by multiple disadvantage that was associated with decreased secondary physical health service use and a class characterized by both privilege and disadvantage that was associated with increased health service use for mental disorder after controlling for age, gender and health status. Anticipated discrimination was also associated with increased service use for mental disorder in adjusted models. There was no evidence to suggest that discrimination experiences were acting as a barrier to health service use.ConclusionsThis study highlights the complex ways in which discrimination experiences may increase the need for health services whilst also highlighting differences in health service use at the intersection of ethnicity, migration status and SES. Findings from this study illustrate the importance of measuring multiple levels of discrimination and taking an intersectional approach for health service use research.

AB  - The ever-increasing human migration with fast-eroding bonds often leads to development of social clusters which tend to produce stereotypes about other groups of people. One among the many factors responsible for such ghettoization is not ignorance but a version of knowledge that does not take us beyond ourselves. Speaking about the role of writer as "the conscience of the nation," S. Yizhar, an Israeli writer and politician, says that a writer is a mutation. Literature is one such powerful tool to transcend cultural boundaries which takes us beyond ourselves and reaches to the other side. Holding the case of Israeli-Palestinian contestation as one such manifestation of cultural ghettoization, the article argues for the need to render open the mental borders to move beyond prejudices. Taking A. B. Yehoshua's Facing the Forests as a point of departure, it highlights the potential of dialog as a powerful antidote to social violence between the two communities of Arabs and Israelis and lays bare its importance in the direction of peaceful coexistence.
   The article is divided into three sections; the first section introduces the cultural location of Yehoshua and his narrative set in the Israeli landscape of the 1960s. The second section explores the use of symbolism in the narrative to cull out the dormant meanings and analyzes the multiple layers of the text. The third and last section projects the idea of re-narrativization as an important tool of re-inscribing history with alternative versions. It draws strength from those Arab-Jewish encounters that are not necessarily troubling.The conclusion sums up the essential findings of the study, elucidating the role of literature and intellectuals in difficult times.

AB  - African American colorism in the United States is often viewed as an intraracial problem in which prejudice and discrimination are relegated to the scope of internal issues. What is often lacking in the discourse on colorism is the interracial component of intraracial hierarchies-referred to as White colorism. Colorism is not a phenomenon that originated within the Black community. Rather, it is a result of European American practices that further divided Blacks according to skin color. The historical underpinnings of colorism include colonialism and slavery, yet these ideologies continue to inform racism today. This article explores how colorism was established and is now sustained by Whites in various capacities, including social and economic spheres. Additionally, racialized dichotomies, borders of Whiteness, and Black consciousness are considered to demonstrate the intersection of historical racism and current racial rhetoric. Last, the effects of White colorism on Black achievement status, including education and employment, is elucidated through an analysis of data and literature.

AB  - This article studies the everyday lives of Indigenous workers at the Romaine River hydroelectric project, in the heart of the Innu ancestral territory in northern Quebec (Canada), to better understand their place in northern resource development. Using a qualitative approach based on in-depth interviews with workers and key players, both indigenous and non-indigenous, we draw on three perspectives to examine the actual situation of the indigenous people at the construction site: employment; intercultural space of encounter; and sense of place. Our analysis reveals that professional, social and spatial exclusionary practices remain, despite integration measures, awareness-raising efforts, services and infrastructures dedicated to Indigenous workers and likely intercultural interactions. The numerical minority of Indigenous workers, the undervalued jobs they occupy, the many socio-professional difficulties they encounter, the hard adaptation to lifestyle on the worksite, prejudice, discrimination and racism confine them to the margins of these major projects. Part of a wider critical reflection on neocolonialism, our analysis of the workers' everyday lives questions the current neoliberal resource development model in indigenous territories.

AB  - Anti-Semitic quotas to restrict access to medical school, graduate medical education and hospital privileges were common in the United States from the 1920s to the 1960s. In Brooklyn, New York, medical education prejudice resulted in violence. In 1916 a Jewish intern at Kings County Hospital, Matthew Olstein, was bound and gagged by Christian interns, put on a train at Grand Central Station, and warned that if he returned he would be thrown in the East River. Olstein died in combat in World War I as an Army physician. In 1927 3 Jewish interns at Kings County Hospital were assaulted, bound, dumped in tubs of water and covered in black fluid. Six gentile physicians were charged with assault. Criminal proceedings and public investigations followed. These attacks are the only known episodes of violence associated with American medical education anti-Semitism.

KW  - ORIGINS
AB  - The central ideas of early object relations theory are heavily inflected with Christian anti-Judaism, particularly as found in the work of Ian Dishart Suttie, now credited as the founder of this tradition. The critique of Freud launched by Suttie repudiates Freudian theory as a "disease" inextricably connected to Freud being a Jew. Suttie's portrayal of Judaism both conforms to and replicates those theological commitments that privilege a triumphalist, supersessionist Christianity that breaks with Judaism, understood as devoid of love, ethics, and social justice interests. The paper argues that the elements organizing the central concepts that structure Suttie's Christian prejudice constitute distorting ideological interests that circulate and shape important strands of contemporary object relations theory. Central to the authors discussed is a repudiation of Freud's theory of unconscious drives on the basis of privileging love and intersubjectivity as the motivators of human psychological development made possible by Jesus and Christianity. The paper demonstrates that contemporary object relations theory remains heavily indebted to Suttie while remaining oblivious to his explicit anti-Judaism.

AB  - Background People with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) continue to struggle to have their condition recognised as disabling in the face of public and professional prejudice and discrimination.
   Objective The aim of this study was to compare the functional status and well-being of people with well-characterised ME/CFS with people with multiple sclerosis (PWMS), as well as healthy controls (HCs).
   Methods In this cross-sectional study, we used data collected as part of the UK ME/CFS Biobank to compare actual participant scores from the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 v2 (TM) (SF-36v2 (TM)) between groups, as a proxy for impact of disability, and from a bespoke questionnaire seeking data on employment and income.
   Results People with ME/CFS scored significantly lower than PWMS or HCs in almost all SF-36v2 (TM) areas. Prominent were lower scores for people with ME/CFS in the Physical Component Summary and Role Physical and Social Function domains, while the smallest differences were seen in the Mental Health domain. Responses to the bespoke questionnaire indicated that people with ME/CFS in this study work fewer hours and have lower incomes compared with people in the other two groups.
   Conclusions Using SF-36v2 (TM) scores as a proxy, people with ME/CFS were measurably more disabled than PWMS or HCs in this study population. Furthermore, employment and income data are consistent with loss of functional status. These findings should encourage the health community to recognise the disabling effects of ME/CFS, to advocate for the needs of people with ME/CFS, and to investigate strategies to address the cost of the disease to both individuals and society.

AB  - In the diverse American population, racial prejudice still remains a disturbing actuality. With the ever-increasing rate of Asians in the United States having better jobs, better income, and better education, Asian American women have never been at a better bargaining point to move their social standing in the society at a higher rank and aspire toward true assimilation. Intermarriage via selective desired traits that can help the Asian American woman trump their racial limitations, hence disadvantages. Okamoto's theoretical perspective to develop a boundary approach to the conventional winnowing hypothesis, intermarriage becomes an indicator of integration. Hall's eurogamy premise posits that most important of such desirable traits of prospective men being Euro-American can help Asian women blur the racial differences, hence bring them to the mainstream. This study suggests that in United States, there exists still substantial homogamy and in the absence of homogamy there is a similar pattern of exogamy, or more specifically eurogamy among Asian American women depicting and showing a clear tendency to marry up. It suggested that eurogamy is likely to continue as a means to marry up. Thus, there will be a continuation of said increase as the population of younger, better educated, independent Asian American women expands, hence resulting in the perfect marital assimilation.

AB  - The World Health Organization has considered sexual health as a major dimension of global health and a sexual right. However, the sexual health of people with physical disabilities is still poorly addressed by health and social care professionals, and it is very stigmatized by society. This study aimed to assess the perspectives of Portuguese people living with physical disabilities regarding issues affecting their sexual health. Nine women and 17 men with different physical disabilities participated in the study. Participants were recruited from a professional rehabilitation facility located in the North of Portugal and were assigned to four groups in one-hour sessions. Three main categories emerged from the content analysis: (1) meanings and beliefs regarding sexuality; (2) experiences of sexuality; (3) necessary changes. Despite the positive social changes towards sexuality, participants expressed that their sexual rights are still unfulfilled, as they live in a context that perpetuates their dependency. They pointed out low self-esteem, prejudice and social isolation, poor architectural accessibility and scarcity of financial support as some of the barriers to their lives and their sexual health. Finally, participants identified the main needs regarding their sexual health, such as: access to specialized information; training for health professionals. This study gives voice to people with physical disabilities and sheds light into both individual and contextual factors affecting their sexual health. Of utmost importance, this study draws attention to the need for reinforcing sexuality of people with disabilities in the social agenda and brings implications for future research and practice.

AB  - This article examines the rise of the political right and far-right in Hungarian political culture. It highlights the contribution that world-systems analysis can bring to an historical sociological understanding of the concept of political culture, with a particular focus on contemporary Hungary. Many commentators are asking: how it can be that 30 years of democratic transition has led to the dominance in Hungary of a politics of intolerance, illiberalism and ethno-Nationalism, as manifested in both the current government, Fidesz, and the neo-fascist party, Jobbik. This paper argues that the correct way to frame the question is to ask: why, given the legacy of authoritarian social and political movements that have shaped Hungary's modern history, should a stable, liberal, political culture emerge after communism? Instead what the paper shows is that the goals of classical liberalism and a liberal political culture have long been destroyed by three factors: capitalism; the nation-state; and the persistence of traditional and sometimes irrational forms of social hierarchy, prejudice and authority. Hungary's current Orbanisation reflects an on-going tension between liberal and illiberal tendencies, the latter being part of the foundations of the modern world-system. Rather than viewing Hungary as a dangerous exception to be quarantined by the European Union, it should be recognised that the political right in Hungary is linked to broader trends across the world-system that foster intolerance and other anti-enlightenment and socially divisive tendencies. Political cultures polarised by decades of neoliberal reforms and in which there is no meaningful socialist alternative have reduced Hungary's elite political debates to the choice of either neoliberalism or ethno-nationalism, neither of which is likely to generate socially progressive solutions to its current problems.

AB  - This article studies the interactional functions of racism discourse in mobilizing support for right-wing populism. The analysis focuses on the controversy surrounding UKIP's "Breaking Point" poster campaign, which launched days before the historic British EU referendum. We focus on the development of "tripolar relations" between the UKIP party leadership, mainstream political elites, and ordinary citizens. Using thematic discourse analysis, we show how the poster was depicted as racist and the UKIP leader Nigel Farage was accused of scaremongering and stoking racism by means of propaganda. This criticism becomes the grounds for mobilization as Farage defended the campaign against the charge of racism and his supporters rose to his side. We conclude by showing how arguments about the nature of racism are identity performances that can reproduce or challenge existing social relations. This article thus identifies the rhetorical "collaboration" that exists between critics and defenders of racism and the inadvertent political outcome of this interaction.

AB  - In the 1980s and early 1990s, homophobia and prejudice were ubiquitous in Australian HIV/AIDS hospital wards and clinics. The association of HIV/AIDS with "deviant" subjects, namely gay men and intravenous drug users, meant that both patients and health care workers experienced and witnessed discrimination. These wards and clinics however, also became sites of solidarity and collaboration that extended across diverse lines of identity. While some HIV/AIDS nurses were gay men, many were heterosexual working-class women. In a context of increasing industrial radicalism amongst nurses, nurses and their unions played a crucial role in fighting for the rights of people living with and dying from HIV/AIDS. They fought and won a political battle with doctors and surgeons for a socially progressive approach to testing and infection control. Drawing on both archival research and oral testimony, this article considers this important, though under-examined, chapter in Australian labour history.

AB  - This essay examines a largely undocumented aspect of Irish literary history: the reception and circulation of John Milton's writings in Ireland. Milton's negative views of the inhabitants of Ireland have been well documented, but this essay analyses some of the intellectual responses of readers, writers, and thinkers in Ireland to the English republic's leading apologist for the conquest of Ireland. I argue that such an approach is required in order to redirect the critical narrative away from examinations of the hackneyed anti-Irish stereotypes written for colonial agendas and to shed light on the ways in which Milton was read to speak to and about a range of political, religious, social, and ethical issues in early modern and late modern Ireland. The essay also seeks to introduce my book-length study of the topic which, ranging across printed and manuscript sources-from Irish translations of Milton's poetry to political appropriations of his controversial prose-interrogates the collective assumptions, aspirations, fears, anxieties, and prejudices of readers and writers in Ireland as they are revealed in response to the self-conflicting voice of civil and religious liberties, on the one hand, and aggressive English colonialism on the other.

AB  - Taking into consideration the complexity that frames the relationship between Globalization and Decolonization this text aims to unveil the potentials (and the burdens) of the Digital Humanities in relation to artist residencies focusing on North Africa as a geographical framework. Through the text I wish to argue that the Digital Humanities should be seen as both an imperative and an exclusionary process by asking the following questions: What is the impact and social projection of the Digital Humanities in relation to the evolution of artists in residencies in the region? What are its methodological innovations, beyond the application of certain technologies? And in what way do they interconnect and hybridize knowledge(s) in an era of widespread prejudice? These questions, framed by a vision that contemplates, reflects and acts in favor of the different realities and responsibilities of the artists in residency model, are the ones through which first NACMM and afterwards Platform HARAKAT have evolved with the aim to promote the encounters of imaginaries and realities that shape the contemporary Mediterranean.

AB  - There is growing evidence of international immigration becoming increasingly influential in peripheral areas in some Southern European countries. Particularly in small localities, where the maintenance of a significant number of active populations is crucial for social, economic and environmental sustainability, immigration can be of vital importance for local and regional policy-making. This paper presents the perceptions, experiences and concerns of various international immigrant stakeholders in Southwest Europe regarding the main challenges in achieving sustainability. Its focus is on rural areas and small towns in Alentejo Litoral (Southwest Portugal) and Alt Emporda (Catalonia, Northeast Spain), places where foreign immigration is above the national average. Using qualitative methods (semi-structured interviews, literature review and participant observation), the main findings show how immigrant stakeholders' perceptions of local sustainability are rich, engaged and diverse, including interesting differences between some Northwest European immigrants and less advantaged immigrants, e.g. Northwest European immigrants (i.e. British, Germans, French, Dutch, Belgians) stress environmental challenges for sustainability much more than the rest. Overcoming some native prejudices, immigrants in Alentejo Litoral and Alt Emporda also contribute to local knowledge of the ways to achieve dynamic local societies and economies, as well as conserve natural protected areas and agricultural environments.

AB  - Background: In psoriatic arthritis (PsA) almost all qualitative studies have been performed in European populations. This work aimed to evaluate the impact of PsA in Brazilian and French subjects, as well as to explore cultural differences in the experience of disease and to recognize domains important for patients living with PsA outside Europe.
   Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in two university hospitals in Brazil and France; outpatients fulfilling Classification Criteria for PsA participated in individual interviews regarding the impact of PsA; interviews were conducted in the local language. The sample size was defined by saturation; interviews were recorded and transcribed and content analysis was performed.
   Results: Fifteen patients were interviewed in Brazil and 13 in France. Mean disease duration was 16.5 +/- 12.5 years (range: 8 months to 47 years) and 14.4 +/- 8.4 years (range 12 months to 29 years) for Brazilian and French subjects, respectively. A broad impact was perceived: 67 codes emerged from the interviews and were grouped in 41 categories. Although 2/3 of categories were common to both nationalities, some important health domains from the perspective of PsA patients from a non-European background were brought to light including sexual dysfunction, emotional impact of psoriasis and impact of prejudice on social and professional life.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of assessing the impact of PsA on a national level, emphasizing the common cross-cultural aspects but also revealing domains of interest for patients with PsA living outside Europe which merit further study.

AB  - A holistic environmental flows (EFlows) assessment, undertaken as part of Ecological Reserve determination studies for selected surface water, groundwater, estuaries and wetlands in the Usuthu/Mhlatuze Water Management Area, South Africa, led to recommendations for modified releases from the Jozini Dam to support the socially, economically and ecologically important Pongola Floodplain situated downstream of the dam. The EFlows study analysed various permutations of flow releases from the dam based on the recommendations of pre-dam studies, and augmented by more recent observations, inputs from farmers and fishermen who live adjacent to the floodplain and discussion with the operators of Jozini Dam. The EFlows method used, DRIFT, allowed for the incorporation of detailed information, data and recommendations from a decades-old research project on the Pongola Floodplain that was undertaken prior to the construction of the Jozini Dam into a modern-day decision-making framework. This was used to assess the impact of a series of different flow releases on nature and society downstream of the dam. It was concluded that, within historic volumetric allocations to the floodplain, a release regime could be designed that considerably aided traditional fishing and grazing without necessarily prejudicing other uses, such as agriculture.

AB  - This article sets out an alternative approach to the assessment and regulation of technology and innovation, situated in and aiming at degrowth and building on an idea first put forward in the late 1970s by Langdon Winner called "methodological Luddism". Methodological Luddism does not have the original meaning of destroying machines, nor does it reflect a prejudiced attitude or a negative view of technology. As outlined in this article, it sets out to overcome the presumption that technology is value neutral and to lower the inflated expectations with which it is generally associated. Technology and forms of life are mutually interdependent, and this implies examining the constructive possibilities for withdrawing from some technologies and adopting others, while ensuring that their role is limited to means designed to achieve certain predefined ends. The article draws on the work of Hans Jonas and Albert Borgmann, authors yet to be acknowledged by the degrowth literature. Jonas' principle of responsibility is a response to the excessive prowess of modern technologies, while Borgmann suggests a reform of technology through focal things and practices. Building on these concepts, methodological Luddism advocates reassessing and reorienting technologies so that informed decisions may be taken as to how they should be designed and developed as means to socially equitable and ecologically sustainable ends. In this way the technological sphere may become an important ally in the transformative change in society which is required to fulfil the axiological parameters of degrowth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Expanding critical accounting research on incarceration, this paper explores the consequences of neoliberal techniques and discourses intersecting with race and class in prison practices. As crime is socially constructed we concentrate on two intertwined terrains of struggle: first, the privatization of prisons and second, the "creation of the other". Controversies over privatization are pervasive and we illustrate that a raison d'etre of privatization - minimizing costs - is discredited and distorted. The devastating consequences of privatization further the divide in communities between those privileged and those vulnerable based on race and class. Through this neoliberal process of privatization and racialization of crime there is a creation of the other - a powerful and hostile discourse. We are troubled that a crime-control dynamic mythologizing and fearing the other has become so institutionalized that domination and injustices are normalized. Accounting contributes to these processes with techniques claiming objectivity, but with undeniable moral impacts. Illustrating these dynamics, we review policies surrounding a four-decade "war on drugs" in the US, appraised as an assault on marginalized (poor) populations. Contrasting to white collar-financial crimes we make visible how incarceration displaces certain groups from significant entitlements of citizenship. While statistics indisputably reveal prejudicial treatment, this is only part of the story. Numbers reduce phenomena to simplistic representations erasing humane meaning and obscuring social dimensions of discrimination and power permeating incarceration practice. Acknowledging these complexities, one aim is developing counter accounts to promote new visibilities to advance social justice. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During Hurricane Maria, individuals throughout the Caribbean uploaded video and photographs to social media, but as winds downed communication towers and electric lines, sharing stopped. Still, satellites orbiting high above Earth transmitted views of the massive hurricane. In the following weeks, the media bombarded viewers with scenes of devastated landscapes, people wading through waist-deep water, infrastructure shredded beyond recognition, apocalyptic desolation, and desperation. Media portrayals focused on a "powerless" people, literally without electrical power, further reduced into social, economic, and political powerlessness. This article combines ethnographic elicitation with cultural analysis to understand how images of trauma and suffering affect diverse audiences. Do these images compel viewers to fight for justice or do they desensitize them? Do they lead people toward feelings of pessimism, resignation, and cynicism? I explore how people's backgrounds and relationships to specific places inform the ways they are even able to look at, grapple with, and work through traumatic images. I demonstrate how long-term prejudice is imbedded into the media's imagery and representations of Hurricane Maria to show how associated governmental neglect exacerbates the trauma of disaster. Lastly, I engage with the place of responsibility and sorrow as I raise the question of how the specter of future natural disasters haunts the current state of devastation.

AB  - Especially since the political turmoil of the 1990s, scholars have focused on the marginalized histories of Dalit (Untouchable) communities in India. Yet these investigations also concentrated exclusively on the male Dalit community. Only recently, however, scholars have focused their attention on Dalit women as subjects of study. Dalits are dominated and dominating at the same time. My article examines Dalit women's lifeworlds under double patriarchy in colonial and post-colonial India to highlight the contributions of scholars in understanding how different Dalit women are negotiating, challenging, politicizing, and transforming conditions of their discriminated Dalit status: as sexed women and caste Dalit. I theorize and focus on ways new Dalit women engaged with the incremental intersecting technologies of caste, class, gender, sexuality, and community to carve out their subjectivity, agency, respectability, and honor in modern India. To this end, I dwell on a variety of themes-generative gender and new Dalit women, upper-caste prejudice, community, patriarchy, honor, and formal education to illuminate the changing sociality and complexities of Dalit women's worlds. My review article demonstrates that Dalit women's universal perspectives and historical and political practices are deeply democratic and as such have the potential of engaging in inclusive and productive politics, building solidarities, and actually reshaping the larger fields of South Asian Studies, India Studies, Dalit Studies, and Gender Studies.

AB  - Across three studies we examined people's implicit attitudes toward Black and White targets who differed systematically by emotional expression. In Study 1, both the race and the emotional expression of primes affected people's attitudes as measured by the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005). In Study 2, participants completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003) containing smiling Black and neutral White faces. When categorizing by race, participants implicitly preferred neutral White, over smiling Black, faces. By contrast, when categorizing by emotional expression, participants showed an implicit preference for smiling Black faces. In Study 3, participants spontaneously categorized these faces by race or emotional expression. Implicit biases again reflected participants' social categorization, however the majority of non-Black participants spontaneously categorized by race. Taken together, these results suggest that how we categorize multiply categorizable others directly affects our spontaneous affective responses.

AB  - Part I of the paper argues against evidentialism and individualism in religious epistemology, and in favor of a "social turn" in the field. The idea here is that human belief in general, and religious belief in particular, is largely characterized by epistemic dependence on other persons. An adequate epistemology, it is argued, ought to recognize and account for social epistemic dependence. Part II considers a problem that becomes salient when we make such a turn. In short, how are we to understand the transmission of knowledge and rational faith in a religious tradition? The problem arises because, by all accounts, even the best traditions transmit superstitions, self-serving prejudices, and other things that are down right false on any reasonable view. So how is it that these same traditions can also transmit rational faith and even knowledge by means of the very same channels, for example channels of religious authority and religious teaching? Part III offers a tentative solution to this problem.

AB  - Decades of behavioral science research have documented functional shifts in attitudes and ideological adherence in response to various challenges, but little work to date has illuminated the neural mechanisms underlying these dynamics. This paper describes how continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation may be employed to experimentally assess the causal contribution of cortical regions to threat-related ideological shifts. In the example protocol provided here, participants are exposed to a threat prime-an explicit reminder of their own inevitable death and bodily decomposition-following a downregulation of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) or a sham stimulation. Next, disguised within a series of distracter tasks, participants' relative degree of ideological adherence is assessed-in the present example, with regard to coalitional prejudice and religious belief. Participants for whom the pMFC has been downregulated exhibit less coalitionally biased responses to an immigrant critical of the participants' national in-group, and less conviction in positive afterlife beliefs (i.e., God, angels, and heaven), despite having recently been reminded of death. These results complement prior findings that continuous theta burst stimulation of the pMFC influences social conformity and sharing and illustrate the feasibility of investigating the neural basis of high-level social cognitive shifts using transcranial magnetic stimulation.

AB  - Teachers' stereotypes may be one factor that contributes to the disadvantages ethnic minority students experience in school. According to dual-process theories, teachers have two strategies that they can apply to derive judgments of students. Teachers' judgments are based on stereotypes when the information they have about students is consistent with teachers' expectations, whereas teachers make judgments on a more individualized basis when their expectations are not supported by student information. We experimentally investigated this hypothesis with regard to teachers' judgments of female ethnic minority and majority students. Teachers were presented with one of four different descriptions of a female student. The below average student was described as low performing, and the above average student represented an easy-to-teach student with high academic achievement. The two student descriptions were compiled for both an ethnic minority student and an ethnic majority student. Results showed that teachers judged the ethnic minority female student less favorably but only when comparing the below average students. The above average female ethnic minority student was judged more favorably than the above average ethnic majority student. Results are discussed with respect to the conditions that might result in advantages or in disadvantages for female ethnic minority students and their implications for future research.

AB  - Ursula K. Le Guin's 1991 short story Newton's Sleep' begins in a utopic society that escaped the environmental and social calamity of a near-future Earth and created an enlightened culture on a space station. The group, led by a scientific elite, pride themselves on eradicating the irrational prejudices and unempirical mentality that hamstringed Earth; but chaos blossoms as the society struggles with the reappearance of religious intolerance, and becomes confused by an outbreak of mass hallucinations of the Earth they left behind. This narrative trope of the necessity of nature for the survival of humanityphysically, mentally, and spirituallyrepresents a new and relatively common allegory in contemporary science fiction in an era distinguished by separation from the natural world.

AB  - Western Governments concerned about the lack of gender equity in their workforces are increasingly seeking to address the negative effects of unconscious biases on employment decisions to counter the effects of hidden prejudices. Although unconscious bias has received limited attention in the human resource literature, social psychology literature has identified inadequacies with this practice, including that such training may entrench and normalise unconscious biases. We argue that the popularity of unconscious bias training invites agencies to view this practice as a silver bullet' to achieve gender equity, but that its effectiveness is likely to be limited unless accompanied by sustained interventions to address discrimination. Further, the impacts of unconscious bias training need to be rigorously evaluated to assess whether government resources are being effectively utilised. Consistent with international research, such an evaluation may reveal that unconscious bias training has unintended negative consequences, but that the training can be improved to reduce these consequences.
   We argue that the provision of unconscious bias training to managers in the Australian Public Service may have limited impact to progress gender equity, and may even have adverse consequences. As a result, we suggest that the Australian Government evaluate this practice to assess its effectiveness.

AB  - This research aimed at identifying social psychological processes contributing to deprovincialising behaviours (Pettigrew, 1997), which support social integration in Europe. We tested whether EU residents' sense of identity, defined as complex (Linville, 1982; Brewer & Pierce, 2005) and inclusive (Dovidio, Gaertner, & Saguy, 2009), orient them toward EU-wide behaviours by mitigating intergroup concerns toward crime, immigration, and terrorism - and by improving optimism about their future within the EU. European adults (N = 28,004; females 54.3%; age M = 50.05, SD = 18.34) residing in one of the 28 EU member states completed the 2014 Eurobarometer survey (Standard EB 81, 2014) and contributed to our key analyses. Mediation analyses confirmed that reduced intergroup concerns and general optimism acted as pathways to pro-Europe integration orientations associated with complex and inclusive identities. This work highlights the promising value of deprovincialization as a concept that imbues both a behavioural and a time dimension.

AB  - Japan disputes the sovereignty of two islands: Senkaku/Diaoyu with China and Takeshima/Dokdo with South Korea. These disputes have triggered political performances. In August 2012, Chinese activists landed on Senkaku/Diaoyu, and South Korean politicians landed on Takeshima/Dokdo. The group threat theory suggests that these events constitute threats to Japanese citizens, which lead to negative attitudes towards these countries. The theory also expects personal variations in the reactions to the threats, and the empirical findings of the theory predict an improvement in the worsened attitudes immediately after the event. Drawing on a Japanese social survey that was conducted every month for the two years during which these landing events occurred, I tested the effect of the events on Japanese attitudes towards China and South Korea in a natural experimental framework. The results show that the events negatively impacted Japanese attitudes towards both countries. However, contrary to the expectations of the group threat theory, individual variations (i.e., socioeconomic status, media exposure, and political orientation) in the responses to the events are not supported. Additionally, the attitudes do not return to preevent levels for one year. The contradictions between previous studies and this study potentially originate from the importance of the territories.

AB  - Transgender individuals face high levels of stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and violence. However, there is a paucity of research (particularly experimental work) investigating the magnitude of gender identity bias (GIB) targeting transgender individuals, as well as interventions designed to ameliorate it. To address this gap, we conducted experimental investigations of reactions to identical, highly qualified men or women job applicants described as either transgender or cisgender (Experiments 1a, 1b), and tested the efficacy of an imagined intergroup contact (IIC) intervention (relative to a control condition) in ameliorating GIB against transgender women (Experiment 2). As expected, all applicants were perceived as equally highly competent, adding to the literature suggesting that clearly demonstrating excellent qualifications can prevent biased judgments of candidate competence. However, revealing GIB, transgender men and women were rated as less likeable and hirable than the identical cisgender applicants, despite the fact that they were viewed as equally competent (Experiments 1a, 1b). Providing additional evidence of GIB, in the absence of IIC, participants rated a transgender female applicant as less likeable and hirable than the identical cisgender applicant, and also reported less self-other overlap and perspective taking for the transgender applicant (Experiment 2). However, these target gender identity differences were reduced (for likeability) or fully eliminated (for the remaining outcomes) in the IIC condition. Put another way, while reactions to the cisgender applicant were unaffected by intervention condition, IIC elevated perceptions of the transgender applicant, suggesting that it may function as an effective GIB intervention.

AB  - Our everyday life is influenced by an overproduction of images and by an iconogenic surplus that is connected to the proliferation of media. These contribute to both the quality and quantity of communication, but simultaneously amplify the knowledge gap between an audience that is able to critically process messages and another that is affected uncritically by prejudices and stereotypes. Bellino argues for a critical media education to address this gap by encouraging the development of students' critical thinking and social awareness. In this article we will discuss the results of a research-driven design project in which visual communication design students engaged with theories of cultural stereotypes and critiqued the role of media in their perpetuation. We adopted Kolb's model of experiential learning as recent published research demonstrates that art and design students have difficulties in conventional academic approaches to learning theory. In this regard students learned theories of stereotype through doing and making and embodied this learning in their critical project outcomes.

AB  - Cognitive heuristics, or people's stereotypes, are central to human interaction. Yet, the literature has been concerned with inter-ethnic stereotypes held by migrants and therefore has insufficiently addressed what might happen to individuals' cognitive heuristics in the process of acculturating to host cultures. The authors discuss this gap in the literature by drawing on the culture learning perspective and work on cultural adaptation to examine migrants' cognitive cultural adaptation. The concept of stereotype accommodation is introduced as a cognitive process whereby migrants incorporate the stereotype-relevant information learned in their host cultures into their preexisting stereotypes. Furthermore, a framework is presented for how cross-cultural differences, learning opportunities, individual differences, and cognitive resources might contribute to stereotype accommodation. The conclusion of this analysis is that, like any other individuals, migrants hold cognitive heuristics about varying groups in society and, moreover, these can be influenced and potentially modified by the mental short-cuts that are relevant in their host cultures.

T2  - ICON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

KW  - FREE SPEECH
AB  - Expression that assaults another's identity or human dignity, as with hate speech, presents a vexing case for regulatory protection. This article proposes a method of expressive elasticity as a means to balance individual protection with expressive liberty in a rigorous and neutral manner. The method of expressive elasticity treats harm to individual recipients as a function of social utility. To maintain neutrality on the content of ideas, social utility is defined as the optimal number of individual participants in public discourse. Offensive expression should be regulated only when it reasonably lessens the likely amount of future contributors to the marketplace of ideas. The object is to restrict offensive expression that signals a hostile or prejudiced public space that a reasonable recipient would recoil from. Elasticity generally refers to the responsiveness of one variable to a change in another variable. Elasticity, as utilized in this article, is a view to the responsiveness of individual participation to the amount of external harm received. When individuals can absorb the external harm and their potential participation remains unchanged, there should be no government intervention. Elasticity should be recognized as inversely related to the private costs imposed on offensive expression. When a speaker is publicly reviled because of a hateful message, then the private marketplace has appropriately indicated that the targeted person is not the one devalued by society. When the private costs for hateful expression are insufficient, however, public sanction may be necessary to ensure optimal levels of future participation.

AB  - In recent years, antitransgender legislation that focuses on gender and the use of public restrooms-so-called bathroom bills-has been considered in many states in the United States. The present study was designed to extend research on transphobic attitudes and elucidate links between religious fundamentalism, social dominance orientation, transphobia, and voting for bathroom bills. Further, we examined the moderating influence of critical consciousness on the relationship between transphobic attitudes and voting on a hypothetical bathroom bill. Results of a moderated mediation multinomial logistic regression path analysis using data from a sample of 282 college students (154 women and 128 men) indicated that religious fundamentalism and social dominance orientation were associated with transphobic attitudes. Transphobia was associated with lower likelihood to vote against or abstain from voting on the bill, compared to voting for it. Critical consciousness was also associated with greater likelihood of voting against the bill rather than for it. The interaction between transphobia and critical consciousness was associated with voting against rather than for the bill, such that at higher levels of transphobia, those higher in critical consciousness were more likely to vote against the bill rather than for it. Implications for incorporating critical consciousness into advocacy efforts to promote transgender rights are discussed.

AB  - The present study aims to provide an overview of experiences of discrimination, harassment, and violence in a sample of Italian transsexuals who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery (SRS). Lack of support for gender transition from family members was also assessed, before and after SRS. Data were collected in the context of a multicentric study (Milan, Florence, and Bari) on SRS outcome. Patients who underwent SRS were contacted and asked to fill out a questionnaire concerning experiences of discrimination, harassment, violence, and crime they might have experienced in previous years. Seventy-two participants took part in the research: 46 were male-to-female (MtF; 64%) and 26 were female-to-male (FtM; 36%). Thirty-six percent of the total sample (with no differences between MtF and FtM) experienced at least one episode of harassment, violence, or discrimination. The workplace was reported to be the social area with the highest risk of discrimination and harassment (22% of participants). Reports of more than one incident of discrimination, harassment, and violence characterized the majority of participants in the MtF sample. Compared with previous studies carried out in other countries, a much larger proportion of participants could count on a supportive family environment before and after transition. Our results show that Italian society at large is prejudiced against transsexuals, but at a more micro level, having a trans person as a family member might result in a protective and tolerant attitude.

AB  - In this study, we contend that distinguishing individuals who support bans on minority religious symbols from those who want to ban all religious symbols improves our understanding of the roots of opposition to minority religious symbols in the public sphere. We hypothesize that both groups are likely driven by markedly different motivations and that opposition to the presence of minority religious symbols in the public sphere may be the result of an alliance between strange bedfellows, clusters of individuals whose political outlooks usually bring them to opposite sides of political debates. Drawing on a survey conducted in the province of Quebec (Canada), we find that while holding liberal values and low religiosity are key characteristics of those who would ban all religious symbols, feelings of cultural threat and generalized prejudice are central characteristics of those who would only restrict minority religious symbols. Negative attitudes specifically toward Muslims, however, also appear to motivate both groups.

AB  - Several researchers hold that the cohousing movement supports sustainability, but it remains economically restrictive. This condition challenges cohousing's status as sustainable, considering that its financially exclusive nature fails to meaningfully address sustainability's social dimension. Yet, it is doubtful that the cohousing movement set out to create this outcome. When we examine the historical conditions that pertain to multifamily housing, we discover a long-standing pattern of discrimination. For today's cohousing communities, we see that they are dealing with the residual effects of such prejudicial practices. Most of the unfair treatment comes from zoning and lending, but we also see that cohousing has internal challenges that complicate matters. Through employing an environmental justice framework, however, we can parse kinds of responsibility. If planners, financiers, and cohousing communities can remove these barriers, then cohousing can bolster efforts in urban sustainability.

AB  - ContextSimulated patients (SPs) are extensively used in the teaching of medical communication, both for students and doctors. They occupy a unique middle ground between patients and physicians: although free from the prejudices that medical training brings, they work closely with clinical tutors to promote the principles of patient-centred consulting. Despite this, there is relatively little research around their views on what makes for good communication practice. This study aims to address this gap in the literature through a qualitative analysis of SPs' opinions, especially in the context of medical student communication.
   MethodsEighteen SPs from two medical schools, Hull York Medical School and Durham, were interviewed, using an in-depth, one-to-one, semi-structured approach. Data, transcribed verbatim, were thematically analysed.
   ResultsThree global themes were identified: (i) listening and empathy and showing it, (ii) continual human connection and (iii) information flow from the patient. These three themes, termed the communication triad, form a type of virtuous circle, each facilitating the other. Listening and empathy were facilitated through attributes, including attentive non-verbal communication, and through responding to cues, including making effective empathetic statements. Continual human connection was facilitated through successful beginnings, including preferring open questions to robotic' tick-list questions and allowing patients time to have their say. Mirroring, professional appearance, appropriate physical contact and a human approach were amongst other factors facilitating connection with patients. Information flow was encouraged by factors including showing an interest in the patient and use of silence; flow was curtailed by undesirable attributes, including interrupting, dismissive communication and making assumptions about aspects such as sexuality.
   ConclusionThis first in-depth study of SPs' views on medical consulting identifies a communication triad that both affirms and builds on the current literature base. Five novel teaching points emerge, with clear relevance for best practice communication teaching and curricula design.
   Simulated patients identify recommended medical communication attributes: listening and empathy, encouraging information flow, and striving for a continual human connection.

AB  - This study examines the effects of neighborhood racial in-group size, economic deprivation and the prevalence of crime on neighborhood cohesion among U.S. whites. We explore to what extent residents' perceptions of their neighborhood mediate these macro-micro relationships. We use a recent individual-level data set, the American Social Fabric Study (2012/2013), enriched with contextual-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2010) and employ multi-level structural equation models. We show that the racial in-group size is positively related to neighborhood cohesion and that neighborhood cohesion is lower in communities with a high crime rate. Individuals' perceptions of the racial in-group size partly mediate the relationship between the objective racial in-group size and neighborhood cohesion. Residents' perceptions of unsafety from crime also appear to be a mediating factor, not only for the objective crime rate but also for the objective racial in-group size. This is in line with our idea that racial stereotypes link racial minorities to crime whereby neighborhoods with a large non-white population are perceived to be more unsafe. Residents of the same neighborhood differ in how they perceive the degree of economic decay of the neighborhood and this causes them to evaluate neighborhood cohesion differently, however perceptions of neighborhood economic decay do not explain the link between the objective neighborhood context and neighborhood cohesion.

KW  - Pragmatism

KW  - SUPREME-COURT
AB  - Truth as a fundamental ingredient within the flow of discourse and the application of freedom of expression in democratic society has historically received considerable attention from the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of the Court's central precedents regarding First Amendment concerns have been determined by how justices have understood truth and how they have conceptualized the complex relationship truth and falsity share. Despite the attention truth has received, however, the Court has not provided a consistent understanding of its meaning. For these reasons, this article examines how the Supreme Court has conceptualized truth in freedom-of-expression cases, ultimately drawing upon the results of that analysis, as well as pragmatic approaches to philosophy, the so called "pragmatic method" put forth by American philosopher William James, to propose a unifying conceptualization of truth that could be employed to help the Court provide consistency within its precedents regarding the meaning of a concept that has been central to the Court's interpretation of the First Amendment since, in many ways, another pragmatist and friend of James's, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, substantially addressed truth in his dissent in Abrams v. United States. The article concludes by proposing that the courts conceptualize the nature of truth via three substantially related understandings: that truth is a process, that it is experience-funded, and that it is not absolute and is best approached without prejudice. Each of the three ingredients relates, at least to some extent, with thematic understandings put forth by the Court in previous freedom-of-expression cases, and therefore does not represent a significant departure from justices' traditional approaches to truth. The model, most ideally, does seek, with the help of pragmatic thought and ideas put forth by Justice Holmes, to encourage consistent recognition of certain principles regarding truth as justices go about considering its nature in First Amendment cases.

AB  - This study explored processes of curricular reinterpretation made by teachers who teach about the Holocaust. We conducted holistic narrative analyses of in-depth interviews with 31 American Holocaust educators. Six teaching orientations were identified: passionate historical, mythologizing-transforming, social-contemporizing, empathic-personalizing, riveting-shocking, and pragmatic-socializing. We offer vignettes for each orientation and compare them to other teaching perspective typologies, highlighting the novelty and utility of the presented typology. The findings demonstrate how narrative identity, meaning-making processes and teaching perspectives interconnect and lead teachers to reinterpret the Holocaust in their teaching. These findings have implications for teaching complex and value-laden topics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - OPEN-ACCESS
AB  - This study examines the reasons why authors publish in 'predatory' OA journals. In total, 50 journals were randomly selected from Beall's list of predatory' journals. Different methods, including WHOIS tracking, were utilized to query basic information about the selected journals, including location and registrant. Then, 300 articles were randomly selected from within selected journals in various scientific fields. Authors of the selected articles were contacted and sent survey questions to complete. A grounded theory qualitative methods approach was used for data collection and analysis. The results demonstrated that most of these journals were located in the developing world, usually Asia or Africa, even when they claimed they were in the USA or UK. Furthermore, four themes emerged after authors' survey responses were coded, categorized, and sub-categorized. The themes were: social identity threat, unawareness, high pressure, and lack of research proficiency. Scholars in the developing world felt that reputable Western journals might be prejudiced against them and sometimes felt more comfortable publishing in journals from the developing world. Other scholars were unaware of the reputation of the journals in which they published and would not have selected them had they known. However, some scholars said they would still have published in the same journals if their institution recognised them. The pressure to 'publish or perish' was another factor influencing many scholars' decisions to publish in these fast-turnaround journals. In some cases, researchers did not have adequate guidance and felt they lacked the knowledge of research to submit to a more reputable journal. More needs to be done by institutions and reputable journals to make researchers aware of the problem of predatory' journals.

AB  - ObjectiveThe Recovery Record smartphone app is a self-monitoring tool for individuals recovering from eating disorders. Oppositely to traditional pen-and-paper meal diaries, the app allows for in-app patient-clinician linkage enabling clinicians to access patient app data anytime. The aim of our study was to explore the interdisciplinary clinical perspective on Recovery Record and its impact on treatment.
   MethodThirty-one clinicians from a Danish eating disorder treatment facility participated in field studies and 23 of these in interviews. Data were generated and analyzed concurrently applying the inductive methodology of Interpretive Description.
   ResultsWe found two overarching themes: Access to app data between treatment sessions, and The patient-clinician relationship. Sub-themes associated with the former were Online obligations in relation to the added workload of continuously monitoring patient app data, and Prepared or prejudiced relating to advantages and disadvantages of using patient app data as preparation for treatment sessions. Sub-themes pertaining to the latter were Expectation discrepancy in relation to patients' and clinicians' divergent expectations for app usage, and Pacified patients regarding the clinicians' experience that the app potentially compromised the patient initiative in treatment sessions.
   DiscussionRecovery Record induced new and affected pre-existing treatment and work conditions for clinicians. Clinicians were preoccupied with challenges associated with the app, for example, an added work load and potential harm to the patient-clinician collaboration. Thus, prior to adopting the app, we encourage clinicians and managements to discuss the objectives, advantages and disadvantages of adopting the app, and outline specific guidelines for patient and clinician app usage.

AB  - Existing research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth homelessness identifies family rejection as a main pathway into homelessness for the youth. This finding, however, can depict people of color or poor people as more prejudiced than White, middle-class families. In this 18-month ethnographic study, the author complicates this rejection paradigm through documenting the narratives of 40 LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. The author examines how poverty and family instability shaped the conditions that the youth perceived as their being rejected because of their gender and sexuality. This rejection generated strained familial ties within families wherein the ties were already fragile. Likewise, the author shows how being gender expansive marked many youth's experiences of familial abuse and strain. This study proposes the concept of conditional families to capture the social processes of how poverty and family instability shape experiences of gender, sexuality, and rejection for some LGBTQ youth.

AB  - Purpose Implicit bias can adversely affect health disparities. The implicit association test (IAT) is a prompt to stimulate reflection; however, feedback about bias may trigger emotions that reduce the effectiveness of feedback interventions. Exploring how individuals process feedback about implicit bias may inform bias recognition and management curricula. The authors sought to explore how health professionals perceive the influence of the experience of taking the IAT and receiving their results.
   Method Using constructivist grounded theory methodology, the authors conducted semistructured interviews with 21 pediatric physicians and nurses at the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, Ontario, Canada, from September 2015 to November 2016 after they completed the mental illness IAT and received their result. Data were analyzed using constant comparative procedures to work toward axial coding and development of an explanatory theory.
   Results When provided feedback about their implicit attitudes, participants described tensions between acceptance and justification, and between how IAT results relate to idealized and actual personal and professional identity. Participants acknowledged desire for change while accepting that change is difficult. Most participants described the experience of taking the IAT and receiving their result as positive, neutral, or interesting.
   Conclusions These findings contribute to emerging understandings of the relationship between emotions and feedback and may offer potential mediators to reconcile feedback that reveals discrepancies between an individual's actual and idealized identities. These results suggest that reflection informed by tensions between actual and aspirational aspects of professional identity may hold potential for implicit bias recognition and management curricula.

AB  - Cultural prejudice rather than self interest is the conventional wisdom for why voters respond negatively to immigration. Using a new measure of unauthorized immigrants based on self-reported invalid social security numbers, we show that voters' responses are more nuanced than mere prejudice against minorities. Using county level data from the U.S. state of Georgia, we find that voters in counties with above median levels of unauthorized workers are more likely to support the Republican Party. We also find that wealthier counties and wealthier voters are most likely to respond negatively to the unauthorized. Our evidence warns against arguments that depict opposition to immigration as motivated solely by xenophobia and cultural fears among lower income Whites.

AB  - Fear of crime (FoC) has dominated the political landscape over the last 20 years, with many crime policy developments during this period linked not to actual experiences of violence but to the fear of victimization. Fear of crime studies, in most cases, are conducted with populations that have only a passing, mediated knowledge of crime victimization. The research discussed in this article, in contrast, considers the impact of FoC with a highly victimized community, and establishes psychometric testing to validate an instrument to measure the impact of that fear (Fear of Heterosexism Scale [FoHS]). If FoC is related to experiences of crime as the existing research suggests, then victims of heterosexist prejudice, discrimination, and/or violence would be more likely to fear such incidents in the future. It was also predicted that participants who concealed their sexual and/or gender identity and had lower levels of social connectedness would experience higher levels of fear. The findings highlight the importance of contextual factors in FoH, and identify the critical roles that disclosure and social connectedness play in ameliorating the damaging effects of heterosexist victimization.

TI  - Repeated Reinterpretation of Civil Society: On the Intellectual Context of Niklas Luhmann's Sociological Theory
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF JAPANESE SOCIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - Niklas Luhmann
KW  - Carl Schmitt
KW  - civil liberalism
AB  - This article explains the intellectual context of Niklas Luhmann's sociological theory. Although Luhmann's theory is well known for its highly abstract features, this does not mean that the theory results from his references to the latest general systems theory, which has been the primary focus of previous literature. That said, no social theory is produced in a vacuum. Even if a theorist attempts to construct a general sociological theory to explain every social phenomenon, that theory is necessarily influenced by the theorist's prejudices. Therefore, social theory must be contextualized both to estimate its biases and to limit its scope. This study shows that Luhmann's systems theory is constructed through a struggle with the issues of his day. First, it notes that the question of how to conceptualize modern civil society was widely shared by German intellectuals from the late 1950s to the 1970s and that the question created a certain discourse field. Second, Luhmann's theoretical conception is contextualized in that field of discourse, and the central role of both the concept of functional differentiation and the concern with border maintenance in his theory-building is explained in comparison with the work of contemporary intellectuals. To deepen our analysis, this article reconstructs Schmitt's interpretation and criticism of civil liberalism and describes Luhmann's struggle with it. Finally, by analyzing the Gesellschaftswissenschaften of Robert von Mohl, one of the founders of civil liberalism, this article argues that Luhmann's sociology can be characterized as an attempt to rehabilitate civil liberalism.

AB  - The aim of this piece of research is to analyse the constitutional references of Article 52 of the Constitution of Romania, namely the guarantee of the right of a person aggrieved by a public authority. Therefore, the guarantee of this fundamental rights helps ensure the good administration of the rule of law, the respect for the legitimate rights and interests of Romanian citizens and, implicitly, of Romanian businesses environment. Good administration concerns the interest of both natural persons and legal persons who are engaged in the economic circuit and whose rights are granted by the fundamental law. Good administration is accomplished by granting the fundamental right of a person aggrieved through an administrative deed or through a request which was not settled within the legal time limit and, at the same time, by granting to that person a right to approach the competent authorities and to be entitled to obtain the recognition of the claimed right or of the legitimate interest, with the annulment of the deed and the repair of prejudice, respectively. The liability of the State for miscarriage of justice, as well as its right of recourse against the magistrates who acted in bad faith or serious neglect in their position are also granted. The methods used in drawing up this study are: the comparative method used to identify the right of a person aggrieved by a public authority in the Romanian Constitutions and in the Constitutions of other states, and the historical method, which was used in the analysis of the historical evolution of the studied field. The logical method served to analyse the current research in the field, while the sociological method helped to study social impact. The quantitative method was used to study the relevant applicable legislation. The results of this research have highlighted the current trends and the need of citizens and economic actors to benefit from good administration by public authorities. The implications of research for ensuring the good administration of citizens, economic agents and implicitly, of the business environment, reveals how important it is to ensure the supreme values, granted by the Constitution, namely the right of a person aggrieved by a public authority, a fundamental right analysed in this study.

TI  - Dramatic Measures: Comedy as Philosophical Paradigm
T2  - ANGLIA-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ENGLISCHE PHILOLOGIE
LA  - English
AB  - Tragedy's overwhelming presence, presaged by the conspicuous absence of Aristotle's treatise on comedy, has dominated the debate between philosophy and poetry ever since Plato, making tragedy the dominant paradigm for philosophical and performance practices. Over the last century, the gradual blurring of genre distinctions has led to George Steiner's declaration of the 'death of tragedy' and to J. L. Styan's recognition of the emergence of 'dark comedy', giving rise to a growing body of research on comedy. Nevertheless, despite the unprecedented attention, the prejudices against comedy run wide and deep, from philosophical neglect to high-brow conceptions of art all the way to underlying economies of power and social regulation. In consequence, comedy has been side-stepped as an inferior genre or mode, or rehabilitated as a truer or newer form of the tragic. The present study attempts to frame this prejudice as the result of theories of aesthetics and ethics which systematically exclude the comic vision, claiming that it is possible to trace a distinct corollary between the development of theories of genre and the development of philosophical aesthetic categories. The emphasis on the beautiful and the sublime, and its corresponding brand of ethics, can be linked to the flourishing of theories of tragedy, while the systematized rejection of the ugly, the ridiculous, and the ethically ambiguous can be shown to correspond to the floundering of theories of comedy, which remained largely neglected for over two thousand years. Much more than mere literary genres, the terms comedy and tragedy, when applied to the history of Western civilization, reveal the extent of our penchant for the speculative to the detriment of the actual.

AB  - The research problems of this study are the difficulties in the explanation of the phenomenon of reading in its accelerated transformations by quantitative sociological methods, because of failure to comply with a number of factors: first, the social aspects of the purchase, consumption and possession of reading materials have not yet been reading; second, reading is both asocial and social activity; third, the reader is not social status, social class, social group or social role. Author's hypothesis: the most accessible and authoritative audience methods for study of the reading sociological research methods, are unable to disclose the specifics of the reader and reading, they provide limited data only on the outer side of the reading activity, for its quantitative indicators but do not reach to the knowledge about the nature and the reasons both for the reading and not reading. The object of this study is the use of sociological research methods in the study of the reader and the reading. The purpose is to reveal the problems generated by the classical sociological research methods, which fed up the mainstream negativity towards the contemporary reading and hinder his objective knowledge. Methodology/approach: The study was conducted by critical analytical and synthetic approach, which involves a systematic review, comparative analysis of terminology and concepts and educational integrated research on the topic, Does my microgroup read?. among Bulgarians over 14 years (2003-2017). Findings: There have been found 15 disadvantages of the sociological methods of the study of reading, as a result of which, science can get a false picture of the reading situation of local and global level. These disadvantages are as follows: 1) research vs. survey, 2) sociological propaganda, 3) the effect of the crowd, 4) fear from the reader, 5) unrecognition of snobbery towards reading and the books, 6) connotations of the word, reading., 7) literature vs. book, 8) the index, free time., 9) reading in the consumer modality, 10) reading as demonstrative consumption, 11) undefined, reader., 12) the respondent lie, 13) the respondent resistance, 14) the prejudice, compulsory for reading., 15) absence of axiological balance. As an alternative to the sociological methods for obtaining of objective results in the study of the reading and the readers is proposed the integrated approach between qualitative sociological methods and the methods of cognitive neuroscience and bibliopsychology.

AB  - Objective: To understand the daily lives of people with Parkinson's disease. Method: Qualitative research, using as methodological and theoretical referential the Grounded Theory and Symbolic Interactionism, respectively. The in-depth interview was conducted with 30 people with Parkinson's disease. Results: From data analysis, three themes were selected: Living with the disease - living with the treatment and changes in lifestyle; Modifying of one's job performance - revealing incapacity for work and the need to anticipate retirement and; Living with the stigma - the feeling of prejudice against the disease and the perceived limitations of the health services. Final considerations: Living with a chronic and non-transferable disease encompasses social, physic al and cultural effects, along with the personal experiences of each unique individual. This study assists the improvement of care to people with the disease, because the care practice emerges from the interactions between the subjects.

AB  - Trends in Eastern Europe, with particular emphasis on Poland, are used in this article to analyse offshoring as a form of social dumping. Neoliberalisation and globalisation generate and utilise the mobility of both capital and labour. Meanwhile, labour migration is presenting a challenge to the observance of labour rights. Present-day methods of capital accumulation rely on the search for cheap labour and the relocation of production to territories that do not protect workers' rights. Effective defence of labour rights must take place at the transnational level, where most capital is generated. Trade unions need to cross national borders in order to move social activity into this area. The defence of workers' rights must go hand in hand with the struggle against nationalism and racist prejudices. In this context, migrant workers become one of the main potential driving forces of the modern global proletariat.

AB  - Many individuals believe that meditation has the capacity to not only alleviate mental-illness but to improve prosociality. This article systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the effects of meditation interventions on prosociality in randomized controlled trials of healthy adults. Five types of social behaviours were identified: compassion, empathy, aggression, connectedness and prejudice. Although we found a moderate increase in prosociality following meditation, further analysis indicated that this effect was qualified by two factors: type of prosociality and methodological quality. Meditation interventions had an effect on compassion and empathy, but not on aggression, connectedness or prejudice. We further found that compassion levels only increased under two conditions: when the teacher in the meditation intervention was a co-author in the published study; and when the study employed a passive (waiting list) control group but not an active one. Contrary to popular beliefs that meditation will lead to prosocial changes, the results of this meta-analysis showed that the effects of meditation on prosociality were qualified by the type of prosociality and methodological quality of the study. We conclude by highlighting a number of biases and theoretical problems that need addressing to improve quality of research in this area.

AB  - Background/Context: The current biographic understanding of John Dewey's experience adopting and raising an Italian boy named Sabino emphasizes the theme of finding an emotional replacement for Morris and Gordon, two young sons who had tragically died on family trips to Europe. Lacking is substantive attention to the fact that John Dewey's son had a physical disability who grew up during the early surge of eugenics thought in American popular life. The leading biographer Jay Martin has portrayed John and Alice Dewey as rescuing Sabino from poverty, an experience that gave John Dewey "a special empathy for the second-best, the second-class citizen, the loser in society." What is missing from all biographic research on the Deweys is their experience of raising a boy with a physical disability during a historical time when disabilities were highly stigmatized.
   Purpose/Objective/Research: The purpose of this historical study is to supplement the current understanding of John Dewey fathering an adopted son with an account that attends to the fact that young Sabino had a physical disability. Working in the disability studies tradition, this analysis explores both how the Deweys contended with Sabino's bone tuberculosis as an illness requiring medical treatment and how they navigated the complex political context of deeply discriminatory attitudes surrounding disabled persons. The conclusion initiates a discussion of the larger questions concerning how the experiences of fathering a boy impacted directly by disability oppression might have influenced John Dewey's political activity and scholarship.
   Research Design: This historical analysis utilizes prior biographic research, published and unpublished works by John Dewey, and primary historical documents such as family letters and medical and popular publications of the era.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This analysis finds that John and Alice Dewey were very loving and attentive parents who endured many struggles due to their child's disability. They worried about their son's health, and they capably navigated the available medical options. They were troubled by their son's suffering and pain, and they worked together with great consistency to comfort and support him. Further, they directly confronted disability prejudice, including educational segregation, and worked assiduously against the powerful cultural assumption that their disabled son should lead a life of anything less than full participation in the community. The article concludes with a preliminary examination of how these experiences influenced John Dewey's political writings and activities.

AB  - Recent and recurrent violence against immigrants in South Africa highlight the prevalence of xenophobia in the country. Is there a relationship between attitudes towards immigrant sentiment and life satisfaction at the individual level in that nation? Life satisfaction could be a proxy for anxiety, social alienation or insecurity which may be driving xenophobic sentiment. Using data from the 2013 South African Social Attitudes Survey, this paper examines the relationship between attitudes towards immigrants and life satisfaction (measured using the Personal Wellbeing Index). The study focuses exclusively on the attitudes of the country's Black African majority. Bivariate and multivariate analysis found that life satisfaction did not have a strong relationship with pro-immigrant sentiments. Objective measures of socio-economic status (such as educational attainment) did not have a significant relationship with attitudes towards immigrants. Although improving subjective wellbeing among Black Africans is a worthwhile policy goal in of itself, the findings of this study suggest that addressing xenophobia among this group will require focus on other areas. Intergroup contact, interracial attitudes and perceptions about the consequences of immigration were found to be stronger predictors of pro-immigrant sentiment than life satisfaction. There was some evidence of `outsider solidarity 'in the study-isiTsonga speakers and members of the ethnolinguistic Black African minority were more pro-immigrant in sentiment than other groups. The implications of this finding on the study of pro-immigration attitudes are discussed in the conclusion.

AB  - Video evidence has been widely welcomed into courtrooms, largely on the implicit faith that video objectively represents the legally relevant facts as they are. In this paper, we argue that both lay and legal understanding of video as "objective" is a misapprehension. The ways in which people watch video, as well as the vividness of the format itself, may encourage biased decision-making. We suggest the need for an evidence-based understanding of the probative value and prejudicial pitfalls of video, adapting a rubric used by scholars to assess the reliability of eyewitness testimony. Drawing from contemporary research on visual attention and perception, we question the reliability of people's interpretations of video. Specifically, we suggest that people overbelieve video, assuming their interpretations are more accurate and complete than they actually are and failing to discriminate inaccurate from accurate interpretations. Further, people are largely unaware of these biases in their processing of video evidence. We conclude by suggesting future avenues of research geared toward the development of rules and interventions for the presentation of video evidence. We seek to promote dialogue between legal experts and psychologists about new ways to reduce biases in judgment and to maximize the benefits of an increasingly prevalent type of evidence.

AB  - We develop and test a theory to address a puzzling pattern that has been discussed widely since the 2016 U.S. presidential election and reproduced here in a post-election survey: how can a constituency of voters find a candidate authentically appealing (i.e., view him positively as authentic) even though he is a lying demagogue (someone who deliberately tells lies and appeals to non-normative private prejudices)? Key to the theory are two points: (1) common-knowledge lies may be understood as flagrant violations of the norm of truth-telling; and (2) when a political system is suffering from a crisis of legitimacy (Lipset 1959) with respect to at least one political constituency, members of that constituency will be motivated to see a flagrant violator of established norms as an authentic champion of its interests. Two online vignette experiments on a simulated college election support our theory. These results demonstrate that mere partisanship is insufficient to explain sharp differences in how lying demagoguery is perceived, and that several oft-discussed factorsinformation access, culture, language, and genderare not necessary for explaining such differences. Rather, for the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal, it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political system as flawed or illegitimate.

AB  - As mental health services have become more accessible to diverse peoples and communities, psychologists' role in addressing the social, political, historical, and economic contexts on individuals' behavior has also increased in complexity. The American Psychological Association's (2003) Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Training, Research, Practice and Organizational Change for Psychologists indicate that the multiculturally competent psychologist provide leadership as agents of prosocial change, advocacy, and social justice. Psychologists therefore are called to promote societal understanding, affirmation, and appreciation of multiculturalism against the damaging effects of individual, institutional, and societal racism, prejudice, and all forms of oppression based on stereotyping and discrimination. Multicultural competencies hold psychologists to a high standard to ally with, advocate for, and, at times, become activists in using psychological science to improve the condition of individuals, organizations, and society. The purpose of this article is to present a practical application of advocacy, in all its forms, as a foundational and functional competency for practitioners of psychology to strengthen psychology's leadership in advocating for psychological health and well-being for all people.

AB  - Even with economic development and improvements in health care around the world, it is estimated that nowadays, 50 million people have epilepsy. It is one of the most prevalent neurological diseases, yet it is still surrounded by prejudice, stigma, lack of awareness, and wrong attitudes of the population towards the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the knowledge about epilepsy in health students from different countries: Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, United States, and South Africa. Students were asked to complete a survey regarding knowledge about epilepsy (the Epilepsy Knowledge Questionnaire). One hundred and two students participated, 62.2% of them were female. Portuguese students had significantly higher values than the American ones (p = 0.025). Regarding the medical aspects, on average, students hit 63.8% of the questions, and the students from Portugal had significantly higher average than the ones from the United States (p = 0.0007). Statements with lower percent of correct answers were about pathophysiology, medication, and treatment of the disease. There were no differences between the scores obtained by the students of each country in the social aspects of the disease. Statements with higher percent of mistakes were about sports practice, labor, proceedings in case of convulsion, and ability to drive vehicles. General knowledge of senior health students about epilepsy was considered low, however, regarding the medical aspects of the disease, students from Brazil and Portugal exhibited a slightly superior knowledge. Changing the way of seeing and treating people with epilepsy brings, as a consequence, increased opportunities for these people in different sectors of society. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recent real-world events in which diversity policies and practices have been met with severe backlash can prompt a zero-sum perception of inclusion efforts. This article offers theory-based insights for instituting diversity initiatives that can afford inclusion for allallowing institutions to reap the benefits of diversity efforts while reducing the costs of backlash. Using an inclusion for all framework we highlight three salient, interrelated, sources of backlash tied to dominant group members' goals and motivations: (1) perceived or actual restriction of independence or autonomy, (2) preference for the status quo and colorblindness, and (3) beliefs that racial and other social equalities have been reached. Throughout, we emphasize an intergroup focus that recognizes the interdependent yet often divergent goals and motivations of marginalized and dominant groups. Mainstream institutions' (colleges, workplaces) role as a critical site for inclusion interventions is discussed.

AB  - Sexual stereotypes may adversely affect the health of Black men who have sex with men (MSM). Greater understanding of the nature and nuances of these stereotypes is needed. This online, survey-based study used an inductive, intersectional approach to characterize the sexual stereotypes ascribed to Black MSM by the U.S. general public, their distinctiveness from those ascribed to Black men and MSM in general, and their relative prototypicality as compared to dominant subgroups. Members of the public, recruited in 2014-2015, were randomly assigned to survey conditions that varied systematically by race (Black, White, or unspecified) and sexual orientation (gay, heterosexual, or unspecified) of a designated social group. Participants (n = 285) reported stereotypes of their assigned group that they perceived to exist in U.S. culture in an open-response format. Cross-condition comparisons revealed that, overall, Black gay male stereotypes were non-prototypical of Black men or gay men. Rather, stereotypes of Black men were more similar to Black heterosexual men and stereotypes of gay men were more similar to White gay men. Nonetheless, 11 of the 15 most frequently reported Black gay male stereotypes overlapped with stereotypes of Black men (e.g., large penis), gay men (e.g., deviant), or both (e.g., promiscuous). Four stereotypes were unique relative to both Black men and gay men: down low, diseased, loud, and dirty. Findings suggest that Black MSM face multiple derogatory sexual stereotypes, several of which are group-specific. These stereotypes are consistent with cultural (mis)representations of Black MSM and suggest a need for more accurate portrayals of existing sexual diversity within this group.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine empirical, epistemological and conceptual challenges and clinical narratives in the application of risk assessment and management in mental health.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a narrative review of empirical, conceptual and clinical literature.
   Findings - The worldwide prevalence of violence in mental health settings remains high. Risk assessment and management approaches, while well intentioned as an attempt to reduce harm and increase people's safety, have negligible effect on both. They are invariably individual centric, ignore wider environmental, societal and behavioural influences that foment violence and have a stigmatising effect on people using mental health services. They also reinforce the myth that people who are mentally unwell threaten society and that through current risk assessment and management approaches, we can minimise this threat.
   Research limitations/implications - There is a need to reconsider the study and application of violence risk assessment in mental health.
   Practical implications - The practice of risk assessment and management in mental health is marred by an overuse of risk assessment measures that are limited in their predictive efficacy. As a result, they have little value in preventing, reducing and/or managing harm. The language of risk punishes and stigmatises service users and reinforces the image of menace. An alternative language of safety may nourish and protect. A collaborative approach to safety assessment based upon recovery-focussed principles and practices may fuse professionals and service users' horizons. Combining service users' self-perception, professionals' sound clinical judgement, assisted by electronically derived risk algorithms and followed by evidence-based risk management interventions, may lessen the threat to service users, reduce harm and transform the practice of violence risk assessment and management.
   Social implications - Risk appraisals discriminate against the small number of people who have a mental illness and are risky, an example of preventive detention that is ethically questionable. On the basis of the limitations of the predictive efficacy of actuarial measures, it is ethically dubious to subject people to interventions with limited benefits. Risk assessment processes tend to reinforce stigma by classifying individuals as risky, sanctioning society's prejudices and fear through scientific authority.
   Originality/value - The increasing focus on risk assessment and management to tackle violence in mental health is fraught with empirical, conceptual and practical concerns; the authors have suggested ways in which these concerns can be addressed without compromising people's safety.

AB  - This article analyses the case of the Barcelona Anti-Rumour Network, an initiative promoted by the City Council and social organizations, in order to deal with the uncontrolled proliferation of rumours, prejudices and stereotypes about immigration. Rumours convey false information with the aim of exploiting the fears of citizens often disconcerted in the face of the changes brought about the arrival of a considerable number of foreign immigrants. The article analyses, through policy analysis and in-depth interviews, the role of communication in immigration policies and the concept of citizenship that exists behind this strategy. Such policies can run the risk of focusing too much on the denial of rumours rather than on the affirmation of rights, as this may question the eligibility of the immigrant population to obtain the status of citizenship.

KW  - lesson planning
AB  - Aim. The aim of the research is to describe the model for lesson planning on peace education in teacher training. The used resources are aimed at filling the shortcomings in peace education and improving the value of the materials available to teachers. In preparing the lesson, a teacher will either use the models available to him/her or develop his/her own models in time.
   Concept and Methods. This study was conducted by qualitative research. The document research technique was used in the study (Yildirim, & Simsek, 2008, pp. 187-193). For the last three years, I have been working on the model related specifically to peace education as part of the project of the Turkish research institute called TUB TAK.
   Result and Conclusion. This model was presented during the academic year 2017/2018 at several conferences in Turkish, German and English. In this article, the topic of "Tolerance Towards Different Cultures" was chosen to de thorn ne the practical part of the lesson preparation because this topic is of particular interest to many countries, due to migration. The refugees experience certain problems in the areas of language, culture, employment, social acceptance and prejudice. In order to minimize these problems, various measures are taken in the field of education.
   Originality. The participants showed great interest in the designing of the daily lesson planning and the implementation of this design in the teaching of peace in the training of the teachers. The studies in this field should be supported in order to increase peace education.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PREGNANCY
LA  - English
KW  - HEALTH-CARE
KW  - WOMEN
AB  - Background. Persons with disabilities (PWDs) generally face strong discrimination and exclusion, especially with regard to their sexual and reproductive health. There is a prevailing social myth in Ghana that women with disabilities are asexual and cannot experience a positive motherhood experience. Although the World Health Organization recommends that research is conducted in this regard, community attitudes towards pregnant women living with disabilities remain largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to explore community attitudes to pregnancy among women living with disabilities. Methodology. The study design was a mixed method cross-sectional study involving quantitative face-to-face individual interviews with 400 randomly selected community members (both males and females) in three communities in the Adaklu District of Volta Region in Ghana. In addition, in-depth interviews were held with five female PWDs. Simple and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to examine the factors associated with perceptions towards pregnant PWDs. Results. Majority of respondents agreed that pregnant women with disabilities should be kept in special institutions until delivery to prevent transmission of their disability to fetuses of pregnant women without disabilities. People also believed that pregnant PWDs are incapable of a safe motherhood experience. Among the strongly influencing factors for negative attitudes towards pregnancy of PWDs were educational status (p<0.001) and perceptions that the disability is caused by accidents (p<0.001) or spiritual issues (p<0.01). Regarding the relationship between perceived cause of disability and the resultant attitudes, respondents were three times more likely to have negative attitude and perceptions towards pregnant women with disabilities if their causes of disabilities were perceived to be spiritual compared to the cause being medical. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that there are generally negative societal attitudes towards pregnant PWDs. The evidence suggests that a degree of prejudice and misconceptions exists towards the pregnancy of women living with disabilities. Generally, there is a public perception that women living with disabilities cannot have a safe motherhood experience and are capable of transferring their disability to an unborn child of another pregnant woman.

TI  - Censoring Tarzan in Belgium: The Belgian Board of Film Control and the Tarzan films, 1932-1946
T2  - HISTORICAL JOURNAL OF FILM RADIO AND TELEVISION
LA  - English
AB  - In this article we are concerned with how the Hollywood Tarzan productions of the 1930s and 1940s were received in Belgium, a country with a long and troubling history of colonizing. The MGM Tarzan films were hugely popular but they seldom reached Belgian audiences uncut, due to the practices of the Belgian Board of Film Control. Apart from the obvious downside to this practice of mutilating films, there are some more productive sides to this as well. Censorship is also a significant social response to representations, thus making it a fascinating issue for studying a society in flux. From an international perspective, it is interesting to see how particular movies like the MGM Tarzan series have caused troubles with censorship boards or not, and how censorship practices interfere with local societal and political sensibilities. In the Belgian case, Tarzan films have been severely cut because of their violence, but as this article tries to show, not all violence was alike. The persistence with which they cut out violence on whites but made almost no problems over violence on blacks serves as an unwitting testimony of Belgian attitudes and views about colonialism. We use the censorship and newspapers' reception of the six MGM Tarzan productions of the 1930s and early 1940s as an indicator for the dominant colonial and racially prejudiced discourse in Belgium.

AB  - The use of 'neopatrimonialism' as a category in mainstream scholarship on African polities and economies is ubiquitous. A critique by Thandika Mkandawire has shown that the 'neopatrimonial school' is devoid of conceptual coherence and analytical power - it is an expression of a prejudice, not a useful tool for research and analysis. The article endorses Mkandawire's view but points out that this is by no means the only example of its kind. On the contrary, the use of categories which assume the superiority of societies in the global North over those in Africa is widespread. The article illustrates this by discussing and criticising two others, the 'democratic consolidation' paradigm and the 'failed state' framework. It argues that all three shape assumptions by scholars in Africa as well as outside it which obstruct concrete analysis. A critique of these paradigms is thus essential to the development of scholarship on and about Africa.

TI  - Re-thinking "Matriarchy' in Modern Matriarchal Studies using two examples: The Khasi and the Mosuo

AB  - The new field of modern Matriarchal Studies calls non-patriarchal societies "matriarchal." Traditional research on matriarchy is laden with unclear definitions and excessive emotionality. Lacking a clear scientific definition of "matriarchy," the term has been misunderstood as "rule by women," provoking a lasting, ideologically distorted prejudice against it. Modern matriarchal studies reorients the field with precise definitions, an explicit methodology, and a theoretical framework (Introduction). This article argues for the importance of retaining the term "matriarchy" and using a new and adequate structural definition of matriarchal societies to understand their deep structure. My argument derives inductively from my cross-cultural research on existing indigenous societies, emphasizing their economic, social, political, and cultural features. Matriarchies will be shown to be gender-egalitarian and consensus-based societies, actively promoting peace and sustainablity by various well-conceived guidelines (Part 1). A brief description of two such societies follows: the Khasi of Northeastern India and the Mosuo of Southwestern China. The focus is not on their ethnographic similarities and differences, but on what makes them "matriarchies" and how the definition can embrace a certain variety, deepening our understanding of these societies (Part 2). Concluding remarks summarize the preceding discussion and highlight the political relevance of this topic.

AB  - Language teachers ought to give their students a sound grounding in what is known as the five C's-communication, communities, cultures, connections, and comparisons-in addition to the classic four basic language skills. This study examines how first-year Turkish students currently enrolled in a culture course at Giresun University view culture-focused courses, and how much cultural training they had received (if any) in high school prior to entering university. This study is qualitative in nature, and provides information by using multiple sources of data. The fact of the matter is that their high school teachers focused more on grammar and avoided culture due to the constraints of both time and of an exam-oriented education system. Regarding the benefits, the course has pushed them to examine the relationship between language and culture, offered a reason to study the target language, and made the learning process real. It takes patience and effort in order to convince youth of the necessity of languages, as well as to make them better aware of, and to dispel their prejudices towards other cultures. The study also provides recommended practices that can encourage educators to implement during foreign language instruction.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the worldwide lesbian and gay movements have diversified and increased their rights claims. The achievement of gay rights claims in society is the result of an interplay among various social factors and forces. Media is one of most influential players in building homosexual images and promoting mutual understanding. Chinese homosexuals were not treated as criminals or mental illness patients any-more in 1997 and 2001, respectively, after decriminalization and depathologization. Thus this article aims to explore how homosexuals were portrayed in the official media of China, particularly the People's Daily, to illustrate the changing perception of homosexuals in China's political and social spheres. It argues that representation of homosexuals in the People's Daily changed gradually from a negative perception to a more positive one with less discrimination and prejudice as shown by the article's quantitative and qualitative results.

KW  - MARRIAGE
AB  - I critically examine how, from a Western cultural perspective of romantic love and Judeo-Christian tradition, certain liberal cultural values and prejudices are used presumptuously to criticize polygamy in African traditions. These criticisms assume, circularly, the superiority of Western cultural monogamous values over African cultural traditional practice of polygamy. I argue that these arguments are specious and particularly unreasonable from an intercultural philosophical perspective. A plausible liberal justification for Western legal imposition of monogamy is to prevent harm. I argue that if polygamy is so harmful as to warrant legal restriction based on the liberal principle of harm, such harm also exists in monogamy. The harm that is falsely associated with polygamy is not the result of polygamy per se but other factors relating to the social-cultural context of the marriage or the character of the individuals in the marriage.

AB  - Why did lawyers grow sympathetic to revolution in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century? This article addresses this question by examining the legal profession in the Spanish empire. It relies on the work of historians who have analysed the bar in specific places in Iberia and the Americas, as well as additional sources. At the same time, it avoids dividing lawyers into "metropolitan" and "colonial" practitioners, given similarities in legal practice and royal justice in the various crownlands on both sides of the Atlantic. It examines the Bourbon Reforms, the juridical Enlightenment, and social-class origins. It discusses how the onslaught of the French Revolution led Charles IV to sponsor a campaign against lawyers, undermining a relatively harmonious relationship between crown and bar that had existed during the Enlightenment. On the eve of the revolution, many young and entrepreneurial lawyers professed radical ideas about sovereignty, equality, and judicial reform, but faced a saturated profession in which they were prejudiced by royal laws and the recalcitrance of elders. Many came from middle-class backgrounds and represented heterogeneous clienteles. They were eminently familiar with feudal and racial tensions on the eve of the disintegration of the Old Regime.

AB  - This study analyzes social perceptions towards groups with different types of disability, as well as the relationship between the judgments towards these groups, oneself and other significant individuals. The assessment was carried out using a Semantic Differential scale completed by181 participants. Results supported the Stereotype Content Model, as the different groups with disabilities were perceived in a more uniform way than those who did not share this label, and people with intellectual disability elicited paternalistic feelings. The results also support a two-factor model to explore the content of the stereotypes. Understanding the factors that contribute to the formation of social judgments is key to the implementation of actions that modify stereotypes and prejudices and promote equity.

TI  - A critical appraisal of heterosexism in Zambia
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
AB  - On 24 February 2012, then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Zambia for three days. His call to respect human rights and give protection to all people regardless of sexual orientation was received mostly with hostility by the Zambian public. The media was inundated with opposing press statements from both government and civil society persons and entities. Politicians, church leaders, and the public widely condemned Ban's advocacy for gay rights. Although the debate on homosexuality is not new in Zambia, there is a dearth of research on the subject. This paper seeks, modestly, to re-examine popular rationale for heterosexism to contribute to the resolution of one of the perennial problems colouring African political, social, and cultural discourse. By deconstructing the popular views and systematising the debate, the paper aims at providing a baseline and guideline for addressing the problem of heterosexism in Zambia. Without suggesting that Africa is homogenous, what happened in Zambia following Ban's visit could have predictably happened in many African countries, notably Uganda and Nigeria. This paper, however, uses Zambia as a point of reference. The paper relies on views indicating negative attitudes and beliefs that legislators, and policy makers, church leaders and ordinary citizens have toward homosexuality. These positions have been thematised into six major grounds for the sexual prejudices against homosexuality. These are subjected to logical and epistemic scrutiny. Ultimately, the arguments in support of heterosexism are shown to be untenable.

AB  - Despite relatively equal participation rates between females and males in casual gaming, females often report stigmatisation and prejudice towards their gaming competency within this sub-domain. Applying the theoretical framework of "stereotype threat", this research examined the influence of explicit stereotype priming on females' casual gameplay performance and related attitudes. It also investigated whether the gender of the game avatar heightens susceptibility to stereotype threat. One hundred and twenty females were allocated randomly to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 (Condition: Stereotype threat, Control) x 2 (Avatar gender: Feminine, Masculine) between-subjects design. They completed a short gaming task and measures of social identity, competence beliefs, gameplay self efficacy and self-esteem. Findings indicate that priming explicitly a negative gender-related stereotype did not appear to have a significant detrimental impact on gameplay performance or gameplay-related attitudes. Additionally, gameplay performance was not affected significantly by manipulating the gender of the gaming avatar. These findings suggest that, although females appear to be knowledgeable about negative gender-gaming stereotypes, these might not impact performance. Moreover, females tend not to endorse these beliefs as a true reflection of their gaming ability, representing a positive finding in view of the prevailing negative attitudes they face in gaming domains.

AB  - Increasing workforce diversity was found to contribute to the narrowing of disparities in health. However, racism toward ethnic minority health professionals has not been adequately researched. In Israel, public healthcare organizations that serve a mixed Jewish-Arab population employ Arab minority healthcare professionals. Instances of prejudice and manifestations of racism toward them, which frequently surface in public discussion and the media, have unfortunately gained little scholarly attention. We used the intergroup contact approach and the theory of the social process of everyday racism as a theoretical framework. The objective of the research was to study race-based experiences of Israeli Arab healthcare professionals.Methodology: We used a qualitative research method that allows respondents to describe their views, experiences, beliefs and behavior in the way they think about them. During 2013 and 2014 we conducted in-depth interviews with a snowball sample of 10 Arab physicians and 13 Arab nurses who work in Israeli public hospitals. The study protocol was ethically approved.Findings: Interviewees noted institutional efforts to maintain egalitarianism and equality. However, at the micro-level, interviewees, mostly nurses, reported instances that ranged from refusal to accept treatment from an Arab nurse, through verbal abuse, to the use of physical violence against them. At the meso-level, interviewees, mostly physicians, reported experiences of institutional discrimination. At the macro-level, one physician reported policy-related discrimination in the context of the immigration of Russian Jewish physicians to Israel.Conclusions: We recommend combining the intergroup contact approach with the social process theory of racism to examine minorities' subjective perceptions, especially in conflictual and violent contexts; conducting broad-based quantitative research in Israeli healthcare organizations, which may have important implications for the specific strategies to be used; and emphasizing the importance of institutional support. By reconstructing race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals, health organizations can better manage racial situations and reduce their frequency.

AB  - Obesity stigma largely remains a socially acceptable bias with harmful outcomes for its victims. While many accounts have been put forward to explain the bias, the role of obesity etiology beliefs has received little scrutiny. The research examined the effect that beliefs about the psychological etiology of obesity have on the expression of obesity stigma and the mechanisms underpinning this effect. Participants (N=463) were asked to evaluate a target person with obesity after reading one of three possible etiologies: psychological, genetic, or behavioral. The presentation of a psychological etiology of obesity elicited less prejudice compared to behavioral causes but greater prejudice compared to genetic causes; observed differences were found to be a function of the agency ascribed to the target's obesity and empathy expressed for the target. The findings highlight the impact that communicating obesity in terms of psychological causes can have for the expression of obesity stigma.

AB  - This paper describes a programme of research addressing an intriguing inconsistency in research findings about cognitive processes under a high need for cognitive closure (NFC). While early studies demonstrated that individuals who seek closure opt for closed-minded cognitive strategies, a growing body of research has identified a number of circumstances in which individuals who are high in NFC engage in effortful, open-minded information processing to an even greater extent than their low NFC counterparts. This has posed the challenge of delineating the circumstances under which people motivated to reduce uncertainty (i.e., attain closure) engage in effortful and open-minded cognition from those situations in which they rely on simplistic, low-effort strategies. This also calls for theoretical advancement in NFC theory. We discuss our proposed solution to this puzzle and the implications of this model for real-world social phenomena.

KW  - ADULTS
AB  - Laura Makepeace Stephen, Virginia Woolf's half-sister from her father's first marriage, is a figure who has only marginally been discussed in literary criticism. The limited corpus of references that exists on her life and mental health condition gives accounts of idiocy, lunacy, schizophrenia, Asperger's syndrome and sexual abuse. Laura Stephen was probably victim to at times crude Victorian generalisations and misdiagnoses due to limited medical knowledge, poor resources and lack of scientific research and investigation. Her childhood was spent in a familial environment riddled with prejudices and sheer embarrassment about bringing up a child whose development was seen as abnormal. From early adulthood, Laura was sent to a series of mental institutions which simply kept her surviving, alleviating her family's sense of burden, but without any treatment interventions. In this paper, we hypothesise that her condition consisted of an intellectual disability and autism with a co-morbid psychosis. We consider the complexity of Laura Stephen's case by examining a number of aspects including psychological and social dimensions of her life.

AB  - Pursuing economic, environmental and social sustainability requires networks endowed with persistent relationships between stakeholders. Networks serve as the vehicle to coordinate diverse policy goals among stakeholders. Within the networks, stakeholders inevitably experience some level of distrust due to the complexity and uncertainty of the unstructured problems on the sustainability. However, little is known about why stakeholders often distrust with one another in the networks. By analysing a local fracking policy network in NYS, we suggest that distrust is influenced by incongruent ecological worldviews, policy goals incongruence in the triple bottom line of sustainability, characterization framing, policy communications and knowledge exchange.

KW  - colonialism
KW  - dogs
KW  - Doris Lessing
KW  - wildness
AB  - Dogs play an important role in colonial society, especially in Africa. While the project of colonisation involves settling in a new country and confronting wild animals, the dog is one animal on which the settler can rely as an ally, protector and companion. Settler dogs whose breeds stem from Britain are in a sense the animal counterpart of the human settler. When these animals desert their owners either by cross-breeding with indigenous dogs or reverting to the wild, it can seem like a betrayal of their settler owners and of the colonial project. Doris Lessing explores this dilemma in "The Story of Two Dogs" which is a semi-autobiographical story of her family and their dogs. She grew up in the 1930s on a farm in colonial Rhodesia. Lessing creates an ironical narrative voice that undermines colonial discourse and exposes racial and class prejudice among the settler community. Through the lens of the dogs she also draws attention to gender conflict and the subjugation of women in matters of dog training and hunting. In addition, conflict between adults and children is brought out which points to possibilities of a more open approach to the question of dog breeding, training and ownership. She also raises questions about the ultimate nature of the dog and its status as a domesticated animal.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to highlight the importance of organizational culture on the leader's style and the effect of the chosen leadership style on the team's performance. It surveys a strata of leaders from the Middle East in the current turbulent environment.
   Design/methodology/approach A research paper based on a quantitative data collection in the service sector from a large number of stratified sampled firms and respondents.
   Findings The cross-sectional data from 40 service companies reveal some interesting results highlighting the interrelationships between these three variables. The findings suggest that managers need to build on this concept finding in providing further training and development of employees' skills in addition to an organizational culture of acceptance, adaptation and diversity.
   Research limitations/implications Electing to use a specific set of criteria in sampling might have resulted in eliminating a meaningful different direction in the results. Moreover, the size of the survey tool limited the number of variables to test with the study.
   Practical implications A number of implications are worthy of mention. First, devising reward programmes that are fairly attractive to both genders independently of each other should be a managerial priority, along with the creation and development of strong organizational cultures.
   Social implications Finally, a coupled performance and organizational culture of efficiency at the workplace, if not paralleled with a proper leadership style that fosters positive results, will only result in partial improvements in the big organizational picture, resulting in the persistence of the old prejudice and discrimination along the gender and age lines.
   Originality/value The study examines a suggested model in a new environment that is known to be deeply rooted in old-fashioned paternalistic managerial behaviour, and where change, if occurring, is extremely slow to introduce.

AB  - Socio-psychological research has frequently reported low correlations between explicit and implicit attitude measures for a range of socially sensitive topics. There is mounting evidence that implicit and explicit evaluations do not change at the same rate and thus any implicit-explicit attitudinal discrepancy (IED) may indicate attitude change in progress. However, researchers have yet to investigate whether differences between implicit and explicit attitudes towards language use can determine the direction of any language attitude change underway; somewhat surprising given recent evidence indicating that community language attitude change can result in micro-level language change over time. The present study employed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and self-report attitude scale to measure the relationship between 90 English nationals' implicit and explicit ratings of Northern English and Southern English speech in England. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant IED, providing evidence of language attitude change in progress, led by younger females, with explicit attitudes changing more rapidly towards a greater tolerance of the English spoken in the north of England. The paper discusses the potential contribution of investigating implicit and explicit language attitudes to help account for the persistence of deeply embedded linguistic prejudice, as well as to measure language attitude change in progress.

AB  - The deployment, reversal and reiteration of stereotypes constitute one of the major comic devices of the top three French box-office comedy hits' of recent years: Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis (2008), Intouchables (2011), Qu'est-ce qu'on a fait au Bon Dieu ? (2014). These comedies follow the same pattern: their contrasting protagonists, in terms of class, regional origin or ethnicity, manage to forget their prejudices and to become friends' in the classic tradition of a feel-good film. Although age-old, this scheme is rejuvenated by issues of ethnicity, in a contemporary French context characterised by the transformation of French society into a multicultural and multi-ethnic society, by the resistance to that transformation and by the emergence on the big screen of ethnic actors. This article examines how the use of stereotypes, in films that claim to promote alterity and diversity, turns out to be extremely ambiguous. It demonstrates how these narratives, whether they challenge or reiterate prejudiced notions of ethnic and regional identity, leave gender roles and class domination unquestioned. Finally, it casts light on elements that may challenge the reactionary aspects of the plot and characterisation, such as the performance of the actors and the opening up of mainstream French comedy to minorities.

AB  - The works of Rudyard Kipling, the first and the youngest, Doris Lessing the last and the oldest and at the same time the only female author and John Galsworthy the only lawyer-novelist Nobel Prize winners of Britain are critically analysed in this paper to investigate the common core of the literary nobility of their selected works, The Jungle Books, The Good Terrorist and The Forsyte Saga respectively. This paper also intends to find the noble literary quality of the aforementioned works which made them worthy of Nobel Prize in literature. At the turn of the 20th century, Alfred Nobel, in his will, decided to found an organization in order to cherish scholars and scientists who have done significant activities in their fields. To nobody's surprise, he included literature as one of the fields worthy of the reward, being immensely interested in literature himself. It is imperative to point out that firstly, the researcher's examination of the Nobel laureates is narrowed down to novelists and secondly, they are chosen to cover different periods of the life of the Nobel Prize, having in mind that the history of the Nobel Prize is divided into different periods by literary commentators concerned with the Nobel Prize and its standards according to the approaches taken for choosing the winners in each phase. Covering different periods of the history of the Nobel Prize, it appears that some other non-literary factors may have played a significant role in choosing the winners. On the one hand, there have been writers who won the Noble Prize due to political prejudices of the Academy like Kipling; on the other hand, writers like Galsworthy and Lessing seem to have benefited from this approach of the Nobel Academy. Galsworthy, striving to give voice to the other silent part of society and suppressed writers and Lessing, a constant supporter of the change and improvement in the condition of women, were involved in some political issues in attempts to bring into light political and social flaws of society and political system.

KW  - philosophy of science
AB  - This article addresses the fraught question of "decolonisation" at South African universities-what does it mean when students and some academic staff members call for the decolonisation of the curriculum? The issue of legitimate participation in the debate is raised, as well as that of the "incommensurability thesis"-the claim that individuals working within a certain "paradigmatically distinct" theory or within an identifiable discourse, cannot understand those working within other theoretical paradigms, and therefore thwart discussion between pro-decolonisers and those who oppose it. The consideration that, regardless of culture, or race, or gender, all human subjects are linguistic beings, is related to the mutual translatability of languages, and the notion of always being embedded in a cultural life-world. Instead of remaining relativistically imprisoned in the latter, it is argued that the sciences afford people the opportunity to step away from their involvement in this life-world, with its cultural prejudices, to meet one another through a shared terminology and conceptual or theoretical apparatus that enable one to understand the (natural and social) world in a manner that allows intersubjective understanding. The point is made that, for something to be scientific (or "rational"), any human being should be able to "test" or examine, or simply enter into a (sometimes difficult) dialogue about it. Unless these issues are kept in mind, one cannot even begin to discuss the merits of the demand for decolonisation. It is acknowledged, however, that there are "knowledges" that have been (unjustifiably) "disqualified" by Western culture as being "inadequate" in terms of "scientific cognition." For this reason it is argued that every scholar, scientist or philosopher must be willing to see beyond the confines of privileged Western knowledge to acknowledge these "excluded knowledges" and to affirm that they are epistemic "equals" of, albeit different from, Western knowledge.

AB  - Despite having outlawed the caste system and the concept of untouchability in 1947, caste identity remains a cornerstone of social, political and economic life in India. Like other social institutions, educational institutions are the reflection of caste prejudices and discrimination. The recent inclusion of lower castes through the reservation system (affirmative action) has changed the nature of higher education. Based on an ethnographic account of a university campus and students' perceptions about caste issues, the authors suggest that the structure of higher education in India is designed in a manner that exacerbates, instead of ameliorates, tensions of class and caste. Using Bourdieu's notion of cultural capital, the paper defines the existing campus culture as a 'caste culture'. The text concludes that elite institutions do not yet guarantee the capability to overcome existing caste prejudices and stereotypes, regardless of structural attempts at reform.

AB  - Reasoning is a fundamental human ability, vulnerable to error. According to behavioural measures, we are biased to consider valid the conclusion of an argument based on the veracity of the conclusion itself rather than on the formal logic of the argument. Nowadays, brain imaging techniques can be used to explore peoples responses as they reason with linguistic materials. Using the Event-Related Potential technique in a categorical syllogism reading task, an N400 enhancement was found for the processing of invalid conclusions preceded by true premises (e.g. All men are mortal). By contrast, when initial premises consisted of socially prejudiced statements previously rated as false (e.g. All blond girls are dumb), valid rather than invalid conclusions enhanced the N400 response. Considering what the modulation of N400 indexes (i.e. word anticipation processes), our data suggests that people cannot follow the logic of an argument to anticipate upcoming words if they clash with veracity.

TI  - Austen Approved: Pemberley Digital and the Transmedia Commodification of Jane Austen
T2  - WOMENS WRITING
LA  - English
AB  - The web video production company Pemberley Digital is most notable for their YouTube adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, the internet sensation The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Pemberley Digital specialises in the creation of transmedia adaptations of texts, with content stretching across a variety of platforms. However, their 2013-2014 adaptation of Emma, Emma Approved, is, by Pemberley Digital's own admission, the company's boldest experiment with the commodification potential of Jane Austen's novels. Emma Approved played out over five platforms: video, blog posts, photographs, social media and music. After watching the videos, viewers are encouraged to click on links to purchase the clothes worn, or technological devices used by, the characters, incorporating product placement and advertorial into the text of Emma Approved. Pemberley Digital's unique transmedia adaptation is a distinctly twenty-first century manifestation of Jane Austen's afterlife: one that privileges a multi-dimensional, interactive bite-sized experience of texts, and one that seeks to transform the cultural capital associated with Austen into profit. The texts are rendered malleable to a transmedia storytelling mode across multiple digital platforms. The Pemberley Digital productions of Pride and Prejudice and Emma speak to the twenty- and twenty-first century's impulse to turn Jane Austen into a marketable, profitable commodity.

TI  - The recovery of natural environments in architecture: Delivering the recovery
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
LA  - English
KW  - CULTURE
AB  - A radical return to natural environments in public architecture is proposed. This requires a reasonably sophisticated understanding of building physics on the part of designers but there is a marked reluctance historically in the design community to acquire such expertise for fear of destroying free artistic expression. This anti-scientific social practice may be the principle barrier to a sustainable future for the built world. The key to unravelling this prejudice may lie in understanding how modern perceptions of safe and comfortable environments evolved through early understanding of disease propogation through the air. The paper presents innovative later nineteenth century hospital designs as proto-modern buildings and suggests that aggressive mid-Twentieth Century advertising of air conditioning killed a highly productive stream of architectural design, overdue for vigorous re-examination to shift the prevailing 'will to form'.

AB  - This essay explores an aspect of a narrative genre, kiosk literature, which has received very little critical attention in Spanish cultural studies, even though it was an extremely popular form of expression. The dimension of this genre (or sub-genre) that I propose to study is anarchist mass-produced fiction as a manifestation of the discourses of modernity in Silver Age Spain. Considering the notion that modernity is characterized by its manifold and contradictory responses to social change, my essay investigates the ways in which mass-produced anarchist short novels both subverted and perpetuated the economic, political, and gender hierarchies of their day. Specifically, I examine the narrative tensions and contradictions arising in the representation of the urban working woman in La aventurera (1935) by Federico Urales and Una mujer y dos hombres (1932) by Federica Montseny. My analysis reveals that, while these short narratives propose the sexually liberated female professional as a model of social modernity and progress, this representation also perpetuates the very gender and class prejudices that these freethinkers purported to overcome. RESUMENEste ensayo explora un genero narrativo, la literatura de kiosco, que ha recibido escasa atencion en los estudios culturales espanoles, a pesar de haber sido una forma de expresion cultural enormemente popular. El aspecto de este genero (o subgenero) que propongo estudiar es la literatura de ficcion anarquista popular como una manifestacion de los discursos de la modernidad en la Espana de la Edad de Plata. Considerando que el concepto de modernidad se caracteriza por sus respuestas multiples y contradictorias al cambio social, mi ensayo investiga las maneras en las que las novelas cortas anarquistas producidas en masa subvertian y perpetuaban al mismo tiempo las jerarquias economicas, politicas y de genero sexual predominantes. Especificamente, examino las contradicciones y tensiones narrativas que surgen en la representacion de la mujer trabajadora urbana en La aventurera (1935) de Federico Urales and Una mujer y dos hombres (1932) de Federica Montseny. Mi analisis revela que, mientras que estas narraciones cortas proponen a la mujer profesional liberada sexualmente como modelo de modernidad y progreso social, su representacion tambien perpetua los mismos prejuicios de clase y genero que estos librepensadores pretendian superar.

AB  - The paper deals with the linguistic representation of the idea of political correctness. Political correctness has two dimensions that are interrelated and indivisible - the former relates to the social public relations and treatment of people without prejudice and without discrimination, while the latter refers to linguistic expression of this attitude, with lexical stock and scope of the vocabulary, which is also called politically correct language. We study the history of the idea of political correctness as a social movement and as language restrictions. Various views are presented - from insincerity, hypocrisy to restriction of hate speech.

AB  - Researchers have recently begun to examine how categorization processes impact social evaluations. In two studies, we examined how sex categorization influences attitudes toward transgender individuals. We found that people evaluated transgender individuals more negatively if they possessed physically androgynous (vs. sex-typical) characteristics because they struggled to identify their sex. These relationships were stronger among political conservatives compared to individuals with more liberal political views. These findings provide new insights for research on attitudes toward gender minorities and for the role of political ideology in social judgments.

KW  - AGEISM
AB  - Background: Through the concept of ageism, we highlight and explain how the society prejudices the elderly. WHO classifies 12 most common stereotypes pertaining to old age. Elderly people are being excluded from social life due to their chronological age rather than any actual reduced physical and/or mental ability. Some of these stereotypes are directly related to the (un)willingness and the ability of the elderly to use technology in everyday life.
   Objectives: The study presented in this article aims to explain the phenomenon of technology use among elderly people who had had a stroke.
   Method: A qualitative study, namely a qualitative content analysis, was performed. Six in-depth interviews with older people who have suffered a stroke were conducted and explored their views on the daily use of technology.
   Results: All older people included in this study used different technologies, which have been divided into technologies that support mobility, technologies for personal care, technologies that support household chores, and technologies for maintaining a social network. An elderly person's attitude toward the use of technology is connected to their social network and assistance from professional staff, as well as the severity of their physical disability. We have found that using various technologies, elderly people are developing various coping strategies.
   Conclusions: After a stroke, a certain degree of physical deterioration can be expected. Nonetheless, our participants managed to compensate for this also with the help of assistive devices and technologies, which negates the myth of simply surrendering to the aging process.

T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - linguistic attitude of young people
KW  - Telugu
KW  - Lambadi language
AB  - Introduction: Lambadi is an Indo-Aryan language of the Lambada community, which is essentially script-less, and is bound to be expressed in the scripts of host languages like Telugu, Marathi, Hindi, etc. In the proposed study we intend to understand the language attitudes of youths of the Lambadi community towards their mother-tongue with respect to dominating language "Telugu". Many linguists have established the fact that the language loss occurs predominantly when young people start to adopt a new language which can lead to behavioural consequences like prejudices towards their own language causing inhibitions in social interaction with the people of their own community [1].The youth in this study is defined as young people belonging to the age group of 20-30 years of either gender. The study is to be performed among the young people of Lambada community who have migrated from their Home-town of Nalgonda district to a metropolitan like Hyderabad. The study hypothesizes that there exists a certain change in the attitudes of the youth towards their mother tongue as they come in contact with the dominating language Telugu.
   Objective: the aim of this article is to understand the level of change in attitudes among urban Lambada youths and its consequences on their mother tongue.
   Research materials: the article is a qualitative approach with the methodology adopted is in depth interviews including probes like- "perception on the adequacy of Lambadi language use in the context of Hyderabad", "Relevancy of Lambadi language in gaining employment", "religious sentiments attached towards the Lambadi", "Stigma related to usage of Lambadi language among Telugu language speakers" etc.
   Results and novelty of the research: the study is expected to understanding of an interesting phenomenon of Language attitude change among Lambadi speakers eventually leading to indentify methods to curb its repercussions on Lambadi language. Dravidian languages are majorly spoken in south India and to which Telugu language belongs and Finno-Ugric languages in this context. The present study would also contribute to the further understanding of such genetic relationship which has also established in Linguistics.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the mechanisms underlying hiring discrimination against transgender women.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct a scenario experiment in which fictitious hiring decisions are made about transgender or cisgender female job candidates. In addition, these candidates are scored on statements related to theoretical reasons for hiring discrimination given in the literature. The resulting data are analysed by means of a multiple mediation model.
   Findings The results suggest that prejudices with respect to the health of transgender individuals mediate unfavourable treatment of them. However, this mechanism is compensated by a beneficial perception concerning transgender women's autonomy and assertiveness.
   Social implications Targeted policy measures are needed given the substantial labour market discrimination against transgender individuals measured in former studies. However, to combat this discrimination effectively, one needs to understand its underlying mechanisms. This study provides a first exploration of these mechanisms.
   Originality/value This study innovates in being the first to explore the relative empirical importance of dominant (theoretical) explanations for hiring discrimination against transgender women. Thereby, the authors take the logical next step in the literature on labour market discrimination against transgender individuals.

AB  - Introduction Zoonotic and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) represent a public health threat that has been acknowledged only recently although they have been on the rise for the past several decades. On an average, every year since the Second World War, one pathogen has emerged or re-emerged on a global scale. Low/middleincome countries such as India bear a significant burden of zoonotic and EIDs. We propose that the creation of a database of published, peer-reviewed research will open up avenues for evidence-based policymaking for targeted prevention and control of zoonoses.
   Methods and analysis A large-scale systematic mapping of the published peer-reviewed research conducted in India will be undertaken. All published research will be included in the database, without any prejudice for quality screening, to broaden the scope of included studies. Structured search strategies will be developed for priority zoonotic diseases (leptospirosis, rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, cysticercosis, salmonellosis, bovine tuberculosis, Japanese encephalitis and rickettsial infections), and multiple databases will be searched for studies conducted in India. The database will be managed and hosted on a cloud-based platform called Rayyan. Individual studies will be tagged based on key preidentified parameters (disease, study design, study type, location, randomisation status and interventions, host involvement and others, as applicable).
   Ethics and dissemination The database will incorporate already published studies, obviating the need for additional ethical clearances. The database will be made available online, and in collaboration with multisectoral teams, domains of enquiries will be identified and subsequent research questions will be raised. The database will be queried for these and resulting evidence will be analysed and published in peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - Objective: Fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair (FB-EVAR) is a valid option to treat juxtarenal and pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Because successful deployment depends on complex maneuvers, hostile iliac artery anatomy (HIA) can prejudice the FB-EVAR outcome. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of HIA on FB-EVAR outcome.
   Methods: Between 2010 and 2015, all patients undergoing FB-EVAR were prospectively categorized according to iliac anatomy (friendly iliac artery anatomy [FIA] or HIA). HIA was defined as the presence of one of the following: severe (>90-degree) iliac angle, extensive (>50%) iliac circumferential calcification, hemodynamic iliac stenosis or obstruction, external iliac artery diameter <7 mm, or previous aortoiliac/femoral graft. Early end points were technical success (absence of type I or type III endoleak, target visceral vessel [TVV] loss, conversion to open repair), intraoperative adjunctive maneuvers (IAMB; iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting, surgical iliac conduit, intra-aortic graft rotations, several attempts of TVV cannulation), intraoperative technical problems (iliac rupture, significant endograft twisting, difficult TVV cannulations, TVV injuries, TVV loss), and 30-day mortality. Follow-up end points were survival, TVV patency, and freedom from reintervention.
   Results: Ninety-four patients (male, 87%; age, 73 6 years) with 59 (63%) juxtarenal and pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms and 35 (37%) thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms underwent FB-EVAR, for a total of 324 TVVs; 60 (64%) patients had HIA and 34 (36%) had FIA. Patients with HIA and FIA had similar preoperative clinical characteristics, except for coronary artery disease, peripheral artery occlusive disease, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (47% vs 24% [P = .031,12% vs 0% [P = .04], and 28% vs 9% [P = .03], respectively). Technical success was 96% (H IA, 97%; FIA, 95%; P =.6). In HIA, adjunctive iliac procedures were performed in 32 cases (surgical conduit, 14 [15%]; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting, 27 [29%]). Endograft twisting and difficult TVV cannulation occurred in 13 (14%) and 33 (35%) cases, respectively (HIA 18% vs FIA 15% [ P= .09]; HIA 28% vs FIA 21% [P = .03]). TVV cannulation failed in nine cases and injury occurred in five (TVV patency rate, 97.8%; HIA 94.7% vs FIA 98.3%; P = .3). One (1%) iliac rupture occurred in HIA, needing surgical repair. Overall, 44 (47%; HIA 55% vs FIA 25%; P = .03) IAMB were necessary. Perioperative mortality was 4% (HIA 3% vs FIA 5%; P =.9). At multivariate analysis, predictors of IAMB were external iliac diameter <7 mm (odds ratio [OR], 12.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-71.4; P =.004) and extensive iliac calcifications (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 1.4-50.0; P =.02). The mean follow-up was 24 17 months, with an overall survival of 87% and 71% at 1 year and 3 years, respectively, significantly lower in HIA compared with FIA (at 3 years, HIA 60% vs FIA 92%; P =.02). On multivariate analysis, H IA was a significant predictor of late mortality (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.1-13.2; P =.04). Freedom from reintervention (87%) and 3 -year TVV patency (92%) were similar in the two groups.
   Conclusions: HIA does not significantly affect the early outcome of FB-EVAR. However, in patients with HIA, procedures are technically more demanding and late mortality is increased. Iliac characteristics should be taken into account to correctly stratify the surgical risk in FB-EVAR.

AB  - Poverty is a well-known short-term outcome of migration in general and a long-term outcome of forced migration in a global context. Surprisingly, this outcome appears among refugees in welfare states which provide various asylum and social policies facilitating integration. The article aims to explore the relationship between asylum and social policies and poverty among refugees. The research results are drawn from two studies conducted among refugees, NGOs, national and local administration representatives, and case workers in Poland between 2006 and 2014. The results show that asylum policy contributes to the material and symbolic hardship experienced by refugees, and social policy is ineffective in its prevention. If refugees are settled in regions with high levels of poverty, unemployment and ethnic-based prejudices, then they experience and continue to live in poverty. In such a context, and due to its weaknesses in addressing discrimination, social policy cannot successfully integrate refugees.

AB  - Moral exclusion is defined as viewing others as lying beyond the boundary within which moral values and rules of justice apply. In contrast, the process of moral inclusion involves the extension of social justice to several social groups. Thus, both moral inclusion and exclusion are a pivotal dimension in the study of social inequalities. Although the concept of moral inclusion/exclusion has a history of more than 20 years, research still lacks accurate instruments for measuring it. In this article, a first version of a scale that measures moral inclusion/exclusion was constructed and validated. The good reliability and correlation indexes found across the samples suggest that MIEG is a good measure for tapping into moral exclusion/inclusion symptoms.

AB  - Purpose: Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) persons have routinely experienced high rates of violence and discrimination. Discrimination in healthcare can affect the ability of TGNC persons to age successfully as it often deters them from seeking care. The purpose of this study was to determine if anticipation of bias from healthcare professionals, as well as other variables, predicted perceived successful aging in a sample of TGNC adults.
   Methods: A total of 384 (of the original 1963) participants older than 50 years completed the relevant parts of an 83-item online survey as part of the Trans MetLife Survey on Later-Life Preparedness and Perceptions in Transgender-Identified Individuals.
   Results: Larger social support networks and higher levels of confidence that a healthcare professional will treat them with dignity and respect as a TGNC person at the end of their life were associated with increased odds of perceiving that they were aging successfully.
   Conclusion: With high rates of discrimination and prejudice toward TGNC persons in various contexts (e.g., healthcare, education, and housing), it is imperative that practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and institutions work together to eradicate healthcare disparities, promote social change, and support an environment that encourages successful aging. This calls for a coordinated, proactive outreach effort to put trust back into a system that has historically let down an entire subset of the population.

AB  - The African-born population in the United States is now the immigrant group growing at the fastest rate, yet African immigrants are often overlooked in studies of immigrant incorporation and social adjustment. One factor negatively impacting immigrant adjustment is a lack of congruence between pre-migration expectations and post-migration realities. Existing academic literature on this topic largely overlooks African immigrants with the exception of refugees, and current studies of Liberians in the United States also focus overwhelmingly on refugees. This article reorients the discussion of African immigrant incorporation by exploring such issues with a sample of Liberian immigrants in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area who arrived with a range of visa types. Using the results of five focus groups (N = 31), I outline shared unrealistic expectations of abundant wealth and development, an easier life, and Americans having extensive knowledge about Africa. I also examine often unanticipated challenges such as communication issues, negative interactions (including racism and African origin prejudice), cultural differences, problems finding jobs and adjusting to American work culture, and high expectations from home, including remittances. The results suggest that non-refugee immigrants face many of the same challenges as refugees and can benefit from information and resources fostering more successful integration.

AB  - It is well supported that intergroup contact reduces prejudice and that positive contact can increase trust and improve attitudes between groups in conflict. In segregated societies, however, contact is often difficult or undesirable when political parties or institutions obstruct interactions contact. Therefore, when contact does occur it is vital that it is of positive quality that could potentially lead to increased intentions for further contact, as a way of facilitating sustained contact, desegregation and promoting peace. With this in mind, the present article examines intergroup contact, intergroup trust, and future contact intentions in 2 conflict settings; Cyprus and Northern Ireland. Participants took part in an online survey that asked them to report on their contact experiences, intergroup trust, outgroup evaluation, and future contact intentions. Separate models are tested for Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland (n = 268) and for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus (n = 408). As expected, participants from Northern Ireland experienced more and better quality contact compared with participants from Cyprus. For Protestants, Catholics, and Greek Cypriots, results show that quality of contact, above quantity of contact, predicts future contact intentions, and improved attitudes through the mediation of intergroup trust. For Turkish Cypriots, contact quality additionally directly predicted outgroup evaluation without necessarily increasing trust. We argue that positive contact is an important route for promoting desegregation in societies with high residential segregation but that it is vital to understand contextual and group status when understanding these relationships.

AB  - Social psychological research has distinguished between ethnic and civic conceptions of citizenship and examined the differential associations of these conceptions with perceived out-group competition and threats to explain attitudes towards immigrants. In contrast, the current study examines two dimensions of group indispensability: functional indispensability and identity indispensability. In a survey study conducted among a national sample of native Dutch we found that the endorsement of ethnic citizenship is related to weaker support for immigrants' social rights because of a lower sense of functional indispensability and of identity indispensability. In contrast, the endorsement of civic citizenship was associated with higher acceptance of immigrant rights because of a stronger sense of functional and identity indispensability of immigrants.

AB  - This article provides a review of sexualities scholarship within the social sciences between 1970 and 2015. It takes an innovative approach by focusing on the way in which bisexuality is addressed in this body of literature. The article reveals the marginalisation, under-representation and invisibility of bisexuality within and across the social sciences in relation to both bisexual experience and identity. Reasons for this varied across the different eras, including the heterosexist nature of the literature, the impact of gay and lesbian-focused identity politics, and queer deconstructionism. In addition, patterns of bisexual erasure and invisibility were uneven, with some scholarship taking inclusive approaches or criticising prejudice against bisexuality. The initial findings of the review were enriched by critical commentary from key relevant sociologists and political scientists. The article concludes that future sexualities scholarship could be enhanced by greater consideration of bisexuality.

AB  - Aim: This paper sheds light on the context that leads some querulous patients to self-immolate in front of, or into, public buildings (e.g., tribunals, city halls, and employment agencies).
   Method: The author defines paranoid querulousness. A psychoanalytic perspective, but also a judicial and a psychiatric point of view, over querulous claimants is presented. The links between political or social claims and self-immolation are studied. The expression of suicidal thoughts voiced by four querulous subjects is analyzed. Eight examples of self-immolation are presented.
   Results: The querulous subjects' self-aggressive behaviors seem to be caused by a loss of hope to obtain compensation for a prejudice they allegedly suffered. Querulous individuals tend to self-immolate in front of, or into, public buildings when no answer is given to their claims. These gestures may be both a consequence of some personal distress and triggered by a difficult social or professional context.
   Discussion: Five sets of assumptions derived from Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalytic theories are advanced. The status of the object over which the querulous claimants wish to assert their rights is clarified. The meaning of self-aggressive gestures is outlined by making reference to the concepts of instinct for mastery, symbolic other, chain of signifiers, masochism, pleasure principle, and reality principle.
   Conclusion: Prevention of self-immolation could involve that members of the legal professions, social workers, civil servants, and mental health professionals in contact with querulous subjects openly show their will to listen to these claimants' voice: self-aggressive gestures might be avoided by supporting the querulous person's hope to obtain compensation for the prejudice allegedly suffered.

AB  - Between 1906 and 1920, eight of the most prominent Black Greek-letter organizations were established. The creation of the Black fraternity had a dual purpose. First, these organizations were established for the greater purpose of pooling the resources of African Americans in the hopes of acquiring an education. Second, these organizations were formed as an attempt by Black students to gain acceptance into American society. Black Greek-letter organizations are some of the most influential organizations in the country. Collectively, these organizations claim approximately 800,000 members, with many coming from the social elite of Black culture. Despite the great influence and vast membership that these organizations possess, the activities of the Black Greek-letter organization have included secret meetings, selective membership, and a preference for lighter-complexioned members. Moreover, the failure and shortcomings of the Black Greek-letter organization have allowed Black elites to create a separate privileged society based on snobbery and arrogance and have thus enabled these organizations to perpetuate the vicious cycle of racial prejudice and White supremacy.

AB  - A growing body of research connects diversity to anti-welfare attitudes and lower levels of social welfare expenditure, yet most evidence comes from analyses of US states or comparisons of the United States to Europe. Comparative analyses of European nation-states, however, yield little evidence that immigration - measured at the country-level - reduces support for national welfare state programs. This is not surprising, given that research suggests that the impact of diversity occurs at smaller, sub-national geographic units. Therefore, in this article, we test the hypothesis that immigration undermines welfare attitudes by assessing the impact of immigration measured at the regional-level on individual-level support for redistribution, a comprehensive welfare state, and immigrants' social rights. To do this, we combine data from the European Social Survey with a unique regional dataset compiled from national censuses, Eurostat, and the European Election Database (13 countries, 114 regions, and 23,213 individuals). Utilizing multilevel modeling, we find a negative relationship between regional percent foreign-born and support for redistribution as well as between regional percent foreign-born and support for a comprehensive welfare state. Objective immigration, however, does not increase opposition to immigrants' social rights (i.e. welfare chauvinism). We discuss the implications of these results and conclude that traditional welfare state attitudes and welfare chauvinism are distinct phenomena that should not be conflated in future research.

AB  - The idea of the moral circle pictures the self in the center, surrounded by concentric circles encompassing increasingly distant possible targets of moral concern, including family, local community, nation, all humans, all mammals, all living things including plants, and all things including inanimate objects. The authors develop the idea of two opposing forces in people's moral circles, with centripetal forces pulling inward, urging greater concern for close others than for distant others, and centrifugal forces pushing outward, resisting "drawing the line" anywhere as a form of prejudice and urging egalitarian concern for all regardless of social distance. Review of the developmental literature shows very early emergence of both moral forces, suggesting at least partly intuitive bases for each. Moral education approaches favoring one force over the other are compared, to show how these forces can provide constraints on moral learning. Finally, the centripetal/centrifugal forces view is applied to current moral debates about empathy and about politics. The authors argue that this view helps us see how intercultural and interpersonal disagreements about morality are based in intrapersonal conflicts shared by all people. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previous studies suggest that members of sexual minority groups have poorer access to health services than heterosexuals. However, few studies have examined how sexual orientation interacts with gender and race to affect health care experience. Moreover, little is known about the role in health care disparities played by economic strains such as unemployment and poverty, which may result from prejudice and discrimination based on sexual orientation. Using data for 2013-15 from the National Health Interview Survey, we found that most members of sexual minority groups no longer have higher uninsurance rates than heterosexuals, but many continue to experience poorer access to high-quality care. Gay nonwhite men, bisexual white women, and bisexual and lesbian nonwhite women are disadvantaged in multiple aspects of access, compared to straight white men. Only some of these disparities are attributable to economic factors, which implies that noneconomic barriers to care are substantial. Our results suggest that the intersection of multiple social identities can reveal important gaps in health care experience. Making culturally sensitive services available may be key to closing the gaps.

AB  - This article considers the unexplored and interrelated motifs of female employment and domestic violence in Carmen Laforet's 1945 novel, Nada. The voyeuristic gaze of the main protagonist, Andrea, renders an intimate and sustained portrait of the inversion of gender roles in a postwar marriage in which the wife, Gloria, is the breadwinner and the husband, Juan, is both traumatized and poverty-stricken. My analysis is three-fold, centring primarily on Juan's inadequate masculinity, Gloria's economic power and her forms of resistance. My article reconceives Laforet's treatment of gender by illuminating the under-studied categories of the traumatized male and the working woman in the postwar period. This article will also consider Laforet's investment in this reconstruction of postwar gender archetypes, seeking to ascertain whether the representation of Gloria and Juan is a critical response to, and undoing of, prejudicial social and gendered practices, or whether remnants of those very same biases underlie this representation.

KW  - Black Greek-letter organization
AB  - Between 1906 and 1920, eight of the most prominent Black Greek-letter organizations were established. The creation of the Black fraternity had a dual purpose. First, these organizations were established for the greater purpose of pooling the resources of African Americans in the hopes of acquiring an education. Second, these organizations were formed as an attempt by Black students to gain acceptance into American society. Black Greek-letter organizations are some of the most influential organizations in the country. Collectively, these organizations claim approximately 800,000 members, with many coming from the social elite of Black culture. Despite the great influence and vast membership that these organizations possess, the activities of the Black Greek-letter organization have included secret meetings, selective membership, and a preference for lighter complexioned members. Moreover, the failure and shortcomings of the Black Greek-letter organization have allowed Black elites to create a separate privileged society based on snobbery and arrogance and have thus enabled these organizations to perpetuate the vicious cycle of racial prejudice and White supremacy.

AB  - A science of groups needs to take different levels of analysis into account since only multilevel perspectives provide a full and realistic picture of processes within and between social groups. A multilevel perspective, however, requires appropriate statistical models. Conventional multilevel regression models suffer from a number of limitations. Among these are the restriction to include only manifest variables and only one Level 1 outcome variable. Moreover, it is not possible to test complex models (i.e., with multiple mediators and outcomes in a single step). In this paper, we introduce multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) as a new and promising development within psychological methods that helps overcome the limitations inherent in conventional MLM. MSEM combines SEM with MLM and offers the best of both worlds. Because MSEM allows using latent instead of manifest variables, measurement error can be taken into account. Moreover, the measurement model can be tested on both the within and between-levels of analysis. MSEM enables researchers to specify Level 2 outcome variables and allows the researcher to test complex multilevel models (i.e., simultaneous tests of multiple direct and indirect effects). We illustrate the potential of MSEM using three examples from our own research, provide the corresponding software code as online supplementary material, and discuss important practical issues.

AB  - Background and aims: Few studies have examined the stigma of problem gambling and little is known about those who internalize this prejudice as damaging self-stigma. This paper aimed to identify psychological factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and coping mechanisms associated with the self-stigma of problem gambling. Methods: An online survey was conducted on 177 Australian adults with a current gambling problem to measure self-stigma, self-esteem, social anxiety, self-consciousness, psychological distress, symptom severity, most problematic gambling form, stigma coping mechanisms, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: All variables significantly correlated with self-stigma were considered for inclusion in a regression model. A multivariate linear regression indicated that higher levels of self-stigma were associated with: being female, being older, lower self-esteem, higher problem gambling severity score, and greater use of secrecy (standardized coefficients: 0.16, 0.14, -0.33, 0.23, and 0.15, respectively). Strongest predictors in the model were self-esteem, followed by symptom severity score. Together, predictors in the model accounted for 38.9% of the variance in self-stigma. Discussion and conclusions: These results suggest that the self-stigma of problem gambling may be driven by similar mechanisms as the self-stigma of other mental health disorders, and impact similarly on self-esteem and coping. Thus, self-stigma reduction initiatives used for other mental health conditions may be effective for problem gambling. In contrast, however, the self-stigma of problem gambling increased with female gender and older age, which are associated with gaming machine problems. This group should, therefore, be a target population for efforts to reduce or better cope with the self-stigma of problem gambling.

AB  - Living in a small southern town, my narrative performance explores the anger, pain, and, at times, privilege of isolation when not having a queer community with whom to publicly mourn following the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Complicating this further is my dissonance as to whether or not the Orlando Latinx community is, in fact, my community at all to mourn. When finally finding and attending a vigil a town away, my identity as a queer femme woman was pushed to the side to make way for anti-second-amendment speeches, a political campaign opportunity, and a Muslim man trying to prevent Islamophobia. Weaving the metaphor of the brewing storm with my narrative of the problematics of small town advocacy, what unfolds is a collision of my identities crashing into my prejudicial thoughts and ideas, despite espousing "good liberal," antiracist, and intersectional politics. Ending with more questions than answers, I narrate the ways in which difference is erased in my small town, and yet, how simultaneously those of us fighting for social justice learn to negotiate challenges together, forging coalitions between people of differences.

AB  - For centuries several hypotheses were formulated on cancer's pathogenesis such as contagiousness, melancholy, heredity and sexuality. In the 18th and 19th century, despite the advent of medical thought and practice, cancer was considered an incurable and contagious disease. Hospitals were refusing to treat cancer patients while the social stigma which followed the disease made primordial the need for the establishment of special institutions. In our article we will present the cancer asylums which counterbalanced the prejudices of the time and contributed to the establishment of modern cancer hospitals.

AB  - In many parts of the world, groundwater users regularly face serious resource-depletion threat. At the same time, "groundwater overexploitation" is massively cited when discussing groundwater management problems. A kind of standard definition tends to relegate groundwater overexploitation only as a matter of inputs and outputs. However, a thorough state-of-the-art analysis shows that groundwater overexploitation is not only a matter of hydrogeology but also a qualification of exploitation based on political, social, technical, economic or environmental criteria. Thus, an aquifer with no threat to groundwater storage can rightly be considered as overexploited because of many other prejudicial aspects. So, why is groundwater overexploitation so frequently only associated with resource-depletion threat and so rarely related to other prejudicial aspects? In that case, what really lies behind the use of the overexploitation concept? The case of the Kairouan plain aquifer in central Tunisia was used to analyze the way that the overexploitation message emerges in a given context, how groundwater-use stakeholders (farmers, management agencies and scientists) each qualify the problem in their own way, and how they see themselves with regard to the concept of overexploitation. The analysis shows that focusing messages on overexploitation conceals the problems encountered by the various stakeholders: difficulties accessing water, problems for the authorities in controlling the territory and individual practices, and complications for scientists when qualifying hydrological situations. The solutions put forward to manage overexploitation are at odds with the problems that arise locally, triggering tensions and leading to misunderstandings between the parties involved.

AB  - Objective: Individuals with mental illnesses have been reported to face prejudices and stigmatization by the society. It has been suggested that language and expressions have a place in stigmatization and emphasized that mental health professionals have a great responsibility to fight against stigmatization. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the use of labeling and stigmatizing language for mental illnesses among mental health professionals as well as their beliefs regarding mental illnesses.
   Method: Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, a questionnaire about the use of stigmatizing language for mental illnesses and the beliefs toward Mental Illness Scale.
   Results: A total number of 103 forms were collected and 95 of them were included in evaluation. Psychiatrists had less stigmatizing beliefs than other mental health professionals. Sociodemographic features and a family history of psychiatric illness had no effect on stigmatizing attitudes, though participants who suffered from a psychiatric illness had less stigmatizing attitudes. "Insane" and "mentally ill" were identified as the most stigmatizing expression, whereas "psychiatric disorder" and "mental health problems" have been found as the least stigmatizing ones. The terms "dotard" and "junkie" have been found as the most humiliating/insulting expressions by participants. There was no difference with regard to use of stigmatizing language between groups.
   Conclusion: Stigmatization is a significant factor affecting social engagement, interpersonal and occupational functioning, and treatment and care processes of individuals with mental illnesses. Stigmatization can be seen also among mental health professionals. Considering the importance of language and expressions in stigmatization, studies and interventions in this field might contribute to reduce stigmatization.

AB  - This project draws on psychological and sociological social psychology to investigate immigration policy opinions among native-born non-Hispanic Whites. Using data from a suburban Chicago-area county that has seen substantial growth in the Latino immigrant population, we examine Anglos' opinions on three dimensions of immigration policy: preferred immigration rate, resistance to immigration, and assistance for immigrants. Our central hypothesis is that liberalizing effects of Anglo/Latino interpersonal contact are conditioned on Anglos' recognition of hardships and barriers faced by Latinos. Five of the six interaction effects we estimated were highly significant: Personal contact with Latinos does promote more positive, progressive immigration policy opinions, but only among some Anglosthose who were acquainted with immigrants who had run afoul of immigration law or believed there is substantial local discrimination against Latinos. The results are reminiscent of James Kluegel's (1985) analysis of White Americans' views about affirmative action: "If there isn't a problem, you don't need a solution." Affirmation of local anti-Latino discrimination was the stronger moderator of contact effects and also showed main effects on immigration policy opinion stronger than the effects of interpersonal contact. Denial of anti-Latino discrimination may be a means used by Anglos to defend their group position.

AB  - Playback theatre was used as a powerful tool for the fight against the stigma of mental disorders. This challenging community process was particularly helpful to people with mental disorders and their families, as well as to mental health professionals. Within the frame of the Association of Dramatic Expression and Therapy "Palmos", "Playback Psi" theatre group was established by a number of Greek professional performers and psychotherapists aiming to work through stigmatizing social representations of mental illness. The training of the group included knowledge on specific issues of mental disorders, as well as of the stigma that surrounds them as well as stage techniques deriving from Dramatherapy and Psychodrama, enabling the actors to portray safely delusional or disorganized material, overwhelming emotions or lack of boundaries. Playback Theatre performances took place in psychiatric and rehabilitation settings, in mental health conferences, as well as under the umbrella of policies of the "Greek Anti-stigma Programme" of the WPA. The performances offered the opportunity to the audience members, suffering or not from a mental disorder, to share life experiences of prejudice and discrimination, to take stance against the existing negative attitudes, to decrease their social distance and to foster community networks.

AB  - This research examined how direct and extended intergroup contact can promote reconciliation in the aftermath of the Liberian civil wars (N = 181 refugees). We measured intergroup contact and attitudes toward each of the 16 ethnic groups in Liberia, and used multilevel analyses to investigate the relation between contact and attitudes toward each outgroup, as well as the influence of overall intergroup contact on reconciliation. At the within-individual level, both direct and extended cross-group friendships predicted attitudes toward specific groups, regardless of participants' overall levels of intergroup contact. At the between-individual level, intergroup contact was related to a more positive overall assessment of ethnic outgroups, which in turn was related to greater intergroup trust, empathy, and forgiveness. We also explored the role of traumatic war experiences in this process, showing that the within-individual relation between intergroup contact and attitudes is stronger for those more traumatized by the war, both for direct and extended cross-group friendships. These findings stress the importance of direct and extended intergroup contact in promoting reconciliation even after violent armed conflicts, and indeed especially for those that were more exposed to this violence.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo promote a critical approach on the conceptualisation of domestic violence by investigating the experience of abuse on the part of men who are victims of domestic violence by their female partners.
   BackgroundMedia attention and prevention programmes relating to domestic violence have mainly focused on women as the victims and men as the perpetrators. The underlying idea is that violence is predominantly physical and a prerogative of men. This conceptualisation of violence reduces the opportunities for the consideration of different modalities of abuse.
   DesignDiscourse analysis within a qualitative approach.
   MethodsSemistructured interviews with 20 Italian men who claimed to have been abused by their female partners were conducted via Skype and analysed with the software atlas.ti. The grounded theory methodology was used to avoid imposing external points of view. Personal data were collected; in particular, their occupational level was compared to their partners' to assess the social power within the couple.
   ResultsBecause of their strong endorsement of social and cultural values, participants showed a protective attitude towards their partners and imputed their violent acts to fragility or an external condition. Emotional distress emerged due to the isolation and subsequent inability to seek help. Although the physical violence reported is severe, the psychological violence was indicated as more damaging.
   ConclusionGaining an understanding of how men experience domestic abuse offers an opportunity to provide better prevention and intervention for them and other family members at risk of abuse.
   Relevance to clinical practiceThe study identifies gaps in service provision generated by a lack of information or perceived prejudice towards abused men. The role of the nurse in supporting male victims is discussed, and future applications for treatments and prevention plans are proposed.

AB  - New technologies like large-scale social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) and crowdsourcing services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower, Clickworker) are impacting social science research and providing many new and interesting avenues for research. The use of these new technologies for research has not been without challenges, and a recently published psychological study on Facebook has led to a widespread discussion of the ethics of conducting large-scale experiments online. Surprisingly little has been said about the ethics of conducting research using commercial crowdsourcing marketplaces. In this article, I focus on the question of which ethical questions are raised by data collection with crowdsourcing tools. I briefly draw on the implications of Internet research more generally, and then focus on the specific challenges that research with crowdsourcing tools faces. I identify fair pay and the related issue of respect for autonomy, as well as problems with the power dynamic between researcher and participant, which has implications for withdrawal without prejudice, as the major ethical challenges of crowdsourced data. Furthermore, I wish to draw attention to how we can develop a "best practice" for researchers using crowdsourcing tools.

AB  - This article explores the trajectory of the Italian comic archetype, 'The Opportunist', and how it illuminates, and allows us to draws connections between, numerous junctures of modern Italian history. The caricature 'Arlecchino', deriving from the masked 'types' of the commedia dell'arte of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, is an historic exemplar of the Italian 'everyman' who simultaneously evades and exploits the established order in order to 'get by', 'get ahead' and survive. Filmmakers of la commedia all'italiana such as Mario Monicelli, Dino Risi and Lina Wertmuller, employed this caricature of the wily - yet ultimately harmless - petty crook in their work. They did so not in order to reinforce prejudices of Italians as self-serving and apathetic, but in order to examine what it meant to 'survive' 20 years of Fascism and the socio-political turmoil of post-war Italy. Examining how this caricature has historically evolved according to its ever-shifting social milieu illuminates not only certain defining moments of Italian history, but also how this archetype has contributed to popular understandings about Italy's past and its people.

AB  - Research investigating the genetic roots of political orientation has proliferated in the past decade. Such genetic accounts resonate with the human tendency to essentialize variation in psychology and behavior to attribute variation to differences in an invisible, underlying, fixed essence. Invoking genetic essentialist biases leads people to consider traits to be relatively immutable and to consider social groups to be homogenous and discrete. These biases have real-world implications for out-group perceptions, stereotyping, and ascriptions of personal control. This article discusses the viability and potential implications of genetically essentializing political orientation. Genetic attributions of political orientation may lead to less derogation of political dissidents due to perceptions of lower personal control. Conversely, essentializing political orientation may lead to perceptions of more discrete group boundaries between political groups, higher perceived out-group homogeneity, and lower ascriptions of personal control over one's own political attitudes. A research agenda to address these possibilities is discussed.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the meaning of the experiences of patients infected by HIV using antiretroviral therapy, regarding the use of alcohol and drugs.
   Study design: A qualitative phenomenological study.
   Method: A total of 25 patients receiving antiretroviral treatment participated in the investigation, of which 14 were male and 11 were females, who expressed their feelings and perceptions through participation in focus groups and the interpretation of costumes. The empirical material was transcribed in full and later organized and analyzed using the phenomenological method.
   Results: Based on this amusing experience we realized that participants were unaware of the effects of the use of alcohol and drugs in the AIDS progression. Since they have kept with their smoking and alcoholism habits to be accepted in a social group and consequently prevent prejudice. We believe that our health education strategy was adequate to improve antiretroviral therapy, since it helped in subject comprehension and patients self care body expression.
   Conclusion: This phenomenological study made it possible to understand the experience of patients living with HIV regarding the use of alcohol and drugs, and contributes to the planning and implementation of intervention programs based on a participative model of care, with a view to prioritizing the holistic aspects involved in the treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS.

AB  - In two quasi-experimental vignette studies, we have analyzed how societal threat to safety moderates the relation between right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and psychological distress. In Study 1 (Italian community sample, N=343), we focused on depressive symptoms (measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the General Health Questionnaire). Two moderated regressions showed that the relation between RWA and both measures of depressive symptoms was positive and significant only among people exposed to a socially threatening scenario. In Study 2 (Italian student sample, N=219), we focused on state anxiety and replicated Study 1's results. The findings indicated that, in conditions of societal threat to safety, RWA is a risk factor for psychological distress. Strengths, limitations, and possible developments of this research are discussed.

AB  - Millions of people in India are born with scars that will last a lifetime. These are scars of social rather than physical blemish and they reduce the capacity of such persons to function in life, free of prejudice and untainted by stigma. The source of these wounds is the practice of untouchability', meaning that any physical contact with them is avoided because they are considered unclean'. This article studies the nature of households in India that admit to practising untouchability' in the sense of avoiding contact with persons they regard as unclean and contrasts such households with those that claim to be not practising untouchability'. Such a contrast is possible because the data used, which are from the Indian Human Development Survey, associate with each household a wealth of economic, social and demographic data. Consequently, it is possible to estimate the likelihood of a household practising untouchability, conditional upon the values pertaining to it of a number of relevant factors. These include its social group, its main source of income, the highest educational level of its members, its urban or rural location and its region of residence. The central finding of the analysis is that the practice of untouchability is determined more by the region in which a household is located than by the caste to which it belongs.

AB  - In this paper, a computational model is presented to simulate emotional response of people after traumatising events, including their development, recovery, and the effect of group support. The model is built upon mechanisms known from cognitive and social neuroscience. Using the model, several scenarios were explored, considering both individual and groups of people. The simulation results were validated on a dataset of symptoms and recovery of patients with PTSD. The obtained model enables simulation and analysis of emotional response evolution of diverse personality types, and how extensible are effects of group therapy on patients with PTSD. Simulation results show that group therapy is positive but in the long term its effect reduces, suggesting that changing people in groups every period of time helps to keep group's atmosphere healthy, contributing to recovering of patients. The gain of group therapy also depends on the type of people present in the group which in some cases can be prejudicial to some members when dependent and toxic relations are formed between them.

AB  - The steady flow of immigrants from all over the world challenges the social cohesion of states in a variety of ways. Against this backdrop, we extend previous research on attitudes toward immigrants by evaluating the formation of trust toward this group. Using a representative sample of the Swiss population, our results indicate that the violation of trust by negative experiences in the workplace is associated with lower levels of trust toward immigrants accordingly. However, we show that the relationship between negative experiences and trust toward immigrants is more powerful among those individuals who place high levels of trust in their own national group than for individuals who do not even trust their fellow group members.

AB  - Background and Aims: Prejudice and negative attitudes toward mental illness are major obstacles in the rehabilitation and functional recovery of patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the attitudes of health-related personnel toward mentally ill patients in a local urban community in South Korea.
   Materials and Methods: In total, 401 participants (men, 132; women, 269; mean age, 37.3 +/- 9.5 years) were recruited. The participants were health-related personnel in a district of Seoul, who were recruited from three different workplaces: a local administration office, a public health center, and a community welfare center. Sociodemographic data were gathered, and the community attitudes toward the mentally ill (CAMI) inventory were administered. Comparisons of the CAMI subscales were conducted among participants using statistical analysis.
   Results: Community welfare center workers showed more authoritarianism and social restriction and less community mental health ideology than the other two groups. Among the demographic variables, a shorter working career, higher education, female gender, and younger age were also related to a more negative attitude toward mentally ill patients.
   Conclusion: Community health-related personnel who have contact with patients with mental illness should be encouraged to have a fair, hospitable, and open-minded attitude. It is advisable for these workers to receive interventions such as regular educational programs early in their careers.

KW  - bilingualism
AB  - National language policy which is implemented from the top is perceived as official legislation designed to influence people's linguistic lives. In the Castilian-dominated Galician linguistic landscape, this paper examines the impact of last thirty years' top-down language policies on the "linguistic culture" (SCHIFFMAN, 1996) of the Galicians and analyses the role of grassroots level actors or agents who play a significant role in interpreting and implementing language policy on the ground. Linguistic culture, as Schiffman (2006, p. 112) describes it, is the "sum totality of ideas, values, beliefs, attitudes, prejudices, myths, religious strictures, and all the other cultural 'baggage' that speakers bring to their dealings with language from their culture". This will inevitably lead us to an examination of the essential macro level linguistic and non-linguistic variables such as socio-political, socioeconomic, socio-cultural, sociolinguistic factors present in the Galician society influencing the ideological construct and revitalisation practices of the community. Concurrently, this article offers a brief overview of the sociolinguistic history of Galician, as a means of contextualising existing debates related to language policies since the outset of the Galician Autonomy. It starts with a discussion on the significance of the 1983 Linguistic Normalisation Act, the immediate effects it had on Galician and on its public visibility which will be further related to the various understandings of notions such as linguistic normalisation and societal bilingualism which have been an integral part of LPP discourse over the course of last three decades. To conclude, the chapter will also offer a critical account of the recent developments in grassroots level Galician language activism such as the creation of Galician medium pre-primary immersion schools through co-operative mobilisations and crowd-sourcing; these schools came about as a reaction to the contemporary state-imposed language policies from the present centre-right wing government (2009-present).

TI  - JANE AUSTEN'S ARISTOTELIAN PROPOSAL: SOMETIMES FALLING IN LOVE IS BETTER THAN A BEATING
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE
LA  - English
AB  - Aristotle suggests that we improve by beating those immune to argument, thus connecting doing wrong with feeling pain, and, as Plato suggests in his Gorgias, justly correcting the injustice in their souls. Since, however, the beaten offender lacks choice in the punishment, and is not thereby shown better options, beating cannot make him virtuous. Only virtuous friendship could do that, but vice prevents both recognizing and attracting virtuous friends. Falling in love, though, as suggested by Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice, provides our perception a flexibility that facilitates character improvement, and the rarity of an appropriate spouse can motivate its accomplishment.

AB  - European Jewish history from 1789-1939 supports the view that construction of national identities even in secular liberal states was determined not only by modern considerations alone but also by ancient patterns of thought, behaviour and prejudice. Emancipation stimulated unprecedented patriotism, especially in wartime, as Jews strove to prove loyalty to their countries of citizenship. During World War I, even Zionists split along national lines, as did families and friends. Jewish patriotism was interchangeable with nationalism inasmuch as Jews identified themselves with national cultures. Although emancipation implied acceptance and an end to anti-Jewish prejudice in the modern liberal state, the kaleidoscopic variety of Jewish patriotism throughout Europe inadvertently undermined the idea of national identity and often provoked anti-Semitism. Even as loyal citizens of separate states, the Jews, however scattered, disunited and diverse, were made to feel, often unwillingly, that they were one people in exile.

AB  - This study focuses on the process of the integration of Arab Muslim Israelis suffering from mental disorders into the normative community, addressing perspectives of both people with mental disorders and the community. This qualitative-constructivist study seeks to understand the dynamics of face-to-face meetings by highlighting the participants' points of view. The main themes of the findings included stereotypes and prejudices, gender discrimination, and the effect of face-to-face meetings on integration of people with mental disorders (PMD) into the community. The findings support former studies about the integration of PMD into the normative community, but add a unique finding that females suffer from double discrimination: both as women in a conservative society and as PMD. The study findings indicate a perception of lack of self-efficacy of PMD as a key barrier preventing integration into the community, which also prevents community members and counselors from accepting them or treating them as equals. We recommend on a social marketing campaign to be undertaken with the Arab Muslim community to refute stigmas and prejudices, particulary with double gender discrimination suffered by women with mental disorders in the Muslim community and training of community center counselors who have contact with the PMD population.

AB  - Eighteenth-century Spain was haunted by a sense of decadence. Consequently, intellectual innovation developed in its attempt to recover its lost grandeur while keeping its Catholic culture. In such a context, politicaleconomic reflection focused in a remarkable way on a scientific approach to social habits. Reception of foreign developments was adapted to a framework that fostered the enhancement of individualism but not of individual self-determination. The first part of the article shows that the approach to customs initially elaborated on the concept of emulation as a moral sentiment for overcoming collective passions that precluded cooperation. The second part shifts the focus to a discussion of education as an antidote against traditional prejudices but also as a bulwark to both modern moral hazards derived from commercial society and republicanism.

AB  - The aim of this qualitative study was to examine young female sport participants' experiences and thoughts in terms of sport, their bodies, and social appearance norms. Six focus groups with female sport participants (N= 25) from Sweden were conducted. Participants raised many positive experiences in relation to their sport participation, but they also witnessed a conflict in the intersection between the culture within their sport (emphasizing physical performance) and the culture outside their sport (emphasizing physical appearance). Through thematic analysis, four themes illustrating the balancing act between these two cultures were formed: (a) the performing body versus the objectified body, (b) food as fuel versus source of shame, (c) appreciation of body type diversity versus appearance prejudice, and (d) empowerment and agency versus disempowerment and restraints. The findings of this study indicate that young women who engage in sport have to face complex, ambiguous, and restricting norms and notions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To identify and explore the dimensions of the difficulties faced by people living with HIV/Aids in the disease management.
   Methods: A qualitative, descriptive, exploratory study was developed in Specialized Care Services, with 26 patients. The recorded interviews were transcribed, and then processed and analyzed by means of descending hierarchical classification. Findings were based on the collective subject discourse.
   Results: Five classes were obtained: "Intrafamilial prejudice and its impact on coping with the disease"; "Social prejudice: macro environment impacts"; "Difficulties in managing the risk of HIV/Aids transmission and its implications on partnerships", "Maintenance of high rates of HIV/Aids treatment adherence: qualifying the service" and "Quality of life promotion for people living with HIV/Aids".
   Conclusion: The difficulties experienced go far beyond the disease, with central, intimate aspects, and are linked to prejudice, which hinders their personal, professional and affective development, expanding into abstract macro-concepts such as quality of life.

AB  - Background: Drug dependence is a recognized medical condition and therefore, right to health applies in the same way to drug dependence as it does to any other health condition. The human rights in patient care framework - which refers to the application of basic human rights principles in the delivery of health care services - was used to explore the experiences of equality in the dignity and rights protected by Polish law within four different specialist drug treatment settings in Poland. The views of patients and staff were examined and compared.
   Methods: Focus group interviews were conducted in 12 drug treatment facilities: three inpatient therapeutic communities, three outpatient programs, three opioid substitution programs and three harm reduction programs (drop-in/needle exchange/support). Interviews were conducted with a total of 43 staff and 73 patients. All interviews were audio-recorded with participants' prior consent and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed according to the problem-centred interview methodology, using CAQDA.
   Results: Patients described instances of abuse of their rights regarding dignity, privacy, confidentiality, personalized treatment, and respect of patient's time, right to information and to complain. Those accounts were complemented by the perspective of professionals working in drug treatment. Patients of Polish opioid substitution programs reported experiencing more humiliation and disenfranchisement than patients in other drug treatment settings.
   Conclusion: Drug testing and control, fuelled by prejudices of health professionals, are leading to discriminatory practices in substitution treatment and damaging the chances of therapeutic success. The concept of epistemic injustice illuminates the reasons behind discrimination against patients on opioid substitution programs, who are seen as continuously sick and their illness perceived as a mark of moral, social and epistemic failure.

AB  - ObjectivesMen who have sex with men (MSM) are at risk of genital warts and anal cancer due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This study explores MSMs' perceptions of HPV and HPV vaccination prior to the introduction of this programme.
   DesignFocus groups and one-to-one interviews with self-identified MSM were conducted between November 2014 and March 2015 in Brighton, UK.
   MethodsParticipants were recruited from community-based lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender (LGBT) venues and organizations. Discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using framework analysis.
   ResultsThirty-three men took part (median age 25years, IQR: 21-27), most of whom (n=25) did not know about HPV, anal cancer (31), or HPV vaccination (26). While genital warts and anal cancer were perceived as severe, men did not perceive themselves at risk of HPV. All MSM would accept the HPV vaccine if offered by a health care professional. The challenges of accessing sexual health services or openly discussing same-sex experiences with health care professionals were perceived as barriers to accessing HPV vaccination. Two participants were concerned that selective HPV vaccination could increase stigma and prejudice against MSM, comparable to the AIDS epidemic. Ten MSM were unsure about the effectiveness of HPV vaccination for sexually active men and were in favour of vaccinating all adolescent boys at school.
   ConclusionsMost MSM have poor knowledge about HPV and associated anal cancer. Despite the lack of concern about HPV, most MSM expressed willingness to receive HPV vaccination. There is a need for health education about the risks of HPV and HPV-related diseases so that MSM can appraise the benefits of being vaccinated. Concerns about HPV vaccine effectiveness in sexually active men and possible stigmatization need to be addressed to optimize HPV vaccine acceptability.

AB  - The aim of this case study was to discover how three Sami artist present their culture in their arts and how their art grows from Sami traditions. Our first purpose was to find out how they use their art forms' roots to create new ideas. The other purpose of this study was to bring into discussion the importance of a minority culture's arts in teacher education programmes. The data was collected from the writings of and interviews with three Sami artists for whom Sami tradition is strongly present. Sami artists can be seen as an open space for challenging preoccupations and prejudices in which traditions and artistic practices work as playful means of questioning the ways in which subjects, social interactions, and practices are constructed. In these artistic processes, subjects and cultures become hybrid and a changing force for interaction among cultural traditions, other cultural ideas, and the environment to generate new arts.

AB  - The Trump phenomenon is argued to depart from current populist rise in Europe. According to a model of opinion dynamics from sociophysics the machinery of Trump's amazing success obeys well-defined counter-intuitive rules. Therefore, his success was in principle predictable from the start. The model uses local majority rule arguments and obeys a threshold dynamics. The associated tipping points are found to depend on the leading collective beliefs, cognitive biases and prejudices of the social group which undertakes the public debate. And here comes the open sesame of the Trump campaign, which develops along two successive steps. During a first moment, Trump's statement produces a majority of voters against him. But at the same time, according to the model the shocking character of the statement modifies the prejudice balance. In case the prejudice is present even being frozen among voters, the tipping point is lowered at Trump's benefit. Nevertheless, although the tipping point has been lowered by the activation of frozen prejudices it is instrumental to preserve enough support from openly prejudiced people to be above the threshold. Then, as infuriated voters launch intense debate, occurrence of ties will drive progressively hostile people to shift their voting intention without needing to endorse the statement which has infuriated them. The ongoing debate does drive towards a majority for Trump. The possible Trump victory at November Presidential election is discussed. In particular, the model shows that to eventually win the Presidential election, Trump must not modify his past shocking attitude but to appeal to a different spectrum of frozen prejudices, which are common to both Democrats and Republicans.

AB  - Positive intergroup contact with socially and economically advantaged national majorities has been shown to reduce ethnic identification among minorities, thereby undermining ethnic minority activism. This finding implies that ethnic identity is the relevant social identity driving ethnic minorities' struggle for equality. We argue that the study of the "sedating" effect of positive intergroup contact for minorities should be more nuanced. The existence of multiple and sometimes interplaying social identities can foster a reinterpretation of the meaning of "ethnic" activism. This study therefore examines how the interplay of ethnic and national identities shapes the sedating effect of contact on minority activism. We expect national identification to buffer the sedated activism resulting from reduced ethnic identification. That is, the mediation from intergroup contact to reduced ethnic activism through weakened ethnic identification is expected to be moderated by national identification. With survey data from Bulgaria, we investigated support for ethnic activism among Bulgarian Roma (N = 320) as a function of their contact with the national majority as well as their degree of ethnic and national identification. The predicted moderated mediation was revealed: a negative indirect relationship between contact and activism through decreased ethnic identification occurred among Roma with low national identification, whereas no sedating effect occurred among Roma identifying strongly as members of the Bulgarian nation. We discuss the meaning of national identification for the Roma minority, who experience harsh discrimination in countries where they have been historically settled, as well as convergence of these findings with work on dual identification. We highlight the role of interacting social identities in mobilizing resources for activism and the importance of adopting a critical view on ethnic discourse when studying activism in both traditional and immigrant minorities.

AB  - The First Amendment to the United States' Constitution addresses freedom of religion and the-separation of church and state. However, the historical influence of religion in laws, policies, and political-representation have left secular individuals feeling excluded. At the same time, levels of confidence in social and political institutions in the United States are at an all-time low. This begs the question: Is there a-relationship between secularity and confidence in various social and political institutions (e.g. the armed forces, churches, major companies, government, police, and political parties)? This question is examined using data on the United States from the World Values Survey from 1995-2011. While controlling for a range of key demographics, the findings show a negative relationship between secularity and institutional confidence. More specifically, atheists and nonreligious individuals are less likely than those who are religious to have confidence in all six institutions. Based on previous literature and the empirical-evidence presented in this study, we argue that overall lower levels of institutional confidence among secular Americans is an outcome of the exclusion of such individuals from American social life. Thus, it highlights the importance of addressing the stereotypes and prejudice that this minority group faces.

AB  - In a historically controversial moment for Spanish territorial politics, where the traditional regional system of the State and regional politics are constantly fluctuating especially considering the referenda in the Basque Country and Catalonia -, the films Ocho apellidos vascos (Spanish Affair) directed by Martinez-Lazaro in 2014 and Ocho apellidos catalanes (Spanish Affair 2) in 2015 have become the most successful films in the history of Spanish cinema. In these films, the Andalusian, Basque and Catalan stereotypes are taken to the extreme, breaking down the negative stigma they have acquired by reducing all their possible meanings to a simple gag. Consequently, the overindulgence of these stereotypical representations has proposed their very deactivation as a legitimate category of representation. The study of stereotypes and prejudices reflects an interest in relationships between social groups. Therefore, if intergroup affairs focus their discussions on beliefs that describe actions such as violence, alliance, or negotiation, this means that perceptions, beliefs and attitudes must mediate all intergroup affairs. According to Fredric Jameson, in order for images not to unfold just their own stereotypes and confirm themselves as realities, a considerable distance should be kept between the contents and what they represent. The proposed goal of this study is to analyse both films from a critical discourse analysis (CDA) in relation to the stereotypes categorization defined by Jaakko Lehtonen. The announcement of the end of the armed struggle by the terrorist group ETA and the eccentric political fights in the last Catalan elections have allowed the production and success of these comedies. These films question the sense of the Basque, Catalan and Andalusian stereotypes, the latter being the primary internationally recognized Spanish stereotype, showing the 'plurinational' origin of the Spanish State.

AB  - Aim: This study aims to identify the predictors of poor sleep quality and the associations between depression, hope and sleep in a sample of 156 women with breast cancer prior to surgery.
   Background: The care and treatment of breast cancer is among the most important scientific challenges in public health. Sleep disturbances and depression are the important complaint of cancer patients. However, they are often neglected. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer also experience prejudice, fear of death, suffering, mutilation, fear of lymphedema, as well as feelings of social devaluation leading to hopelessness Several studies point to hope as an effective strategy to help patients cope with difficulties and achieve their goals, especially patients with cancer.
   Methods: This is a report of baseline data extracted from a longitudinal study.
   Data collection tools: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Herth Hope Index. Data were analyzed with the Spearman's Rank Correlation test and Multiple Logistic Regression analysis.
   Results: The majority of women had tumors in initial stages (78.7%), reported poor sleep quality (58.9%), and had moderate to severe or severe depression (27.2%). Significant correlations were found between hope and depression (Spearman r = 0.4341), and between sleep quality and depression (Spearman r = 03938). Significant associations were found between poor sleep quality and pain, symptoms of menopause and depression. Depression and symptoms of menopause were independent predictors of poor sleep quality.
   Conclusion: The evaluation of sleep quality, depression and hope should be implemented in clinical practice. Increased hope lessens depression and may positively affect sleep quality, all of which improves quality of life for women with breast cancer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - WAR
AB  - After the Second World War, using culture - such as theater, film, and writing - to promote Austria as a separate nation became a helpful strategy for Austrians and the Allied Forces alike. In this context, the role of Jews and Jewish difference in revising Austrian self-definitions was particularly fraught. Antisemitic prejudices persisted after the Holocaust, even though Austrian Jews were now largely absent. However, in the early postwar years, antisemitism was more likely to rear its head via code words or backhandedly, in efforts to deny its very existence. This article investigates the presence and consequences of this invisible' antisemitism in postwar Vienna by juxtaposing two films made at roughly the same time: Der Proze ss (1948), a film about antisemitism that takes place in a nineteenth-century village over 300 miles away and features only innocent rural Jews and diabolical antisemites, while The Third Man (1949) features an urban tale of the black market and poisoned children set in post-1945 Vienna that does not mention either Jews or the reasons for their absence. This comparison suggests that the simultaneous repression and evocation of Jewish difference that characterized the creation of culture in Vienna before the Holocaust persisted in the immediate postwar era.

AB  - Individuals who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder have persistent intrusive thoughts that cause severe distress that impairs daily functioning. These individuals often conceal their intrusive thoughts and delay help-seeking for fear of being stigmatized. Stigma can be problematic when it is present among mental health professionals because they may distance themselves from their clients and have a negative outlook on treatment outcome. To date there has not been any research that focuses on stigma that clinician's may hold towards obsessive-compulsive disorder or specific obsessions; however, there is evidence that mental health professionals may have prejudices towards individuals who suffer from other mental illnesses. The current study aimed to explore clinician and student clinician attitudes about obsessional content from varying symptom dimensions. Results indicated participants were more likely to socially reject or be concerned by individuals with obsessions related to contamination, harming, and sexual obsessions than those with scrupulous obsessions, and that they would be less likely to reveal sexual obsessions to others if they were experiencing them than the other three types of obsessions.

AB  - The unprecedented demands of patient and population priorities created by globalization and escalating health and social inequities will not be met unless medical education changes. Educators have failed to move fast enough to create an education framework that meets current population needs. A new common set of professional values around global social accountability is necessary. Education borders must be broken down at three levels-societal-institutional, interpersonal, and individual.
   At a societal-institutional level, global health must be embraced as part of a philosophy of population needs, human rights, equity, and justice. A move from informative acquisition of knowledge and skills to formative learning where students socialize around values, develop leadership attributes, and become agents for change is needed. At an interpersonal level, radical changes in curriculum delivery, which move away from the well-defined borders of specialty rotations, are required. Students must develop an integrated understanding of the future of health care and the patient's journey through health care delivery, within the context of population needs. At an individual level, doctors need to understand the boundaries of the professional values they hold within themselves and develop a deeper understanding of their own internal prejudices and conflicts. Opening the borders between the sciences and humanities is essential. Fostering and mentoring that emphasize that resilience, leadership, flexibility, and the ability to cope with uncertainty are needed to tackle the complexities of current, as well as future, health care. Doctors need to understand the restraints within themselves to work effectively without borders.

AB  - Independence was a core value of the movement for disability rights. People with disabilities did not have to be dependent, advocates claimed; they were robbed of autonomy by poverty, social prejudice, and architectural barriers. Recently, critics have noted that the emphasis on independence equates personhood with autonomy, reason, and self-awareness, thereby excluding those who are incapable of self-determination. The stigma of dependency is communicated to caregivers whose work is devalued and undercompensated. These values are echoed in the life writing of people with disabilities, which tends to present a singular narrative voice, even when the author requires assistance in the physical or intellectual work of composition. The 1979 Mexican memoir-testimonio Gaby Brimmer, collaboratively authored by the acclaimed journalist Elena Poniatowska, Brimmer, her mother, and her paid caregiver is a notable exception. Consisting of interwoven dialogue among its three informants, Gaby Brimmer enacts dependency at the level of form, while exploring the challenges and opportunities of interdependence in societies that devalue the giving and receiving of care.

AB  - There is evidence of health disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual populations. Although the focus of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender health research has been human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted infection among men who have sex with men, there are health disparities among sexual minority women. Using the minority stress framework, these disparities may in part be caused by individual prejudice, social stigma, and discrimination. To ensure equitable health for all, there is urgent need for targeted culturally sensitive health promotion, cultural sensitivity training for health care providers, and intervention-focused research.

AB  - Poultry and pork farming are typical activities of small farms in southern Brazil. This production plays an important social and economic role in many of these areas as it is often the main income source. The swine compost has emerged as an alternative to reduce the volume of swine wastewater, which is transformed into a residue that can be easily transported and applied with less environment prejudice. However, there is no information in literature regarding the use of this compound as a source of nitrogen in grain crops. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate poultry litter and swine compost as organic sources of nitrogen for the millet crop. The experiment was conducted in the years of 2013 and 2014 in southern Brazil, in no-tillage systems in a Hapludox soil. The treatments were: control (without nitrogen); poultry litter (PL), swine compost (SC) and mineral fertilization (NPK). The use of poultry litter resulted in better averages for almost all evaluated variables. Although the swine compost did not express results as good as the crop treated with poultry litter, the crop in which the swine compound was applied presented better results for some plant parameters than the chemical fertilizer treatment, which shows that these two residues can be viable alternatives for nitrogen fertilization in millet cultivations.

AB  - In this essay, Adam Bridgen argues that the oft-condemned "sycophancy" of James Woodhouse's early poetry is a misapprehension that overlooks the emergence of his evangelical, egalitarian beliefs in the mid-176os. Reconsidering the letters between Woodhouse and his patrons reveals not only the influential friendships he cultivated as a plebeian poet but also the class prejudices he continued to encounter and resist, often forcefully. Although he conformed to a humble self -portrayal in his 1764 and 1766 Poems, Woodhouse's subversion of praise allowed him to criticize as well as commend elite behavior; viewing benevolence as a Christian duty faithful to the more equal society that God had intended, he praised patronage, in fact, for its leveling potential.

AB  - A consequence of the endorsement of technological determinism is that technical change, even when it entails high social and environmental costs, must never be delayed. Consistently with the notion of technological determinism, consumers opposing new food technologies, such as nanofoods, have been accused of irrational attitudes driven by technophobia. This study was aimed at investigating whether technophobia and prejudices towards science could be considered as important factors affecting consumers' attitude to buy nanofoods. Through a hierarchical clustering a sample of interviewees was classified on the basis of their overall attitude toward food technologies, with the identification of three groups exhibiting considerable differences. The results show that the opposition to nanofoods is mainly dictated by the knowledge of the incertitude about its net benefits and by the desire to keep control over food choices and food risks.

AB  - Research programs in empirical psychology from the past two decades have revealed implicit biases. Although implicit processes are pervasive, unavoidable, and often useful aspects of our cognitions, they may also lead us into error. The most problematic forms of implicit cognition are those which target social groups, encoding stereotypes or reflecting prejudicial evaluative hierarchies. Despite intentions to the contrary, implicit biases can influence our behaviours and judgements, contributing to patterns of discriminatory behaviour. These patterns of discrimination are obviously wrong and unjust. But in remedying such wrongs, one question to be addressed concerns responsibility for implicit bias. Unlike some paradigmatic forms of wrongdoing, such discrimination is often unintentional, unendorsed, and perpetrated without awareness; and the harms are particularly damaging because they are cumulative and collectively perpetrated. So, what are we to make of questions of responsibility? In this article, we outline some of the main lines of recent philosophical thought, which address questions of responsibility for implicit bias. We focus on (a) the kind of responsibility at issue; (b) revisionist versus nonrevisionist conceptions of responsibility as applied to implicit bias; and (c) individual, institutional, and collective responsibility for implicit bias.

AB  - Despite recent shifts in societal attitudes toward same-sex relationships, women who have sex with women face a variety of barriers to optimal health, including a history of negatively perceived interactions in clinical settings that lead them to delay or avoid health care. Women who have sex with women may be at disproportionate risk of obesity, tobacco use, substance use, mental health issues, intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, and some cancers. Disparities can exist throughout the lifetime. Lesbian and bisexual adolescents are vulnerable to bullying, family rejection, and risky sexual behavior that may lead to sexually transmitted infections or unintended pregnancy. Sexual minority stress, which is a response to stigmatization, prejudice, and internalized homophobia, contributes to many of these conditions. Family physicians should foster trust and communication to provide a nonjudgmental, welcoming environment supportive of culturally competent health care and optimal outcomes. When indicated, clinicians should refer women who have sex with women to culturally sensitive community resources and legal advisors for assistance with medical decision making, hospital visitation, conception, and legal recognition of nonbiologic parents.

AB  - Sexual prejudice remains a widespread problem worldwide. Past research demonstrates that cross-orientation contact (contact between heterosexuals and lesbian/gay individuals) reduces sexual prejudice among heterosexuals, especially when contact is high quality. This study extends the literature on the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice and the mediation of this relationship by intergroup anxiety by examining the role of a key ideology - essentialist beliefs about homosexuality (immutability, universality, and discreteness beliefs). Findings indicate that the mediation of the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice by intergroup anxiety differs by level of essentialist beliefs. Additionally, the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice appears to be mediated by essentialist beliefs as well as intergroup anxiety. These results suggest that individuals who endorse essentialist beliefs commonly associated with increased bias (high discreteness and low immutability and universality beliefs) may benefit the most from cross-orientation contact and resultant decreases in intergroup anxiety. Further, decreasing essentialist beliefs generally associated with increased bias may be a mechanism through which cross-orientation contact reduces sexual prejudice. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - The constrict claim that ethnic heterogeneity drives down social trust has been empirically tested across the globe. Meta-analyses suggest that neighbourhood ethnic heterogeneity generally undermines ties within the neighbourhood (such as trust in neighbours), but concurrently has an inconsistent or even positive effect on interethnic ties (such as outgroup trust). While the composition of the living environment thus often seems to matter, when and where remain unclear. We contribute to the literature by: (1) scrutinizing the extent to which ethnic heterogeneity drives down trust in coethnic neighbours, non-coethnic neighbours, unknown neighbours and unknown non-neighbours similarly; (2) comparing effects of heterogeneity aggregated to geographical areas that vary in scale and type of boundary; and (3) assessing whether the impact of heterogeneity of the local area depends on the wider geographic context. We test our hypotheses on the Religion in Dutch Society 2011-2012 dataset, supplemented with uniquely detailed GIS-data of Statistics Netherlands. Our dependent variables are four different so-called wallet-items, which we model through spatial and multilevel regression techniques. We demonstrate that both trust in non-coethnic and coethnic neighbours are lower in heterogeneous environments. Trust in people outside the neighbourhood is not affected by local heterogeneity. Measures of heterogeneity aggregated to relatively large scales, such as, administrative municipalities and egohoods with a 4000 m radius, demonstrate the strongest negative relationships with our trust indicators.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF JAPANESE SOCIOLOGY

KW  - highly skilled labor migration

KW  - MIGRATION
AB  - As labor markets become increasingly global, competition among industrialized nations to attract highly skilled workers from abroad has intensified. Spurred by concerns over future economic needs caused by the demographic challenges of an aging population, both Japan and Sweden have joined this global competition. This article examines Japanese and Swedish immigration policies for highly skilled migrants and compares the highly skilled migrants' experiences in the two countries through interviews with these migrants. Despite Japan and Sweden's completely different approaches to immigration itself, both countries' policies, as well as the experiences of the skilled migrants, are strikingly similar. Highly skilled migrants experience language barriers and prejudice in both countries, making it difficult to build social networks with natives. Career development seems to be perceived as a common problem, although less so in Sweden, where labor markets are more flexible. Overall, these issues reduce both Japan's and Sweden's ability to retain skilled migrants. While they share similarities, Sweden's famed work-life balance and gender equality give it an edge in the competition for skilled migrants, which Japan does not share. This comparison identifies which social conditions facilitate or impede skilled migrant settlement.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices relating to Leprosy among Public Health Care Providers in Colombo, Sri Lanka
T2  - LEPROSY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction: Leprosy remains a serious public health problem due to its ability to cause disability. The prevention of leprosy ultimately lies in the early diagnosis and treatment of the individuals having leprosy, thereby preventing further transmission. In Sri Lanka, 46% of new cases identified in year 2013, were late presentations and this caused to 7-8% patients to present with deformities. It has been observed that lack of awareness among health staff has contributed to this late diagnosis.
   Objective: To describe knowledge, attitudes and practices towards leprosy amongst public health care workers in Colombo Municipal Council area, Sri Lanka. Material & methods: A descriptive cross sectional survey was carried out in Colombo Municipal Council area by distributing self administered questionnaire among all public healthcare workers (n = 178) from January to February, 2015.
   Results: Hundred and fifty three participants (86%) identified 'hypo pigmented patches', 64 (36%) identified 'skin nodules' and 36 (20%) identified 'thickened nerves' as suspicious sings of leprosy. More than one fifth of participants believed leprosy is easily transmitted by touch. Sixty one (34.3%) health care workers were scared of leprosy and 77 (43.3%) didn't want to reveal to a friend that if a family member gets leprosy. Another 49 (27.5%) didn't want to share materials with a patient. A significant minority (22.5%) believed that patients should be kept apart from others.
   Conclusion: Including leprosy in continuous medical education and refresher training is crucial in early diagnosis of leprosy as certain gap in knowledge was identified. An emphasis needs to be placed on education regarding transmission and low rate of infectivity of leprosy as study revealed certain misconceptions and prejudices still exist even among healthcare workers.

AB  - This study was intended to analyze the intersection of experience of sexual stigma low-socioeconomic status, and suicide attempt amongst young Brazilians (11-24 years old). In each of the data collection periods (2004-2006: n = 7185; 2010-2012: n = 2734), participants completed a questionnaire-based instrument. Network analysis provided support for a Minority Stress Model, oriented around whether participants had experienced sexual stigma. Although suicide attempts decreased by 20% for participants who had not experienced sexual stigma, there was a 60% increase for those who had experienced sexual stigma. Of particular note were the increases in rates of reported community and familial physical assault, molestation, and rape for those who had experienced sexual stigma. An analysis of centrality statistics demonstrated that both experiences of this Minority Stress Model were fundamentally different, and that those disparities increased over the time frame observed in this study. At the center of this model, shortest paths statistics exhibited a direct conditioned connection between experiencing sexual stigma and suicide attempts. We discuss the social and historical contexts that contributed to these dynamics, and emphasize the need for policy change.

AB  - In this study, the aim was to construct a significant structural measurement model comparing students' affective characteristics with their mathematic achievement. According to this model, the aim was to test the measurement invariances between gender sub-groups hierarchically. This study was conducted as basic and descriptive research. Secondary level analyses were conducted on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 Turkish student questionnaire data. The sample consisted of 4,848 fifteen-year-old students from 170 schools and 12 statistical territories. For analysis techniques, regression analysis, exploratory, and confirmatory factor analyses were executed in order to construct a significant initial measurement model. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was executed to analyse the invariance between gender sub-groups. According to the results, taking into consideration the limitations of the model which was constructed in this study, it was observed that strong invariance between gender sub-groups was provided. This finding indicates that there are similarities of affective characteristics for fifteen-year-old Turkish students across gender sub-groups. The results can be evaluated as evidence that the possibility of bias or prejudice in students' affective characteristics toward mathematics is not high.

AB  - Young bisexual women experience worse mental and sexual health outcomes in comparison to their heterosexual and lesbian peers. These disparities are associated with stigma and devaluation of bisexual identities. The current paper addresses a community-based focus group project in which participants discussed bisexual stigma in regard to bisexual erasure and other stereotypes. Specifically, participants detailed experiences of feeling pressured to provide evidence of their bisexual identity, modifying their relationship or sexual behavior to conform to these expectations, as well as feeling excluded from queer community. Further, participants discussed how these experiences were related to decreased mental and sexual health. Future research should further investigate the relationship between bisexual stigma, pressure to provide evidence of bisexual identity, and negative mental and sexual health outcomes.

AB  - There is little academic research in relation to mentoring, learning and women, particularly in the male-dominated organizational context of the UK Police force. Currently, there is a Home Office drive to address inequality within the UK Police with a number of initiatives proposed including mentoring interventions, flexible working arrangements and positive-action recruitment initiatives. The purpose of this study is to investigate what policewomen mentees and mentors perceive they are learning through formal mentoring over time and how this makes a difference for them in the workplace. This will provide insights into whether Government investment in formal mentoring is the right intervention to help create a more gender-reflective, more equal workforce, in the Police. This study takes a critical realist position and an interpretivist theoretical perspective investigating a single case study organization. Key themes, spread across the four phases of the mentoring lifecycle were explored through 68 semi-structured interviews and four focus groups. Key findings are uncovered in relation to learning outcomes for these policewomen, both as mentees and mentors. It was found that mentoring added value across all four learning domains (cognitive, skills, affective related and social networks) and that the largest number of responses over time, were in relation to the affective-related domain, particularly building self-confidence. These findings are significant as they demonstrate that formal mentoring programmes can support and empower women within the specific workplace of the UK Police. In conclusion, if women are being precluded from breaking the "glass labyrinth" because of lack of knowledge, opportunity and networks to progress within this context, then mentoring could be part of this solution. If the masculine organizational culture is also creating prejudice and obstacles for women in the workplace (the "concrete floor"), then mentoring might be one way towards breaking down these barriers. In addition, if all (or some) of these factors are contributing to women's lower self-confidence levels and the "sticky floor" syndrome, then again the findings suggest that mentoring may be part of the solution towards empowering women beyond their current role. It is hoped that these insights will impact the emphasis put on the various Home Office recommendations and the initiatives offered by different Police forces. It is also hoped that these insights will have implications for other organizations that are considering investing in mentoring interventions, for similar groups or beyond. This article is published as part of a collection on the role of women in management and the workplace.

AB  - In recent years, a number of authors have commented on the current diversification of archaeological theory into different paradigms defined by diverse epistemologies and methods. One of the main consequences of this process has been the closure of the theoretical debate in archaeology, i.e. the fragmentation of archaeological theory into separate non-communicating paradigms. In this setting, several archaeologists have argued that there is a need for new theoretical discussions that promote dialogue among archaeologists belonging to different schools of thought. I suggest that a reflection on scientific progress, if executed properly, can fulfil this goal. In particular, I examine the conception establishing that science progresses by discarding incorrect prejudices and assumptions rather than by accumulating new facts and evidence. I argue that this view may be of particular relevance for different groups of archaeologists because it is compatible with the main philosophies that have oriented archaeological research since the 1980s. I illustrate this point with a number of examples drawn from the history of archaeology.

KW  - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
AB  - An examination of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah reveals a mapping of exponential growth of obtrusive racial tension which leaves in its wakes prejudice, acrimony and hatred. The article argues that despite its dialogic engagement with the possibility of harmonizing the varied characters' racial/cultural backgrounds, Adichie's Americanah's experimentation with transculturalism faded in a miasma of morbid biases and despair. This failure has a marked impact on the cultural downturn in the lives of African immigrants and other economic migrants from other parts of the world who are trapped in the social contradictions prevalent in America and England. Through concerted efforts, Adichie negotiated interracial harmony among her characters in Americanah; especially among ethnocentric characters cocooned in private world of hate, snobbishness and recherche referenced by the turbulent contemporary world. Invariably, Adichie as a transcultural writer is bounded by the need to illustrate issues which verge on individuals' intolerance for people outside their ethno-cultural or socio-political backgrounds. Nevertheless, Americanah's transcultural trope appreciates the fluidity of the present age: the confluence of global cultures, the mobility as well as nomadic nature of the 21st-century man and the need to engender a monolithic cultural outlook in a culturally polyvalent society. The paper concludes that transculturalism could only manifest in a globally differing society if the walls of ethnocentrism and racism insulating it collapse. Curiously, transculturalism in Americanah ostensibly failed due to the obtrusive racial intolerance exhibited by the varied characters who appear to have determined to cling to the divisive racial sentiments identified in their attitude.

AB  - This article considers how contemporary representations of child molesters in scholarly, political, and popular culture participate in projects that revolve around the recuperation of heteronormativity. I argue that these multimodal obsessions with child molestation displace the resilience of entrenched homophobic fears, prejudices, and dispositions, giving the lie to the commonplace that the political advance of same-sex marriage in the United States signals the apotheosis of gay rights. My analysis focuses on two representative popular and scholarly texts: the long-running television series Law and Order: SVU and a scholarly article about the Jerry Sandusky case published in jac. The former capitalizes on a combination of stranger and familiar child molester figures, reflecting a mix of popular sex panic mythology and social reality. The latter reenacts this combination, so the discourse about the Sandusky case becomes imbricated in the convergences between mythology and social reality that characterize the television show.

AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students attending religious colleges and universities. This study used grounded theory to analyze the narratives (N = 271) of LGBTQ former and current students. The central theme described by LGBTQ students was a fight for survival with five subthemes: (a) institutionalized homo/transphobia (strict school policies, enforcement of heterosexuality and gender conformity through discipline, conversion therapy); (b) a culture of fear (fear of exposure, homophobic panic and code words, seeking cover); (c) marginalization and isolation; (d) struggle (suffering and suicide, reconciling faith and LGBTQ identity); and (e) coping and resilience (surviving through critical thinking and strategic activism). Implications for practice are provided.

AB  - To date very little literature exists examining theoretically-based models applied to day-to-day positive and negative affective well-being among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Grounded in the perspective of Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence. Psychological Bulletin, 129, 674-697. Minority Stress Model, the present study examined HIV- and sexual orientation-related factors influencing affective well-being (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, and stress). Participants were 154 HIV-positive LGB adults from an urban area in the southwestern United States. Data were drawn from an archival database (i.e., Project Legacy). The study methodology featured a cross-sectional self-report survey of minority stress, victimization, coping, and emotional well-being, among other subjects. Primary regression results were: (1) males reported less general stress than females; (2) higher internalized HIV-related stigma was associated with elevated negative affect; (3) higher internalized homophobia was associated with elevations in negative affect and general stress; (4) higher coping self-efficacy was associated with lesser negative affect, lesser general stress, greater positive affect, and greater satisfaction with life; (5) a significant interaction between HIV-related victimization and coping self-efficacy showed that coping self-efficacy was positively associated with positive affect only (only for non-victims). Contrary to expectations, coping self-efficacy demonstrated the largest main effects on affective well-being. Results are discussed with regard to potential need for theoretical refinement of Minority Stress Model applied to PLWHA and affective well-being outcomes. Recommendations are offered for future research.

AB  - Ethnic riots in India rarely lead to convictions of perpetrators and redress for victims. By implication, antagonisms prevail years after violence has ceased and victims often find themselves sharing everyday spaces with their attackers. The task of identifying the risk factors leading to ethnic violence as well as the nuances of coexistence for individuals ridden with memories of violence and prejudice is rife with methodological and ethical challenges. Concerns surrounding data quality are enhanced when the researcher is also an insider. In a study spanning 26 months (undertaken between 2010 and 2015), I examine the challenges of an insider researcher in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence that occurred in Gujarat in 2002, and offer techniques to improve data quality. Strategies include the cross-verification of sources within official data; interviewing respondents in group and individual settings to address the attitudinal fallacy; and employing respondent-empowered cognitive maps. I argue that visual data, such as cognitive maps, enable a better understanding of abstract social concepts and also facilitate a balance between distance and involvement for the insider researcher.

AB  - How might interventions that engage ordinary citizens in settings of violent conflict affect broader conflict dynamics? Given the volume of resources committed every year to citizen-oriented programs that attempt to promote peace, this is an important question. We develop a framework to analyze processes through which individual-level interventions could mitigate violent conflict escalation more broadly. Individual-level interventions may increase positive feelings toward the outgroup, as well as psychological, social, and material resources among participants. These have the potential to influence behaviors such as policing of the ingroup, public advocacy, and political action that can contribute to peace. Yet, the effectiveness of interventions to influence the conflict is moderated by contextual factors like groups' access to material resources, their positions in society, and political institutions. We use this analytical framework to assess evidence from recent intervention studies. We find that the current evidence base is quite small, does not cover the diversity of relevant contexts, and gives too little attention to resources and capacities that enable people to engage in conflict mitigation behaviors. Researchers and policy makers should go beyond thinking only about improving attitudes to thinking about behavior, resources, and capacities for such behaviors, and contextual conditions that constrain behavior.

AB  - This paper analyses the powerful stereotypical media discourse that shapes and reproduces a certain racialised and prejudiced perception of people identified as "Roma" in Germany. Using a close analysis of a single picture appearing as harmless at first glance - and through the reconstruction of its various interpretational contexts and semantics the paper identifies mechanisms used in stereotypical media coverage of "Roma". This qualitative analysis draws on media analysis of antigypsyism as well as on research of photographic construction of the "gypsy" in order to analyse the contemporary visual regime of "Roma" in Germany. As it portrays "the Roma" as a fundamentally different and socially deviant group, this visual stereotyping is shown to be an integral element of the persistent antigypsyist ideology, deeply embedded in German society.

KW  - Turkey
KW  - First Letter of Peter
AB  - The study focusses on converts from Islam to the Christian faith in Turkey. Converts are confronted with special challenges. Based on Islamic theology and Turkish nationalism most Turks cannot think of positive reasons to choose Christianity. So verbal assaults with social consequences like ostracism, prejudice, suspicion, and very low esteem are very common. The First Letter of Peter provides advice for strengthening new Christians by defining their identity as chosen und loved people of God.
   Personal caring for converts from Islam is crucial to provide a new "home" in assuring them of their new identity. They have to learn to evaluate accusations honestly, and from a faith-based position, and to integrate their new faith with their old environment. In the context of modern Turkey a fresh look at history can be meaningful: There were Turkish Christians before Islam, and there are still Christian Turkish people today. More important however is a genuine spiritual approach that understands verbal assaults within the framework of God's history with his people. Converts should find their identity "in Christ". At the same time, being in Christ must become practical in finding a new family in the local church and seeing themselves as part of the worldwide multinational body of Christ.

AB  - This study set out to explore the social-psychological aspects of living with HIV among a group of HIV-positive Colombian gay men in London, and the strategies that they deployed to manage ensuing threats to their identities. Focus group and individual interview data were collected from 14 Colombian gay men living with HIV, and were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis and identity process theory. The following themes are discussed: (1) identity struggles and conflicts in Colombia, (2), managing multiple layers of social stigma in England, and (3) changing interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, which highlight the inter-connections between sexual prejudice, sexual risk-taking and HIV stigma. Identity may be chronically threatened due to the multiple layers of stigma, which can limit the coping strategies available to individuals. Findings strongly support the need for action and programmes to highlight and tackle both racism and HIV stigma on the gay scene and to fund more specific resources for sub-communities of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, which employ appropriately trained and culturally competent staff.

KW  - Ghanaian mines
AB  - Gender equality plays a very significant role in our socioeconomic development and corporate innovations. However, the multinational Ghanaian mining is dominated by men and a culture of masculinity. The current paper, therefore, studies the Ghanaian mines, exposes their homogeneous scopes, and examines the sociocultural barriers constraining effective participation of women in mine works. The paper further explores the transformations that have occasioned a shift in gender dynamics, leading to an increased participation of women in mines. The results of deploying a multiple case study, qualitative research design, and meta-narratives of the respondents, point to common prejudices, perceptions, and implicit stereotyped notions of gender roles in the mines, as the sociocultural factors constraining the effective participation of women in mine jobs. Beyond the barriers, the paper intuits a women's revolution in the mines due to the collective efforts of mining companies and allied institutions, both adopting gender strategic measures such as the 'ore solidarity movement' gender mainstreaming in admission programs as well as gender equity-driven mining initiatives aimed at re-engineering a shift in gender dynamics of the mine jobs of Ghana. These change regimes among the mines imply inclusivity, de-feminization of poverty, a move towards achieving organizational modernization, competitiveness, and an assurance for gender equalitydriven social innovative mining.

AB  - At the turn of the nineteenth century, small numbers of elite, mixed-race Jamaicans traveled to India in order to improve their financial and social statuses. They did so by joining the East India Company Army, or by working as lawyers and civil servants. This global movement - starting in Jamaica, continuing to Britain, on to India, and oftentimes back to Britain - allowed these individuals to reposition their identity as East Indian nabobs, rather than as West Indian elites. By divorcing themselves from an enslaved, African past, they could live more effectively as white Britons. But, as anti-black prejudice escalated at the end of the eighteenth century, it became much more difficult for Jamaicans of color to undertake this journey successfully, as well as to reframe their identities.

Controlling for GPA and gender, reading variables were hypothesized as related to empathy; the relationship was expected to differ for males and females. For the complete sample, affective components were related to GPA but not reading. Perspective taking was related to reading appreciation but not GPA. For females, reading appreciation was related to perspective taking and empathic concern. For males, GPA and nonfiction reading were positively related, but both were negatively related to empathic concern. Results suggest reading may promote both academic achievement and social development. Findings and social implications are discussed.

AB  - Privilege is one of the central constructs social work educators reference to increase self-awareness and concern about inequality, but it is often oversimplified. This article argues how the concept of privilege can be made more credible to learners by anchoring it to everyday business-as-usual decision making, stereotyping, and various ideologies. Using a modified definition of privilege as privileging, and elaborating the definition of opportunity, the article describes the connections between opportunity distribution decisions, content of stereotypes, and belief systems, showing how educators can help students connect privileging at the individual and interpersonal levels to group-based inequality and sociocultural phenomena. The article also shows how using the privileging concept map can help students identify subtler contemporary examples of privileging and marginalization.

AB  - Recent scholarship has declared multiculturalism to be in retreat, yet multiculturalist discourses and practices remain salient in many realms of social reproduction. This paper explores multiculturalism in predominantly white churches in the U.S. South, a region that has seen significant demographic transformations due to immigration. Church outreach to immigrants draws on theologies that reject racial prejudice and that call for the accommodation and celebration of cultural differences. Drawing on qualitative research with pastors and congregants, this article explores how multiculturalist practice is both re-working and reinforcing existing social relationships in Christian faith communities. Multiculturalist practices, we show, disrupt racialized hierarchies long embedded in white churches. But they simultaneously leave racialized distinctions and inequalities intact, in part by maintaining separation between immigrants and non-immigrants. This case illustrates the everyday politics of multiculturalism and the ways in which the boundaries of social membership take shape in ordinary, seemingly non-political spaces.

AB  - Balancing the needs and demands of audiences, sponsors and shareholders and making wise curatorial decisions concerning the politics of display in an increasingly risk averse society, are dilemmas many contemporary museums are experiencing. This article utilizes a case study comparing curatorial approaches to 'risk management' at two Australian museums (Art Gallery of New South Wales Sydney, and Museum of Old and New Art Tasmania), in regard to contentious and 'difficult' topics. Based on empirical data, analysis will consider the role museums play as agents of social change in respect to counteracting prejudices and promoting appreciation of cultural differences through exhbitionary displays. Against the backdrop of the 'culture wars' and impact of media reporting, the writings of Ulrich Beck inform discussions surrounding different perspectives of museum professionals and audiences and how displays in the art museum conform to or contradict Beck's vision of 'reflective' modernity in an increasingly 'world risk society.'

AB  - Recently, implicit methods have been employed as a method to understand the underlying attitudes of the participant while also bypassing the social desirability biases that explicit measures are vulnerable to. Unfortunately, the literature has not considered the viewpoints of the individuals who participate in this process and the face validity they ascribe to the test's results. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore how individuals respond to engaging in and receiving the results of an implicit test that addresses a sensitive topic and exploring the subsequent methodological implications. Specifically, we conduct a qualitative exploratory study of individuals' reactions to their scores on the race-based implicit association test (IAT) using publically accessible comments from online message boards. Overall, we discuss four themes: the reporting of results, questioning IAT legitimacy, explicit racism/in-group behavior, and humor. Using a sensemaking theoretical framework, we discuss our findings and make recommendations for the future use of implicit tests.

AB  - Lo que nosotras sabiamos by Maria Ines Krimer portrays life in a cement-producing village in Argentina during the dictatorship. The narrative voicenosotras is that of wives of company managers who are reconstructing their memories and in the process seek the reasons behind the suicide of a woman in the village. There are references to ominous occurrences related to the dictatorship, and we discover that behind the appearance of normality lurks the sordid reality of a society complicit with the abuses of power. This study will consider how Lo que nosotras sabiamos fuses elements of the genero negro with a memory narrative to reproduce a discourse of social actors whothrough their prejudices, their alliance with power, and veil of secrecyserved to legitimize State terror. Recent work by memory theorists helps us understand how memory discourses function to enable individuals to come to terms with painful experiences and denounce human rights violations. However, in the case of the narrators, who repress the truth out of their interest in defending the regime, they are unable to give a unifying meaning to the past and find closure. Thus the reader becomes the ultimate detective who pieces together the clues.

AB  - Many transgender and gender-expansive young people live outside of mainstream society, due to structural barriers that limit access to employment, health care, education, and public accommodations, as well as prejudice and discrimination within their families and communities. These structural barriers can be understood as cisgenderism. Though a growing body of research examines lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth homelessness, gaps in knowledge about the specific experiences of transgender and gender-expansive homeless youth remain. This phenomenological qualitative investigation explored aspects of transgender and gender-expansive youth's experiences related to homelessness. This article focuses on participants' understanding of their pathways into homelessness.

AB  - The last decade has witnessed a proliferation of lesbian representations in European and North American popular culture, particularly within television drama and broader celebrity culture. The abundance of "positive" and "ordinary" representations of lesbians is widely celebrated as signifying progress in queer struggles for social equality. Yet, as this article details, the terms of the visibility extended to lesbians within popular culture often affirm ideals of hetero-patriarchal, white femininity. Focusing on the visual and narrative registers within which lesbian romances are mediated within television drama, this article examines the emergence of what we describe as "the lesbian normal." Tracking the ways in which the lesbian normal is anchored in a longer history of "the normal gay," it argues that the lesbian normal is indicative of the emergence of a broader post-feminist and post-queer popular culture, in which feminist and queer struggles are imagined as completed and belonging to the past. Post-queer popular culture is depoliticising in its effects, diminishing the critical potential of feminist and queer politics, and silencing the actually existing conditions of inequality, prejudice, and stigma that continue to shape lesbian lives.

AB  - In psychiatry, stigma means negative marking of the person only because s(he) has a diagnosis of mental disease, and usually this refers to schizophrenia. Stigmatization is related to prejudice, i.e. negative attitudes that are deeply rooted on false beliefs that schizophrenia cannot be treated.
   In principle, stigma is caused by combination of ignorance and fear which represents the basis of the creation of entrenched myths and prejudice. From a historical point of view, schizophrenia as a disease remains for public, one of the medical areas that are related to fear, a sense of discomfort, prejudice and avoidance.
   A combination of difficult mental disease, discrimination and stigmatization can be devastating for mentally disabled patients. Throughout history, stigma played significant role in patient's emotional and social isolation from other people deepening their suffering. A common consequence of stigma is discrimination which represents violation of basic human rights. Mentally disabled patients are often unjustifiably seen as dangerous, incapable, irresponsible which causes their isolation, homelessness and economic collapse. Thereby, possibilities for normal life, work, treatment, rehabilitation and social integration are decreased.

KW  - business economics
AB  - Articles on the research methodology to be used in Business Economics generally address the key aspects involved in designing the research, such as procedure, techniques of evidence gathering and analysis and associated tests of rigor and quality. However, researchers involved in some of the more "uncommon" scientific research methodologies (albeit necessary in social science) such as case studies have some rather more existential questions (Why and for what purpose should one use case studies in research?). They need answers to these questions if they are to overcome the technical problems of the research process and, above all, the prejudice against such methodologies encountered amongst the scientific community. As well as addressing the key aspects of research design, this paper sets out to discuss the raison d'etre of case study as a scientific research methodology. In doing so, it will use three principal questions in order to approach the discussion from a different perspective. These three questions are: is it desirable, is it necessary and is it possible to perform research using case studies? In answering these questions, it is hoped to provide robust arguments that will justify the use of this methodology, as well as substantial elements for building appropriate and rigorous designs for scientifically-based and focused case study research.
