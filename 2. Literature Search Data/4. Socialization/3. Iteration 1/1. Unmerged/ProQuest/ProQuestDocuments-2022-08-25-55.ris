T1  - The racialization of danger: patterns and ambiguities in the relation between Islam, security and secularism in the Netherlands
AN  - 2424463790
AB  - The question of European foreign fighters in Syria has transformed security and counter-radicalization into important pillars of the liberal secular governance of Muslims in Europe. By exploring how Dutch integration and counter-radicalization policies connect the idea of danger to Muslims and Islam, de Koning analyses how admission to the Dutch nation-state is regulated according to what kind of deficiencies outsiders are thought to have, locating them in ideas about ‘race’, culture and religion. By focusing on the idea of a racialization of danger, de Koning argues, first, that, already prior to 9/11, a securitization logic existed in Dutch policies in which a form of Islam that was perceived to be ‘unacceptable’ was regarded as a potential danger to social cohesion and the rule of law. And, second, in analysing the process of racialization, that we should take into account its ambiguities in order to understand how the racialization of Muslims works.

T1  - A Troubling Presence: Indigeneity in English‐Language Canadian Sociology
AN  - 2355836486
AB  - Over the past decade Canadian sociology has engaged in spirited debates on the sociology of sociological research, but it has barely begun to address its relation to Indigenous theorizing, scholarship, and politics. How does the discipline deal with the settler colonial history and current realities of Indigenous social lives, and where is the place in our field for Indigenous voices and perspectives? Drawing on Coulthard's politics of recognition and Tuck's damage‐centered research, we present here the first systematic empirical analysis of the place of Indigeneity in the Canadian Review of Sociology and the Canadian Journal of Sociology. We situate the presence of Indigeneity in Canadian sociology journals in the sociopolitical context of the time, and examine how imperialism, statism, and damage are oriented within the two journals. Most importantly, we challenge the silence in the discipline's intellectual frames and research programs with respect to Indigenous theorizing about the social world.Alternate abstract:RésuméAu cours de la dernière décennie, la sociologie canadienne s'est engagée dans des débats animés sur la sociologie relative à la recherche en sociologie, mais elle ne fait que commencer à aborder ses relations avec la théorisation, les bourses et la politique touchant les Autochtones. Comment cette discipline traite‐t‐elle de l'histoire coloniale et des réalités actuelles de la vie sociale des Autochtones, et quelle place fait‐on dans notre domaine à leur voix et à leurs perspectives? En tirant parti des politiques de reconnaissance de Coulthard (2014) et de la recherche de Tuck axée sur les préjudices (2009), nous vous présentons ici la première analyse empirique systématique de la place de l'indigénéité dans la Revue canadienne de sociologie et dans les Cahiers canadiens de sociologie. Dans des revues de sociologie, nous situons la présence de l'indigénéité dans le contexte socio‐politique de l’époque et examinons comment l'impérialisme, l’étatisme et les préjudices sont orientés dans ces deux publications. Et, par‐dessus tout, nous remettons en cause le silence des cadres intellectuels et des programmes de recherche de cette discipline à l’égard de la théorisation autochtone au sujet du domaine social.

T1  - The impact of biological and cultural racisms on attitudes towards immigrants and immigration public policies
AN  - 2376776197
AB  - Based on ESS-7 data, this paper focuses on two attitudinal dimensions about public policies related to immigration: how many can come and who can come. In this context, the hypothesis concerning the bi-dimensionality of racism was supported and, as predicted, biological racism is more anti-normative than cultural racism. Both biological and cultural racism predict opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria on the selection of immigrants. As hypothesised, the relationship between racism and opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria is mediated by threat perceptions. Specifically, symbolic and realistic threats mediate the effect of biological and cultural racism on opposition to immigration and on ethnicist criteria. The hypothesis that the mediation effects are moderated by the country’s quality of democracy was supported, indicating that the mediation effects are stronger in countries with a higher quality of democracy. Results are discussed within the context of racism theories as a bi-dimensional concept and in the framework of the role of legitimation processes in social discrimination.

T1  - Modern Notions of Accent-ism: Findings, Conceptualizations, and Implications for Interventions and Research on Nonnative Accents
AN  - 2325825979
AB  - Nonnative-accented speakers face prevalent discrimination. The assumption that people freely express negative sentiments toward nonnative speakers has also guided common research methods. However, recent studies did not consistently find downgrading, so that prejudice against nonnative accents might even be questioned at first sight. The present theoretical article will bridge these contradictory findings in three ways: (a) We illustrate that nonnative speakers with foreign accents frequently may not be downgraded in commonly used first-impression and employment scenario paradigms. It appears that relatively controlled responding may be influenced by norms and motivations to respond without prejudice, whereas negative biases emerge in spontaneous responding. (b) We present an integrative view based on knowledge on modern forms of prejudice to develop modern notions of accent-ism, which allow for predictions when accent biases are (not) likely to surface. (c) We conclude with implications for interventions and a tailored research agenda.

T1  - Beyond Islamophobia? The role of Englishness and English national identity within English Defence League discourse and politics
AN  - 2299329690
AB  - Unsurprisingly, most scholarship on the English Defence League (EDL) focuses on the Islamophobic nature of the group's politics. This has found that, whilst the group presents a more moderate, public-facing image, the EDL's backstage discourse is a far less nuanced brand of Islamophobia and cultural racism (Allen, C. (2011). Opposing Islamification or promoting Islamophobia? Understanding the English Defence League. Patterns of Prejudice, 45(4), 279-294; Kassimeris, G., & Jackson, L. (2015). The ideology and discourse of the English Defence League: 'Not racist, not violent, just no longer silent'. British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 17, 171-188). A more fundamental area of EDL ideology has been left unexamined, however: what notion of 'England' is the EDL trying to 'defend'? Using content analysis of EDL online discourse, this article examines how the EDL articulates, represents, and uses English national identity within its discourse and politics.

T1  - Who Is Prejudiced, and Toward Whom? The Big Five Traits and Generalized Prejudice
AN  - 2285657283
AB  - Meta-analyses show that low levels of Openness and Agreeableness correlate with generalized prejudice. However, previous studies narrowly assessed prejudice toward low-status, disadvantaged groups. Using a broad operationalization of generalized prejudice toward a heterogeneous array of targets, we sought to answer two questions: (a) Are some types of people prejudiced against most types of groups? and (b) Are some types of people prejudiced against certain types of groups? Across four samples (N = 7,543), Openness was very weakly related to broad generalized prejudice, r = −.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) [−.07, −.001], whereas low Agreeableness was reliably associated with broad generalized prejudice, r = −.23, 95% CI [−.31, −.16]. When target characteristics moderated relationships between Big Five traits and prejudice, they implied that perceiver–target dissimilarity on personality traits explains prejudice. Importantly, the relationship between Agreeableness and prejudice remained robust across target groups, suggesting it is the personality trait orienting people toward (dis)liking of others.

T1  - Direct and indirect effects of prejudice: sexism, information, and voting behavior in political campaigns
AN  - 2571083821
AB  - This paper examines the effects of gender-based prejudice on candidate evaluation and voting behavior. It uses a unique experimental design to test for direct effects of sexism on candidate evaluation and voting behavior, as well as indirect effects of sexism on these variables via the information that subjects seek out about women candidates. I find that subjects with higher scores on items measuring modern sexism are less likely to vote for female candidates, less likely to vote “correctly” when their preferences most closely align with a female candidate, and rate female candidates more negatively than their male counterparts. I also find that subjects high in sexism search for less information about women candidates and that less information search also leads to lower feeling thermometer ratings, a lower likelihood of voting for women candidates, and a lower likelihood of casting a “correct” vote for a woman. In sum, sexism has both direct and indirect effects on subjects’ voting behavior.

AN  - 2330737144
AB  - In this paper I discuss Islamophobia as a form of racism especially intensified in the press and media. The women in my study talked about how they coped with what they saw as a backlash of Islamophobia. I show how they have come to deal with the effects of this in their everyday life. Even though most of the women in my study were born and raised in Britain, this antipathy towards Muslims has made them question their sense of belonging. This paper brings to light the experiences of prejudice and discrimination from the perspective of middle-class British-Pakistanis.

T1  - The Relationships of Intergroup Ideologies to Ethnic Prejudice: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2252656494
AB  - This meta-analysis summarizes the results of research on the relationships of majority group members’ endorsement of assimilation, colorblindness, multiculturalism, and the relative relationships of colorblindness and multiculturalism to ethnic prejudice. Random effects analyses found that assimilation was positively related to explicit prejudice (g. = 0.80), multiculturalism was negatively related to both explicit (g. = −0.26) and implicit prejudice (g. = −0.19), and colorblindness was negatively related to explicit prejudice (g. = −0.07). Multiculturalism was more closely associated with low prejudice than colorblindness (g. = 0.15). Effect sizes varied as a function of methodology (experimental vs. correlational), country in which research was conducted (United States vs. other countries), and, in experimental studies of multiculturalism, type of prime used (abstract vs. concrete). Discussion points include methodological issues, groups used as targets of prejudice, national diversity norms, additional issues raised in the studies reviewed, and directions for future research.

T1  - Embodying 'the Nordic race': imaginaries of Viking heritage in the online communications of the Nordic Resistance Movement
AN  - 2238516152
AB  - Kølvraa's article focuses on the cultural imaginary of the Scandinavian extreme right by analysing the online presence of the so-called Nordic Resistance Movement. He seeks to show how the cultural imaginaries of this National Socialist organization make use of the Scandinavian Viking heritage in three distinct ways. First, to produce a distinctly Nordic form of National Socialism and thus potentially make this ideology palatable to Nordic publics. Second, to differentiate their racially oriented political project from a wider far-right or populist right concern with the defence of European Christian heritage and/or civilization against Islam. And, third, to thematize and perform a certain hyper-masculine identity, especially in the context of martial and sporting competitions arranged by the organization.

T1  - "There's a difference between Black people and n******": A cultural contracts exploration of interracial communication barriers
AN  - 2238258486
AB  - Fear, prejudice, and racism create communication barriers between Black and White individuals which complicates interracial communication (Hopson, 2011). This qualitative, interpretive analysis is framed by cultural contracts theory (Jackson, 2002, 2009) and informed by 31 interviews with White participants as co-researchers. Thematic analysis (Braun & Clark, 2006; Owen, 1984) revealed White interviewees held ready-to-sign cultural contracts about Black community members, with no room for (re)negotiation. Specifically, interview narratives exposed the follow dominant group members' fears: having an affinity for or against particular types of Black people; fearing predominantly Black geographic locations; preferring not to be the only White person in the room; the belief that Black people are responsible for White's pejorative ascriptions about them, and the claim that Black people hinder themselves.

T1  - The Short and Longer Term Impacts of Hate Crimes Experienced Directly, Indirectly, and Through the Media
AN  - 2234434670
AB  - A longitudinal study (N = 774) explored the short and longer term impacts of anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans (LGBT) hate crime experienced directly, indirectly, and through the media. In the short term, being a victim (direct) or personally knowing of a hate crime victim (indirect) was positively associated with vulnerability, emotional responses, and behavioral intentions after reading about a hate crime. Direct victims were also less empathic toward other victims and engaged in more victim-blaming. A structural equation model showed direct experiences (via personal vulnerability and empathy) and media experiences (via group-threat and victim-blaming) to be cross-sectionally associated with behavioral intentions. Media experiences also had lasting demobilizing impacts on actual behaviors, again serially mediated by group-threat and victim-blaming. The findings highlight the emotional and behavioral impacts of hate crimes on both direct victims and on the wider LGBT community. They also raise questions about media reporting of hate crimes and the role of victim-blaming.

T1  - Personal Ties and Prejudice: A Meta-Analysis of Romantic Attachment and Ambivalent Sexism
AN  - 2234434262
AB  - We examine how relational needs underlie sexism by conducting a meta-analysis (k = 22; N = 4,860) on the links between adults’ romantic attachment and endorsement of ambivalent sexism. Results across two random-effects meta-analytic methods supported that men’s and women’s attachment anxiety predicted stronger endorsement of both benevolent sexism and hostile sexism. Simultaneously, men’s attachment avoidance predicted lower endorsement of benevolent sexism, and for men in relationships (vs. single men), stronger endorsement of hostile sexism. Thus, the way that people fulfil their relational goals lead people to adopt particular attitudes about gender, supporting that relationships are one key source of people’s adoption of sexism. These results bridge attachment theory and ambivalent sexism theory by illustrating how individual differences in the amplification or suppression of needs for relational security fuel adoption of beliefs that function to maintain gender inequality across the world.

T1  - Exploring Blacks’ Perceptions of Whites’ Racial Prejudice as a Function of Intergroup Behavior and Motivational Mindsets
AN  - 2231382896
AB  - When Whites believe prejudice cannot change, they often adopt a behavioral style that is intended to reduce the possibility that they are seen as racist (i.e., performance-oriented behaviors). The present research tests the possibility that these performance-oriented behaviors may be interpreted, ironically, as racist. Across two studies, Black participants viewed performance-oriented behaviors as indicating racial prejudice. Additionally, when Black participants were led to believe that Whites’ racial prejudice could not change, they perceived Whites as more prejudiced. This research highlights a potential source of misunderstanding in interracial interactions and offers implications for improving interracial interactions from target and perpetrator perspectives.

T1  - Identity Questioning: Antecedents and Consequences of Prejudice Attributions
AN  - 2241815629
AB  - Many ethnic minorities in the United States hold both an ethnic minority and national American identity. Yet, they often encounter identity questioning when asked questions such as, “Where are you really from?,” which may operate as an ambiguous threat to their national identity. Because varied motivations (curiosity versus exclusion) create ambiguity, targets likely vary in their tendency to view identity questioning as prejudicial. Study 1 examined the extent to which ethnic minorities attribute identity questioning to prejudice, and the associated well‐being consequences. Study 2 examined the immigration policy‐oriented antecedents of identity questioning prejudice attributions. The results suggest that prejudice attributions are psychologically harmful (Study 1) and are associated with anti‐immigration policies (Study 2). Because identity questioning challenges one's ability to maintain a dual identity, it is important to better understand identity questioning. Specifically, these findings provide initial evidence of the role policy contexts may play in shaping identity questioning attributions.

T1  - Intimate Partner Violence Against Disabled Persons: Clinical and Health Impact, Intersections, Issues and Intervention Strategies
AN  - 2114944858
AB  - One of the crimes currently affecting our society is intimate partner violence (IPV), which is regarded as a major global health issue especially affecting women. These health problems concern every citizen, but even more so for women with disabilities who are more exposed to dependence, prejudice and marginalisation. Although a greater focus has been placed on IPV against women with disabilities during the last decade, data about the incidence of violence still need to be confirmed and the way by which abuse situations are perpetuated has not been clarified, especially regarding what the practical aid for women living in this situation might be. This work highlights the clinical impact of the IPV phenomenon on women with disabilities, describes the difficulties experienced while dealing with this phenomenon and suggests the most appropriate intervention strategies. Our work found that people with disabilities are at a higher risk of facing IPV when compared to individuals without disabilities. The results unquestionably show that such acts of violence are often not even reported, partly because of sentimental, emotional and economic reasons. Finally, we point out policies and initiatives aimed at helping people with disabilities tackle the phenomenon.

T1  - The fascist who would be king: Count Geoffrey Potocki de Montalk
AN  - 2209973546
AB  - Macklin and Fowlie explore the political life of Count Potocki de Montalk, a poet, pagan and pretender to the Polish throne. Count Potocki is perhaps most famous as a minor cause célèbre among London's literary intelligentsia after his imprisonment for obscene libel in 1932. Historians, when they consider him at all, often discount him, viewing him as little more than a colourful eccentric, a view reinforced by Stephanie de Montalk's fascinating biography of the man, which appeared in 2001. Eccentric he most certainly was. However, as this article demonstrates, Potocki also played a key role as an enabler of fascist and extreme right-wing activism through the services he provided myriad groups as a printer of their literature, a career that spanned the interwar and post-war periods. The article examines how his preposterous pursuit of the Polish Crown, coupled with the innate elitism this engendered, led him to reject egalitarianism and democracy and embrace fascism. While the Spanish Civil War saw an outpouring of literature from his literary contemporaries in support of the Spanish Republic, Potocki responded by establishing The Right Review as a mouthpiece for his own personal mélange of monarchism and fascism. Utilizing newly released security service files combined with archival research in the newly deposited Searchlight archive at Northampton University, this article pays closer attention to the political side of Potocki's activities than has hitherto been the case, particularly his wartime publishing activities. This includes his anti-Soviet pamphlet on the Katyn massacre, which caused great vexation in government circles for fear of the harm Potocki's (correct) accusations might do to relations with Britain's crucial wartime ally. The authors conclude with a detailed examination of the role Potocki played in post-war National Socialist networks, for both personal and political ends, not least of which was his continued efforts to further his claim to the Polish throne, which he never ceased to believe was his by divine right.

T1  - Authoritarianism Reimagined: The Riddle of Trump’s Base
AN  - 2558593869
AB  - Social scientists are often reluctant to think that cruel words express actual personal cruelty—so when they hear people speak harshly about minorities or women, they tend to blame stress and anxiety, not hate. In that spirit, it is often said that voters who favored Donald Trump in 2016 supported him not because they vibrated with his vindictive rhetoric but rather because they were fearful about their finances. However, many recent studies, including my papers with Eric Hanley, undermine that claim. Financial worries were widespread and did not distinguish Republicans from Democrats in 2016. Rather, what typified Trump partisans was the vehemence of their prejudices—for a domineering leader who would “crush evil” and “get rid of rotten apples” and against feminists, liberals, immigrants, and minorities. My contention here is that grasping this point is essential if we hope to understand the kind of authoritarianism that Trump represents.

T1  - The has-beens and never will-bes
AN  - 2170826380
AB  - The Australian team that toured India in 1935/36 comprised atypical cricket personnel. Their cultural and social unorthodoxy contributed to the tour being shunned by cricket officialdom in Australia. Tour manager, Frank Tarrant's method of team selection was meritocratic unlike that of customary cricket practice where social and cultural hierarchy informed team composition. This article outlines the unorthodox team composition and argues that the official cricket body objected to the exercise because of the professional nature of the tour, social (particularly class) discrimination and preconceptions of racial prejudices. The Maharaja of Patiala's generous financing of the tour identified it as a definitively professional exercise and encouraged participation considering the precarious status of the global economy following the Great Depression. The goodwill between Australia and India evidenced on tour challenged cricket protocol and reflects a pragmatic and growing recognition that diplomatic and economic unity was desirable in light of the imminent dissolution of the British Empire.

T1  - Darkies Never Dream: Race, Racism, and the Black Imagination in Science Fiction
AN  - 2294473884
AB  - Russell discusses race, racism, and the Black imagination in science fiction. He argues that black engagement with the genre has been marked less by absence than by invisibility, that is, by a failure framed by popular prejudices, stereotypes, and social expectations embraced by both those within the genre and outside it to perceive that presence. Moreover, he argues that this apparent absence of blacks from the genre has been employed to reify socially entrenched notions that portray blacks as lacking the mental agility to engage in visionary speculation or so encumbered by the oppressive realities of everyday racism that their imaginative abilities have been impaired, a view that has prevented those who subscribe to it from examining the actual intersections between blacks and the genre--however peripheral that presence in the genre may at first appear.

T1  - A Critical Enquiry of Racism 'within the idioms of religion' in America
AN  - 2160339284
AB  - American attitude grew more intolerant towards Islam and Muslims after 9/11 developing a different type of racism defined as 'Islamophobia'. Insisting that no single explanation effectively reported for the range of American racism, the paper proposed to establish a link between racism and Islamophobia. The study was qualitative and analyzed the data within Fredrickson's concept of racism as scavenger ideology, reviewing researches from twentieth century scholarship. It claimed that racism as a manifestation of antiIslam prejudice had sustained in the history of America. Islamophobia as an ideological war is brought forward to justify Western particularly American racism in the backdrop of 9/11 terrorist attacks. It is not a new concept but a fabrication of the old animosity. The study offered a historical record of racism through which an inclusive account of Islamophobia was elaborated. It concluded that the entwined concepts spelled new life and ideology construction embedded in religious fear around the globe. It is significant as it will fill the gap in the contemporary research by examining the question of Islamophobia in relation to racism in a substantive manner.

T1  - Magic and Fate in Eighteenth-Century London: Prosecutions for Fortune-Telling, c. 1678-1830
AN  - 2114711591
AB  - London newspaper and court records of the long eighteenth century constitute good records for the study of magical beliefs and practices, provided that allowances are made for the nascent middle-class prejudices of their compilers. These records reveal, nonetheless, that both middle- and lower-class Londoners resorted to fortune-telling. Popular prognostic services, long called upon to answer specific queries, began more to resemble counselling after 1700, in so doing supplying their clients with self-knowledge and a greater sense of agency.

T1  - Metric of Rebarbarization: Real Time in The Authoritarian Personality
AN  - 2148952857
AB  - “The essay as form,” Adorno (1984: 160) writes in The Authoritarian Personality, seeks to understand concepts as they “are already unconsciously named in language.” This is not exactly philology since it is only in pressing the given meanings further than their given sense that they can be grasped reflectively. The intention, then, in this essay, written between November 9, 2016, and November 9, 2017, is to enunciate what authoritarianism has come to mean in the wake of the American presidential election of Donald Trump. The point made is that domination is self-destruction, now immediately so, and that its metric is cognizable in a critical understanding of the received idea of “real time.” Following an introduction titled “Undercount Nation,” the essay proceeds in six sections: (I) Studies in Prejudice, Primordial Restitution, Interpretation neither Stringent nor Arbitrary; (2) Savage Beating, Get Even for What?, The Use of Humankind; (3) The Authoritarian Personality, Is It Fascism?, Transcendental Deduction of Psychoanalysis; (4) The Uninterpretation of Dreams; (5) Primitive Thread of Human History; and (6) Historical Trend: Real Time. The essay as a whole is a commentary on Adorno et al.’s The Authoritarian Personality.

T1  - A Rabbi's Impressions of the Oberammergau Passion Play: Joseph Krauskopf, Antisemitism, and the Limits of the Transnational Jewish Public Sphere
AN  - 2131570536
AB  - Performed at regular intervals since 1634, the passion play at Oberammergau in Bavaria has in recent decades become a byword for the allegedly timeless continuities of European and especially German anti-Jewish prejudice. This article explores the publication and reception of the first significant attempt to accuse Oberammergau of antisemitism: Joseph Krauskopf's A Rabbi's Impressions of the Passion Play, published in Philadelphia in 1901. The specific context of American Reform Judaism at the turn of the century contributed to the nature and timing of Krauskopf's attack on the play, but although Krauskopf achieved limited success among both Christiaan a,nd Jewish audiences in the United States, Britain, and Germany, Jewish feminist Bertha Pappenheim's subsequent efforts to publish a German translation of his book ultimately failed. Krauskopfs difficulties in turning either American or European public opinion against the Oberammergau play expose the obstacles to the ideal of an integrated transnational Jewish public sphere at the dawn of the twentieth century.

T1  - Profit and prejudice: a critique of private English language education in Vietnam
AN  - 2121506611
AB  - It is 30 years since Vietnam implemented the 'Doi Moi' economic reforms. The subsequent influx of capital was accompanied by a general infiltration of foreign influences, arguably none more important than the English language. This article focuses on an area where market and language converge: the private English as a second language industry. Drawing upon the ideas of Pierre Bourdieu, the article utilises the experiences of teachers to examine industry practices, with particular emphasis on the consequences of education commodification. The article locates its findings within the wider contexts of Vietnamese education, economy and the global propagation of the English language and market ideals. These findings depict a profit-driven industry where the customer always being right is not always right for the customer.

T1  - Lawyers on the Spanish Atlantic on the eve of the revolutionary era
AN  - 2089865301
AB  - Why did lawyers grow sympathetic to revolution in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century? This article addresses this question by examining the legal profession in the Spanish empire. It relies on the work of historians who have analysed the bar in specific places in Iberia and the Americas, as well as additional sources. At the same time, it avoids dividing lawyers into "metropolitan" and "colonial" practitioners, given similarities in legal practice and royal justice in the various crownlands on both sides of the Atlantic. It examines the Bourbon Reforms, the juridical Enlightenment, and social-class origins. It discusses how the onslaught of the French Revolution led Charles IV to sponsor a campaign against lawyers, undermining a relatively harmonious relationship between crown and bar that had existed during the Enlightenment. On the eve of the revolution, many young and entrepreneurial lawyers professed radical ideas about sovereignty, equality, and judicial reform, but faced a saturated profession in which they were prejudiced by royal laws and the recalcitrance of elders. Many came from middle-class backgrounds and represented heterogeneous clienteles. They were eminently familiar with feudal and racial tensions on the eve of the disintegration of the Old Regime.

T1  - What is an open mind?
AN  - 2036724933
AB  - In this article, I suggest that an open mind wholly unburdened by preconceptions and prejudgments is a mistaken ideal. Not only is it unrealistic; it deprives us of context and background knowledge relevant to judging well. I begin with two cases that show how the ideal of the “prejudice-free” mind, though appealing, may end up thwarting good judgment: blind assessment and “blank-slate” jury selection (the ideal of empaneling jurors without prejudgments). I then trace the prejudice-free ideal to the Enlightenment, exposing its roots in the subject-object worldview. Drawing on Heidegger, I suggest that the subject-object worldview is misguided and that all judgment involves a prior understanding of the matter we judge. To have an open mind, paradoxically, is to have a stake in defending a prior understanding, to be possessed of an understanding of the good that one wishes (at least provisionally) to promote. I then draw out the implications of this view for how we might make sense of cultural differences, examining the difference between the practice of marriage based on a romantic conception of love, and that of arranged marriage. By thinking through these two practices, seemingly opposed, we can arrive at a conception of marriage and love that preserves both.

T1  - 'Don't just look for a new pet': the Vietnamese airlift, child refugees and the dangers of toxic humanitarianism
AN  - 2031358145
AB  - The Kindertransport remains the most common historical point of reference in contemporary debates over the present position of refugees in Europe. Taylor's article instead focuses on a very different emergency movement of children-the airlift of ninety-nine 'orphans' from Vietnam before the fall of Saigon in April 1975-as a historical point of entry into Britain's relationship with child refugees. Although superficially a one-off event, and an example of 'toxic' humanitarianism, in fact it is suggestive of some of the key themes of modern refugee history. These include the tendency of humanitarianism to hollow out political contexts from the objects of their concern; the prominent, and sometimes problematic, role of voluntary organizations in the movement, reception and resettlement of refugees; and the place of expressions of spontaneous compassion by individuals who become involved in refugee operations. Taylor's article suggests that all these themes could fruitfully bear greater historical attention.

T1  - Truly, madly, deeply ... nostalgically? Britain's on-off love affair with refugees, past and present
AN  - 2031357047
AB  - Britain's response to the recent refugee crisis is marked by its absence. Kushner's article explores how constructions of the past have been instrumentalized by defenders of government restrictionism and those demanding that more should be let in. His particular focus is on child refugees and the comparisons drawn (and rejected) to the Kindertransport. Through discussion in parliament, the media, cultural productions and among ordinary people, he shows the importance of 'history' and how references to the Second World War and the Holocaust have tended to help justify rather than query the exclusion of today's refugees, thereby providing a very different example to Germany. He also explores the role of sentimentalism in positive responses to refugees and how this encourages empathy but can also limit effective entry policies and treatment of the forcibly displaced.

T1  - Fostering Mutual Understanding Among Muslims and Non-Muslims Through Counterstereotypical Information: An Educational versus Metacognitive Approach
AN  - 2019337480
AB  - Fostering interfaith tolerance may help to reduce religious tensions. The authors examined the attitudes of Christians, Muslims, and people with no religious affiliation toward different religions and explored whether their negative attitudes toward other faiths could be ameliorated. Participants (N = 298) were asked about their attitudes toward Judaism, Christianity, and Islam before they were randomly assigned to either a metacognitive intervention or an educational intervention. Information was conveyed in a simple narrative form in the educational condition. In the metacognitive condition, participants were first asked apparently simple questions that frequently elicited incorrect responses. This was followed by corrective information. Both Christian and Muslim participants appraised their own religion as the most peaceful and tolerant. The educational approach was more effective in reducing stereotypes about Islam among non-Muslims, whereas the metacognitive approach was more successful in lessening prejudice about Christianity among Muslims. Muslims displayed overconfidence in their responses related to religious topics.

T1  - Germany and Italy: the ‘odd couple’ at the heart of Europe
AN  - 2569576778
AB  - This article analyses the historical roots of the recent revival of the mutual prejudice between Germany and Italy in European politics. The paper seeks to explain the longevity of stereotyped representations of ‘the other’ in German-Italian relations down to the present day. To this end, both the national post-war memories and the ‘memory cultures’ of the two countries have to be taken into account. Furthermore, it argues that the resurgence of mutual prejudice between Germany and Italy can also be seen as the expression of a recurrent historical pattern in European politics after 1945. Despite the image of peaceful cooperation that has often been conveyed, the history of European integration has seen disagreements and conflict between the member states, periodically exhuming historic bones of contention and asymmetries. At points of heightened tension, one-sided or controversial post-war historical memories have tended to surface, steeped in stereotype, commonplace and prejudice. One recurrent cause of tension between Italy and Germany has been the prospect of a ‘variable-geometry’ or ‘multiple-speed’ Europe.

T1  - 'The biggest gang'? Police and people in the 2011 England riots
AN  - 2012873823
AB  - Conflict with the police is a staple of civil disorder and the English riots of 2011 were no exception. The antagonism towards the police expressed by the rioters varied in intensity - from a low-level anger stemming from occasional negative experiences on the one hand to outright, visceral hostility on the other - but was visible everywhere riots took place. Leading politicians dismissed this hostility as nothing more than the typical wariness criminals have of the police. Indeed, it is undoubtedly the case that the police are an easy target for rioters seeking to explain away their conduct. Nevertheless, drawing on 270 interviews with people involved in the riots this paper shows that for some involved the police were a very deliberate and specific focus of anger and resentment. The basis of such feelings was complex and variable, but included historically poor relations between the police and particular communities, an inherited distrust of the police as an institution, to more particular and immediate experiences of mistreatment and prejudice - often coalescing around the perceived misuse of police powers such as stop and search.

T1  - After Charlie: the unravelling of the French republican response
AN  - 1992735530
AB  - Starting with the assault on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on 7 January 2015, the French Republic has endured a series of terrorist attacks, culminating in the massacre of civilians on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice on 14 July 2016, an outrage deliberately and symbolically timed to coincide with the Bastille Day celebration. During this period, the governing and other elites in France attempted to foster a sense of national unity around key republican values as the most effective response to the threat posed by terrorism. After examining the inconsistent postures struck by the French socialist government in the months following the outrages of 2015 and 2016, Raymond's article will analyse the contradictions of the previous administration in order to illustrate the argument that the problematic relationship between race, identity and secularism cuts across the traditional ideological cleavages of left and right. The failure of leading mainstream political figures to articulate an effective and unifying discourse in the face of the terrorist threat to France is not, however, purely a failure of communication. Raymond will address the adequacy of a blueprint for social cohesion shaped by the Third Republic and exemplified by the formal separation of church and state in 1905. He considers whether the traditional understanding of what it means to belong to the 'one and indivisible' republic has problematized the sense of national self-esteem and contributed to the current tension in France.

T1  - The sigh of the oppressed: The palliative effects of ideology are stronger for people living in highly unequal neighbourhoods
AN  - 2008938293
AB  - Ideologies that legitimize status hierarchies are associated with increased well‐being. However, which ideologies have ‘palliative effects’, why they have these effects, and whether these effects extend to low‐status groups remain unresolved issues. This study aimed to address these issues by testing the effects of the ideology of Symbolic Prejudice on well‐being among low‐ and high‐status ethnic groups (4,519 Europeans and 1,091 Māori) nested within 1,437 regions in New Zealand. Results showed that Symbolic Prejudice predicted increased well‐being for both groups, but that this relationship was stronger for those living in highly unequal neighbourhoods. This suggests that it is precisely those who have the strongest need to justify inequality that accrue the most psychological benefit from subscribing to legitimizing ideologies.

T1  - Proverbs in Lubukusu and Ekegusii in Kenya: Empowering or Disempowering for Women and Girls?
AN  - 1948913960
AB  - Research about the Kenyan women has primarily been conducted from socio-demographic perspectives. Such approaches, while important, are not exhaustive. This paper reports on the findings of a study that focused on the socio-linguistic perspectives that explore the place and role of women and girls in the society. Thus, this paper also set out to investigate how proverbs portray women and girls, and effect on gender identity and the implications of proverb messages to achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals. Data of the study comprised thirty eight Bukusu and Gusii proverbs related to (dis)empowerment of women and girls; ethnography was used to select the proverbs, the data analysis focused on the representation of women through the examination of the meanings of the respective proverbs using the language dominance framework by Lakoff Zimmerman and feminist theories of the Radicals and Critical Discourse Analysis by Norman Fairclough. The findings revealed that women are portrayed as inferior, worthless and weak and thus constructed in specific roles as domestic workers, wives and caretakers. Consequently, such specific roles marginalize and discriminate women and girls in issues of decision making, participation, resource distribution and policy formulation due to the prejudice. Such discriminative proverbs slow the achievement of development goals. The paper concludes that in order to realize the UN Millennium Development Goals, there is a need to eliminate or re-conceptualize some of the proverbs which reinforce gender parity and also reform the language to suit the needs of the society.

T1  - Block and thread intercultural narratives and positioning: conversations with newly arrived postgraduate students
AN  - 1911618908
AB  - This paper considers how, in the process of positioning that is implicit in every interaction, all of us employ multiple and often competing narratives when we talk about cultural identity and our relationships with new cultural environments. In interviews with newly arrived postgraduate students about their experience of travelling to study abroad, the students employ competing block and thread narratives. Block narratives represent an essentialist discourse of culture. As such, they are easily converted into cultural prejudice by blocking the possibility for understanding and sharing at the point of tolerating an Other who can never be like 'us'. These are default narratives because of the way in which we are brought up in our societies within a global positioning and politics. Thread narratives instead support a critical cosmopolitan discourse of cultural travel and shared meanings across structural boundaries that act against cultural prejudice. Threads need to be nurtured as alternative forms of engagement. Therefore, there is a place for the researchers to intervene with their own thread narratives. This intervention is both allowed within and supported by an understanding that researchers join with their participants in the creative intercultural events of the interview.

T1  - Russian Jewish socialists and antisemitism: the case of Grigorii Aronson
AN  - 1973045528
AB  - Among all the socialist strategies and responses to antisemitism, those developed and applied in Russia before 1917 command our attention because of the violence and ubiquity of antisemitism, and because of the principal role of socialists in promoting democracy and revolution in the Russian empire. A significant part of the socialist movement to in Russia was in the hands of Jewish socialists because of the disproportionately large number of Jews in Russian revolutionary parties. This was even more the case in the Pale of Settlement, where Russia's Jewish population was concentrated and where the first Marxist party in the Russian Empire, the Bund, flourished. Jewish members of socialist parties were, however, inhibited from pleading the case of Jews due to the internationalist, even anti-nationalist, political position of most socialists. Surh's article explores the response to antisemitism among Jewish socialists, primarily in the Pale, by considering the career of the revolutionary Social Democrat, Grigorii Aronson, in the period before 1914. Aronson joined and worked with the Bund for a short while but, for most of his career, he was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party (RSDRP), first as a Bolshevik and, from 1917 until the end of his life, as a Menshevik. Although most Jewish socialists joined the Bund or a number of Zionist socialist parties, quite a number joined Russian parties including, besides the RSDRP, the Socialist Revolutionary Party and a number of anarchist groups. These are the parties whose attitude and stance towards antisemitism that Suhr's article explores through Aronson's biographical journey.

T1  - Antisemitism in France and colonial Algeria
AN  - 1973045440
AB  - There is a commonplace assumption that, in the twentieth century, antisemitism was an exclusively right-wing phenomenon. However, there was a strand of socialism that equated Jews and capitalism and, to that extent, was antisemitic. When Algeria became a colony of France, French antisemitism was exported there. In the first two decades of the Third Republic, some socialists saw antisemitism as a stepping-stone to anti-capitalism, and thought they could combine forces to overthrow the 'bourgeois republic'. It was not until the summer of 1898, as the Dreyfus Affair exploded throughout France and colonial Algeria, and they feared that antisemites and the right were about to stage a coup, that socialists rallied to save the republic. Those who became Dreyfusards did so in defence of human rights and the universalist principles of the French Revolution. The antisemitic origins of the charges against Dreyfus were downplayed and some Dreyfusards continued to accept stereotypes about Jews. Other socialists who never became Dreyfusards condemned antisemitism when they discovered the Jewish proletariat. Yet their 'anti-antisemitism' reinforced the antisemitic stereotype that imagined a uniquely Jewish form of capitalism that was more virulent than other forms of capitalism. This failure to reject antisemitism in principle and provide a solution to the 'Jewish question' other than assimilation would later prove to be disastrous, indeed fatal to the Jewish working class, and continue to be a serious problem for France to the present day.

T1  - Socialist antisemitism and its discontents in England, 1884-98
AN  - 1973043713
AB  - Virdee's essay explores the relationship between English socialists and migrant Jews amid the new unionism of the late nineteenth century: a cycle of protest characterized by sustained collective action by the unskilled and labouring poor demanding economic and social justice. Reading this labour history against the grain, with a greater attentiveness to questions of race and class, helps to make more transparent both the prevalence and structuring force of socialist antisemitism, as well as English and Jewish socialist opposition to it. In particular, the essay suggests that the dominant socialist discourse was intimately bound up with questions of national belonging and this directly contributed to a racialized politics of class that could not imagine migrant Jews as an integral component of the working class. At the same time, such socialist antisemitism was also challenged by a minority current of English Marxists whose conceptions of socialism refused to be limited by the narrow boundaries of the racialized nation-state. And they were joined in this collective action by autonomous Jewish socialist organizations who understood that the liberation of the Jewish worker was indivisible from that of the emancipation of the working class in general. With the help of Eleanor Marx and others, these latter strands entangled socialist politics with questions of combatting antisemitism, and thereby stretched existing conceptions of class to encompass the Jewish worker.

T1  - Socialist patriotism, racism and antisemitism in the early Swedish labour movement
AN  - 1973042885
AB  - Blomqvist's article holds that nationalism in the socialist labour movement did not suddenly manifest itself as Europe went to war in 1914. In Sweden, patriotic ideas from the French Revolution and radical liberalism heavily influenced the early labour movement and contributed to the development of a socialist patriotism. As a twin of socialist internationalism, this left-wing working-class nationalism centred on the question 'Who is the nation?' The answer was not simply 'the working people', but penetrated further into the question-in this age of nationalization of the masses-of who those 'working people' were. With few intellectual resources of its own in its early years, the young socialist movement in Sweden had to rely on popular liberal education. Accordingly, knowledge from the modern natural sciences and anthropology was imported with its ideas of human races as kernels of nationality. Academics who subsequently joined the socialist movement tried to interpret racial science and eugenics to the advantage of the working class and for the sake of social reform. Together with socialist patriotism, this attempt developed into a racialized message on the anthropological value of Swedish workers as opposed to both the bourgeois elites and foreign low-paid workers and strikebreakers. In its more extreme version-as represented by a leading Swedish social democrat-it turned older stereotypes of Jews into a racist antisemitic discourse against those who were believed to be the enemies of Swedish labour. The combination of socialist patriotism, racism and antisemitism, however, was challenged by other interpretations and experiences.

T1  - Moving beyond the individual: Community-level prejudice and health
AN  - 1915558868
AB  - What rote does racial bias play in race-based health disparities? Debate on this question has intensified since the publication of the Institute of Medicine's report, Unequal Treatment, in which wide-ranging racial disparities were shown to persist even when socio-economic and biological factors were controlled. Much evidence shows that individuals' reported experiences of racial bias -- in society broadly, as well as in health care settings, specifically -- consistently relate to worse health outcomes. Orchard and Price make a valuable contribution to this small but growing literature in their study of community-level prejudice and disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight. Orchard and Price (2017) make a strong contribution to an emerging literature on community-level bias and health disparities. These data stimulate broader consideration of the antecedents of racial bias and the mechanisms through which it may affect the health of stigmatized group members. Additional research is needed to pursue the effects of racial bias at multiple-levels and harness the insights gained from interdisciplinary work.

T1  - More Than Cultural Racism: The Complexity of White Beliefs about Racial Inequality in the Twenty-first Century
AN  - 2167250776
AB  - The acceptance of these values engenders the development of an antipathy towards African Americans and their perceived cultural shortcomings by whites.

[...]whites routinely oppose policies that address the structural disadvantages experienced by African Americans (Kinder and Sears, 1981; Sears and Henry, 2003; Tarman and Sears, 2005; Rabinowitz et al., 2009).

Because most don't have the chance for education that it takes to rise out of poverty? [lack of education] 4.

Because most just don't have the motivation or will power to pull themselves up out of poverty? [lack of will] For the question "Do people in these groups tend to be (descriptive here)?" a score of 1 means that you think almost all of the people in the group are (descriptive here).

[...]believing that racial inequality is due to an inborn learning disability, or that African Americans tend to be unintelligent, suggests a lack of intelligence as causes for racial inequality.

[...]situating the racial beliefs of whites, and the beliefs of Americans in general, within a wider sociopolitical context, warrants attention.

T1  - Empowered to Submit: Pentecostal Women in Nairobi
AN  - 1949800174
AB  - Neo-Pentecostalism is characterized as offering freedoms and empowerment for women, a limited role in navigating patriarchy, or strengthening patriarchal control. In Nairobi, Kenya, neo-Pentecostalism is concerned with a morality built around an idealized model of the nuclear family in which a wife is subservient to her husband. It might appear that women’s ministries empower female members to challenge structures of control, but such challenges are resisted and women are expected only to survive within existing structures. Singlewomen are expected to live amongst the prejudices of society and dissuaded from any attempt to alter the societal structures that leave them marginalized.

T1  - A 'black Parisian' march in remembrance of slavery: challenging the French collective imagination
AN  - 1851128103
AB  - On the 10 May 2008, approximately 2000 people marched through the center of Paris proclaiming that, 'Slavery has been abolished, but prejudices not!' Based on participant observation of this march, this article explores two main issues with regard to the challenges of blackness in contemporary Paris. First, it examines how the ethno-racial category of 'black' becomes significant for collective action in the French republican context, specifically in terms of how French black people symbolically occupy the French national imagination by physically occupying Parisian urban space. Second, the article shows that, as a commemorative march, one of its key objectives is to make present-day claims of social justice, namely, a denouncement of ongoing racial discrimination experienced by French black people. The article seeks to understand how the marchers, paradoxically by making themselves visible in public space, are in effect also proclaiming a demand for social invisibility.

T1  - Longitudinal Effects of Religious Media on Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage
AN  - 1830830326
AB  - Religion and anti-gay prejudice in the United States are closely connected. Yet we still know little about the specific mechanisms through which religious subcultures may shape adherents' attitudes toward gays and lesbians. This study considers religious media consumption as a unique mechanism through which religious Americans are socialized and embedded within an anti-gay religious subculture. Drawing on panel data from the nationally-representative Portraits of American Life Study, and focusing on opposition to same-sex marriage as a measure of anti-gay prejudice, analyses show that more frequent consumption of religious radio and TV (but not internet) is associated with higher levels of opposition to same-sex marriage over time. These effects remain significant with different model specifications as well as controls for previous attitudes toward same-sex marriage, general media use, sociodemographic and religious characteristics, and intimate contact with gays and lesbians. We propose that consuming religious media over time may influence Americans' views toward LGBT issues directly through explicit messages about homosexuality and indirectly by embedding Americans within a broader religious subculture (largely, conservative Protestantism) that opposes homosexuality.

T1  - Extending the Global Acculturation Model to Untangle the Culture Mixing Puzzle
AN  - 1845076662
AB  - Today's globalized environment exposes people to culture mixing--mixing of iconic symbols of different cultures in the same space at the same time. Findings on individuals' exposure to culture mixing provide evidence for both exclusionary and inclusionary responses. In this article, we focus on the growing phenomenon of culture mixing of global and local symbols and artifacts. We generate a conceptual model to identify who is likely to respond in what way to the mixed cultural environment and why. To answer these questions, we build on the global acculturation model, which aims to explain individuals' adaptation to the global environment by considering the relative strength of their local and global identities. We extend this model by considering not only the two entities' relative strength but also their balance--the degree of symmetry between the identities' strength. We propose that individuals with dominant (unbalanced) identity types (global or local) will exhibit negative and exclusionary responses to culture mixing, whereas individuals with balanced identity types (glocal or marginal) will exhibit positive and inclusionary responses to culture mixing. We also incorporate the concept of bicultural identity integration (BII) to suggest that individuals with high identification with both cultures (glocals) and with high BII will exhibit more inclusive responses than glocals with low BII. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - What Lies Beneath? Minority Group Members' Suspicion of Whites' Egalitarian Motivation Predicts Responses to Whites' Smiles
AN  - 1837635086
AB  - Antiprejudice norms and attempts to conceal racial bias have made Whites' positive treatment of racial minorities attributionally ambiguous. Although some minorities believe Whites' positivity is genuine, others are suspicious of Whites' motives and believe their kindness is primarily motivated by desires to avoid appearing prejudiced. For those suspicious of Whites' motives, Whites' smiles may paradoxically function as threat cues. To the extent that Whites' smiles cue threat among suspicious minorities, we hypothesized that suspicious minorities would explicitly perceive Whites' smiles as threatening (Study 1), automatically orient to smiling White--as opposed to smiling Black--targets (Study 2), and accurately discriminate between Whites' real and fake smiles (Study 3). These results provide convergent evidence that cues typically associated with acceptance and affiliation ironically function as threat cues among suspicious racial minorities.

AN  - 1835698205
AB  - Maertz's essay offers a history of a modernist art exhibition that opened in Vienna's Künstlerhaus under the patronage of Baldur von Schirach, the Führer's personal representative in that city, the second largest in Nazi Germany. The significance of the 1943 Junge Kunst im Deutschen Reich (New Art in the German Reich) exhibition lies in its assertion of a modernist variant of 'official' National Socialist art that clashes with the orthodox aesthetic system typically associated with the Third Reich.

T1  - Institutional Allyship for LGBT Equality: Underlying Processes and Potentials for Change
AN  - 1793546255
AB  - Discussions of outgroup activism in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) equality reflect two shortcomings. First, such discussions generally present uncritically positive views of ally activism; second, research on ally activism has overly focused on individual allies. The aim of this article is twofold: to suggest that action toward LGBT equality may often be influenced by sexual prejudice and may thus recapitulate longstanding power dynamics between majority and sexual minority groups, and to expand our understanding of ally behavior beyond individuals by presenting an ethnographic study exploring the development of institutional ally identity in a mainstream church that underwent a marked shift from an explicit anti-LGBT to an expressly LGBT-supportive stance. The study employed critical discourse analysis to examine interview, textual, and participant-observation data. Dimensions of individual and institutional ally activism, and potential pitfalls in each, are explored. Suggestions for promoting more constructive collective action are offered.

T1  - Overarching findings
AN  - 1863793839
AB  - The issue of racism in the Australian Football League (AFL) is one that has been officially recognized since 1995. Since then, the AFL, the AFL Players Association (AFLPA) and the AFL clubs have been bound by the rules of the code, specifically Rule 35, to deal with racism, racial and religious intolerance and racist abuse, as well as other forms of vilification, when it has arisen. The most recent player-to-player vilification incident occurred in 2011 and involved Western Bulldogs forward Justin Sherman and Gold Coast Sun defender Joel Wilkinson. Despite the problems that many had with Sherman’s suspension, which still allowed him to play with the Western reserves side, what was very marked was the speed of the process from the lodgement of complaint to the suspension. This would seem to indicate that when it comes to such matters, the AFL is serious about dealing with racial vilification and it wanted to send a message to all the clubs and players. In the weeks and months after the incident, what become quite evident was the damage Sherman has sustained to his reputation as a professional athlete: his ‘brand’ is tarnished from here on. Furthermore, the overarching message from this incident as it related to the AFL was that racism in any form is wrong and it will not be tolerated. The main aims of this project were to assess the ways that AFL players have engaged with the education programmes and professional development offered, and how they understand issues of race, racism, ethnicity and difference within the professional environment of elite football in the AFL, and by association, the everyday. The reason for this is the length of time that has passed since Michael Long made his stance in 1995 and the resources that have gone into educating the players on these matters. What this book is seeking to provide is an understanding of the efficacy of those programmes in educating professional elite athletes about racial and religious issues within the AFL and also the athletes’ everyday lives and extended communities. This is important given that the AFL has become an international and national leader on this issue and its corporate and community standing is heavily connected to by Rule 35 and its associated programmes.

T1  - Examining the role of psychological inflexibility, perspective taking, and empathic concern in generalized prejudice
AN  - 1771061758
AB  - Research to-date on generalized prejudice has focused primarily on personality factors. Further work is needed identifying manipulable variables that directly inform antiprejudice interventions. This study examined three such variables: empathic concern, perspective taking, and psychological inflexibility/flexibility with prejudiced thoughts, as a test of the flexible connectedness model. A sample of 604 undergraduate students completed online surveys. A model indicated prejudice measures loaded onto a latent variable of generalized prejudice. In a second model, psychological inflexibility, flexibility, empathic concern, and perspective taking were all significant, independent predictors of generalized prejudice. Psychological inflexibility also predicted prejudice above and beyond personality and general inflexibility variables. Results suggest the three components of the flexible connectedness model may be important targets for prejudice interventions.

T1  - One Size May Not Fit All: The Need for a More Inclusive and Intersectional Psychological Science on Stigma
AN  - 1719467689
AB  - In their review, Remedios and Snyder ( 2015 ) articulated how models of stigma fall short of explaining stigmatization of women of color, because they do not consider intersectionality of multiple stigmatized identities. Using the example of the intersection of race and gender, they reviewed literature on how targets of stigma detect and respond to prejudice (making prejudice attributions, the role of identity processes such as centrality), highlighting the complexity of these processes once multiple identities (namely non-prototypical categories of race and gender) are considered. In response, we provide more in depth discussion of the challenges to inclusion and intersectionality including current and traditional psychological science approaches and the perceived politicization of intersectional research, as well as the complexity of integrating multiple identities (social class, sexual orientation and gender diversity) into stigma research, including recruitment, measurement, and analysis. We offer practical suggestions in the areas of recruitment, measurement, and analysis, to facilitate more inclusive and intersectional research, given that such work would provide a more complete understanding of the experience of stigma.

T1  - I Don't Think You Like Me Very Much: Child Minority Status and Disadvantage Predict Relationship Quality With Teachers
AN  - 1703407761
AB  - Even when accounting for past performance, academic achievement can be influenced by teacher expectations, which are lower for disadvantaged and visible ethnic minority children. We use a Quebec (Canada) population-based sample (N = 1,311) to examine whether ethnicity and teacher-perceived signs of disadvantage in kindergarten predict child reports of their relationship with teachers in fourth grade. Results suggest that visible minority children were 50% less likely and perceived disadvantaged children were 32% less likely to report having a positive relationship with their teacher. The findings are discussed in terms of directing efforts toward reducing teacher prejudice and improving child academic success.

T1  - An essentialism perspective on intercultural processes
AN  - 1676297077
AB  - Essentialist theories are the beliefs that there are immutable essences underlying observed differences between social groups (e.g. racial group, cultural group). This paper reviews the intergroup dynamics and intrapersonal processes associated with essentialism. It also explores the interplay between the two. By explicating the intricate relationship between these psychological processes, the current paper aims to advance our understanding of intergroup relations and identify their implications for the study of multiculturalism. We posit that although the commonly observed negative intergroup outcomes, such as prejudices and biases, can be the byproducts of basic cognitive processes associated with essentialist theories, the social power dynamics in a given society also play important roles in shaping the relationships between essentialism and intergroup outcomes. We then discuss the implications of this understanding to our increasingly multicultural world.

T1  - What Kinds of Value Motives Guide People in Their Moral Attitudes? The Role of Personal and Prescriptive Values at the Culture Level and Individual Level
AN  - 1708523747; 201528729
AB  - Opinions about moralized issues are arguably one of the most difficult issues in interpersonal dialogues given that they can result in intolerance and prejudicial behavior toward those with divergent moral beliefs. Recent research has shown that moral attitudes vary not only depending on the individual's characteristics but also as a function of culture. Individuals from individualistic-oriented cultures exhibit more lenient judgments toward moralized issues than those from collectivistic-oriented cultures. What is unclear to date is what kinds of cultural value motives underlie these attitudes-Are they driven only by intrinsic value motives (personal values) or also by extrinsic value motives (prescriptive values in the form of societal expectations about what should be valued)? The cultural press to conform is arguably stronger if moral attitudes are predicted by the latter. Participants from eight countries (N = 1,456) responded to a questionnaire containing a modified version of the Schwartz Value Survey assessing personal and prescriptive values. The results showed that personal value ratings of openness-to-change versus conservation at the culture and individual levels were predictive of individuals' moral attitudes consistent with previous findings. Prescriptive value ratings of openness-to-change versus conservation also predicted individuals' moral attitudes, but only at the aggregated culture level. This suggests that the prescriptive values concept is a truly group-level phenomenon and that attitudes toward moralized issues are guided by cultural values with normative qualities. We discuss the implications for intercultural contact situations. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Construction of Migrant Work and Workers by Alberta Legislators, 2000-2011
AN  - 1665530584
AB  - By conceptualizing temporary international migrant workers as "foreigners labouring within a 'foreign labour market' instead of being an integral component of Canadian society" ([Sharma] 2006, 7), policy-makers can avoid difficult questions about whether partial citizenship is socially just. By casting international migrants as "others", state-imposed limits on their rights can be seen as an effort to "protect" the jobs of Canadian workers from the threat posed by international migrant workers. It uncritically accepts the well-established but contestable position that citizens should have preferential access to jobs. As Vosko (2010) notes, this "othering" effect may also be intensified by ethnic and racial prejudices. International migrants are likely to be viewed differently than inter-provincial migrants, who are both citizens and more likely members of the dominant ethnic group. Similarly, by casting international migrants as "workers" (rather than human beings), the state can legitimize its immigration and labour practices ([Bauder] 2006), including international migrant workers' partial citizenship. Framing international migrants narrowly as workers implies they are here to perform solely an economic role. Canadians are encouraged to see only the functional utility of international migrants and not the full scope of their humanity.              The boom of the 2000s was different in a number of ways. First, while there was still significant interprovincial migration, net interprovincial migration began declining in 2006 and was effectively zero by 2009 (Alberta 2011a). This decline occurred despite relatively high unemployment (between 7.9% and 14.7%) in Atlantic Canada (a traditional "sending" region) during this time (HRSDC 2012). High unemployment in other provinces has historically been an important "push" factor for interprovincial migration (Hiller 2009). A net decline in such migration during a period of high unemployment suggests that deteriorating "pull" factors reduced Alberta's ability or desire to attract interprovincial migrants. For example, wage growth slowed in 2006 and inflation rose, significantly eroding the potential wage gains interprovincial migrants could realize by moving to Alberta (Alberta 2008a). Alberta also experienced a severe housing shortage at this time, with some workers in the province's major cities living in tents in campgrounds and squatting in the river valley. Indeed, as the economy improved, net interprovincial migration picked up again in 2011 (Alberta 2013).              As international migrant labour becomes a permanent feature of Alberta's and Canada's labour market, the political pressures surrounding it require governments to justify its use. As part of that political process, Alberta government MLAs constructed narratives about the necessity of international migrant labour as well as the undesirability of international migrant workers. Specifically MLAs asserted that migrant work (1) was economically necessary and (2) posed no threat to Canadian workers. MLAs also asserted that international migrant workers (3) had questionable occupational, linguistic or cultural skills and (4) caused negative social and economic impacts in Canada. This seeming contradiction can be reconciled as an effort to justify international migrant work (despite the political tensions and problems inherent with it) by "othering" international migrant workers. Specifically, international migrant workers are dehumanized by discussing them in solely economic terms and by characterizing them as undesirable workers who pose a threat to Canadian communities (although not jobs). These framings justify their partial citizenship and poor treatment.

T1  - Confronting and Reducing Sexism: A Call for Research on Intervention
AN  - 1667950841; 201513010
AB  - This article presents the current state of research on confronting and reducing sexism. We first provide a systematic overview about prior work on confronting sexism. We identify gaps in the literature by outlining situational and contextual factors that are important in confronting sexism and introduce how these are addressed in the current volume. Second, we review prior work on reducing sexism. Compared to research on reducing other forms of prejudice, research on interventions to reduce sexism is rare. We explain why mechanisms that are successful in reducing other forms of prejudice cannot simply be adapted to reducing sexism. We then outline how the articles of this issue promote research, theory, and policy on reducing sexism. In conclusion, the aim of this issue is to bring together novel theoretical approaches as well as empirically tested methods that identify key antecedents and consequences of diverse ways of confronting and reducing sexism.

T1  - Host Culture Acceptance, Religiosity, and the Threat of Muslim Immigration
AN  - 1703413198
AB  - This study explores the intricate relationships between a dominant group's fear of an immigrant group, religiosity, and the dominant culture's perception of if an immigrant group is motivated to culturally adapt. Specifically, Muslim immigration to Spain was analyzed. The study found the following: 1) threat from an immigrant group was negatively correlated with perception of immigrant motivation to adapt, 2) highly religious members of the dominant culture were less likely to believe Muslim immigrants are motivated to culturally adapt, and 3) increased contact with Muslim immigrants led to higher levels of realistic threat and symbolic threat among Spanish Catholics. Implications for integrated threat and intergroup communication research are discussed.

T1  - Encountering nature through fieldwork: expert knowledge, modes of reasoning, and local creativity
AN  - 1559005343; 201432282
AB  - The concept of 'relation' has been central to the anthropological reworking of the nature/culture and nature/society dichotomies. However, ecology is relational in a way that has often been ignored or dismissed in contemporary socio-cultural anthropology. This article shows that there is more to ethnoecology than an ethnocentric form of analysis representing other people's understandings of the natural world through the prejudiced lens of Western scientific classifications. Three 'fieldwork on fieldwork' experiments involving encounters between natural scientists and indigenous communities in Amazonian Ecuador and Southern Guyana are discussed to illustrate the heterogeneity of human knowledge, the role of expert knowledge in intercultural communication, and the need to differentiate ecological reasoning from moral reasoning.

T1  - Multiply vulnerable populations: mobilising a politics of compassion from the 'capacity to hurt'
AN  - 1542002510; 201428457
AB  - This paper reflects on the concept of insecurity defined as 'the capacity to hurt'. It begins by considering asylum seekers and refugees as hyper-precarious groups that have experienced bodily, material and psychological 'hurt' in the UK. At the same time, the paper considers how these hyper-precarious groups are perceived to have the capacity to hurt (bodily, materially, psychologically and spatially) the majority population. Having drawn out two understandings of the capacity to hurt-both the ability to be or feel hurt and the act of hurting others, we argue that a shared recognition of what it means to feel hurt (co-suffering or suffering together)-albeit to very different extremes and with very different consequences-and an understanding of the processes which drive this might be mobilised politically to challenge the act of hurting others. In doing so, we argue for a group politics of compassion to respond to increasingly insecure times. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural sensitivity or cultural stereotyping? Positive and negative effects of a cultural psychology class
AN  - 1559007193; 201432070
AB  - Cultural psychology ultimately aims to increase intercultural understanding, but it has also been accused of reifying stereotypes. Can learning about cultural psychology research cause students to increase their cultural sensitivity, or does it increase stereotyped and rigid thinking about cultural others? Students in an undergraduate cultural psychology course (N = 34) were compared to students in control psychology courses (N = 20) in pre- and post-course measures of cultural awareness, cultural intelligence, essentialistic thinking, prejudice, moral relativism, and endorsement of stereotypes and sociotypes. Compared to students in the control courses, cultural psychology students increased in cultural awareness, moral relativism, and meta-cognitive cultural intelligence, but students who received lower grades in the course also increased their endorsement of stereotypes that were not endorsed by cultural psychology research. Implications for intercultural training and the communication of research on cultural differences are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - What Was Margaret Thatcher's Legacy for Women?
AN  - 2115172475
AB  - This article considers the legacy for women of Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013), Britain's first and to date only woman prime minister. It is suggested that although Thatcher had to struggle against many of the sexist prejudices of her day to achieve her political ambitions, she was no feminist. The hard ladder up which she had climbed was drawn up and not extended to other women. Yet for some women, such as the Spice Girls, she was the pioneer of their ideology of girl power. Overall, it is concluded that Thatcher was a polarising figure whose legacy is one of much divisiveness, in which the divisions between women is only one of many strands.

T1  - Baldwin's Quest for 'Panacea': A Case Study
AN  - 1929914091
AB  - Literature mirrors the ongoing social and cultural trends. Textual discourse gives space to internal and external upheavals that shape the human civilization. An author who interprets reality in terms of existing conceptions turns to his artistic sensibilities to decipher the true, deeper and even metaphysical meaning of his perceptions. Hence, a text turns into an endeavour to search the significance of various life experiences in relation to existing social, political, cultural and moral notions of a society. The present paper takes up an African American author James Baldwin to explore how a literary artist turns into a rebel or reformer in his quest for remedial measures for social and cultural maladies. In his attempt to unravel the intricacies of the institutionalized setup of human society, Baldwin navigates the whole range of the socio-cultural panorama to find a solution for human predicament. Baldwin's search was initiated with his traditional approach to religion in his first novel Go Tell It on the Mountain and gradually becomes more and more radical with the advancement of time. A close perusal of his novels, chronically arranged as per the year of their publication, evinces the gradually transforming approach of the writer with an increasing element of experimentation. An individual's search of happiness instigates him to discover all its possible sources. Having existed in terms of gender and racial prejudices of a group, Baldwin examines the potentiality of the black church, interracial relationships, the value of strong family values, hedonistic approach of a bohemian culture and, furthermore, the spiritual element in homosexual love.

T1  - Mock Jurors' Use of Error Rates in DNA Database Trawls
AN  - 1692290485; 201522980
AB  - Forensic science is not infallible, as data collected by the Innocence Project have revealed. The rate at which errors occur in forensic DNA testing-the so-called 'gold standard' of forensic science-is not currently known. This article presents a Bayesian analysis to demonstrate the profound impact that error rates have on the probative value of a DNA match. Empirical evidence on whether jurors are sensitive to this effect is equivocal: Studies have typically found they are not, while a recent, methodologically rigorous study found that they can be. This article presents the results of an experiment that examined this issue within the context of a database trawl case in which one DNA profile was tested against a multitude of profiles. The description of the database was manipulated (i.e., 'medical' or 'offender' database, or not specified) as was the rate of error (i.e., one-in-10 or one-in-1,000). Jury-eligible participants were nearly twice as likely to convict in the offender database condition compared to the condition not specified. The error rates did not affect verdicts. Both factors, however, affected the perception of the defendant's guilt, in the expected direction, although the size of the effect was meager compared to Bayesian prescriptions. The results suggest that the disclosure of an offender database to jurors might constitute prejudicial evidence, and calls for proficiency testing in forensic science as well as training of jurors are echoed.

T1  - The All-or-Nothing Workplace: Flexibility Stigma and "Opting Out" Among Professional-Managerial Women
AN  - 1429630246; 201336335
AB  - Using a model of the stigmatization of flexible work based on status legitimation theory, we analyze the experiences of a sample of 54 mothers who "opted out" of professional jobs. Qualitative text analysis reveals that features of women's workplaces are conducive to the creation and maintenance of flexibility stigma and bias and that women working flexibly are subjected to various forms of stigmatizing treatment, which plays a role in their decision to suspend their careers. We find limited evidence, however, that women perceive high levels of stigma and differential treatment as reflecting bias or prejudice. Instead, the majority appears to accept the legitimacy of professional time norms and view their treatment as justifiable. We identify factors that moderate or inhibit their perception of flexibility bias, as distinct from stigma per se, and discuss the limitations of our research as well as its implications for future research and policy.

T1  - Anti-Asian Sentiment Amongst a Sample of White Australian Men on Gaydar
AN  - 1357006258
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Whilst the homogenizing descriptor 'gay' is often used in a singular sense to refer to 'the gay community,' research has increasingly recognized that individuals within gay communities are as diverse as they are within the broader community. Importantly, recognition of this diversity requires an acknowledgement of the fact that, just as in the broader community, discrimination occurs within gay communities. The present study sought to examine the degree to which racism occurs within gay men's online communities (in the form of anti-Asian sentiment expressed in the profiles of a small number of the 60,082 White Australian gay men living in five major Australian states whose profiles were listed on the website gaydar.com.au during October 2010), the forms that such racism takes, and whether any White gay men resisted such racism. The findings report on a thematic and subsequent rhetorical analysis of the profiles of the sub-sample of 403 White gay men who expressed anti-Asian sentiment. Such sentiment, it was found, was expressed in four distinct ways: 1) the construction of racism as 'personal preference,' 2) the construction of Asian gay men as not 'real men,' 3) the construction of Asian gay men as a 'type,' and 4) the assumption that saying 'sorry' renders anti-Asian sentiment somehow acceptable. Whilst the numbers of White gay men expressing anti-Asian sentiment were relatively small, it is suggested that the potential impact of anti-Asian sentiment upon Asian gay men who view such profiles may be considerable, and thus that this phenomenon requires ongoing examination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

It discusses the interactions between activists and homeless people. Initially, as the Occupiers camped in the square they excluded the homeless. A pivotal point was when some Occupiers spoke out against the mistreatment of the homeless arguing that these prejudiced actions were examples of classism. Furthermore, they argued that the homeless exemplified an important segment of the 99%. The contradictions that the homeless population brought to the movement allowed for the movement to grow. The tensions disappeared once the homeless took particular roles in the maintenance of the camp and the logistics needed to keep it running. This justified the presence of these individuals in the eyes of others. This also gave the homeless people a different identity, and normalized their sleeping arrangements since everyone in the camp was sleeping in urban public areas. By becoming Occupiers, homeless individuals gained a new political role that was different from that of being a recipient of charity and services. Some homeless people even credit the activities they carried with the Occupy El Paso movement for helping them recover from addiction and their eventual attainment of housing. The acceptance of homeless people as Occupiers gave coherence and strengthened the movement, while simultaneously providing dignity and solidarity for homeless people.

T1  - The Missing Quadrants of Antidiscrimination: Going Beyond the "Prejudice Polygraph"
AN  - 1030710864
AB  - Behavioral realists urge the law to respond to new scientific discoveries about the reality of contemporary discrimination. But in thinking about how tile law might respond, it is easy to frame the question as: When should evidence from scientific instruments, such as the Implicit Association Test, be admissible in a discrimination lawsuit. In other words, should we admit into evidence the results of some "Prejudice Polygraph"? But this framing, which focuses on specific facts, found ex post is too narrow and obscures a much broader range of potential legal responses. Indeed, by considering both specific and general facts, as well as both ex post and ex ante time orientations, four separate quadrants of analysis emerge. Psychologists, legal scholars, and policymakers should not miss these other quadrants of antidiscrimination. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The politics of nativism: Islam in Europe, Catholicism in the United States
AN  - 1125218567; 201243274
AB  - The politics of nativism directed at Catholic immigrants in 19th-century America offer a fruitful comparative perspective through which to analyze the discourse and the politics of Islam in contemporary Europe. Anti-Catholic nativism constituted a peculiar North American version of the larger and more generalized phenomenon of anti-immigrant populist xenophobic politics which one finds in many countries and in different historical contexts. What is usually designated as Islamo-phobia in contemporary Europe, however, manifests striking resemblances with the original phenomenon of American nativism that emerged in the middle of the 19th century in the United States. In both cases one finds the fusion of anti-immigrant xenophobic attitudes, perennial inter-religious prejudices, and an ideological construct setting a particular religious-civilizational complex in essential opposition to Western modernity. Although an anti-Muslim discourse emerged also in the United States after 11 September, it had primarily a geo-political dimension connected with the 'war on terror' and with American global imperial policies. But it lacked the domestic anti-immigrant populist as well as the modern secularist anti-Muslim dimensions. This explains why xenophobic anti-Muslim nativism has been much weaker in the United States than in Europe. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Functions of Symbolic Racism
AN  - 930147581
AB  - Symbolic racism (SR) has attracted critique and controversy. One controversy that has remained unresolved is the function of SR. SR theorists suggest that SR originates from Black individualism and represents a new form of racism. Others suggest that SR originates in opposition to equality and serves to legitimize these socially inappropriate attitudes. The current paper argues that SR can arise from both Black individualism and anti-equality attitudes, thus serving both as a new expression of racism but also as a legitimizing ideology. A preliminary test of this hybrid model was examined with survey data from a community and university sample. Results suggest that a hybrid model of the underpinnings of SR explains more variance in SR than either the Black individualism or legitimizing ideology models. Furthermore, SR mediated the relationships between both anti-equality attitudes and Black individualism on opposition to affirmative action policy and diversity in work and education settings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - UK Dispersal Policy and Onward Migration: Mapping the Current State of Knowledge
AN  - 1037878731; 201231299
AB  - Since 2000, the UK Home Office has implemented a policy of dispersal whereby asylum seekers are housed on a no choice basis in locations around the country. Although the aim of dispersal is to determine local and national movements of asylum seekers, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the role played by dispersal in onward migration flows. Indeed, the majority of literature on UK dispersal has focused upon critiquing the policy for being driven by void housing and concentrating vulnerable populations in deprived, inner city neighbourhoods. Dislocated from existing social networks, asylum seekers have experienced prejudice, racial harassment and isolation. The aim of this article is to sketch out the current state of knowledge on onward migration in the context of UK dispersal policy. Based upon quantitative data analysis and case study material, the complexity of onward migration flows is examined. This includes identifying the geography of onward migration flows as well as the diversity of individuals engaged in movement around the UK, both during the asylum process and after being granted or refused refugee status. Along with relevant literature on past dispersal schemes in the UK, quantitative data is employed to highlight gaps in knowledge as well as discussing ways forward for future data collection and analysis.

T1  - The Influence of Education on Attitudes toward Affirmative Action: The Role of the Policy's Strength
AN  - 1545068216
AB  - The present research examined the influence of education on attitudes toward affirmative action. Studies 1 and 2 showed no impact of education on attitudes toward "soft" policies of affirmative action. In contrast, they showed less support of the more educated to "hard" policies of affirmative action. Neither prejudice (Study 2), nor understanding of the affirmative-action policies (Study 3) accounted for this effect. Study 4 demonstrated that the education effect is mediated by the threat posed by strong plans to meritocratic beliefs. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

AN  - 2697558508
AB  - The paper negotiates ideas, views and beliefs of Bulgarians towards the ethnic minorities of their country published in the Bulgarian press during the period of 2005–2009. Through these aspects it becomes clear that three years after Bulgaria's accession to the European Union and despite various state attempts to integrate minorities – mostly initiated and funded by the EU and various governmental and non-governmental organizations – prejudice and racism have not been overcome, the Other is still differentiated and the way to multiculturalism is very long. The research field is limited to the Turkish and the Roma minorities, which are “visible” in the sense that they are officially recognized.

T1  - On critical thinking
AN  - 2598119808
AB  - This paper begins by defining critical thinking and setting out a personal history of the author's journey toward becoming a critical thinker It considers two common barriers to critical thinking: cultural disapproval of critique; and confusing critical thinking with criticism. In response, it argues that rigorous thinking offers benefits-and not only risks- to cultures as well as individuals. It considers where cultural resources supportive of critique might be found. Further it argues that critical analysis should be understood (and undertaken) as a process of collaborative support for rigorous thinking rather than as a form of hostile criticism. Some dimensions of critical thinking are outlined, together with questions which might allow readers to apply them to specific contexts. The paper closes with some reflections on the process of writing in which some of these dimensions of critical thinking are applied to the paper itself.

T1  - Stigma as 'othering' among Christian theology students in South Africa
AN  - 1429624112; 201338464
AB  - HIV is a health and developmental crisis that has profoundly challenged the Christian church in sub-Saharan Africa. Responding to stigma and prejudice against HIV and people living with HIV and AIDS has been a major concern of theologians and Christian leaders. However, Christians themselves and the church as a community are equally prone to stigma and prejudice. The author contends that this stigma is grounded in the dynamic of 'othering', which, among Christians, takes on religious or theological overtones. Drawing on qualitative data from theology students in South Africa, the paper assembles a model of AIDS stigma as othering. The central story or axis of the model is the dynamic of othering, comprising three themes, viz. lack of empathic contact, disconnection, and distancing. There are three main dynamics that appear to contribute to or feed into othering, viz. emotions related to sexuality and HIV, theology of health and judgement, and contextualised knowledge of HIV. Finally, the model presents two primary results of othering, viz. disengagement from HIV through passivity and hopelessness, and prejudice against those living with HIV. The paper endeavours to reveal the possible biblical roots of AIDS stigma. Through this, the deep violence embedded in such stigma is exposed and contrasted with a theology of inclusiveness and engagement. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Naming the 'R' word in racial victimization: Violence against Indian students in Australia
AN  - 1364699777; 201327182
AB  - In 2009, thousands of international students, led by the Federation of Indian Students in Australia, staged a public protest in the central business district of Melbourne in Australia. One focus of the demonstration was the claim that Indian students living in Australia were being deliberately targeted for racist violence and crime. In the months following the demonstrations, many deep-seated problems in the international education industry were revealed, generating multiple and ongoing reviews of the education, migration, housing, transport and criminal justice sectors. This article focuses on the ways in which police services and political leaders have responded to the claim that racism is behind the victimization of Indian students studying and living in Australia. It will argue that, with one or two exceptions, both have responded with a range of discursive strategies that, ultimately, amount to a form of denial. Significantly, this is not a denial of the problem of violence itself but, rather, a denial of the racial character of that violence. Such denial raises the question: can racist victimization, or any form of hate crime, truly be acknowledged if the prejudiced or biased nature of that victimization is not accorded public recognition and condemnation?

AB  - Examining nursing home segregation and race disparities in influenza vaccinations, this study demonstrates that segregation may increase both susceptibility and exposure to seasonal flu for black Americans. Evidence based on the 2004 U.S. National Nursing Home Survey shows that individuals in nursing homes with high percentages of black residents have less personal immunity to flu because they are less likely to have been vaccinated against the disease; they may also be more likely to be exposed to flu because more of their coresidents are also unvaccinated. This implies that segregation may generate dual disease hazards for contagious conditions. Segregation appears to limit black Americans' access to personal preventive measures against infection, while spatially concentrating those people who are most likely to become contagious.

T1  - Lombroso's Jewish identity and its implications for criminology
AN  - 1883069159
AB  - Recovering Lombroso's Jewish identity is important for understanding the context in which he lived and worked. Italian statehood and positivist science had particular meaning relative to Jewish emancipation. Lombroso turned his back on Judaism and Jewish tradition, but interacted over the years with a circle of Jewish colleagues. Salvatore Ottolenghi, Pauline Tarnowsky, Helen Zimmern, Max Nordau and Jean Finot influenced his professional life in more than one way, as did members of his family, such as David Levi. Lombroso contributed to the defence of Jews from the surge of anti-Semitism in the late nineteenth century and he even managed a measure of critical analysis in his discussion of Jews and crime. Although he failed to overcome the prejudices and misconceptions at the centre of his outlook, the Lombroso who engaged 'the Jewish question' emerges as a more complicated and conflicted character than the Lombroso associated with 'the criminal man'.

T1  - Reflective Paper: GL Versus BT: The Archaeology of Biphobia and Transphobia Within the U.S. Gay and Lesbian Community
AN  - 907911080
AB  - Heterosexism against bisexuals and transgenders exists not only in the straight community but in the gay and lesbian community as well. Are 'biphobia' and 'transphobia' examples of 'phobias' -- irrational fears? No, such heterosexist attitudes are all too rational, mirroring social tensions, which only appear to be an ahistorical psychological phenomenon. Rather, as the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender (GLBT) community developed, power relations arose which resulted in the four different groups (G/L/B/T), assigning them different social locations. Prejudice in gay and lesbian communities against bisexuals and transgenders is heterosexism because it is, among other things, an accommodationist attempt to discover these more 'radical' forms of sexuality.

T1  - My Second Life as an Austerity Nut
AN  - 896166904; 201121631
AB  - In unusual times one has to do unusual things. Thus it is that my stolid existence as an Associate Professor of Sociology at one of the colleges in the City University of New York system has recently been enriched by the invasion into my life of Austerity Nut. Austerity Nut goes around the New York City subway system preaching the virtues of budget cuts and the need for all working people to lend a helping hand to our suffering brothers and sisters on Wall Street. In a Steve Colbert-like stunt, I have been posing as Austerity Nut to parody the absurd state of affairs whereby a deep economic crisis caused by the rich is used to attack working-class people in New York City and around the world. Austerity Nut's monologue does not just suggest the need to resist policies that use a crisis caused by the rich to victimize working people and the poor. It ostensibly endorses all the ideological prejudices that have long dominated American society. These prejudices are deconstructed by being inserted into a set of assertions that are not just false but simply absurd. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Seeing the Unseen: Attention to Daily Encounters With Sexism as Way to Reduce Sexist Beliefs
AN  - 1125223497; 201243544
AB  - Three experiments were conducted in the United States and Germany to test whether women and men endorse sexist beliefs because they are unaware of the prevalence of different types of sexism in their personal lives. Study 1 (N = 120) and Study 2 (N = 83) used daily diaries as a method to encourage individuals "to see the unseen." Results revealed that encouraging women to pay attention to sexism, in comparison to attention to other social interactions, led to a stronger rejection of Modern Sexist, Neosexist, and Benevolent Sexist beliefs (Studies 1 and 2) and to negative evaluations of Modern and Benevolent Sexist men described in profiles as well as to more engagement in collective action on behalf of women (Study 2). In contrast, for men, paying attention to sexism did not have these effects. Results from Study 2 suggest, and from Study 3 (N = 141) confirm, that men's endorsement of Modern and Neosexist beliefs can be reduced if attention to sexism and emotional empathy for the target of discrimination is encouraged. Finally, a follow-up survey indicated that the attitude change in women and men was stable over time. The implications of these findings for interventions to reduce women's versus men's endorsement of sexist beliefs are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Rhetorical Construction of Polity Membership: Identity, Culture and Citizenship in Young People's Discussions of Immigration in Northern England
AN  - 919902949; 201201521
AB  - In this paper, we argue for a social psychological approach to citizenship which focuses on how social actors define competent and legitimate polity membership, together with the associated rights and responsibilities that this entails. A perspective based on the principles of rhetorical psychology is adopted in order to explore these issues in an analysis of a sample of young people's talk about issues of immigration to the UK. Analysis considers how matters of 'race', national identity and culture were oriented to and constructed during the interviews. We then explore how rights and responsibilities concerning cultural expression, interpersonal civility/courtesy and (implicitly acultural) legal frameworks were articulated as practical criteria for judgements about competent and legitimate polity membership. These findings are discussed in relation to existing social psychological work on issues such as racism and national identity, with a view to situating these matters within an overarching concern for the construction of polity membership. We conclude by briefly considering the implications of these findings for contemporary debates concerning citizenship education in the UK. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Crisscrossing Gender, Ethnicity, and Race: African Religious Legacy in Cuban Contemporary Women's Art
AN  - 1125221033; 201242096
AB  - Despite the many redistributive social policies that the Cuban Revolution implemented, the crisis of the Special Period has had severe consequences for Afro-Cubans, who are overrepresented in the poorer sectors of Cuban society. At the same time, the loss of many social benefits and increased social competition have fueled previously underlying racial prejudices. Like other cultural manifestations, such as Cuban rap music, the visual arts have launched a public discussion about the growing social fracture set offby the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of racial inequalities. From 1997 to 2011, the Queloides art exhibits have presented the work of a number of artists that are currently focusing their artistic practices on issues of race and racism. A strategy implemented in the artwork to contest social processes of racialization has been the representation of Afro-Cuban religious practices, previously marginalized or reduced to folklore. In this context, the use of the Afro-Cuban legacy enables women artists to reflect on the consistency of identity markers such as race, gender, and ethnicity. In this article, I am particularly interested in revealing how subjectivity informs this artwork and how it is conceived as a site for reinvention at which identity markers are restructured and redefined.

T1  - The Four Horsemen of the Fair Housing Apocalypse: A Critique of Fair Housing Policy in the USA
AN  - 1081864220; 201237620
AB  - This article examines US fair housing policy from a critical perspective. We describe the impact of the expansion of neoliberal ideology on the fair housing assistance program (FHAP), the fair housing initiatives program (FHIP), and the scope of US Department of Justice activities. Prior findings from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and IRS Form 990 are summarized. We argue that neoliberalism has contributed to the underdevelopment, underfunding, and poor implementation of US fair housing policy. We offer three recommendations for fair housing reform. The first focuses on the need to remove fair housing activities from HUD and place them in an independent fair housing agency. The second focuses on the need for the federal government to mandate fair housing enforcement across all governmental programs and agencies. The third focuses on the need for increased lobbying, litigation, and activism by community-based advocacy organizations for reform. [Reprinted by permission; copyright Sage Publications Inc.]

T1  - Glasswing Butterflies: Gay Professional Football Players and Their Culture
AN  - 1018358064; 201213443
AB  - Only one association football (soccer) player in history has declared his homosexuality during his professional active playing career. Before or since that player's death in 1998, no other professional footballer player has come out. The prohibitively traditional culture of association football is popularly regarded as being responsible for this. Fans habitually use homophobic epithets to abuse players. In recent years, England's governing organizations have cautiously addressed this state of affairs, though ineffectually. The present study uses online methods to explore fans' and industry professionals' perspectives on gay players and the impact their failure to come out has had on the sport. The article, which is based on the responses of 3,500 participants, seeks to answer three questions: (1) Why do fans, who urge gay players to come out, use homophobic language to barrack players? (2) If gay players disclosed their sexual orientations publicly what effect would this have on them personally, on football culture generally and on conceptions of masculinity in sports? (3) What prevents gay football players coming out? The overwhelming majority (93%) of participants in the study oppose homophobia and explained the homophobic abuse as good-humored banter or, in their argot, "stick." An unusual logic is employed to make this intelligible. Participants argue that an athlete's ability to play football is the only criterion on which he is judged and his sexuality is of little consequence to their evaluations. Although few participants encourage forcible outing, the majority welcome openly gay players, whose impact would be transformative. Football clubs and agents are cited as the principal impediments to a more open and enlightened environment: participants argue that they pressure gay players to keep their sexuality hidden and so contribute to a culture of secrecy, which permits and perhaps commissions continued homophobic abuse. Participants speculate that the continued absence of openly gay players actually reproduces the apparent prejudices. One fan concludes, "The homophobia in football will remain for longer if no gay players come out.". [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Black Africans in World War II: The Soldiers' Stories
AN  - 761175901
AB  - This article discusses the often forgotten contributions of black African infantry to the French and British war efforts from Europe to Asia during the Second World War. It traces the relationship between black African soldiers and their imperial rulers as it evolved over the course of two global conflicts from 1914 to 1945. The article points out how racist preconceptions about the "inferior" abilities and intelligence of Africans paralleled white Americans' prejudices against African-Americans and how the British and French attempted to systematically omit, diminish, or discredit the achievements of African soldiers.

T1  - Utility of online communities - ways one can benefit from one's online life
AN  - 1040724156
AB  - As many of today's social scientists (such as Beck, Giddens, Howard, Vlasceanu etc) have remarked, the modern age has brought with itself a great series of fast-paced changes in the average man's lifestyle. Nothing is safe or can be taken for granted anymore. Families disintegrate, traditions become obsolete and professional re-qualifications are necessary every few years just to keep up with the younger, tougher competition on the labour market. Forced to constantly changed ones place of residence, ones entourage, work and habits leads to a feeling of loneliness, of not really being a part of modern society and its communities, of being left out to fend for yourself. Luckily, modernity has also brought with itself a never seen before technological boom which instantly permitted not only the improvement of one's biological life, but also provided society with the opportunity to bridge the gap between people. One of the most significant of these innovations is the Internet, a non-geographical space that people, in just a few short years, have colonized and made their own, projected their identities into and created solid and durable communities that, which were less subjected to being torn apart by distance and time. This paper's object is to show how and why being part of an online community is a great way for one to get a stronger feeling of social integration and be part of a somewhat more fair, less prejudiced world.

T1  - Group-Based Dominance and Opposition to Equality Correspond to Different Psychological Motives
AN  - 746585269
AB  - Social Dominance Orientation, one of the most popular individual differences measures in the study of generalized prejudice, can be understood as having two components: Opposition to Equality (OEQ) and support for Group-Based Dominance (GBD). We consider these components in terms of system justification theory and social identity theory. We find that each component best explains different kinds of political views, consistent with the theory that they arise from different motivations. OEQ reflects system justification motives. It better predicts attitudes towards redistributive social policy, political conservatism, and a lack of humanitarian compassion for the disadvantaged. GBD reflects social identity motives. It is more associated with hostility toward outgroups and concerns about intergroup competition. GBD and OEQ have different personality and demographic correlates, exhibit distinctive relations with explicit and implicit attitudinal preferences, and differentially predict a variety of policy attitudes. Use of GBD and OEQ as separate constructs enriches the understanding of prejudice, policy attitudes, and political ideology.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Routes to Positive Interracial Interactions: Approaching Egalitarianism or Avoiding Prejudice
AN  - 1928315331
AB  - The current work examined factors that contribute to positive interracial interactions. It argues that the source of people's motivation to respond without prejudice and the goals and strategies they pursue in interracial interactions influence the quality of these interactions. Three studies show that non-Black participants who are highly internally motivated to respond without prejudice tend to focus on strategies and behaviors in interactions with Black people that approach a positive (i.e., egalitarian) outcome. As a result of engaging in these approach behaviors, their interracial interactions go more smoothly for both themselves and their interaction partners as compared to people less internally motivated. In contrast, externally motivated people tend to focus on avoiding negative (i.e., prejudiced) outcomes, which ironically results in their coming across to their partners as prejudiced. The implications of the findings for smoothing out the rocky road to positive intergroup interactions are discussed.

T1  - Person Categorization and Automatic Racial Stereotyping Effects on Weapon Identification
AN  - 1928321006
AB  - Prior stereotyping research provides conflicting evidence regarding the importance of person categorization along a particular dimension for the automatic activation of a stereotype corresponding to that dimension. Experiment 1 replicated a racial stereotyping effect on object identification and examined whether it could be attenuated by encouraging categorization by age. Experiment 2 employed socially complex person stimuli and manipulated whether participants categorized spontaneously or by race. In Experiment 3, the distinctiveness of the racial dimension was manipulated by having Black females appear in the context of either Black males or White females. The results indicated that conditions fostering categorization by race consistently produced automatic racial stereotyping and that conditions fostering nonracial categorization can eliminate automatic racial stereotyping. Implications for the relation between automatic stereotype activation and dimension of categorization are discussed.

T1  - An Expectancy/Value Perspective on the Demotivating Effects of Prejudice
AN  - 1866473495
AB  - This study examined whether expecting prejudice is demotivating. Women were led to believe they were being evaluated for a co-manager position. They were randomly assigned to receive information that the evaluator held negative attitudes toward women or that he did not. We hypothesized that compared to women led to believe that the evaluator was unprejudiced, women led to believe the evaluator was prejudiced would: (a) have lower expectations for being chosen as co-manager; (b) place less value on being chosen as co-manager; and (c) be less motivated to perform a task that would influence selection as co-manager. We predicted that the effect of prejudice on motivation would be mediated by expectations and valuing of success. Results were consistent with predictions.

T1  - Barriers to immigrants' integration into the labor market: Modes and coping
AN  - 743056536; 201031927
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate similarities and particularities of barriers encountered by different immigrant groups when entering the labor market, to define the modes of how immigrants deal with barriers and to detect determinants influencing these modes, comparing two groups of immigrants to Israel. On the basis of twofold criteria (number of barriers and coping with barriers) we created modes classifying the ways in which immigrants deal with barriers: "the easy going", encountered few barriers and showed high coping; "the fighters", - many barriers and high coping; "the incapable", - few barriers and low coping, and "the disadvantaged", - many barriers and low coping. Whereas the majority of the Ethiopian immigrants were dispersed between the "disadvantaged" and "fighters" modes, the majority of Former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants were positioned in the "fighters" mode. The results reveal that FSU immigrants encountered different barriers than immigrants from Ethiopia and coped with them better. Human capital characteristics of immigrants explain the distribution of immigrants between the modes. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Do the "Savage Origins" of Tattoos Cast a Prejudicial Shadow on Contemporary Tattooed Individuals?
AN  - 1866473490
AB  - We investigated whether increases in tattooing rates and designs have eradicated or altered traditional delinquent tattooing stereotypes. We tested the perceived suitability of tattooed and non-tattooed individuals for 2 different jobs. Affective evaluations mediated judgments of job suitability, with those displaying traditional tattoos being rated as less suitable for employment than those who were not tattooed and those displaying contemporary tattoos. Those with a contemporary tattoo were judged in the same manner as those who were not tattooed (even by observers who neither had a tattoo nor were considering getting one). These results suggest that the savage associations of tattooing continue for some, but suggest that for other tattoo enthusiasts, a new stereotype has emerged reflecting a shift toward respectability.
