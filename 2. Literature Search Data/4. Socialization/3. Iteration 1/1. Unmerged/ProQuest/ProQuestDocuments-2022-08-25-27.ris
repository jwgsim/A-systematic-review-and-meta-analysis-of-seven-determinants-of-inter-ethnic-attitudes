T1  - Intercultural Attitudes as Predictors of Student’s Prejudices Towards Refugees
AN  - 2705207936
AB  - One of the major challenges for modern western societies is the reduction of prejudice in order to achieve a sufficient level of integration of immigrants and especially refugees. The current literature thus presents a multitude of approaches to understand and reduce prejudices. Therefore, the following paper investigates the relationships between ethnic identity, acculturation attitudes, intercultural competence, and prejudice and how contact experiences shape these relationships for students in Germany with and without migration background. The results show that there is a significant relationship between prejudice and the social identity, cultural intelligence, and acculturation strategies. Furthermore, the results indicate that the experienced contact quality and quantity to refugees moderate the effect of acculturation strategies on overt prejudice and xenophobia. However, the relationship between acculturation strategies and covert prejudice is only moderated by contact quantity. Because of the relatively weak manifestations of the dependent variables in the study at hand, alternative instruments should be used for investigation. Based on the obtained results, this paper finally tries to give some guidance for the facilitation of diversity and reduction of prejudice at higher education institutions.

T1  - Do minorities perceive procedural fairness merely in terms of ethnic bias suppression? Evaluation of the concept of fairness in multicultural conflicts
AN  - 2695623023
AB  - The present study investigated the impact of perceived procedural fairness enacted by societal actors on minority members’ willingness to accept decisions regarding multicultural issues. We particularly focused on ethnic bias suppression, which we expected to be highly salient in this type of conflict and deemed pivotal given its impact on the collective social self. Four studies (one cross-sectional study and three experiments) were conducted in African American minority samples. The results revealed that: (1) perceptions of procedural fairness cannot be reduced to solely evaluations of ethnic bias suppression, (2) the weight placed on bias suppression is indeed substantial, (3) procedural fairness and bias suppression each play a strong role in shaping minority members’ legitimacy perceptions of a decision-maker, and in turn, (4) decision acceptance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - The Inequality of Intersectionalities in Chicago’s First-Wave Women’s Movement
AN  - 2677283434
AB  - The women’s movement wing of the Progressive Era—the wave of widespread activism spanning the 1890s to the 1920s—was defined by two important but often conflicting dynamics. The movement was built around coalitions, with women collaborating across organizations to advocate for multiple reforms, including those related to gender, class, immigration, and race. At the same time, there were deep divisions and debates among women from different backgrounds, leading to conflict and mistrust within the movement. This article uses network and text analyses methods to reexamine the intersections of race, class, gender, and ethnicity in first-wave feminist organizations in Chicago during the Progressive Era, from 1860 to 1920. Using intersectionality as a theoretical lens, the article takes a bird’s-eye view of organizational connections and discourse across this movement. By comparing three different identities that intersected with gender—class, ethnicity, and race—I reexamine both collaboration and conflict within Chicago’s first-wave movement by mapping the precise empirical contours of intersectionality within it. I find that class and ethnicity were both an organizational core and a persistent public focus of the movement. While the intersection of race and gender was also an important aspect of this movement, race was never fully integrated into the movement to the extent that class and ethnicity were. In other words, Chicago’s first-wave women’s movement was foundationally intersectional, but not all of its intersections were treated equally in the core of the movement. This analysis lends fresh empirical evidence to historians’ observations of both coalition and conflict within first-wave feminist organizations. As the women’s movement continues to grapple with anti-Black racism, we can reflect on the inequality of intersectionality during the first wave to inform and frame our attention to intersectionality today.

T1  - Majority nation‐building through language requirements: Minority perspectives from EU27
AN  - 2652708197
AB  - This study contributes with minority‐centred perspectives to the policy trend of imposing majority language requirements on immigrants. With the aim to identify and explore (dis)connections and value conflicts between policies of national minority recognition and immigrant integration, it develops and applies four ideal types of minority‐linguistic integration regimes to a mapping of integration and minority language policies in 27 European Union (EU) member states. Most states with recognized minorities are found to exclude national minorities from integration policies. The finding is connected to a discussion that identifies normative tensions between the promotion of national minority languages, the linguistic barriers faced by non‐citizen migrants and the asymmetries in how identity and instrumental values are assigned to minority, migrant and majority languages. The study challenges the imposition of language requirements on immigrants and calls for contextually sensitive ways to jointly consider the position of national minorities, majorities, and immigrants in language policies.

T1  - Diversity Discourse as Racialized and Double-edged: Findings from a National Survey
AN  - 2646688321
AB  - The keyword diversity is common in contemporary U.S. culture, but it can refer to many forms of difference; questions remain about the meaning and consequences of “diversity,” especially regarding whether this concept is commonly recognized in the American imagination and how diversity discourse relates to racial hierarchy in the United States. We use nationally representative survey data to address these questions through a critical race theory lens. First, we conduct factor analysis upon three different items that ask participants to evaluate or characterize “diversity.” These three items are well-predicted by a single latent factor, and this factor proves distinct from possible confounders such as prejudicial attitudes, misgivings about immigration and demographic change, and color-blind racial attitudes. Second, we see that diversity attitudes have a double-edged relationship with other attitudes that relate to racial hierarchy in the United States. Using regressions, we find that positivity toward diversity predicts equitable, non-racist stances on several race-related attitudes such as support for affirmative action and acknowledgment of white privilege. On the contrary, positivity toward diversity is also associated with core cultural ideologies which normalize racial inequality and implicitly denigrate minorities, such as color-blind racism and meritocracy. Thus, our study establishes that a coherent and distinct recognition of diversity exists in the American imagination and that diversity discourse has a double-edged relationship with racial hierarchy.

T1  - Legacies of war: Syrian narratives of conflict and visions of peace
AN  - 2631514955
AB  - This article is interested in the formation of war legacies and how they interact with social identities. It suggests a bottom-up approach towards examining the societal processes in which individuals create a legacy of war. It posits that through their narratives of conflict, by remembering what happened to them as a group, they mould the meaning and boundaries of how the group will be membered post-conflict. The validity of the theorised link between war memory and group membership is then tested in the case of Syria. In 200 interviews, Syrians provided their narratives of the conflict and their vision of a future Syrian state and society. The findings show that most respondents’ narratives follow a civic rationale, forming a society around civil rights and political ideas rather than around ethnic/sectarian divides. With this, the article contributes a new route for international relations scholars to understand the formation of war legacies through individuals’ narratives of conflict and explains their effects on ties of group belonging while also offering a glimpse into the Syrian ‘we’ amid the ongoing war in Syria.

T1  - THE MIGRATIONS OF THE OGHUZ IN THE EARLY MEDIEVAL PERIOD: CAUSES, DIRECTIONS AND CONSEQUENCES
AN  - 2678853231
AB  - In the 10th to 11th centuries, the process of formation of the Oghuz tribes was under way in Central Asia. It was accompanied by the disintegration of kinship ties and the emergence of statehood. A new type of ethnic community was being formed, based on territorial and economic ties. The formation of the Oghuz Yabgu state with its political centre in the lower reaches of the Syr Darya1 played an important role in this process. The Oghuz state, like many other nomadic empires, was not monolithic and its borders were not permanent or strictly defined. As a result of extended social conflict, the Syr Darian Yabgu state collapsed and did not withstand the attack of the neighbouring Kipchak tribes in the middle of the 11th century. This caused a new migration wave directed westward. The paper analyses the preconditions and peculiarities of the Oghuz tribes' westward migration. In addition, a comparative analysis of its economic and political consequences is carried out.

T1  - Parental perceived immigration threat and children's mental health, self-regulation and executive functioning in pre-Kindergarten
AN  - 2640799501
AB  - Many children in immigrant households endure unique stressors shaped by national, state, and local immigration policies and enforcement activity in the United States. Qualitative studies find that during times of heightened immigration enforcement, children as young as 3 years of age show signs of behavioral distress related to national anti-immigrant sentiment and the possibility of losing a parent. Using multiple sources of data from 168 racially and ethnically diverse families of children in pre-Kindergarten, the present study examined variability in perceived levels of immigration enforcement threat by parental immigrant status and ethnicity. This study examined associations between immigration enforcement threat and child mental health, self-regulation, and executive functioning and whether parent immigrant status or child gender moderates these associations. We found substantial variability in perceived immigration threat, with immigrant parents and Latinx parents reporting significantly greater levels of immigration threat compared to nonimmigrant parents and non-Latinx parents. Immigration enforcement threat was associated with greater child separation anxiety and overanxious behaviors, and lower self-regulation among boys and girls and among children of immigrant and U.S.-born parents. In contrast to our hypothesis, immigration enforcement threat was associated with higher self-regulation according to independent assessor ratings. Educators and healthcare providers working with young children from immigrant and Latinx households should be aware of the disproportionate stress experienced by immigrant and Latinx families due to a xenophobic sociopolitical climate marked by heightened immigration enforcement threat and racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric.

T1  - “Don’t Call Us <i>Kushim</i>”: Racialized Experiences and Political Activism Among African Students in Israel in the 1960s
AN  - 2639884957
AB  - During the 1960s, several hundreds of African students attended long-term academic or vocational programs in Israel. For Israel, offering higher education to Africans was considered a way to strengthen its influence in decolonizing Africa, while for African states, it was a means to gain vital technical expertise and reduce reliance on ex-colonial powers or the Cold War superpowers. African international students, however, were not merely pawns in this larger international political game. Responding to everyday racism and influenced by radical and Pan-Africanist ideas of the turbulent sixties, these students became active participants and commentators within Israeli society. They employed diverse strategies to promote anti-racist and anti-colonial causes, engaging in political activism at levels that were uncommon in the Israeli student social scene. By doing so, African students in Israel contested local prejudices about Africa and Africans and taught the hosting society important lessons on political awareness, broad-mindedness, acceptance, and racial tolerance. This history tells of understudied aspects of the global Black-Jewish relations in the 1960s. It also provides a novel perspective on Israeli society – one that surpasses the well-discussed Jewish-Arab or Ashkenazi-Mizrahi divisions – and contributes to the scholarly understanding of the meanings and manifestations of Blackness in Israel.

T1  - Immigration, integration and citizenship: elements of a new political demography
AN  - 2624031820
AB  - A critical review of the state-of-the-art in migration studies. The paper centres on a contrast between established comparative scholarship – elaborating progressive models of immigration, integration and citizenship, that reflect the increasingly diverse, migrant-built societies of the North Atlantic West – and a new generation of work in the last decade, influenced by critical, anti-racist and decolonial theory, that rejects this ‘Eurocentric' liberal democratic global order and self-image. Establishing a bridge between older neo-Weberian approaches to immigration and sovereign nation-state building and newer (or revived) Marxist-Foucauldian accounts, it accents the state-power building effects of bordering, managing and cultivating ‘diverse' national populations, and its ongoing governmental categorisation of citizens and migrants, nationals and aliens, majorities and minorities, as a key feature of neoliberal ‘racial capitalism'. The argument develops in relation to wanted and unwanted migration in advanced liberal democratic economies, “visible” forms of immigration versus ‘middling' forms of everyday cross-border mobility, and the limits of humanitarian arguments for open borders and expansive asylum rights. The paper sketches an alternate politics to the self-legitimating ‘political demography' of liberal democracy, relating the ongoing colonial power of ideas of immigration, integration and citizenship, to the reproduction of massive global inequalities between ‘the West and the Rest’.

T1  - Dissecting Electoral Support for the Far Right: A Comparison between Mature and Post-Communist European Democracies
AN  - 2610875101
AB  - This article investigates three explanations for electoral support for the far right – ‘cultural backlash’, ‘economic grievances’ and ‘protest voting’ – in a novel way. Our main contribution is that we contrast far-right voters with voters of centre-right parties, traditional left-wing parties and abstainers. Equally innovative is the comparison between mature and post-communist democracies. Using European Social Survey data (2014–16), we conclude that anti-immigration attitudes are most important in distinguishing far-right voters from all other groups. Yet, these differences are significantly smaller in Eastern Europe. Furthermore, far-right voters are not the so-called socioeconomic ‘losers of globalization’: this is only true when compared with centre-right voters. Concerning protest voting, distrust of supranational governance particularly enhances far-right voting. Overall, our study concludes that more fine-grained distinctions pay off and avoid misleading generalizations about ‘European far-right voters’ often presented in public debates.

T1  - Ethnic Politics and Political Violence in Post-2001 Afghanistan: The 2014 Presidential Election
AN  - 2607467530
AB  - This article evaluates the political dynamics of the 2014 presidential election to explore the sense of nationhood that could have formed in post-2001 Afghanistan and to gauge its strength. It examines frontrunner candidates – Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah’s – campaign rhetoric and processes they utilized to manipulate ethnic identities for political ends. Ethnic identities sharpened by ideological and political polarisation during the civil war (1978–2001), continue to play a critical part in the political economy dynamics of post-2001 era. With the popular patriotic idea of citizenship remaining weak, the abundance of ethnic identities provides a paradigm around which power contenders articulate messages that easily feed into popular perceptions of “us” and “other”. The article contextualizes representative and consociational democracy exploring whether these models of democracy offer any solution to social cleavages in Afghanistan. It argues that elites’ manipulation of ethnic identities and distribution of resources through ethnic shares (Bonn Conference 2001, National Unity Government (NUG) 2014) might reinforce ethnic boundaries, leading to deeper consolidation of ethnic divisions.

T1  - Nationalism or Geopolitics: The Rise of Guerillas and Patterns of Military Conflict during the Expansion of the Ili Rebellion, 1944–46
AN  - 2564763235
AB  - This article investigates the Ili Rebellion in Xinjiang (1944–49). Relying primarily on Chinese sources, the author identifies variations in the rise and fate of non-Han ethnic guerillas, and the patterns of military conflict in different regions during the expansionist stage of the Ili Rebellion from 1944 to 1946. The article argues that neither a nationalist nor a geopolitical explanation adequately account for such variations. Rather, the overlapping and intersecting geopolitical influence (both the Soviet Union and the two Chinese regimes) as well as local conditions (including local ethnic composition and social structure) explain such patterns. Finally, this article discusses broader implications of the role of nationalism and geopolitics in revolutions in small and dependent states.

T1  - Beyond the ‘Criminalisation’ of Immigrants: Critical Criminology and the Modern Deportation Regime
AN  - 2574781239
AB  - Despite a long‐standing body of research contradicting stereotypes that link migration with crime, the image of immigrant as criminal has routinely been used to buttress punitive policy across the globe – particularly within the past 30 years. While the United States is the world leader in rates of deportation, recent decades have also seen renewed anti‐immigrant sentiment, punitive immigration enforcement, and increased deportation in migrant‐receiving countries around the world. Expanding on existing scholarship that disentangles the mechanisms through which migrants are affected by processes otherwise reserved for ‘criminals’, this article demonstrates how the concepts and perspectives of critical criminology are vital to a full understanding of the modern deportation regime. Beyond effects on migrants themselves, I argue that the current deportation regime is harmful for all potential subjects of social control, in its uncritical acceptance and implicit reification of broader societal notions of who and what is ‘criminal’.

T1  - Whose narratives? Divergence in how history is organised across generations and its impact on well‐being
AN  - 2557165667
AB  - Singapore is a young and affluent global city‐state located in a region that is historically known for its ethnic diversity and racial politics. A recent study identified three dominant narratives embraced by Singaporeans: Nation Building—events that highlight milestones and achievements, National Resilience—events that exemplify national unity and resolve in addressing a national crisis, and Conflict—events that demonstrate social divisions. These narratives predicted present and future satisfaction to different degrees and patterns. Further analyses, however, point to generational divides not only in how history is organised but also how it is associated with satisfaction and life experiences. Citizens from all ages converged on the type of events that constitute the Nation Building and National Resilience narratives but hold different views on the constituents of the Conflict narrative. In all, future satisfaction among each cohort of Singaporeans is shaped by a different set of historical narratives—Nation Building for the seniors, National Resilience for the middle‐aged, and Conflict for the young. These results suggest that collective remembering is shaped by a cohort’s generational character.

T1  - Partnerships for Universal Health Coverage in Myanmar: Power and Politics within ‘Immunisation Encounters’ in Kayah State and Kayin State
AN  - 2548484295
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasise the importance of partnerships in achieving targets like Universal Health Coverage. But how can partnerships between non-state and state actors be established, and what development and political ramifications might they have, within protracted conflict situations? In Myanmar’s Kayah State and Kayin State, decades-long conflict resulted in parallel health systems operating under Ethnic Armed Organisations. In recent years, non-state and state health workers in both areas have forged partnerships to implement an Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). These endeavours demonstrate that partnerships are permeated with power relations and development programmes can become the site of political struggles in contested states. Linking national development plans with the SDGs can enhance non-state actors’ positions in contexts where state and international actors have limited implementation capacity. Comparing Kayah State and Kayin State EPI activities demonstrates the importance of recognising political dynamics of partnerships in conflict situations. In Kayah State, when non-state actors were not recognised as leaders of development in their areas, EPI activities had negative impacts, fuelling local grievances. Conversely, in Kayin State, when state and international actors acknowledged political sensitivities and empowered non-state actors, EPI activities built a ‘working encounter’ with positive development and peacebuilding outcomes.

T1  - Redrawing symbolic boundaries after Maidan: identity strategies among Russian-speaking Ukrainians
AN  - 2535628031
AB  - In the context of conflict between Ukraine and Russia and increasing polarisation, symbolic boundaries between the two spaces are shifting. Here I investigated the themes and strategies of border-construction between the concepts of ‘Ukrainianness’ and ‘Russianness’ through everyday acts of communication of Russian-speaking Ukrainians. The article utilises materials of 14 in-depth interviews with Russian speakers from various Ukrainian regions (2018). The results show that the polarisation and hardening of borders between Ukraine and Russia prompted two responses: acceptance vs. negotiation/denial. The underlying tension behind opposing border-narratives was caused by the competition between ethnic and civic elements for the dominance in the national identity discourse.

T1  - The Color Line in Southeastern Europe: A Du Boisian Analysis of the Yugoslav Region
AN  - 2528876541
AB  - Sociologists apply the theory and methods of W.E.B. Du Bois to cases of widely-understood racial difference, often using the historical black-white divide of the United States as a default case. As a result, there is a dearth of Du Boisian analysis of phenomena that are primarily conceptualized using non-racial categories such as nation, ethnicity, or class. However, Du Bois's theories and the racialized structures they address are global in scope. This article uses Du Boisian theory to examine identity discourse surrounding the Yugoslav region, an ostensibly white space at the blurred border of Europe and historical empire. This article places Du Bois in conversation with critical Balkan scholarship to reveal the ways in which South Slavic populations experience unique versions of racialized double consciousness, despite assumptions of whiteness. This framing illuminates the presence of race and empire otherwise obscured in discussions of historical conflict. We can better understand the relevance of a global Du Boisian project if we reject the assumption that processes of racialization map neatly onto bounded populations or geographic spaces.

T1  - Mediterraneanism in conflict: development and settlement of Palestinian refugees and Jewish immigrants in Gaza and Yamit
AN  - 2501181292
AB  - This article examines Israeli development in the Gaza Strip and Northern Sinai from 1972 to 1982 from the perspective of architectural history. We argue that the prime objective of the Israeli occupation in this decade was economic development, not elimination; its guiding logic saw humanitarian aid as the preferred way to “resolve” the Palestinian refugee crisis. We follow how the pro-development, humanist “know how” of the architects and urban planners wrote themselves onto Gaza’s politics of space. Their scientific approach embodied in Mediterranean architecture was the solution of choice to hit two birds with one stone: end the refugee crisis by assimilating them into the Gaza strip cities, and ensure dependence on Israel by a new development plan with Yamit city at its epicentre. Mediterranean architecture expressed the gradations of vernacularity in the Israeli policy, and helped fashion a unique ideology of development based on exclusion and ethnic separation.

TT  - Job insecurity in Afro-descendant and indigenous populations aggravated by the armed conflict in Colombia
AN  - 2540549732
AB  - Este artículo es fruto de un proceso investigativo que se desarrolla en el contexto del conflicto armado, diversas vulneraciones que ha padecido la comunidad afrodescendiente y los pueblos indígenas que, al ser desplazados por este fenómeno bélico, han padecido desde precariedad laboral hasta racismo estructural. De esta manera, el objetivo central de la pesquisa se centró en las afectaciones de estos grupos étnicos integrando los conceptos de raza y etnicidad, discriminación y desigualdad laboral con perspectiva étnica y de género, para visibilizar múltiples violaciones a los derechos humanos en el contexto del conflicto armado. El abordaje de las categorías se apoya en la investigación cualitativa y los resultados revelan principalmente, pese al proceso de justicia transicional, la existencia de precariedad laboral en comunidades afrodescendientes y pueblos indígenas, acentuada por la desigualdad y discriminación étnico-racial. Coyunturalmente, el marco teórico soporta que las comunidades negras y los pueblos indígenas en Colombia han padecido históricamente de dinámicas de exclusión originadas por la época de la conquista. Sin embargo, puede evidenciarse una posición de subordinación que se agrava por el conflicto armado, visibilizando un impacto desproporcionado en estas comunidades. Se concluye, que el reconocimiento del ser humano en la sociedad no puede ser estigmatizado.Alternate abstract:This article is the result of an investigative process that takes place in the context of the armed conflict, various violations suffered by the Afro-descendant community and indigenous peoples who, when displaced by this war phenomenon, have suffered from job insecurity to structural racism. In this way, the central objective of the research focused on the effects of these ethnic groups, integrating the concepts of race and ethnicity, discrimination and labor inequality with an ethnic and gender perspective, to make visible multiple human rights violations in the context of the armed conflict. The approach to the categories is supported by qualitative research and the results mainly reveal, despite the transitional justice process, the existence of job insecurity in Afro-descendant communities and indigenous peoples, accentuated by ethnic-racial inequality and discrimination. Circumstantially, the theoretical framework supports that black communities and indigenous peoples in Colombia have historically suffered from dynamics of exclusion originated by the time of the conquest. However, a subordinate position can be evidenced that is aggravated by the armed conflict, making visible a disproportionate impact on these communities. It is concluded that the recognition of the human being in society cannot be stigmatized.

T1  - Becoming “Historically Marginalized Peoples”: examining Twa perceptions of boundary shifting and re-categorization in post-genocide Rwanda
AN  - 2484699140
AB  - The overwhelming majority of academic literature on pre- and post-genocide Rwanda focuses on the Hutu-Tutsi duality while resigning the narratives of the Twa to a mere footnote. From their nomadic lifestyle as hunter-gathers, to their experiences of conflict and genocide, to their perceptions of political transition and post-conflict nation-building, little is known about the lived realities of Rwanda’s most marginal minority. This article addresses this gap by exploring the impact of the government of Rwanda’s national unity project on the Twa using survey, interview and focus group data with Twa youth, community leaders and villagers. Borrowing from Andreas Wimmer’s taxomony of boundary-making strategies, it shows that despite state-led efforts to unmake Twa identity by blurring ethnic boundaries and recategorizing the Twa as “Historically Marginalized Peoples”, Twa have a strong attachment to their identity and culture and challenge government efforts to re-draw boundaries through everyday acts of resistance.

T1  - When men migrate for marriage: negotiating partnerships and gender roles in cross-border marriages between rural Kosovo and the EU
AN  - 2481545889
AB  - In Western hegemonic discourses, cross-border marriages in which ethnic minority members, especially Muslims, take a partner from a ‘country of origin’ are framed as patriarchal and backward and women are portrayed as victims within such marriages. Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork, the article focuses on the marriages of men from rural Kosovo, who have moved to Austria or Germany because they married a woman from a ‘Kosovan’ background, and on the gender roles that are negotiated here. The men in these cross-border marriages do not fit into the dominant Western image of ‘patriarchal’ ethnic-minority men. After migration, married male migrants find themselves in multiple dependencies and take up diverse roles that are framed by their educational profiles and economic performance, by the support they receive from their wives, as well as the diverse and partly translocal social fields they relate to. Depending on their social position, male marriage migrants may be doubly marginalised, by the majority society as well as within their ethnic communities. But men with higher education who successfully integrated into the labour market may also set up intra-ethnic boundaries, be it to members of their rural community in Kosovo or within ethnic-minority communities in Austria or Germany.

T1  - Heritage-based tribalism in Big Data ecologies: Deploying origin myths for antagonistic othering
AN  - 2546908085
AB  - This article presents a conceptual and methodological framework to study heritage-based tribalism in Big Data ecologies by combining approaches from the humanities, social and computing sciences. We use such a framework to examine how ideas of human origin and ancestry are deployed on Twitter for purposes of antagonistic ‘othering’. Our goal is to equip researchers with theory and analytical tools for investigating divisive online uses of the past in today’s networked societies. In particular, we apply notions of heritage, othering and neo-tribalism, and both data-intensive and qualitative methods to the case of people’s engagements with the news of Cheddar Man’s DNA on Twitter. We show that heritage-based tribalism in Big Data ecologies is uniquely shaped as an assemblage by the coalescing of different forms of antagonistic othering. Those that co-occur most frequently are the ones that draw on ‘Views on Race’, ‘Trust in Experts’ and ‘Political Leaning’. The framings of the news that were most influential in triggering heritage-based tribalism were introduced by both right- and left-leaning newspaper outlets and by activist websites. We conclude that heritage-themed communications that rely on provocative narratives on social media tend to be labelled as political and not to be conducive to positive change in people’s attitudes towards issues such as racism.

T1  - The “Social Brain,” Reciprocity, and Social Network Segregation along Ethnic Boundaries
AN  - 2489118857
AB  - How does segregation along ethnic boundaries emerge in social networks? Human evolution resulted in highly social beings, capable of prosociality, mindreading, and self-control, which are important aspects of the “social brain.” Our neurophysiologically “wired” social cognition implies different cognitive goal frames. In line with recent developments in behavioral theory, the present study defines network ties as episodes of social exchange. This dynamic definition can account for shifts in goal frames during an exchange episode: whereas deliberate choice and hedonic or gain goals drive the initiation of a tie, given the opportunity structure, the normative goal frame activates a strong dynamic effect of reciprocity, which limits actors’ choice set and appears as “self-organization” at the network level. Longitudinal analyses of 18 birthday party networks comprising 501 students support the definition of network ties as exchange episodes, as well as the relevance of humans’ inherent tendency to reciprocate. However, reciprocation is much stronger in dyads of the same ethnicity than in dyads of different ethnicities. Network segregation along ethnic boundaries results from deliberate decisions during the initiation of an episode, but also from different commitments to reciprocity during the ongoing exchange process, depending on intra or interethnic dyadic constellations.

T1  - Population Size and Social Contact as Predictors of Religious Thought and Intergroup Attitudes: The Case of Muslims in Forty Countries
AN  - 2470251105
AB  - This paper examines the effects of different percentages of Muslim population and their interactions with non-Muslims on their religious views and intergroup attitudes. By analyzing three different datasets of Pew Research Center, with an aggregation of more than 39,000 Muslims' responses from 40 different countries, this paper offers a counter-argument against the use of the previously mentioned approach. This will be presented by analyzing these datasets from three different levels of analyses. Unlike the present social contact literature in which the primary focus is on the host/majority population's nature of interaction with minorities and its effects on the former's intergroup attitudes, this research focuses on minorities' contact with majority members and its impact on their religious and intergroup views. Consequently, our findings indicate a more meaningful and factual understanding of Muslim minorities' religious views and intergroup attitudes emerges when their social experiences are taken into consideration.

Based on ethnographic snapshots from Cyprus, it is shown how the agency of migrants from the nearby region not only subverts a restrictive border regime, but also challenges a hegemonic paradigm of citizenship shaped by colonialism, ethnic conflict, as well as crisis and austerity. At the same time, struggles for legal recognition occur in a state of relative autonomy from this social contestation of citizenship. They rather express a desire for freedom of movement as a right in itself, in a context where legal citizenship is becoming synonymous with mobility.

T1  - The hostel wars in apartheid South Africa: rumour, violence and the discourse of victimhood
AN  - 2461415738
AB  - During the transition to democracy in the 1990s, South Africa was engulfed in escalating violence. The majority of the violence occurred in KwaZulu and Natal and the African townships in the Pretoria – Witwatersrand – Vereeniging area. It pitted supporters of the African National Congress against the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). In the area around Johannesburg, the IFP’s mobilisation in workers’ hostels created violent rifts between township communities and IFP aligned hostel dwellers. Based on life history interviews and archival research, this article explores what mobilised hostel dwellers into violent action. The article argues that rumours of threat and expulsion led to the politicisation of ethnic identities and the strengthening of ethnic solidarities. The expulsion of Zulu-speaking hostel dwellers from Sebokeng hostel in July 1990, and the destruction of two hostels in the East Rand, triggered fears among hostel dwellers that their lives and their place in the city were at risk. It paved the way for a discourse of victimhood that framed violence against township communities as ‘defensive’, in an attempt to reverse the status of perpetrators and victims. These fears were further exacerbated and manipulated by IFP propaganda and their espousal of Zulu ethnic nationalism.

T1  - Love knows no colour bar: Windrush, racism and <i>Flame in the Streets</i>
AN  - 2428991997
AB  - Released in the aftermath of the 1958 Notting Hill riots, Flame in the Streets [Baker, Roy. 1961. UK: The Rank Organisation.] remains a distinctive British film of the 1960s in its examination of the racial prejudices that defined African-Caribbean's antagonous relations with the wider British Society. In Baker's attempt to expose the passive racisms of Jacko Palmer by paralleling his family conflict between his wife and daughter with his industrial conflicts as a trade union representative defending the rights of a black co-worker despite the disquiet that his ethnicity has generated from the white workers, the film presents ethnic minority characters in a form that links the personal with the political, interweaving themes of both class and race. Through a historicization and contextualization, this article sets out to examine the ways in which twentieth century post-war immigration and subsequent race struggles influenced the socio-political character of Flame in The Streets.

T1  - Party affiliation and support for Muslim newcomers: masked opposition in the Norwegian context
AN  - 2427338778
AB  - This work considers how anti-immigrant sentiment is selectively revealed, offering a new perspective on the role stigma plays in defining the political mainstream. By way of a survey experiment in Norway, we measure the gap between what people express and the beliefs they hold anonymously, assessing how supporters of distinct political parties situationally conform to expectations about the expression of intolerance. Using three frames, we contrast attitudes toward immigrants, refugees and more general types of new entrants to Norway. We conclude that the intolerance is more widespread than openly expressed sentiment would suggest due to the systematic masking of targeted opposition to Muslim newcomers. Covert expression, under conditions of absolute and permanent anonymity, demonstrate hardened sentiment among the mainstream right. In other words, a large shift in covert attitudes is best understood as a shift in deference to norms about the expression of targeted bias – in this case toward Muslim newcomers – rather than a large change in underlying, anonymously expressed attitudes.

T1  - Muslim youth as global citizens
AN  - 2419909587
AB  - Dominant understandings of global or cosmopolitanism citizenship align it with the ‘modern’ and the ‘secular’, in ways that construct religious belongings as irrational, or indeed ‘pre-modern’. Assumptions of superiority embedded in claims to cosmopolitanism are all the more powerful for being constructed as a ‘universal’, in ways that erase and occlude the local social relations and particularities of the spaces and positions from which these very claims emanate. Resisting such understandings, this paper engages with research into Muslim youth identities with respect to nation, religion and gender in four nation-states of the Global South. It explores how Muslim youth’s strong affective commitments to the religious community of the ‘global Ummah’ can be understood as a distinctive form of global, cosmopolitan citizenship, in ways that are similar to, but also sharply differentiated from modern (secular) understandings of cosmopolitanism. We suggest that appeals to any ‘universal’ cosmopolitan project can work to silence local social relations (such as ethnic, gender, religious or class differentiations), and how all claims to cosmopolitanism are intrinsically sutured to youth’s struggles for positioning within their nation. We stress therefore the importance of attending to local social dynamics throughout our analysis of youth identity constructions and their constitutive others, and take this up throughout the following papers of this special edition.

T1  - Ethnicity, Peers, and Academic Achievement: Who Wants to be Friends with the Smart Kids?
AN  - 2394490903
AB  - Ethnic differences in peer reactions to academic achievement during adolescence has been a widely discussed but controversial issue in developmental and education research. Do peers respond positively or negatively to classmates of different ethnic groups who get good grades in school? The current study addressed this question by examining the linkage between academic achievement and friendship nominations received in an ethnically diverse sample of 4501 sixth grade students (Mage = 11.3 years; 51% female; 41.3% Latino, 25.1% White, 19.3% Asian, and 14.3% Black). The results of mediated moderation analyses showed that for Asians and Whites, higher academic achievement was associated with more same-ethnic friendships, whereas for Blacks and Latinos, higher academic achievement was associated with more cross-ethnic friendships. In addition, ethnic differences in the linkage between academic achievement and friendships were partly explained by classroom ethnic composition. Implications for promoting friendships of high achieving students both within and across ethnic boundaries were discussed.

T1  - Mechanisms of ethnic internationalization: The Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Mongols
AN  - 2352127000
AB  - This article – by looking at selected cases of the ethnic Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Mongols in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), officially a unitary multinational state – proves that domestic ethnic conflicts have the potential to internationalize and become significant interstate crises. While internationalization factors may at times be difficult to differentiate, I highlight four main mechanisms: 1) third-party intervention, 2) irredentism/separatism, 3) refugee movements across borders, and 4) international ethno-terrorism. Media coverage of ethnic conflict may also initiate a call for justice from the international community. The PRC remains a special case, with the Chinese Communist Party’s continued control over ethnic policy and interactions. This research article also reinforces the idea that ethnic conflict can be integrated into both comparative politics and international relations, as such domestic conflicts often involve and affect actors that transcend state boundaries.

T1  - Getting older and living up to implicit followership theories: Implications for employee psychological health and job attitudes
AN  - 2354727698
AB  - Age discrimination at work is a widespread destructive phenomenon that often takes subtle forms. Based on negative stereotypes about older employees, we argue that older employees often experience that they are perceived as less ideal followers than younger employees. We propose that older and younger employees do not differ in what they assume their supervisors expect of an ideal follower (implicit followership theories, IFTs). Thus, we hypothesize that older employees perceive that they compare less favorably to their supervisors' IFTs than younger employees (i.e., worse IFT‐fit). This should entail lower quality of the relationship between leader and follower (leader‐member‐exchange, LMX), which, in turn, should have detrimental effects on employees' health (i.e., burnout) and job attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and identification). We tested our model in a field study with 379 employees. Results differed for ideal and counter‐ideal follower attributes. Concerning counter‐ideal follower attributes (e.g., being incompetent), age had the proposed negative effect on psychological health and job attitudes that mediated through IFT‐fit and LMX. Concerning ideal follower attributes (e.g., thinking ahead), older employees expected their supervisors not only to think less of them than of their younger colleagues, but also expected them to have less demanding IFTs—contrary to our expectations. Employee age was negatively related to psychological health and job attitudes, mediated through lower perceived IFTs, worse perceived appraisal of the actual employee and their joint effects on LMX.

T1  - Militarism and Political Conformism in Sudan and South Sudan
AN  - 2491200833
AB  - The culture of political conformity and arbitrary sociopolitical contracts within Sudan and South Sudan were influenced by colonialist-engineered politics of divide and rule, which were later adopted by the post-independence Sudanese political elites. It has resulted in two bloody civil wars (1955-1972, 1983-2005) that ended with the signing of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the separation of South Sudan in 2011. It is now evident, however, that the separation of South Sudan did not address issues of political stability, and economic and institutional development, or set the stage for political reforms in these two countries. At its core, unresolved political grievances between politically and economically marginalized groups in the peripheral areas of these countries and their unelected military political elites has undermined the quest for sustainable social, economic, and political progress. Hence, the two nations continue to endure challenges derived from decades of armed conflicts tainted by unresolved ethnic, regional, and political grievances. That lack of political will in conflict resolution, transition to democracy, and equitable power sharing, has delayed all aspects of sustainable economic development projects, thereby fueling political unrest and instabilities.

T1  - The Concept of Ambivalence in the Study of Family Relations
AN  - 2379002784
AB  - The purpose of the article was to draw attention to the ambivalence concept, its use and measurement in Russian sociological research, including family. In the article particular emphasis is placed on the "structured ambivalence" core the source of which is a different distribution of privileges and resources in society among social groups based on class, age, gender, ethnicity/race, sexual orientation, place of birth, etc. Structural ambivalence affects the micro level of family interaction. It is important to study the social causes that provoke family ambivalence including social policy, mitigation of social inequalities and social stereotypes. Diversifications of family institute create new sources of family ambivalence such as role uncertainty, role conflict, ambiguity of family boundaries, non-normative family transitions, etc. The article substantiates the actuality of studies of relations between adult children and parents in connection with the increasing number of elderly people associated with an increase in life expectancy and low birth rate. In Russia, as in developed countries, there are problems of care for the elderly, providing them with physical, emotional and financial support, the development of care services. Russian sociology features few works analyzing relationship of genealogical generations – mainly from the perspective of solidarity/ conflict. Not studied remain social sources of intergenerational ambivalence that arise currently, in particular, due to different norms of generations in the marriage and family sphere.

T1  - Irish American Organizations and the Northern Ireland Conflict in the 1980s: Heightened Political Agency and Ethnic Vitality
AN  - 2361955679
AB  - Drawing on two confidential reports, this article demonstrates the significant political agency exercised in the 1980s by Irish and Irish American politicians supported by an unusually robust form of ethnicity. Embodied in hundreds of cultural and fraternal associations, this vigorous Irish American ethnicity was animated by political passion arising out of the conflict in Northern Ireland. The first report, by the Irish Embassy in Washington in 1980, provided first-hand accounts of the widespread activities of Irish American associations, with a view to enlisting their support in resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland. The embassy and Irish American political leaders formed a powerful "Irish lobby" in Washington seeking a solution based on nonviolence and equality between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists, strengthening the hand of the Irish government in its negotiations with the British government. The second report, compiled in 1988 by Sinn Féin, the political wing of the IRA, sought to bring the Irish American republican movement into line with Sinn Féin's recent decision to seek a political solution to the conflict. As Sinn Féin moved gradually away from violence, it exerted control over Noraid, the most important of the hardline Irish American organizations. Both the Irish government and Sinn Féin mobilized an Irish American ethnicity that, far from being merely "symbolic," was rooted in tangible social and political processes in which Irish immigrants and their descendants played the leading role. Whether that ethnicity can retain its vitality in the absence of continued immigration and an animating political cause is an open question.

T1  - Introduction: Between <i>Wataniyya</i> and <i>Ta'ifia</i>; understanding the relationship between state‐based nationalism and sectarian identity in the Middle East
AN  - 2330941590
AB  - This introduction to the four papers that make up the themed section locates them in the wider theoretical, comparative, and historical perspectives from which they originate. First, it places the study of communalist or sectarian identities in the Middle East in broader comparative debates about the study of ethnic and nationalist identities. It then examines the causalities underpinning the shifting relationship between these different identities in the Middle East. Taking modernity as a starting point, it looks at the integration of the region into a global capitalist market from the mid‐19th century and the consequences of this transformation. It then examines the external imposition and growth in coherence and capacity of geographically delineated states. It details the influence that neo‐liberal policy prescriptions have had on those states and their relationship to society. Finally, it examines the role that a series of extended wars played in the forging of and competition between different sets of identities, trans‐state Arab nationalism, state‐based nationalism, and religious and ethnic identities.

T1  - Ethnic boundary-making in health care: Experiences of older Pakistani immigrant women in Norway
AN  - 2363908423
AB  - Older immigrant women experience several barriers in accessing health care. In this study, we explored how older Pakistani women are met with, and respond to, barriers to health care in Norway, using an ethnic boundary-making and intersectionality approach. Our data included interviews with 23 older Pakistani women and 10 caregivers. We found that ethnic boundaries were constructed in healthcare interactions and were influenced by participants' social positions. At the micro level, the interplay of language barriers and being an immigrant fuelled the making of ethnic boundaries. At the macro level, ethnicised cultural discourse in the public sphere fuelled the making of ethnic boundaries in health care. Having encountered ethnic boundaries in health care, older Pakistani women actively coped through compensatory, de-stigmatising and boundary-modifying strategies.

T1  - Problems of Education in the Third State Duma, as a Reflection of the Spiritual Condition of Society
AN  - 2335666224
AB  - The significance of this study is that the issues of cross-cultural communications between the Russian people, which were relevant in the early XX century, will remain relevant in the XXI century. Therefore, this paper described the issues related to the establishment of the mutual understanding and tolerance to "aliens"/nonRussians using an example of education the issues discussed by the 3rd State Duma. In fact, the Russian history proves that the state evolution is only possible with inter-ethnic peace. In addition, ethnic and religious peace is impossible without a dialog between cultures and religions because the cross-civilization exchange is the best way to harmonize the cross-ethnic and cross-religious relations. Thus, results obtained from the paper may be used for teaching, digests, and meta-studies in the Russian history for creating specialized courses and educational programs, educating children and youth, and management decision-making in the social and cultural spheres.

T1  - Changing Our Frameworks Can Help Parse Racial Disparities in Stress-Related Morbidity
AN  - 2329157625
AB  - Stark racial divisions along economic and social lines have long been and continue to be defining features of American life. Health disparities across racial groups are considered downstream consequences of these economic and social divisions. Neoclassical economics, political economy, and stratification economics provide potential explanations for health disparities. Preliminary support for the stratification approach is provided in the research. Understanding the causes of racial health disparities is crucial in developing better policy solutions to those disparities.

T1  - Pathways linking intergenerational cultural dissonance and alcohol use among Asian American youth: The role of family conflict, parental involvement, and peer behavior
AN  - 2306380578
AB  - A difference in degree of acculturation between immigrant parents and children, known as intergenerational cultural dissonance (ICD), is a risk factor for adolescent alcohol use. We used path analysis with 292 Vietnamese and Cambodian adolescents from immigrant families in the United States to measure potential mediators (family conflict, parental involvement/monitoring, association with deviant peers) of the ICD-alcohol use relationship. The hypothesized model was an adequate data fit among both groups. Among Cambodian adolescents, higher ICD levels significantly predicted increased family conflict, which in turn was associated with reduced parental involvement/monitoring, increased association with deviant peers, and a subsequently higher risk of alcohol use (p < .05 for all coefficients). We also found significant indirect effects of ICD on alcohol use among Vietnamese adolescents through family conflict and parental involvement/monitoring (p < .05 for all coefficients) but not through peer behavior. For both groups, there was no direct effect of ICD on alcohol use outside these pathways. Identification of significant mediators provides potential targets for preventing alcohol use among these populations. In addition, differences in path coefficients between Vietnamese and Cambodian adolescents underscore the importance of conducting analyses stratified by Asian ethnic group.

T1  - Making moral migrants? Exploring the educational aspirations of Black African and Caribbean boys in a New York City public school
AN  - 2299102264
AB  - Drawing on 48 in-depth interviews with Black immigrant and second-generation boys at Bridgewood secondary school in New York City, this article points out how the high educational aspirations expressed by Black African and Caribbean boys are strategically deployed as features of an ethnic project to counter anti-immigrant sentiments and anti-Black racism in US society. The findings indicate that in a context of rising xenophobia along with the historical and continual stereotypes of Black people in the US, participants' aspirations for elite higher education function as strategies to enhance their individual and ethnic reputations. High educational aspirations were also used to justify emigration to and worth within the US. At its core, this article illustrates how participants mobilized aspirations to represent themselves as moral migrants and 'worthy' ethnic minorities. Moral claims and ethnicity-based campaigns associated with aspirations are problematized because they reinforce the hierarchical racial order that informs US society.

T1  - Facing Fear and Responding with Courage: Understanding How Fear Constitutes the "Emotional Citizenship" of Voluntary Returnees to Bosnia and Herzegovina
TT  - Suočiti se sa strahom i odgovoriti hrabrošću: razumijevanje uloge emocije straha u konstitutiranju »emotivne dimenzije« državljanstva pripadnika iseljeništva koji su se dobrovoljno vratili u Bosnu i Hercegovinu
AN  - 2338123885
AB  - This paper examines the case of voluntary return migration to a post-conflict society, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), where the returnee freely chooses to go back despite having a viable alternative of livelihood and a well-integrated social presence abroad. The initial claim of the paper is that the motivation for this type of return is primarily emotional. Although the much researched (Brown, 2014) "patriotic love" is certainly part of returnees' emotional landscape, other emotions play an equal, and sometimes a more important role. Arguing that fear is a key emotion constituting returnees' daily experience of BiH citizenship, the paper identifies three dimensions of fear: ethnic discrimination, economic uncertainty and abuse of political power. Returnees' continued life and work in the home state represent an act of remarkable courage, the success of which does not occur because of the state structure envisioned by the Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA) that comprises the current BiH Constitution, but in spite of the obstacles it creates. The argument is based on a thematic analysis of 35 in-depth interviews conducted with members of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian diaspora/transmigrants, who have voluntarily decided to return and settle in BiH.Alternate abstract:Ovaj rad razmatra slučaj dobrovoljne povratne migracije u postkonfliktno društvo, kao što je to Bosna i Hercegovina (BiH), kada se povratnik, iako ima pravnu, ekonomsku i društvenu mogućnost da ostane živjeti i raditi u inozemstvu, svojevoljno odluči vratiti. Početna je tvrdnja rada da je osnovna motivacija za ovakvu vrstu migracije emotivne prirode i da, iako duboko istražena emocija »patriotske ljubavi« (Brown, 2014) čini značajan dio povratničke emotivne strukture, i druge emocije igraju jednaku, a u nekim slučajevima i važniju ulogu. Autoričin je argument da je strah jedna od ključnih emocija koje konstituiraju povratničko svakodnevno iskustvo državljanstva te navodi tri dimenzije straha: etničku diskriminaciju, ekonomsku neizvjesnost i zloupotrebu političke moći. Činjenica da povratnici nastavljaju živjeti i raditi u Bosni i Hercegovini čin je njihove velike hrabrosti, a uspjeh njihova povratka nije uvjetovan državnom strukturom predviđenom Daytonskim mirovnim sporazumom, koji uključuje i sadašnji ustav BiH, nego se događa usprkos svim preprekama koje ovakva državna struktura podrazumijeva. Autorica svoje zaključke temelji na tematskoj kvalitativnoj analizi podataka iz 35 dubinskih intervjua s pripadnicima bosanskohercegovačkog iseljeništva koji su se dobrovoljno odlučili vratiti i ponovo nastaniti u BiH.

T1  - Why Immigrants’ Multiple Identities Matter: Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice
AN  - 2241814650
AB  - Immigrants and their descendants typically identify with ethnic, national, religious, and/or regional groups, in various combinations and with varying degrees of compatibility or conflict. Research and theorizing on these patterns of identification, as represented in this issue, suggest guideposts for future research and domains for policy development. Here, we identify some of the issues that warrant additional research and we consider implications of existing research on dual (or multiple) identification for the development and implementation of policies related to immigrants. Examples of the former include the need for careful specification of concepts, the consideration of multiple dimensions of identity, deeper examination of identity meanings, methodological extensions in time and space, and greater theoretical integration. Policy development will require greater attention to various identity combinations, advocacy for national inclusivity, the promotion of sites for positive intergroup contact, and maximizing the potential for immigrants with multiple identities to help bridge intergroup gaps.

T1  - Super-diversity, austerity, and the production of precarity: Latin Americans in London
AN  - 2188157619
AB  - Intensified globalisation, upheaval, conflict and inequality are creating new patterns of global migration and mobility in the 21st century. As a result, the dynamics of urban diversity is changing: global cities like London are increasingly characterised by the super-diversity of their residents, including increasing complexities of legal status. ‘New’ diversity interacts with ‘old’ ethnic diversity to create complex patterns of difference, the impact of which is felt at local level, including sites of service provision. This article draws on research on barriers to service access for Latin Americans in London, to examine the intersections between super-diversity and super-austerity. Latin Americans constitute a new migrant group in London with considerable internal diversity. The article discusses the interlocking challenges they face in accessing services. I argue that focusing on barriers to service access for this particular group provides a window onto new inequalities in super-diverse austerity Britain and the production of precarity.

T1  - Ethnicity and conflict severity: accounting for the effect of co-ethnic and non-ethnic militias on battlefield lethality
AN  - 2212829870
AB  - How does the presence of armed pro-regime groups affect conflict lethality? This study examines the relationship between ethnicity, militia violence and conflict lethality in civil wars. We emphasise that differences in whether pro-regime militias were recruited in accordance with their ethnicity or not are critical in their influence upon conflict lethality, which we estimate in battlefield deaths. To that end, we categorise militias into groups recruited on their ethnic basis (co-ethnic militias) and those recruited regardless of their ethnicity (non-ethnic militias). We hypothesise that conflicts are more lethal when non-ethnic militias are involved. We link higher number of battle-deaths in conflicts with non-ethnic militias with the militia use of one-sided violence against civilians. Co-ethnic militias - that is militias recruited from the same ethnicity as rebels - are deployed amongst their co-ethnics and therefore tend to target civilians less than non-ethnic militias. This militia-civilian relationship has direct impact on conflict severity. To test our hypotheses we conduct global statistical analysis of 84 intrastate conflicts from 1989 to 2014.

T1  - Answering Questions About Race: How Racial and Ethnic Identities Influence Survey Response
AN  - 2174079677
AB  - Given the fundamental role that race and ethnicity play in U.S. society, sensitive survey items on this subject can often lead individuals to underreport their true attitudes. Previous studies have shown that the absence of an interviewer reduces the pressure to provide socially desirable responses. The 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies (ANES), where both interviewer and self-administered surveys were used, allows us to test whether mode effects emerge in the way respondents answer survey items related to racial attitudes. We also expect mode effects to vary based on the extent to which individuals are politically socialized in the United States. We find that respondents tend to underreport their racial animosity in interview-administered versus online surveys. Moreover, underreporting is nonexistent in the responses provided by foreign-born Latinos, but emerges for U.S.-born Latinos, Blacks, and Whites. These findings pose a number of implications for our understanding of racial attitudes and survey mode.

T1  - Assessing High School Students’ Cost Concerns About Pursuing STEM: “Is It Worth It?”
AN  - 2180438677
AB  - Women and ethnic minorities (e.g., Latinos) continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In an attempt to understand why these STEM minorities are underrepresented, we explored high school students’ cost perceptions about pursuing STEM in college. Past research has grouped cost into three dimensions: effort, loss of valued alternatives (LoVA), and emotional. Focus group interviews with Latino high school students confirmed the three cost dimensions, but there were some cultural sources of cost unique to our sample. Consequently, we modified and refined existing cost items to create a STEM-specific and culturally contextualized cost scale. We utilized our scale to examine how high school students at the intersection of gender, ethnicity, and math identification differ in cost perceptions. Results showed that high, compared with low, math-identified students had lower effort and LoVA costs. Among high math-identified students, we also found that STEM ethnic minorities had lower emotional cost than STEM ethnic majorities.

T1  - The Status and Problems of the Gerontogroup (Based on Surveys of the Rostov Region Residents)
AN  - 2212702564
AB  - In recent decades, Russian social practices have noted trends in the growth of negative stereotypes of old age, the displacement of problems and interests of older citizens on the periphery of social life, the substitution of informal social support mechanisms for older people, which updates the need to analyze the situation and problems of older persons age group in Russia and regions, the search for mechanisms to improve their status and the establishment in Russia of a favorable social climate of aging. The aim of this article is to present the results of surveys of residents of the Rostov region in 2012–2017, devoted to assessing the status of the gerontogroup. Data of polls of the Rostov region residents confirm a slow, but steady tendency of decrease in a role of family support and responsibility of family for performance of functions of leaving against the background of growth of hopes for the state nature of the social help, the opinion that obligations for care of elderly have to lie on elderly, on social services, nursing homes gains weight. The tendency of decrease in the economic status of elderly people in the region is noted, the old age and aging are associated with poverty, the optimum level of income of the person "at respectable age" is almost twice less than real. Growth of expectations concerning the level of provision of pensions is noted, however, representatives of a gerontogroup are socially passive, modestly estimate the income as satisfactory or sufficient, would prefer to have work rather and to distance pension borders, than to expect increase in pension. Economic problems, the need for available high-quality free medical care are among traditionally current problems of a gerontogroup; in 2017 the importance of a problem of employment and social service grew.

T1  - A conflict that did not happen: revisiting the Javakhk affair in Georgia
AN  - 2172604675
AB  - During and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, several violent conflicts erupted in different parts of its (former) territory. The South Caucasus region has experienced three ethnically rooted violent conflicts, yet other ethnic disputes in the same region remained dormant. Despite an extensive literature on the South Caucasus conflicts, research on those ethnic disputes that could have erupted during the collapse of the Soviet Union is scarce. This article discusses the case of the Armenian populated region of Javakhk (Javakheti) in Georgia. It explores the questions of how, unlike the Abkhazian and South Ossetian movements that were able to effectively mobilize against Georgian calls for sovereignty leading up to the Soviet collapse, Armenian populated territories in Georgia remained relatively quiet. Considering that the primary ethnic minority groups within the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic could each be linked by concerns over demographic shifts, economic discrimination/resource allocation, and political representation, the absence of conflict in Javakhk, as well as in Kvemo Kartli, is somewhat surprising. Based on existing theories of nationalism and ethnic conflicts and field interviews with the leaders of the popular movements in Javakhk, the paper examines the underlying reasons for the lack of conflict there.

T1  - Constructing Cityscapes: Locality, Materiality and Territoriality on the Urban Construction Site in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Northwest China
AN  - 2168810724
AB  - Urbanization in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Northwest China) has gained momentum in the last three decades. The Chinese government supports infrastructure development in this border region and construction sites have been emerging everywhere. Often framed as a planned nation‐state project of sinicization from above, from an ethnographic perspective infrastructure development involves a much more diverse set of actors and their different motives. The construction sector offers a gateway for global and national architectural designs and manpower to enter the making of local cityscapes. Besides engaging with the political economy of construction activities, this article outlines the meaning of the construction site as a place where social and ethnic senses of locality are negotiated. The data show that many of the economic, material, social and design mobilities on the construction site in Xinjiang extend eastwards to the rest of China rather than to Central Asian countries which are geographically much closer. Power relations and ethnic issues become interwoven into the construction of new cityscapes. In particular, the domination of Han actors in the planning and implementation of construction projects shapes not only the materiality of the built environment but also related senses of locality.

T1  - Narratives of Agency and Capability from Two Adolescent Girls in Post-conflict Liberia
AN  - 2082395992
AB  - Between 1989 and 2003, Liberia experienced a brutal civil war characterized by ethnic killings, sexual violence and the use of child soldiers. Five years after the war ended, half the population of Liberia was under 18 years old. Understanding the needs of these youth is thus essential to the recovery of the nation. This study focuses on the narratives of two female adolescents, selected from 75 in-depth individual interviews with post-conflict Liberian youth conducted in 2012. A narrative analysis approach was employed to examine each interview for multiple layers of meaning. The aim of the study was to elucidate factors that may enable post-conflict youth to reclaim a sense of agency and return to normal developmental tasks. The study explores the ways in which these youth navigate complicated power dynamics in the post-conflict setting and how gender impacts their experiences of their own agency and capability. The dynamics between the participants and the interviewer are explored to further illustrate how power dynamics manifest. These narratives support the involvement of youth in projects that help others as an avenue for promoting agency and resilience for themselves.

T1  - Social exchange and integration into visits-at-home networks: Effects of third-party intervention and residential segregation on boundary-crossing
AN  - 2123579126
AB  - In this study, the concept of social integration will be rebuilt along arguments from social exchange theory and applied to close ties in social networks. Visiting children at home is part of daily routine–behaviour based on trust and expectations of reciprocity. Two different approaches to longitudinal modelling of ties in network data show that, once initiated, visits-at-home ties strongly tend towards reciprocity. While the intensification of these ties can be explained by E. Lawler’s affect theory of social exchange, their initiation will be regarded as a rational decision based on uncertainty and costs. Both increase when ethnic boundaries need to be crossed. Ethnic-residential segregation and spatial distance reduce the opportunity structure of inter-ethnic visits, and third-party intervention often inhibits ties in these networks.

T1  - Online ethnic segregation in a post-conflict setting
AN  - 2116656084
AB  - Existing research has shown that online networks are often segregated along identity lines, such as political ideology or religious views. Although online segregation should be specifically detrimental when appearing between ethnic groups in a post-conflict setting, to date we have no systematic evidence on the level of online ethnic segregation. To close this gap, the present study examines online ethnic segregation in a large ethnically mixed blogger network in a post-conflict society, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since politics has been found to enhance ethnic divides in the offline world, we additionally examine whether segregation is higher for bloggers engaging with political topics. Using large-scale web scraping, automated text analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, we find evidence for pronounced ethnic divisions. Furthermore, we find that political bloggers tend to have more ethnically segregated networks. The findings show that a broad public exchange transcending ethnic categories remains limited in the online context we study, and that those who dominate the online political debate tend to be those who in their social interactions put even more weight on ethnic categories than the average.

T1  - Immigration Policies and Social Determinants of Health: Is Immigrants’ Health at Risk?
AN  - 2063531578
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of immigration legislation on Latino immigrants within the social determinants of health framework to understand the impact of such legislation on the immigrant’s health. While the socio-political climate in California is geared towards more pro-integration immigration policies, findings indicate that immigrants still experiences poor treatment in the form of microaggressions, horizontal discrimination, and institutional discrimination. This poor treatment may be an indication of residual anti-immigrant sentiment that remains in the state as well as a spillover effect from the anti-immigrant legislation being passed in neighboring states or national rhetoric. The findings overlap with four domains of the social determinants of health framework including economic stability, education, health and access to care, and social and community context. Implications for practice, policy and research are discussed.

T1  - Attendance Trajectory Classes Among Divorced and Separated Mothers and Fathers in the New Beginnings Program
AN  - 2053218430
AB  - We examined attendance trajectories among mothers and fathers in the effectiveness trial of the New Beginnings Program, a parenting-focused prevention program for divorced and separated parents. We also investigated attendance trajectory class differences on two sets of pretest covariates: one set previously linked to participation in programs not specifically targeting divorced parents (i.e., sociodemographics, perceived parenting skills, child problem behaviors, parent psychological distress) and another that might be particularly salient to participation in the context of divorce (i.e., interparental conflict, level of parent-child contact, previous marital status to the ex-spouse). For mothers and fathers, results supported four attendance trajectory classes: (1) non-attenders (NA), (2) early dropouts (ED), (3) declining attenders (DA), and (4) sustained attenders (SA). In the final model testing multiple covariates simultaneously, mothers who were EDs and DAs were more likely to be Latina than SAs, and EDs reported more interparental conflict than SAs. Mother trajectory groups did not differ on parenting skills, child problem behavior, or mother-child contact in the final or preliminary models. In the final model for fathers, EDs rated their children higher on externalizing than DAs, had less contact with their children than DAs and NAs, and reported less distress than SAs. Father trajectory groups did not differ on fathers’ age, ethnicity, income, perceived parenting skills, or interparental conflict in the final or preliminary models. Results highlight qualitatively distinct latent classes of mothers and fathers who disengage from a parenting intervention at various points. We discuss implications for intervention engagement strategies and translational science.

T1  - Gender morality and emotion work in Taiwanese immigrant in-law relations
AN  - 2019337047
AB  - This study examines major social, economic, and cultural factors that sustain in-law inequality in Taiwanese transnational families. Data are based on life-history interviews with 16 Taiwanese immigrant women and ethnographic observations in a Midwest urban area. Findings suggest that middle-class immigrants' abilities to host in-laws for lengthy periods and parents-in-law's financial support for immigrant couples lead to the living arrangement of three-generation households in many immigrant families. Daughters-in-law in these households experience enormous stress because their mothers-in-law demand obedience. Traditional gender norms become moralized when the women's husbands, mothers, and fellow immigrants reinforce Confucian cultural values of filial piety and respect for the elderly. Considering the importance of securing a stable family and children's well-being, the women hesitate to challenge the power imbalance in their in-law relations. In a single ethnic household and a private domestic space, no competing gender ideology is available to contest Confucian culture. As a result, the women are compelled to fulfil their gender role expectations as submissive daughters-in-law. To cope with this home environment, they conduct varying degrees of emotion work and silence their voices, which results in the persistence of in-law patriarchy in these transnational households.

T1  - Acculturation Gap Distress among Latino Youth: Prospective Links to Family Processes and Youth Depressive Symptoms, Alcohol Use, and Academic Performance
AN  - 1983623063
AB  - Latino youth have higher rates of educational and mental health difficulties compared to peers from other racial/ethnic groups. To understand the factors related to such maladjustment, a mediational model linking youth report of parent-youth acculturation gaps to prospective changes (from spring to fall semester) in youth report of academic performance, depressive symptoms and alcohol use via youth report of parent-youth conflict and family cohesion, was studied in a sample of 248 U.S.—and foreign—born Latino youth (Mage = 15.21 years; 50% female; 67% U.S.-born). Parent-youth acculturation gaps were associated with changes in youth academic performance across two semesters via their negative impact on family functioning. For U.S.-born youth, parent–youth acculturation gaps were also linked to changes in alcohol use via parent-adolescent conflict. Results provide some support for the acculturative gap hypotheses while unique findings across nativity groups suggest that such individual-level characteristics may serve as important sources of variation for Latino youth.

T1  - Writing Gifted Baby Cyprus: Anticolonial Ethnic Motherland Nationalist Literatures
AN  - 1992008917
AB  - This essay assigns the literary as the preferred means to write Cyprus because it exposes the power of place and space in postcolonial partitioned cases; it shows that spatial production determines the formation and agency of identity in Cyprus, which serves to sharpen and to blur the dominant binary legacy of historical-political deadlock discourse, so as to generate conflict and solidarity between the deeply divided people in postcolonial partitioned Cyprus. The focus is on the Greek-cypriot and Turkish-cypriot nationalist identification that dominated throughout the last decades of British colonial and into postcolonial Cyprus. This is an examination of ethnic motherland nationalist literatures, with emphasis on capturing the ways writers actively write, read and construct the dominant production of Cyprus. Even though nationalists' writings are based on deeply competing narratives, they have used the same processes and practices to produce a Cyprus for their ethnic selves. This spatial competition and solidarity will be examined through various empirical-theoretical spatial approaches, with emphasis on illuminating the postcolonial and partitioned inventions of gendered nationalism, through making use of Yi-Fu Tuan's healthy balance between experiencing place and space and Henri Lefebvre's spatiology. The essay demonstrates the shared ways in which nationalist writers attempt to produce an ethnically homogeneous mental place through two gendered processes - a maternal principle and ancestral journeys operating with fetish spectacles, objects and substances - that manipulate social, historical and spatial practices to make the abstract nation appear concrete. This place is thus depicted as a gift from the mothers to the children of Cyprus and as Baby Cyprus.

T1  - The human right to health: exploring disability, migration and health
AN  - 1953921393
AB  - Across the globe, an estimated one billion people are on the move today, of whom 244 million are international migrants. Not only have global horizons expanded in the realm of work and study; global conflict and exploitation have resulted in forced migration. Migration is a political issue, which raises questions of identity, citizenship, diversity and integration and is utilised to play upon the fear of the stranger, the 'Other' and difference in contemporary society. Disabled migrants are a hidden population whose experiences are often overlooked or subsumed within wider debates around disability and ethnicity. This article considers the intersection of disability and migration in contemporary society through the lens of healthcare access. Reflecting on the impact of citizenship rights on the realisation of human rights in the context of contemporary migration, using health as an example, the article considers the implications for disabled migrants, focusing primarily on the European Union.

T1  - Mother tongues and languaging in Malaysia: Critical linguistics under critical examination
AN  - 1934008023
AB  - This article brings the critical turn in linguistics--with its current scepticism towards essentialised languages and bias for languaging--under critical evaluation. It does so by bringing it face-to-face with the local-knowledge turn in sociolinguistics that investigates local knowledge and local epistemologies, held by language users themselves, to understand sociolinguistic phenomena. This article analyses whether and how the epistemologies inherent to language, mother tongue, and languaging hold relevance in local metalinguistic talk in Malaysia. Focus group discussions with ethnic Malay, Chinese, and Indian youth reveal that languaging through Bahasa Rojak is already firmly embedded in local epistemologies for communicating across ethnolinguistic divides and fostering interethnic inclusiveness. An essentialised view of language, however, remains vital to any holistic sociolinguistic research in Malaysia in culturally specific ways that do not conflict with languaging. The article therefore supports arguments that we ought not to disregard mother tongues in the interests of critical linguistics.

T1  - The Expansion of Emergency Powers: Social Conflict and the Military in Indonesia
AN  - 1915899446
AB  - The exercise of emergency powers is always controversial. This article identifies the expansion of the type and scope of emergency powers through legislative reform. It does so by examining the Indonesian Law on Social Conflict 2012, which allows a state of social conflict to be declared at the national, regional or local level in response to social conflict, such as conflict between religious or ethnic communities. The deliberate choice of the term "state of social conflict", rather than "state of emergency", is an attempt to obscure the nature of these powers. Analysis of these powers and the debate that has ensued suggests that the law expands the types of situation in which powers usually only reserved for an emergency are used, and by delegating this power to local authorities, the law in effect amounts to the expansion of emergency powers. I suggest that this should lead to renewed focus on meaningful limits and checks on the exercise of power during times of emergency.

T1  - Social Forces and Regime Change: Beyond Class Analysis
AN  - 1978381727
AB  - This article discusses three recent books that analyze patterns of political conflict and regime change in postcolonial Asia and Africa using a social forces approach to political analysis. The social forces tradition, originally pioneered by Barrington Moore, studies the social origins and political consequences of struggles between social groups whose members hold shared identities and interests. The works under review examine, respectively, the varied regime trajectories of Southeast Asia's states, divergent regime outcomes in India and Pakistan, and the institutional origins of social cleavages and political conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. Although historically the social forces paradigm has focused on conflict between class actors, the author argues that these three works fruitfully extend the social forces approach to encompass struggles between nonclass social groups, including those defined along the lines of ethnicity, religion, nationality, region, and family. This pluralized version of the social forces approach is better suited to studying patterns of regime change in Asia and Africa, where the paradigm has been less frequently applied than it has been to cases in Europe and Latin America.

T1  - Talking about sunbed tanning: Social representations and identity-work
AN  - 1927146071
AB  - Despite the publicised health risks associated with its usage, sunbed tanning remains popular in many Western countries. Previous research indicates that knowledge of the harmful effects does not necessarily lead to a reduction in sunbed use. The aim of this study was to develop a more extensive social psychological understanding of sunbed use, in the United Kingdom, by exploring the social representations of sunbed tanning held by both those who use and who have never used sunbeds. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 sunbed users and 10 who had never used a sunbed. A thematic analysis identified two dimensions in the social representations of both the users and non-users; these were concerned with a) health and b) beauty. However, whereas non-users emphasised the health risks, users downplayed and minimised them, instead emphasising the health benefits. Similarly, whereas non-users emphasised the negative aspects of excessive concern with beauty, sunbed users challenged and distanced themselves from this negativity. Sunbed users were engaged in a form of identity-work to protect themselves from the wider negativity and disapproval of which they were aware. Theoretically, social representations theory has provided a unique lens through which to explore this topic, highlighting the importance of taking into consideration the wider environment in which sunbed use takes place. Preliminary practical suggestions include that health workers should consider identity-work when designing interventions aimed at reducing sunbed use. Findings also suggest that, rather than continuing to educate sunbed users about the risks, campaigns and interventions should challenge the commonly drawn upon arguments about the health benefits. These benefits emerged as a particularly powerful discursive tool for the sunbed users in helping to justify their behaviour, but also to counteract negative stereotypes and assumptions they knew others held of them.

T1  - The Cultural Adaptation of a Community-Based Child Maltreatment Prevention Initiative
AN  - 1906672383
AB  - A unique primary prevention effort, Strong Communities for Children (Strong Communities), focuses on changing attitudes and expectations regarding communities' collective responsibilities for the safety of children. Findings from a 6-year pilot of the initiative in South Carolina have shown promise in reducing child maltreatment, but efforts to adapt the initiative to different cultural contexts have been lacking. No models exist for adapting an initiative that takes a community-level approach to ensuring children's safety. Thus, this article addresses the gap by providing an overview of the original initiative, how the initiative was adapted to the Israeli context, and lessons learned from the experience. Building on conceptualizations of cultural adaptation by Castro et al. (Prevention Science, 5, 2004, 41) and Resnicow et al. (Ethnicity and Disease, 9, 1999, 11), sources of nonfit (i.e., sociodemographic traits, political conflict, government services, and the presence and role of community organizations) were identified and deep and surface structure modifications were made to the content and delivery. Ultimately, this article describes the adaption and dissemination of a community-based child maltreatment prevention initiative in Tel Aviv, Israel, and addresses researchers' calls for more publications describing the adaptation of interventions and the procedures that need to be implemented to achieve cultural relevance. 
Strong Communities for Children o Strong Communities ("Comunidades fuertes para los niños"), una iniciativa única de prevención primaria, se centra en el cambio de actitudes y expectativas con respecto a las responsabilidades colectivas de las comunidades en relación con la seguridad de los niños. Los resultados obtenidos de una prueba piloto de dicha iniciativa implementada en Carolina del Sur durante 6 años fueron prometedores a la hora de reducir el maltrato infantil, pero hace falta esfuerzos para adaptar la iniciativa a diferentes contextos culturales. No existen modelos orientados a adaptar una iniciativa que utiliza un enfoque a nivel comunitario para garantizar la seguridad de los niños. En consecuencia, este artículo aborda esta carencia proporcionando una breve reseña de la iniciativa original, la manera en la que se adaptó dicha iniciativa al contexto israelí, y lo aprendido a raíz de la experiencia. Retomando las conceptualizaciones sobre la adaptación cultural de Castro y colegas (2004) y de Resnicow y colegas (1999), se identificaron las fuentes de incompatibilidad (p. ej.: características sociodemográficas, conflicto político, servicios gubernamentales, y presencia y rol de organizaciones comunitarias) y se realizaron modificaciones en las estructuras profunda y superficial del contenido y la entrega. Por último, este artículo describe la adaptación y la difusión de una iniciativa comunitaria de prevención del maltrato infantil en Tel Aviv, Israel, y aborda los reclamos de los investigadores de un incremento en las publicaciones que describan la adaptación de las intervenciones y los procedimientos que han de implementarse para adquirir relevancia cultural.

T1  - Social trust and radical right-wing populist party preferences
AN  - 1907123544
AB  - In this study, we examine the role of social trust as an individual and a neighborhood-level determinant for radical right-wing populist party preferences. We argue that high social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences and that this relationship is essentially mediated by negative attitudes toward immigrants. Using data from the Netherlands’ Life Course Study, we employ multilevel structural equation modeling to test our argument on support for the Party for Freedom (PVV). The results reveal that individual social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences. Beyond the micro-level relationship, we find that neighborhood social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences. In either case, the effects are mediated by anti-immigrant sentiments. Our findings provide evidence for the importance of social trust as a multilevel construct in explanations for radical right-wing populist party preferences.

T1  - Is America More Divided by Race or Class? Race, Income, and Attitudes among Whites, African Americans, and Latinos
AN  - 1900220845
AB  - Scholars have long been interested in examining how race and class each shape citizens’ political attitudes. To date, however, there have been few efforts to untangle how race and class intersect to shape Americans’ political identities and attitudes about public policies. We argue that it is important to investigate attitudes inter-sectionally. Pooling the 2012 and 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies to obtain large numbers of observations of non-whites and individuals with high incomes, we observe patterns of partisan identity, beliefs about racial prejudice, and attitudes about public policies. Our results suggest that race and class intersect in different ways for different groups in society. Increasing income erodes differences in attitudes between Latinos and whites, but has no effect on the large gap in attitudes between African Americans and whites.

T1  - Identity and social solidarity: an ignored connection. A historical perspective on the state of Europe and its nations
AN  - 1873509972
AB  - The article comments on the ongoing de-Europeanisation and re-nationalisation of Europe from a historical perspective. The article argues that the building of national community from the 1870s onwards focused on the problem of social integration where the development of emotional feelings of belonging and solidarity was linked to the building of institutions for social politics in mutually reinforcing dynamics. The social question emerged in the wake of the spread of industrial capitalism. Its role is underexplored in the study of the building of national and European communities. The social question draws attention to the institutional capacity of nation states rather than nations based on emotions. Nationalism did not only mean the building of friend- enemy distinctions through ethnicity but also national socialism as a conservative reform strategy against class struggle socialism. This contention between two approaches to the problem of social integration moulded together national communities through emotions and institutions without deploying the concept of identity. The article outlines this development, culminating in the (West) European welfare states as nation- states in the strong sense of the merger of these two terms, and how it came to an end in the 1970s when a reverse development began towards social disintegration at the end accompanied by accelerating nationalism and xenophobia. The identity concept was mobilised in 1973 as a tool in the European integration project to compensate for the erosion of social institutions by means of emotions. It was taken over and politicised from having been a technical term in mathematics and psychoanalysis. The politicisation of the identity concept was an indication of a deep identity crisis in Europe and its nations. The identity therapy failed, and the identity crisis remains, accompanied by an ever louder nationalistic and xenophobic vocabulary. Emotions replace institutions. The methodological focus of the article is on the semantics around key concepts such as social politics, solidarity and identity in their historical context as forward-looking and action-oriented concepts in the construction of community. This approach with a focus on past futures is an alternative to the application of the retrospective analytical concepts of ethnic and civic nationalism outlining present pasts.

T1  - World Heritage listing and changes of political values: a case study in West Lake Cultural Landscape in Hongzhou, China
AN  - 1923800513
AB  - World Heritage themes and frameworks, as well as the criteria for assessing the 'outstanding universal values' (OUV) of World Heritage sites, have been extensively criticised for being Eurocentric. Asia is a region of extraordinary levels of cultural, religious and ethnic diversity, which often comes into conflict with UNESCO understandings of heritage. Due to the influence of UNESCO, and the persuasiveness of the heritage discourses it authorises, Asian nations tend to utilise assessments and management ideologies that derive from a European viewpoint. This paper explores the changes in the political role of heritage during the process of World Heritage listing of a Chinese cultural heritage site, West Lake Cultural Landscape of Hangzhou. The study is based on three and a half months of fieldwork in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou. Firstly, I examine how the government officials and experts formulated the nomination dossier, and explore their purposes in seeking World Heritage listing and their understanding of heritage. In addition, tensions between governments' understanding of the values of the site and those of UNESCO and ICOMOS will be mapped. Secondly, I examine how the Chinese government used the World Heritage 'brand' and policies to construct national and local narratives during and after the World Heritage listing. In this paper, I argue that both national and local governments are quite cynical about the listing process, in that they not only recognise they are playing a game, but that the game is 'played' under Eurocentric rules and terms. They know some Chinese values do not fit into UNESCO's conception of 'outstanding universal value' (OUV), and they have 'edited out' those Chinese values, which could not be explained to Western experts, and utilised the discourses of international policy and expertise. Ultimately, these values and 'rules' frame the management of the sites to some extent, as the Chinese government must not, in order to maintain the WH listing, deviate too much from the rules of the game.

T1  - Conflict and Development
AN  - 1983664830
AB  - In this review, we examine the links between economic development and social conflict. By economic development, we refer broadly to aggregate changes in per capita income and wealth or in the distribution of that wealth. By social conflict, we refer to within-country unrest, ranging from peaceful demonstrations, processions, and strikes to violent riots and civil war. We organize our review by critically examining three common perceptions: that conflict declines with ongoing economic growth; that conflict is principally organized along economic differences rather than similarities; and that conflict, most especially in developing countries, is driven by ethnic motives.

T1  - Kashmir Conflict: The Nationalistic Perspective (A Pre-Partition Phenomenon)
AN  - 1924616891
AB  - This paper argues with the changing narrative of Kashmir conflict in international arena, which is generally taken as an inter-state conflict between India and Pakistan. While this conflict must be viewed as an indigenous struggle for economic and social justice with its roots tracing back to 1846. This is also an effort to delink Kashmir from being merely an inter-state conflict to the conflict being a local Kashmiri struggle to preserve their identity based on distinct ethnicity. To understand the nature of conflict in true sense, Kashmir conflict is divided into two phases -prepartition and post partition period. Many proposals are put forward by various stake holders to resolve the conflict in Kashmir, but rigidity in attitudes at both sides India and Pakistan has made the situation worse. All concerned parties are having different perspective over Kashmir as per their specific interests. Peace process dynamics are weak with least attention from United States and other major powers to resolve the issue. The paper ends with the certain recommendations to resolve the issue.

T1  - From society to tribal communities
AN  - 1846285393
AB  - Between the 18th and the 20th centuries, modernity was built on rationalism, individualism (the individual seen as a unit) and on the social contract of the Republic, united and indivisible. The modernist project was to dominate nature and to be universal. The postmodernity which has succeeded it has seen the powerful return of the impulse to community and of the need of collective emotion - I call this neo-tribalism (1988). The plural person, identifying with a number of tribes and elective affinities based on common tastes, is rediscovering the importance of territory (roots) and 'compagnonnage' - the passing on of a trade and a craftsman's identity, an initiation rather than an education. It is this nascent postmodernity which I attempt to describe.

T1  - Ethnic conflicts and riots in Italy: The case of Rome, 2014
AN  - 1817459211
AB  - In this article I present an overview of Italian experiences of social unrest and riots, with a focus on the wave of protests and ethnic conflicts that occurred in some areas on the outskirts of Rome during the last months of 2014, when groups of Italian citizens - often led by right-wing politicians and neo-fascist political movements - organized street blocks, set fires in garbage containers, attacked buildings where refugees and asylum seekers were living and chased immigrants in these neighbourhoods. The case explored here, based on the first results of an ethnographic study, is an example of ethnic conflict in which immigrants - and Roma people - are the target of violent actions undertaken by natives, with an important role played by radical right movements in reinforcing the protest and in the decision to engage in rioting. I describe in detail the characteristics and the context of these events, analysing differences from and similarities to past Italian experiences of ethnic conflict and discussing the preliminary results of my work in relation to the main hypotheses discussed in the literature on ethnic conflicts.

T1  - Israel-Palestine: One State or Two: Why a Two-State Solution is Desirable, Necessary, and Feasible
AN  - 1811926271
AB  - The recent collapse of the US-brokered peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians and the eruption of violence between Israel and the Hamas show the enormous difficulties for reaching a two-state solution. Given the background of quite a few earlier failures, which sometimes led to bloody confrontations, the current impasse might lead to despair of the possibility of reaching a partition of the Land of Israel/Palestine between the two peoples. Despite this problematic record, this paper will argue that even though a two-state solution is fraught with numerous problems, it is the only possible peaceful solution that is both desirable and necessary. A key argument that buttresses this assessment is that in extreme nationalist conflicts, a partition, despite its numerous problems, is the most desirable solution or the least undesirable one. Over the years observers have introduced alternative conceptions of the character of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as colonial, civilizational, religious, class, realist and civil/ethnic in nature. As I argue elsewhere none of these alternative conceptions is correct. Rather, I show in this paper that the conflict is a severe case of an ethno-nationalist conflict with numerous manifestations of what I call a 'state-to-nation imbalance.'

T1  - Intersectional Individuality: Georg Simmel's Concept of "The Intersection of Social Circles" and the Emancipation of Women
AN  - 1781681899
AB  - Georg Simmel's "The intersection of social circles," a chapter in his 1908 Sociology, contains discussions of class, religion, ethnic, and gender relations that are highly relevant to contemporary sociological concerns. Simmel's argument is based on a notion of historical dynamic that interprets increasingly complex intersectionality as a sign of progressing civilization. The article establishes how Simmel describes "the intersection of social circles" and then looks at Simmel's account through the concept of "intersectionality" as developed in contemporary feminist theory. The article suggests that although some aspects of Simmel's account of women in modernity are incompatible with contemporary feminism, the shared use of the same image, "intersection," in Simmel and in contemporary feminist theory is the symptom of a shared concern with a particular aspect of the complexity of modern society. In Simmel, the increasing density of the intersections of social circles points to the increasingly complex individuality of modern subjects, whereas the use of the same image in contemporary feminist theory is part of a critique of inequality and oppression in the same modern society whose advent Simmel celebrated. Intersectionality is a characteristic of modern society that first became visible more than a century ago and has meanwhile become ever the more a signature of modernity.

T1  - How crosscutting weak ties are established-the case of Muslims in Europe
AN  - 2076970680
AB  - Building on the work of Granovetter [1973. "The Strength of Weak Ties." American Journal of Sociology 78 (6): 1360-1380.], weak ties are assumed to play a vital role in processes of integration. In this paper, the focus lies on weak ties that cut across ethnic boundaries, connecting Muslim immigrants to members of the ethnic majority in six European host societies. The aim is twofold: a descriptive analysis of the existence of those crosscutting weak ties amongst different groups of Muslim immigrants and an explanatory analysis focusing on the structural factors that make the establishment of such ties more likely. In the latter part, the native populations are also taken into account, allowing for a bidirectional perspective. Using ordinal logistic regression models, we found that emancipatory factors such as education and language skills are positively associated with having weak ties, whereas conservative values and religiosity decrease the likelihood of establishing many weak ties. A diverse neighbourhood appears to play a pivotal role in the formation of weak ties from both a native and an immigrant perspective.

T1  - Introduction: Globalization and Race in World Capitalism
AN  - 1814308325
AB  - Scholars of world-systems and global political economy have wrestled for decades with the genesis of 'race' as a social construct and its historical significance for the system of world capitalism. Transformations in the world capitalist system pose a new challenge to Western theories of race. Older colonial structures may be giving way in the face of capitalist globalization. Racial or ethnic dimensions of the relations of exploitation in the capitalist world-system need to be reconceptualized. This symposium aims to generated debate and interchange among scholars on such a reconceptualization and to contribute to real world struggles against racial inequities.

T1  - Conflict & Community: Twin Tensions in Becoming a Multiethnic Congregation
AN  - 1962749718
AB  - This in-depth case study investigates the religious, ethnic, and social conflicts that exist between two groups co-located in the same congregation. A diocesan cost-based merger brought together two religio-ethnic communities that were formerly housed in separate parishes. One group already had their congregation in the existing building and is mostly composed of aging Polish immigrants. The second group had been in a building across town that was closed and moved, and its congregants are mostly younger, Spanish-speaking, Latino immigrants, predominantly from México. The merger appears to have been unsuccessful, and the two groups remain divided, functioning as two congregations within the same building. Analyses focus on first demonstrating the intense group-to-group conflict and then explaining it through their respective interpretations. The two groups evidence distinct demographic, social class, values, norms, and traditions that inform their group-to-group conflict in shared community. The case illuminates larger issues of religio-ethnic conflict and provides rich data on the perceptions and stereotypes each group has of the other. Findings indicate twin tensions of community, with in-group solidarity experienced more intensely as each group expresses their out-group divisions, conflict, and hostilities. As the Impossible Triangle sculpture visualizes (Bess et al. 2002), this case highlights the ways in which community encloses those within its boundaries while leaving those outside its boundaries confused about socially acceptable norms. Theoretically, the case contributes to understandings of community and conflict generally, as well as the ways cultural and religious historical memories influence present-day interpretations.

T1  - Colonial Lords and Subjects: Uncovering Semicolonialism in Lao Khamhom's 'Dust Underfoot'
AN  - 1875134489
AB  - This paper exposes colonial remnants in modern-day Thailand through a postcolonial materialist analysis of Lao Khamhom's 'Dust Underfoot'. Revolving around the conflict between a minor member of the Bangkok royalty and a Khmu forest worker in northern Thailand, this short story sheds light on Siam's semicolonial conditions created at the turn of the nineteenth century. Though nominally independent, Siam was subject to the capitalist world economy. This was clearly discernible in the British-dominated teak industry in the North. Siam, however, was not so much a victim as a collaborator and beneficiary of colonial capitalism. The Siamese monarchy sustained British capital by recruiting Khmu ethnic subjects into an exploitable labour force for timber production. This collaboration with the British enabled the monarchy to consolidate its economic, political and cultural power over its population. 'Dust Underfoot' underscores Siam's colonial legacies by critiquing the continued exploitation of the Khmu and other lumbermen by the emerging Thai sakdina -turned-bourgeois class in the 1950s. Following in the footsteps of the West, these royal elites viewed themselves as civilized rulers lording it over their 'savage' subjects. This paper also discusses the story as a seditious challenge to the hegemonic Buddhist 'god-king' discourse and translational process that underpins the foundation of the rule of the Thai monarchy.

T1  - What Constitutes Intermarriage for Multiracial People in Britain?
AN  - 1726736296
AB  - Intermarriage is of great interest to analysts because a group's tendency to partner across ethnic boundaries is usually seen as a key indicator of the social distance between groups in a multiethnic society. Theories of intermarriage as a key indicator of integration are, however, typically premised upon the union of white and nonwhite individuals, and we know very little about what happens in the unions of multiracial people, who are the children of intermarried couples. What constitutes intermarriage for multiracial people? Do multiracial individuals think that ethnic or racial ancestries are a defining aspect of their relationships with their partners? In this article, I argue that there are no conventions for how we characterize endogamous or exogamous relationships for multiracial people. I then draw on examples of how multiracial people and their partners in Britain regard their relationships with their partners and the significance of their and their partners' ethnic and racial backgrounds. I argue that partners' specific ancestries do not necessarily predict the ways in which multiracial individuals regard their partners' ethnic and racial backgrounds as constituting difference or commonality within their relationships.

T1  - War, violence, and the military during late socialism and transition. Five case studies on the USSR, Russia, and Yugoslavia
AN  - 2697560431
AB  - The text introduces five case studies on war and the military in the USSR and Yugoslavia in historical perspective. It argues that the armed forces were at the core of socialist statehood and that their role and their change in late socialism and post-Communism are thus far understudied. Discussing the similarities as well as the differences between the Soviet, the Russian, and the Yugoslav case, the introduction seeks new explanations for war and military violence in these countries. Rather than pointing exclusively to ethnic mobilization and nationalism, it views the transformation and collapse of the Communist party-state and its army as a precondition for violence and civil war. It places these cases using innovative methodological approaches to the research on physical violence, war, and military. These studies explore the experience and the representation of violence, army service, combat, and war in late socialism and scrutinize individual actors and their behavior within violent spaces. In retrospect the emerging wars in the post-Soviet space – from Chechnya to the Donbas – and in Yugoslavia are at least as crucial for the region as Gorbachev's reforms. They help to better understand the conflicts of the present.

T1  - Religion and Nationalism: Contradictions of Islamic Origins and Secular Nation-Building in Turkey, Algeria, and Pakistan
AN  - 1705245612
AB  - Objectives 
Turkey, Algeria, and Pakistan have been persistently challenged, since their founding, by both Islamist and ethnic separatist movements. These challenges claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people in each country. I investigate the causes behind the concurrence of Islamist and ethnic separatist challenges to the state in Turkey, Algeria, and Pakistan. 
Method 
This research employs comparative historical analysis, and more specifically, a most different systems design. In addition to small-N cross-national comparison, I also designed an intertemporal comparison, whereby Turkish, Algerian, and Pakistani history is divided into four periods, corresponding to preindependence, mobilization for independence, postindependence secular nation-building, and Islamist and ethnic separatist challenge periods. 
Results 
Contrary to the prevailing view in the scholarship, this article formulates an alternative reinterpretation of Turkish, Algerian, and Pakistani nation-state formation. These three states were founded on the basis of an Islamic mobilization against non-Muslim opponents, but having successfully defeated these non-Muslim opponents, their political elites chose a secular and monolingual nation-state model, which they thought would maximize their national security and improve the socioeconomic status of their Muslim constituencies. The choice of a secular and monolingual nation-state model led to recurrent challenges of increasing magnitude to the state in the form of Islamist and ethnic separatist movements. The causal mechanism outlined in this article resembles what has been metaphorically described as a "meteorite" (Pierson, ), where the cause is short term (secular nationalist turn after independence) but the outcome unfolds over the long term (Islamist and ethnic separatist challenges). 
Conclusion 
A distinct and counterintuitive path of nation-state formation has been identified based on the cases of Turkey, Algeria, and Pakistan. This research demonstrates that a contradiction between the goals of the original mobilization that establishes the state and policies of its postindependence governments can be a major structural source of instability and violence in the long run. These findings suggest that theories of nationalism that were developed based on the European experience of ethnic or linguistic nationalism need to be modified in explaining the religious nationalism that is found in the origins of some of the major nation-states in the Muslim world.

T1  - Ethnic Boundaries in Contemporary Rwanda: Fixity, Flexibility and Their Limits
AN  - 1690736798
AB  - What was clear during my fieldwork-and in the findings of numerous other scholars working in Rwanda today-is that these Tutsi and Hutu stereotypes are alive and well. Even though the RPF has outlawed ethnic labels, people continue to use ethnic categories as interpretive frameworks. Rwandans are well versed in the cultural stereotypes of Tutsi having a fondness for wealth and cattle, and they categorize people who are high status as Tutsi (Fqjii 2009:114). Susanne BuckleyZistel (2006:141) similarly reports that wealthy people are still occasionally referred to as Tutsi regardless of their ethnic descent categories and that the expression, "I am not your Hutu," is deployed if the speaker perceives that someone is trying to exploit her. Further, Lyndsay McLean Hilker (2009:89) found that urban youth in Kigali use Tutsi and Hutu stereotypes as reference points for describing or explaining others' behaviour. I occasionally heard [Butare] residents express concern that contemporary post-genocide politics reinforce old ethnic stereotypes. An elderly Tutsi survivor, who was critical of the gacaca courts, once remarked to me that the trouble with them is not only that the civilian judges are poorly trained but also that their conduct reinforces the stereotype of the "tricky Tutsi," even as not all judges are Tutsi by heritage. "It's cruel, truly," he said. "These poor peasants are invited to come testify to what they know and they end up getting sentenced even when they aren't the ones on trial. This does nothing to solve our problems" (June 2008, Butare). Finally, as a Hutu Catholic priest explained about the politics of his work, "You must be careful about people thinking you favour your own ethnicity. Sometimes it's hard for people to know what you are, though! For example, if you're Hutu but you show cleverness or become powerful, people will say you must have been influenced by Tutsi because you are more Tutsi than Hutu" (February 2009, Butare).              What is compelling about these social situations is that in neither case was [Charles]' Hutu heritage enough to definitively offset the social dangers of "Tutsi" wealth and education. In social-relational, situational terms, Charles' position in the patronage relationship with his neighbour "overrode" his Hutu descent category and lent him the stereotypical capacities of Tutsiness. In patron-client exchange in Rwanda, the patron role is tied to Tutsi stereotypes and the client role to Hutu ones, an opposition that hardened, in no small part, owing to colonial era ethnography in Rwanda (e.g., [Jacques Maquet] 1961). However, Charles attempted, in another act of moral agency bound up with stereotypically Hutu valuations of equality, to downplay the ethnically marked hierarchy between them by temporarily emphasizing the friendly dimensions of his neighbour's visit over the transactional ones. She participated in this act through her willingness to engage in friendly chatter with Charles to show that she saw him not as a mere economic resource but as a neighbour or friend. Whether Charles' performances are received as intended, however, is another matter. On the one hand, his clients may spread his reputation for generosity and bolster his "Hutu" concern for redistribution, access to education and equal sharing of the benefits of modernity, a positive outcome with its own double edge since this increases the number of supplicants who arrive on his doorstep. Indeed, I heard town residents characterize Charles as someone who has sympathy for the poor because he was not bom into urban privilege. On the other hand, Charles' patron role and his effort to downplay it potentially increase his vulnerability to the social dangers of "Tutsi" wealth and privilege. He is open to the accusation that, like a "Tutsi," he wants to trick clients into servitude with overtures of friendliness, a possibility that is captured in comments I routinely heard from Butare residents of all income levels about how the wealthy will give only if they think they can get something in return. Hence, shared Hutu heritage between Charles and his neighbour is not enough to level the hierarchy of patron-client exchange, and it must be performed in ways that can either succeed or fail.

T1  - Social and Political Participation of Indian Diaspora in the UK
AN  - 1977660612
AB  - The diaspora communities are quite unique and play a significant role in establishing connections between cultures in the contemporary world. Diaspora, on one hand, is an asset, and on the other, it can be a potential source of conflict in the host society. Diaspora is an asset, in terms of their economic, social and cultural contribution it makes to both the country of origin and destination. On the other hand, because of their different cultural, religious, linguistic and regional affiliation, they can also, at times, be a source of friction with the natives and mainstream culture of the host country. There have been instance of their perfect integration with the host society at one end of the continuum, and their ethnic distinctiveness/differences and un-assimilability becomes a factor for divisions between 'us' and 'them'. Interestingly, diaspora communities also exhibit a unique blend of culture and way of life of their home and host country. Drawing from this framework, this article focuses upon the social and political participation of Indian diaspora in the UK. The article begins by understanding the patterns or phases of international migration to the UK from South Asia, in general, and India, in particular. The 'Indian Diaspora: Historical Overview' section discusses the social aspects and political participation of Indian diaspora in the UK. The article provides an overview of the history, trajectory, social and political participation of Indian migrants in the UK and underlines the issues and challenges faced by Indian diaspora using secondary data, statistics and sources based on primary academic research. The nature and extent of social and political participation of any community is an indicator of their degree of influence in and integration with the host society. This article establishes that Indian diaspora has assimilated itself well with the British society along with retaining its cultural distinctiveness.

T1  - Memory and identity: intergenerational narratives of violence among refugees in Serbia
AN  - 2698629126
AB  - This article examines the role of the intergenerational memory of the Second World War (WWII) in identity formation and political mobilization. An existing explanation in the ethnic-conflict literature is that strategic political leaders play a crucial role in constructing and mobilizing ethnic identities. However, based on 114 open-ended interviews with individuals born in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia, conducted in Serbia during 2008–2011, nearly a third of the respondents make spontaneous references to WWII in their statements, usually drawing parallels between the cycle of violence in the 1990s and that in the 1940s. The question this article asks, then, is why some respondents make references to WWII spontaneously while others do not. It is argued that intergenerational narratives of past cycles of violence also constitute a process of identity formation, in addition to, or apart from, other processes of identity formation. The respondents mention WWII violence in the context of the 1990s events because they “recognize” elements, such as symbols, discourse or patterns of violence, similar to those in the intergenerational narratives and interpret them as warning signs. Hence, individuals who had previously been exposed to intergenerational narratives may be subsequently more susceptible to political mobilization efforts.

T1  - Contesting exclusion in a multi-ethnic state: rethinking ethnic nationalism in Nigeria
AN  - 1512219005; 201408935
AB  - On the surface, ideas of a Nigerian state with common citizenry, free from ethnicity, religious bigotry and regionalism were pursued by Nigerian nationalists. Generally, a state united in common political practices, equal opportunities and under the same law was envisaged. However, the process leading to independence was characterised by ethnic nationalism. In the decolonisation era, group interest was reified and elevated above national struggle for self-government. The post-colonial project of constructing a common citizenry with the same aspirations, one Nigerian identity with a cosmopolitan outlook instead of ethnic loyalty, therefore largely eluded the country. Over the last five decades, the deepest attachment has increasingly been that of ethnic and regional consciousness. Ethnic nationalism has increasingly won support in an atmosphere of greed and clientelism. Several complex crises are currently manifesting themselves in ethnic forms. The situation has been exacerbated by political and economic exclusion, which has awakened forces and organisations that fight for ethnic and regional aspirations. This paper deals with the issue of group identification during the colonial period, especially from 1945. It also explores the extent to which the pattern of nationalist struggle defined the crucial issues of ethnic crises in post-colonial Nigeria. Finally, it examines the dimensions of the contest for citizenship. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Examining Bonding and Bridging Activities in the Context of a Common Spaces Approach to Integration
AN  - 1467355789
AB  - The remaining dependent variable, Canadian identity, was derived from multiple survey response variables. Canadian identity is intended to measure whether or not the respondent has a strong tie to Canada. The measure of Canadian identity in the EDS is not exclusive, with the survey allowing for a possible six ethnic identities to be reported (eid_l - eid_6). Those reporting "Canadian," "French-Canadian," "Newfoundlander," "Acadian," "Aboriginal," "North-American Indian" and "Other regional or provincial group" were all included as Canadian identities. A measure of the strength of the participant's sense of Canadian identity (IDQ1301 - IDQ1306) was derived from two sets of variables-one set comprised of the ethnic identities reported and the other of the corresponding strength of those ethnic identities measured by a 5-point Likert-type scale. The variable was converted to a binary variable, which was coded true if the strength of the reported Canadian identity was either four or five on the 5-point Likert-type scale. This resulted in the final variable being coded as: (1) strong Canadian ethnic identity for respondents who had a response of four or five on the strength of ethnic identity measure, or (2) not a strong Canadian ethnic identity for respondents who had a response of one through three on the strength of ethnic identity measure, as well as respondents who did not report a Canadian ethnic identity at all as one of their possible ethnic identities.              Across all immigrant and non-immigrant groups, respondents involved in one or more bonding activities were more likely to report a sense of belonging to one's ethnic group, when compared to respondents who reported no bonding activities, while respondents involved in one or more bridging activities were less likely to report a sense of ethnic group belonging, when compared to respondents that reported no bridging activities, in most instances. While the former result is consistent with Putnam's ( 1993, 2000) conceptualization of bonding social capital as activities associated with efforts to establish or maintain exclusive social ties with one's ethnic community, the effects of bridging activities require further examination. Although some researchers express a concern that if minority ethnic groups bond too much within their communities, they are less likely to integrate into wider society (e.g., Goodhart 2004; [Uslaner] and Conley 2003), our conceptualization of integration based on [Ager] and Strang's (2004) model does not see bonding and bridging activities as having necessarily contradictory effects on ethnic sense of belonging. However, the results indicate that efforts to establish inter-ethnic relationships may arise from, or result in, an attenuated sense of ethnic belonging, possibly due to the time required to initiate and maintain inter-ethnic relationships ([Cheong, Pauline Hope] et al. 2007), or possibly due to a natural inclination to incorporate diverse ethnic or cultural elements, and less ethnically-specific elements, within an evolving sense of self. Additionally, while the effect of bridging activities on ethnic group belonging was evident across all immigrant groups, and for the specific immigrant groups examined, the effect was also evident for specific visible non-immigrant groups, and all other visible non-immigrant groups, but not for non-visible non-immigrants. In this case it appears that visible minority status may be a factor and that non-visible, non-immigrant respondents in particular may experience less conflict from or less incongruence between their own sense of ethnic belonging and their experience in the wider social realm. These results speak to the complexities of the integration process related to the context of immigrants' reception experiences. As Cheong et al. (2007) point out, "[T]he politics and practices of racism and discrimination are often underplayed in initiatives promoting bonding and bridging social capital" (33).

T1  - Natural Experiments of History
AN  - 1326735646
AB  - Readers familiar with the work of scholars such as Patrick Kirch (on the Pacific Islands), Daron Acemoglu and his co-authors (on the economic impact of the French Revolution), Nathan Nunn (on the long-term effects of the African slave trades), and Abhijit Banerjee and Lakshmi Iyer (on colonial land tenure in British India) will find that this book replicates a number of chapters and journal articles previously published by those authors, and for that reason it might not be a priority purchase.

In his view the applied method leads to a "compression of history".2By lumping together slave export data over a period of five centuries, Nunn equalizes the hypothesized impact on late twentieth-century income levels of a slave exported in the fifteenth century to one exported in the nineteenth century.

[...]by linking historical slave export intensity to present-day GDP estimates, he ignores a number of centuries without considering the possibility of changes in the proposed long-term effects.

Nunn has suggested that the slave trade promoted ethnic fractionalization, leading to higher levels of distrust, social conflict, and political instability in the post-slave-trade era, a hypothesis he went on to elaborate in a study with Leonard Wantchekon.3However, even if we take this claim for granted, one has to realize that the "ethnic fractionalization" of present-day African countries (note that the units of analysis are anachronistically defined because present-day African countries did not exist two centuries ago) has been caused primarily by the colonial borders designed on the European drawing board in the late nineteenth century.

Only since 1980, a period that followed the collapse of many African economies in the mid-1970s, does the effect approach its estimated magnitude in 2000 and become statistically significant.4The results of these regression analyses do not refute Nunn's argument that the slave trades are important in understanding current African poverty, but they do suggest that we are missing an important layer of complexity.

T1  - 'The Land of the Golden Fleece': Conflict and Heritage in Abkhazia
AN  - 1551001745; 201429606
AB  - Tourism was a big industry for imperial as well as Soviet Abkhazia. Famous writers like Chekhov and political figures like Stalin himself, spent the summer in the sub-tropical climate of Abkhazia taking advantage of its 'pristine' beauty. Could we find traces of this colonial tradition in the numbers of Russians who visit the place today? How are the notions of the 'natural' and the 'unspoiled' combined with the post-conflict Abkhazian landscape? Would tourism itself be a cause of instability and another conflict responding to the rising numbers of these tourists? At the same time, as Abkhazia is home to various ethnic groups, how do the latter make use of local history and heritage? To what degree would the past and its multiple layers, such as the Greek past of Sukhumi, be a platform for new social solitaries and cohesion or a source of friction?

T1  - Making contact. Generating interethnic contact for multicultural integration and tolerance in Amsterdam
AN  - 1322718506; 201312378
AB  - Interethnic contact is considered a potent tool for the generation of interethnic understanding and tolerance. This faith has engendered countless social projects that seek to stimulate contact between members of different ethnic groups under 'optimal conditions'. However, the academic literature does not stipulate how, if at all, these optimal conditions can be realized in real world interventions. This article investigates how the organizers of a number of Dutch projects for 'contact under optimal conditions' conceived of such contact and how these conceptualisations informed how projects were set up, executed and experienced. The analysis demonstrates that organizers conceived of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' as a natural autonomous process. Optimal conditions for this natural process were assumed to be guaranteed when project workers interfered as little as possible with the contact between participants. The 'natural' processes thus engendered were assumed to lead to the recognition of fundamental sameness between two ethnic groups and/or the recognition of the superficiality of their differences. In practice, however, projects were set up in ways that privileged the exchange of uncontroversial information on personal tastes and ethnic differences. Moreover, the emphasis on the dual recognition of fundamental sameness and superficial difference produced a discursive context in which the exploration of conflicts of interest was foreclosed. These results suggest that the notion of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' may in practice have connotations that lead to practices that reinforce, rather than challenge, existing prejudices and misunderstandings.

T1  - Nagorno-Karabakh in Regional and World Politics: A Case Study for Nationalism, Realism and Ethnic Conflict
AN  - 1030942301
AB  - The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict constitutes a perfect case study for empirical and theoretical studies in international relations dealing with the issue of nationalism and ethnic conflict as well as with realism and constructivism. The fact that the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is recognized by the international community as part of Azerbaijan did not change the reality that the region was captured by local Armenian forces with the help of Armenia proper and Russia. This state of affairs seemed like a vindication of realist school of thought in international relations theory with its age old dictum "might makes right". As far as the end result of the conflict is concerned, this is a correct analysis. However, when one takes the state identities and policies of Armenia and Azerbaijan, we need to recognize ideational factors such as national honor, and dignity which make any compromise on Karabakh highly costly regarding each government's relations with its constituents. This paper will demonstrate that constructivist variables are essential in explicating the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in addition to the realist factors currently at play, particularly since conquest of the region does not significantly add to a country's resources and power.

T1  - Conflict and the conceptions of identities in the Sudan
AN  - 1023030964; 201225044
AB  - My native Sudan has been ravaged by conflicts over identity and socioeconomic marginalization since independence from Britain in 1956. Elitist debates confined the country's diverse identities to two dichotomous categorizations: Arabism, associated with Islam and Arabic descent and culture, and Africanism, linked to Christianity, indigenous beliefs and African culture. These polarized views, along with the dominant ideology of the imposition of Arabism and Islam as the basis of national identification, triggered a national identity crisis. This crisis contributed to the escalation of armed conflicts notably the civil war between the North and the South and the current conflict in the Sudan's Western province of Darfur. This article explores the Darfur conflict which erupted between the central government and liberation groups in 2003, and has been described both as the first genocide of the 21st century and an ethnic cleansing in which the Arab militia are killing the Africans. Using data gathered recently in the Sudan, this article extends the debates on Sudanese identities by showing that the boundaries between Africanism and Arabism are fluid, and by positing multiple identities that resurface as a result of globalization, migration and social ties among ethnic groups. By deconstructing the dominant conceptions of the Sudanese identities, and considering new conceptions about these identities, we can address social dynamics that impact the conflict and take them into consideration when it comes to conflict resolution. Multiculturalism is proposed as a model that could help to accommodate the country's diverse identities and foster stability. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - HIV and tuberculosis: The construction and management of double stigma
AN  - 1023026164; 201226286
AB  - Mitigation of the tuberculosis (TB) and HIV syndemic is undermined by critical clinical, operational and social challenges of which the social aspects have been least explored. This paper examines the lived experience of TB disease and HIV from the perspective of affected individuals to analyze how they may think about their dual illness; how they understand their illness with TB in relation to HIV, and vice versa; and how they characterize their (stigmatized) experiences in the context of their perceptions and identities. From February-August 2009, qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 adults with HIV and TB disease at three ambulatory clinics in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Subjective meanings of illness experience were analyzed using modified grounded-theory. Emergent themes on illness perception and disclosure revealed how patients constructed dichotomous identities associated with TB and HIV through social constructs of moral susceptibility and (im)permanence. Each identity was associated with relatively disparate degrees of stigma as a product of labeling, negative stereotyping and discrimination. HIV bore the least desirable identity and invoked the greatest stigma. However, the confluence of the two epidemics rendered TB symbolic and symptomatic of HIV, and enhanced the visibility of AIDS. Dual illness thus introduced a paradox to patients' identity constructions, and produced a unique, overlapping double stigma. This facilitated new forms of stigma against TB, and aggravated existing stigma against HIV. It also conferred visibility to some forms of extra-pulmonary TB. Patients managed their double stigmas through novel forms of information sharing that relied on segregating their dual illness identities. Patients deflected the dominant stigma of HIV through concurrent processes of HIV 'othering' -- their symbolic distancing from persons affected by HIV, and 'covering' -- their selective disclosure of illness (and identity associated) with TB over that of HIV. Findings call for greater consideration to the complex role of stigma in the delivery of TB/HIV healthcare. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Nagorno-Karabakh in Regional and World Politics: A Case Study for Nationalism, Realism and Ethnic Conflict
AN  - 1283641578; 201304902
AB  - The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict constitutes a perfect case study for empirical and theoretical studies in international relations dealing with the issue of nationalism and ethnic conflict as well as with realism and constructivism. The fact that the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is recognized by the international community as part of Azerbaijan did not change the reality that the region was captured by local Armenian forces with the help of Armenia proper and Russia. This state of affairs seemed like a vindication of realist school of thought in international relations theory with its age old dictum 'might makes right'. As far as the end result of the conflict is concerned, this is a correct analysis. However, when one takes the state identities and policies of Armenia and Azerbaijan, we need to recognize ideational factors such as national honor, and dignity which make any compromise on Karabakh highly costly regarding each government's relations with its constituents. This paper will demonstrate that constructivist variables are essential in explicating the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in addition to the realist factors currently at play, particularly since conquest of the region does not significantly add to a country's resources and power.

T1  - "My Life was Filled with Constant Anxiety": Anti-Immigrant Discrimination, Undocumented Status, and Their Mental Health Implications for Brazilian Immigrants
AN  - 894174172
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Race and Mental Health              Immigration reform and the various costs associated with undocumented immigration have been in national headlines in the past few years. The growth of Latinos as the US' largest ethno-racial minority has sparked debates about the "browning" of the United States and led to an increase in anti-immigrant discrimination. While some researchers have documented the effects of racial discrimination on the mental health of ethno-racial minorities in the United States, less has explored how anti-immigrant discrimination and undocumented status influence the mental and psychological well-being of Latino immigrants, more specifically Brazilian immigrants, in the United States. Relying on data from in-depth interviews conducted with 49 Brazilian return migrants who immigrated to the United States and subsequently returned to Brazil, this paper will examine how their experiences living as racialized and primarily undocumented immigrants in the United States influenced their mental health. Specifically, I demonstrate that respondents experienced ethno-racial and anti-immigrant discrimination and endured various challenges that had negative implications for their mental health. This paper will also discuss additional factors that researchers should take into account when examining immigrants' mental health and the challenges immigrants encounter in a racialized society with increasing anti-immigrant sentiment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - PERCEPTIONS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AMONG BLACK PROFESSIONALS IN RIO DE JANEIRO
AN  - 878044571
AB  - Most Brazilians believe that racial and socioeconomic inequalities tend to overlap-in other words, blacks are poorer because they have less education and worse jobs. In the past few years, however, several quantitative studies have presented an interesting puzzle: racial inequalities are strongest among those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy. This article explores the "elitist profile" of racial discrimination through eighty in-depth interviews with black professionals in Rio de Janeiro. The results show that interviewees describe their trajectories of social mobility through mechanisms that involve both socioeconomic and racial exclusion. Their perceptions of injustice, however, are more directly related to experiences of racial discrimination. In narrating incidents of discrimination, interviewees stress the distinction and tensions between what we call generalized prejudice and particularized universalism. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - "Conflict defines origins": Identity transformations of Sudanese refugees in Cairo
AN  - 887499220; 201118234
AB  - This study explores the effects of conflict on the identities of Sudanese refugees back in Sudan and then in Cairo, namely the experience of ambiguous, ambivalent, and conflicting identities. The conflict in Sudan caused multiple ruptures to the refugees' previously established identities. In Egypt, they come into contact and conflict with the host community, organizations, and fellow Sudanese from different regions or ethnic backgrounds, which creates tensions in religious, tribal, or ethnic identities. Such identity issues were manifested in extreme form during the tragic 2005 Sudanese refugee sit-in. The conclusion sheds light on implications for conflict resolution.

T1  - Autochthony, Rumor Dynamics, And Communal Violence In Western Uganda
AN  - 1081862626; 201237784
AB  - Across Africa, conflicts over land rights are increasingly centered on notions of autochthony. This article analyzes a violent event that took place in 2003 in connection with ethnically biased land redistribution in Western Uganda. Through the concepts of autochthony and communal violence, it analyzes the wider political context, tracing the processes from ethnic conflict to communal violence between autochthonous Banyoro and immigrant Bafuruki ethnic groups. Foregrounding the role of rumors in communal violence, it argues that rumors are not simply a response to conflict. Rather, they are constitutive of the situation, particularly in the formation of common moral imagination and in shaping the direction of social processes between the conflicting parties.

T1  - The Role of Economic Aspiration in Elections in Kenya
AN  - 1037881751; 201232373
AB  - The violence that erupted, following the 30 December 2007 civic, parliamentary and presidential elections in Kenya is analysed as part of various historical continua anchored on social engineering by colonial officials who sought to control social change after the Mau Mau conflict. Presidents Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi built on this colonial strategy for managing challenges by socialist and pro-democracy forces to their hold on power. Moi's regime had to combat challenges to his electoral fortunes from 1988 onwards and left behind a technology that was a useful investment for 2007/2008 opposition groups. Both forms of social engineering gave prominence to tribalism as an organising tool. The power behind the success of these exercises was economic anxieties rooted in land, widespread unemployment and elite struggles for control of political influence. This perspective allows us to propose that stability in Kenya in the post-conflict period requires a bold counter-social engineering that breaks down efforts to continue the use of tribalism to prevent re-distribution of large landed estates in several parts of the country, particularly Coast and Central Provinces.

T1  - Impressing for Success: A Gendered Analysis of a Key Social Capital Accumulation Strategy
AN  - 758123994; 201057570
AB  - Social capital theory assesses the career benefits that accrue to individuals from the stock of relationships they have. Such benefits can be in the form of guidance and advice, access to key projects and assignments and help with setting up business deals. However, when assessing whether such career-enhancing resources are available equally to men and women, we find that gender impacts on the access to and accumulation of social capital. The article seeks to address two key research questions. The first is whether women are aware of the need to accumulate social capital to advance their careers and the second is whether they use impression management techniques in order to assist them in doing this. Findings are reported from a study in an international consulting firm with 19 female consultants. In respect of research question one the findings indicate that women in the sample are aware of the need to accumulate social capital to advance their careers; with particular emphasis being placed on the importance of gaining access to influential sponsors. In respect of research question two, the findings confirm that women in the sample do perceive the necessity to utilise impression management techniques to help them to accumulate social capital. This is done in a defensive way and is linked to ensuring that one is seen as ambitious, likable and available. It is argued that these are key organizational norms, and it is perceived that in order to accumulate social capital, women need to actively work to dispel the negative stereotypes that attach to them because of their gender. The article calls for greater recognition of the impact that masculine organizational cultures have on the career development of women, who not only have to perform at a high level but are also required to expend additional energy conforming to masculine organizational cultures they have had little say in creating.
