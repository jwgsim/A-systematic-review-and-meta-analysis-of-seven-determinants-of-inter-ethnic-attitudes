T1  - Why does segregation prevent conflict in some regions but not others? Interrogating social distance amid ethnic conflicts in Jos, Nigeria
AN  - 2697225744
AB  - This paper revisits the longstanding question of why segregation douses ethnic tensions in some places but exacerbates them in others. Anchored on the concept of social distance and drawing on empirical evidence from Jos, Nigeria’s hotbed of ethnoterritorial conflict, this article provides a nuanced analysis of why segregation mediates both the emergence and the prevention of ethnic conflict. In the examined case study, the role of social distance in conflict mitigation varies according to neighbourhood type. Animosity was already deep-seated across the region when social distancing – the effect of partition and segregation – was cemented following the outbreak of conflict in some communities in 2001. Yet the conflict spread to some ethnically unmixed neighbourhoods but not others. In conflict-affected areas, social distance did not avert future conflicts compared to neighbourhoods where the initial conflict was avoided. However, past conflict is not a predictor of future outbreaks in socially distanced neighbourhoods given that in the areas that avoided future conflicts, social distance occurred simultaneously with extensive informal bi-communal leadership engagements. Therefore, the paper shows that even imperfect unmixing can dampen violence when combined with observable leadership engagement.

T1  - Conceptualising eco-violence: moving beyond the multiple labelling of water and agricultural resource conflicts in the Sahel
AN  - 2697225560
AB  - The conflict over water and agricultural resources within the Sahel of Africa has led to the destruction of lives, property and nature for decades. The extant practice is to label these conflicts with multiple names and conceptualise them as single-issue events. This article illustrates this practice further and highlights some issues associated with such approaches. Existing terms for these conflicts in Africa’s Sahel region are primarily linked to people’s occupations and ethnic identities, distracting efforts to gain a deeper understanding. This view obscures the broad dimensions of these struggles among those competing for water and agricultural resources. Thus, this paper remedies the conceptual gaps by recommending ‘eco-violence’ as an umbrella term for these conflicts and foregrounding the emerging trends of eco-violence within the Sahel region. By referring to these conflicts as eco-violence, we can foster a more inclusive perspective that incorporates social and environmental injustices and political failures as factors related to these conflicts.

T1  - Stories of conflict: Ethnicity, social class, and difference in transnational divorce narratives
AN  - 2687644815
AB  - Based on a study of transnational divorce in Dutch–Moroccan and Dutch–Egyptian families, this paper will analyse the role of ethnicity, social class and difference in transnational divorce narratives. It will show how public narratives on marriage migration, fraudulent marriages and cultural difference influence the stories people tell about their marriage and subsequent divorce and how they make sense of their experiences. These public narratives are not limited to a national context but move across borders, circulating in transnational social fields. By studying at both intra‐ethnic and inter‐ethnic relationships, this paper also aims to further complicate notions of ethnicity in transnational relationships. By studying these two categories of transnational marriage together, it becomes clear how ethnicity intersects with other social inequalities such as social class as well as how differences ascribed to regional origin can produce ethnic differences even within inter‐ethnic marriages.

T1  - Pastoralists and Violent Conflict along the Oromia–Somali Border in Eastern Ethiopia: Institutional Options toward Peacebuilding
AN  - 2685279937
AB  - Four theories are used to explain the causes and dynamics of violent conflict along the Oromia–Somali Border in eastern Ethiopia. Of these, political economy (greed versus grievance) and political ecology theories are instrumental in understanding the main drivers of violence. Politicization of ethnicity and the self-centered behavior of political elites have increased the complexity of the conflict. Fekadu Kenee demonstrates that peacebuilding efforts require respect for the outcomes of referendums on the disputed territorial units and revitalization of customary systems, among others. While customary institutions can resolve conflicts at least temporarily, sustained community dialogue needs to be part of the political reform to build lasting inter-regional peace.

T1  - Intermarriage-born Millennials in the Whirlwind of the 1990s Yugoslav Wars: Treatises and Documents : Journal of Ethnic Studies
TT  - Otroci mešanih zakonov sredi vojne vihre na območju Jugoslavije v devetdesetih letih prejšnjega stoletja
AN  - 2684213334
AB  - The goal of this paper is to investigate the role of family choices regarding the language of education in self-representations in the adult life of millennials, who grew up during the 1990s Yugoslav wars in Vojvodina. Although the armed conflicts of the 1990s Yugoslav wars avoided Vojvodina, the war had a profound effect on the region. For intermarriage-born millennials, one of the milestone events in their lives is their parents' choice of language of instruction when enrolling them in elementary school. The paper is based on an in-depth analysis of interviews conducted with millennials born in Serb-Hungarian intermarriage. The findings show the influence the choice of language of school instruction has on the millennials' identity and sense of belonging. Those who attended minority language tuition endured more ethnicity-based, nationalism-fuelled incidents during their schooling. This topic is important, since the experiences of intermarriage-born millennials in Vojvodina had previously been neglected because of the focus on Serb-Croatian-Bosnian relationships in conflict literature.Alternate abstract:Prispevek proučuje vpliv izbire učnega jezika na samoopredelitev v odrasli dobi v primeru otrok, ki so odraščali v Vojvodini v času jugoslovanskih vojn v devetdesetih letih prejšnjega stoletja. Čeprav so neposredni oboroženi spopadi Vojvodino obšli, je vojna tudi to regijo močno zaznamovala. Za otroke, rojene v mešanih zakonih, je ena od življenjskih prelomnic tudi izbira učnega jezika ob vpisu v osnovno šolo. Članek temelji na poglobljeni analizi intervjujev, opravljenih z otroki, rojenimi v mešanih srbsko-madžarskih zakonih. Ugotovitve kažejo pomemben vpliv izbire učnega jezika v šoli na njihovo identiteto in občutek pripadnosti. Tisti, ki so obiskovali pouk v manjšinskem jeziku, so med šolanjem doživeli več incidentov, povezanih z etnično pripadnostjo in nacionalizmom. Tematika je vsekakor zanimiva, saj izkušnje vojvodinskih otrok iz mešanih zakonov doslej niso bile deležne večje pozornosti v strokovni literaturi, ki se je osredotočala predvsem na srbsko-hrvaškobosanske odnose.

T1  - Constructing ‘others’ and a wider ‘we’ as emotional processes: A case of South Korea in times of crisis
AN  - 2682181970
AB  - This article examines how growing fears, insecurities and uncertainties during the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted an emotional distance from others. The aim is to explore how global solidarity and nationalism are challenged and constructed as collective emotional processes concerning ‘others’. Drawing on social theories of emotions during crises and emotions towards others, this study looks at policy decisions around vaccines and health services and their associated emotions in the context of Korea, which has a relatively small migrant population and a short history of supporting people in lower-income countries. The study finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has strengthened nationalism, both ethnic nationalism and cosmopolitan nationalism. This points to the need to highlight global norms such as human rights and justice and cultivate foundational emotions such as empathy and compassion. This article suggests paying attention to the role of emotions in generating othering practices and developing global solidarity.

T1  - You are always one of us: The role of implicit theories of ethnicity in host country nationals’ view of co‐ethnic expatriates
AN  - 2658474597
AB  - Ethnic similarity often generates positive interactions between host‐country nationals (HCNs) and co‐ethnic expatriates in multinational corporations (MNCs), but the potential causes of conflict between these groups are under‐studied. In two studies, we tested whether Chinese HCNs’ attitudes towards expatriates are associated with the implicit theories of ethnicity held by HCNs—essentialism (i.e., believing ethnicity has an immutable essence) versus constructivism (i.e., believing ethnicity to be malleable/socially constructed)—as well as expatriates’ ethnicity, which we operationalised as Chinese (co‐ethnic) versus Scottish (other‐ethnic), and expatriates’ cultural upbringing, operationalised as Chinese (local) versus American (foreign). In Study 1, HCNs who endorsed an essentialist perspective of ethnicity expected co‐ethnic (vs. other‐ethnic) expatriates to demonstrate greater ingroup identification and favouritism towards them irrespective of the expatriates’ cultural upbringing. In Study 2, HCNs primed with the essentialist view expected co‐ethnic (vs. other‐ethnic) expatriates to demonstrate greater ingroup identification and favouritism towards them irrespective of the expatriates’ upbringing, whereas those primed with the constructivist view expected expatriates with local (vs. foreign) upbringing to demonstrate greater ingroup identification and favouritism towards them irrespective of their ethnicity. These findings advance international management literature by providing a nuanced understanding of the interactions between HCNs and co‐ethnic expatriates that are influenced by essentialist beliefs about ethnicity.

T1  - Factors Related to Immigrant/Nonimmigrant Children’s Experience of Being Bullied: An Analysis Using the Multiple Disadvantage Model
AN  - 2640566216
AB  - Applying the multiple disadvantage model, a study of children in the United States examined experiences of being bullied in terms of 5 factors: social disorganization, social structural factors, social relationships, mental health and access to care, and acculturation. The study was a secondary data analysis of 19,882 immigrant and non-immigrant children, using data from the 2018 National Survey of Children’s Health. Logistic regression results show children’s likelihood of being bullied to be associated positively with racial discrimination; child mental health problem (either attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, behavioral/conduct problem, or Tourette Syndrome); family substance use; being female; being age 6–10; being age 11–13; and parent education level. Likelihood of being bullied was associated negatively with safe neighborhood; being Black; being Asian; family cohesiveness; neighbor support; parent mental health; being a first- or second-generation immigrant; and parent age. The results imply the usefulness of interventions promoting racial harmony and family support.

T1  - Awareness, social cognition, and commitment: Developing a social justice orientation in psychology training programs
AN  - 2645537552
AB  - This study investigates how the awareness of social inequities and racism may serve as a foundation for psychology trainees' social justice self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations, interests, and commitment. Using the social-cognitive justice developmental framework proposed by Miller et al. (2009), a total of 222 participants were recruited from accredited applied psychology programs across the United States. Participants completed measures assessing their levels of two dimensions of critical consciousness: Egalitarianism and awareness of inequality (Diemer et al., 2017). their colorblind racial attitudes (Neville et al., 2000), and their social justice self-efficacy, outcome expectations, interests, and commitment (Miller et al., 2009). A hypothesized path model was fit to the data. Alternative models were also considered. Results indicated that participants who endorsed egalitarianism and were more aware of social inequities showed greater awareness of racism and, in turn, were more likely to endorse a higher orientation and commitment to social justice. Limitations and implications for future research and training are discussed.

T1  - Plurality resistance: Effects on intergroup relations and the mediating role of stereotypes
AN  - 2695091142
AB  - We currently seem to witness an increase of right-wing populism, anti-immigration sentiments, and a general hostility towards 'others' in increasingly diverse and complex societies. Based on literature in social, political and psychological sciences, we hypothesize that plurality resistance predicts negative intergroup relations by increasing stereotypes. Using data of a recent, large-scale, and representative survey (N = 2304; 55% females; MAge = 55,19 years), we examined, across different models, whether plurality resistance is associated with anti-Muslim attitudes, mediated via general and gendered Muslim stereotypes. Structural equation models provided evidence for the hypothesized main effect, which was partly mediated by stereotypes, while multigroup mediational models confirmed the robustness of the present findings. Results highlight the usefulness of plurality resistance that contributes to the explanation of negative intergroup relations as well as the important role of stereotypes as cognitive short-cuts for diversity-overwhelmed individuals in order to simplify and, thus, deal with the complexities of contemporary societies.

T1  - “Fraternal” Other: Negotiating Ethnic and Religious Identities at a Muslim Sacred Site in Northern Cyprus
AN  - 2634502246
AB  - This article shows how everyday religious practices inform the processes of social identification, complicate presumed ethno-religious categories, and mediate local cultural differences in face of political and cultural hegemonic practices. In the context of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a de facto state recognized only by Turkey, Turkish Cypriots and Turks are considered to share an ethnicity and religion. This “overlap” has been employed to justify Turkey’s military intervention and its political, economic, and cultural domination over the island. Yet the cultural diversities and “perceived” differences between and among these groups are exacerbated by power dynamics, nationalist agendas, and mutual biases. The article explains subtle discussions around “genuine” Turkish and Muslim identities, as well as the enforced coexistence and constructed brotherhood of Cypriots and Turks on the island. The competing accounts of the “correct” interpretation of Islam at a Muslim tekke reflect intragroup power asymmetries and the conflict between institutionalized Sunni-Orthodox and “heterodox” local Islam. The article focuses on two overlooked issues in the scholarship on Northern Cyprus—the relations between Turkish Cypriots and settlers from Turkey, and the role of religion in the political processes—as well as on literature on shared sacred sites and an analysis of competitive intracommunal interactions.

T1  - Reconstruction of Historical Memory: A Methodological Approach to Uncover the Reasons of the Armed Uprising in the Montes de María, Colombia
AN  - 2642464209
AB  - This work aims to reconstruct the historical memory of the armed conflict in the Montes de María coastline, province of Sucre, Colombia, in a moment of military confrontations and responses of defenseless civilians to the repertoire of violence caused by armed groups—specifically against the Unión Camilista–Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP), and the paramilitary groups present in the Gulf of Morrosquillo. The objective of this study was to determine the reasons that led the community of Libertad to rise in arms and repel the abuses of armed groups by testing two hypotheses: (1) the frequency of victimizing acts consisting of sexual violence against the women of the Libertad village provoked the community to take up arms; (2) the presence of social agents, here called provocateurs of the community response, motivated the community’s social cohesion and armed uprising. The research is developed using a qualitative methodology with a narrative approach that involved a sample of 49 informants, including two focus groups. We provide empirical findings which are pivotal to understanding the reasons why defenseless civilians made the decision to defend themselves with arms against illegal armed groups that invaded their territory and harassed their communities, especially when dealing with an ethnic minority such as Afro-descendants.

T1  - Multiple categorization and intergroup bias: Examining the generalizability of three theories of intergroup relations
AN  - 2622619463
AB  - Research on intergroup bias usually focuses on a single dimension of social categorization. In real life, however, people are aware of others' multiple group memberships and use this information to form attitudes about them. The present research tests the predictive power of identification, perceived conflict, and perceived symbolic threat in explaining the strength of intergroup bias on various dimensions of social categorization in multiple categorization settings. We conduct a factorial survey experiment, manipulating 9 dimensions of social categorization in diverse samples from 4 countries (n = 12,810 observations, 1,281 participants representing 103 social groups). The dimensions studied are age, gender, ethnicity, religion, place of residence, education, occupation, income, and 1 country-specific dimension. This approach allows exploring the generalizability of established determinants of bias across dimensions of categorization, contexts, and target groups. Identification and symbolic threat showed good generalizability across countries and categorization dimensions, but their effects varied as a function of participant and target groups' status. Identification predicted stronger bias mainly when the participant belonged to a higher status and the target belonged to a lower status group. Symbolic threat predicted stronger bias mainly when the target was a minority group member. Conflict predicted bias only in few cases, and not only the strength but also the direction of the effects varied across countries, dimensions, and target and participant groups. These findings help to clarify the limits of generalizability of established determinants of intergroup bias and highlight the need for new explanations of social–cognitive processes among minority group members.

T1  - The Chinese path of integration and development among all ethnic groups from a comparative perspective between China and the west
AN  - 2608260775
AB  - By comparing five aspects between China and the West—ideas, model of political participation, path of economic and social development, pattern of protection of language and culture rights, and construction of national cohesion and social (Minzu) solidarity, this paper reveals that the Chinese path of integration and development among all ethnic groups has the following characteristics: the ideas of equality, solidarity, mutual assistance and harmony among all ethnic groups; the integrative participation model of all ethnic groups under the unified leadership of the Communist Party of China; the integration on the economic and social development (common prosperity and development); equal protection of the language and culture rights of all ethnic groups; strong sense of national cohesion and social solidarity of fifty-six ethnic groups, based on the equal emphasis on the individual and collective rights as well as the close integration between political value and traditional cultural value. In general, China’s ethnic policies embody both specific rights and the level of community with a common future. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, relations between ethnic groups are harmonious and positive, and development of all ethnic groups tends to achieve a real equality. In Western countries, ethnic (or racial) relations remain relatively stable with fluctuations from time to time, and the development gap between ethnic groups has a trend of further expansion. Different ideas, systems and cultural concepts lead to different ethnic relationships and current situations of development between China and the West.

T1  - School Matters: The Effects of School Experiences on Youth’s Attitudes toward Immigrants
AN  - 2580805690
AB  - Although schools have been described as an important socialization context for the development of intergroup attitudes, longitudinal multilevel studies are still rare within this field. This 3-wave study (with annual assessments) of German adolescents (N = 1292; Mage = 13.86; 51.8% female) examined the role of school experiences (perceived multicultural education, supportive peer relations in class, democratic classroom climate) in the development of youth’s negative attitudes toward immigrants. Longitudinal multilevel analyses revealed that a democratic classroom climate predicted youth’s attitudes at the individual level. At the classroom level class-average perceptions of a democratic classroom climate, supportive peer relations in class, and multicultural education (the latter solely among male, higher track students) were associated with less negative attitudes toward immigrants. In addition, age moderated the effect of school experiences on attitudes, showing that perceptions of a democratic climate at the classroom level mattered in particular among older adolescents. The findings suggest that school experiences are related to youth’s negative attitudes toward immigrants and can therefore help to reduce the risk of prejudice development.

AN  - 2571852714
AB  - Empirical studies show that many governments gear the provision of goods and services towards their ethnic peers. This article investigates governments’ strategies to provide ethnic favors in Africa. Recent studies of ethnic favoritism find that presidents' ethnic peers and home regions enjoy advantages, yet cannot disentangle whether goods are provided to entire regions or co-ethnic individuals. This article argues that local ethnic demography determines whether governments provide non-excludable public goods or more narrowly targeted handouts. Where government co-ethnics are in the majority, public goods benefit all locals regardless of their ethnic identity. Outside of these strongholds, incumbents pursue discriminatory strategies and only their co-ethnics gain from favoritism. Using fine-grained geographic data on ethnic demographics, the study finds support for the argument's implications in the local incidence of infant mortality. These findings have important implications for theories of distributive politics and conflict in multi-ethnic societies.

T1  - “Trump and racial equality in America? No pretense at all!”
AN  - 2581966168
AB  - This article explores the effects of the Trump administration’s racist words, policies, and behaviours on the increased racial divisions in the United States and the erosion of faith in American institutions. Many Americans have come to recognize that racial injustice is an enduring feature of American society. Recent events, such as the murder of George Floyd, have led to calls for racial justice. What is the definition of racial justice and how is it related to the concepts of structural inequality, systemic racism, structural racism, and institutional racism? The questions arises: What does racial justice look like in the present atmosphere in the United States? Is racial justice possible in a society riven by racial inequality? What about the wounds and scars from four years of Trump and his administration? Using a practical and policy-oriented definition of racial justice shows that Trump and his administration were not merely unconcerned about racial justice issues, but that they actually appeared to set out to exacerbate and inflame racial issues in the United States. Moreover, the damage done to the progress of America’s communities of colour, especially Black Americans, continues to manifest itself, despite Trump no longer being in office.

T1  - In the Ear of the Listener: The Role of Foreign Accent in Interethnic Friendships and Partnerships: IMR
AN  - 2560029905
AB  - This article examines the association between accented speech and the formation of friendships and partnerships among immigrants and native-born majority residents in Germany. Drawing on the sixth wave of the German extension of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries, we analyze a neglected aspect of language — pronunciation — and find that speaking with a foreign accent is a more important correlate of the incidence of interethnic partnerships than of interethnic friendships. We argue that beyond its primary function of understandability, accented speech possesses socially communicative power. Accent transmits signals of an individual’s foreignness and cultural differences and, thus, becomes an additional marker of social distance. Such signals serve as a greater obstacle to more consequential intimate interethnic relations such as partnerships. Our findings extend the scholarly debate on the role of symbolic boundaries in social interactions between ethnic groups by yet another important boundary maker — accent.

T1  - “Because Here, White is Right”: Mental Health Experiences of International Graduate Students of Color from a Critical Race Perspective
AN  - 2557304025
AB  - To examine the mental health experiences of international graduate students of Color (IGSC) as they navigate through a multitude of systemic barriers, the researchers interviewed eight IGSC in the U.S. Adopting a critical race perspective, the researchers sought to address a persistent gap in the counseling literature, and explore how systemic influences of racism, xenophobia, and discriminatory policies impacted the mental health of IGSC. Three distinct themes emerged from phenomenological analysis of the participants’ interviews in the current study: cross-cultural challenges, surviving racism and anti-immigrant sentiment, and mental health and wellness. Implications for how professional counselors can support IGSC as they navigate through multiple challenges are emphasized.

T1  - Race, Revisionism, Ethnic Boundaries, and Japanese American Internment
AN  - 2539310631
AB  - Recognizing the centrality of race in US immigration and ethnic history-what is known as the field's "racial turn"-has been advocated, applauded, and globalized; but it has yet to be examined from a theoretical perspective. To better understand the appeal and limitations of the field's race-centered analysis, historians can profit from studying the contemporary development of race theory, as well as the revisionism against it. There is a vigorous debate among social scientists about the significance of race. This article addresses this debate, especially from the revisionist side. In so doing, it highlights revisionist Andreas Wimmer's model of ethnic boundary making, and explores its insights for the study of Japanese American internment during World War II.

T1  - Contested and interdependent appropriation of space in a multicultural commercial neighbourhood of Santiago, Chile
AN  - 2506655877
AB  - This article examines experiences of making, inhabiting and appropriating space, in relation to the transformations of the political economy in an increasingly multicultural urban setting. Through processes of social production and construction of space, it explores the material, societal and symbolic processes at play. The entry points are memories, images, uses and material connection to Patronato neighbourhood (Santiago, Chile) by people of Korean and Palestinian ancestry. It analyses how claims of space authenticity, processes of ethnicisation and material appropriation of space – commonly understood as given by ‘cultural differences’ – respond to historical, economic and political shifts happening at a global and local level. Moreover, challenging the prism of socioeconomic conflict and separation, it shows emerging dynamics of social interdependence and adjustment, taking place alongside the reorganisation of ethnic boundaries. Such reorganisation allows settled migrants to develop a sense of belonging and control over space in a rapidly changing neoliberal city.

T1  - What Context Matters and at What Level? A Test of Racial/Ethnic Threat, Symbolic Threat, and Structural Inequality Perspectives in Juvenile Court Decision-Making
AN  - 2476307757
AB  - Do traditional theories of conflict influence juvenile court decision-making and explain racial/ethnic disparities? Racial/ethnic threat, symbolic threat, and structural inequality perspectives purport social controls increase when groups differ in race, ethnicity, or class. Scholarship tends to test one perspective at a time and use county as a unit of analysis. Taking a comparative approach, this study evaluates whether contextual indicators of these three theories, measured at the county- and zip code-levels, contribute to Black-White and Latino-White disparities in court decisions. Multilevel models reveal weak and partial support for each perspective. More effects appear at the zip code-level, indicating conflict may occur within rather than across courts. Macro-level theories must then be reconsidered to describe modern-day juvenile court proceedings.

T1  - CHALLENGES IN DESIGNING AN INTERETHNIC-CONTENT SURVEY AMONG B40 URBAN MULTI-ETHNIC WOMEN IN KUALA LUMPUR
AN  - 2563491777
AB  - The article elaborates researchers' challenges in designing a structured survey on B40 urban women across three major ethnic groups in a multi-ethnic city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is an outcome of a sociological, quantitative research. A major focus of this article is to enrich the knowledge associated with designing a survey questionnaire involving interethnic study - a field that has a direct impact on any diverse-cultural societies. It provides an overview of methodological matters in conducting research on the interethnic theme. Its main objective is to raise understanding about methodological issues and procedures in designing the interethnic content survey. It is found that in designing the research questions and items in interethnic studies, researchers need to comprehend the socio-cultural-historical-political experiences of each ethnic group in Malaysia. This article hopes to provide helpful guidance to future researchers to engage in interethnic study. Understanding the influences of ethnic diversities regarding social relations is pertinent within the Malaysian context.

T1  - Declining and splitting: Opposition to immigration in the United States, 1996–2018
AN  - 2516239856
AB  - The 'competitive threat' theoretical model leads to the expectation that flows of documented and undocumented immigrants, economic downturns, and spread of conservative-nationalist ideologies would increase opposition to immigration. Recent studies on attitudes toward immigrants in American society do not show any increase in anti-immigrant sentiment. In the present study, we use data from the General Social Surveys (GSS) and American National Election Survey (ANES) to study change in opposition to immigration between 1996 and 2018. The findings obtained from the two data sources are strikingly similar and lead to the following conclusions. First, opposition to immigration had steadily and monotonously declined throughout the period. Second, the decline is evident even after considering variations and changes in the composition of the population, shifts in political ideologies, regional variations and cohort replacement. Third, the trend of decline in opposition to immigration takes a linear form. Fourth, opposition to immigration is stronger among Republicans and Independent voters than among Democrats. Fifth, the overtime decline in opposition to immigration was evident mostly among supporters of the Democratic Party increasing the division along party lines. The findings suggest that immigration is becoming a major political issue that is steadily polarizing American society.

T1  - A Darwinian Approach to Postmodern Critical Theory: Or, How Did Bad Ideas Colonise the Academy?
AN  - 2561677931
AB  - This article proposes a Darwinian approach to examine the persistence and resilience of a peculiar set of misbeliefs that have flourished in intellectual circles over the last several decades. These misbeliefs, such as the prevailing antirational explanatory models within postmodern critical theory (PMCT), might be expected to perish under the weight of critical scrutiny; that is, selection pressures would tend to weed them out in a highly competitive and rigorous “marketplace of ideas” such as the academy. Given the flourishing of PMCT and its attendant communities of practice, political economies, tribalism and social signalling, it is suggested here that it should be approached in a new way: as a significant socio-cultural cluster of misbeliefs worthy of explanation with tools honed via evolutionary science. For example, the prominence of religious-like performativity and self-validating arguments associated with PMCT makes it suitable for study from perspectives such as memetics, evolutionary psychology (EP) and signalling theory, and Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). With these approaches, a hypothesis-driven research agenda could be developed to examine the deeply-rooted cognitive basis and adaptive socio-cultural drivers behind the spread of PMCT. It is proposed that formal and systematic programmes be established to research the phenomenon, and that – just as with the study of religion – we move beyond the now long-established emphasis on intellectual critique and instead establish a broad programme in the Evolutionary Studies of Postmodernism (ESPM).

T1  - “Watchful citizens” and digital vigilantism: a case study of the far right in Quebec
AN  - 2459593831
AB  - Vigilantism is defined as collective coercive practices carried out by non-state actors and intended to enforce norms (social or judicial) or to act directly to enforce such actors’ views of the law. Vigilantes are involved in both societal control and the fight against crime. In this article, we analyse how societal vigilantes use digital media (Facebook) to act on immigration, national identity, ethnic boundaries, and cultural values in the province of Quebec, Canada. We show how social media practices entail performative effects that should not be considered exclusively in terms of physical expression, such as gatherings of dispersed constituencies, as in, for example, the Arab Spring, but also in relation to the construction of boundaries and increased polarisation between social groups. These latter effects have real consequences, such as separating one element of the population (Muslims) from the moral obligation social groups have towards each other in society.

T1  - Forum theater can improve intergroup attitudes, sense of community, and collective action intentions: Evidence from Liberia
AN  - 2453786253
AB  - After a civil war or other forms of mass violence, a society needs to reestablish trust between formerly conflicting groups and take peaceful collective actions to address the root causes of the conflict. We propose that one method of facilitating improved intergroup attitudes, a sense of community, and collective action intentions is Forum Theater (Boal, 1989); we tested this prediction in postwar Liberia. In 2 communities, 218 diverse Liberians participated in a field experiment evaluating 2 Forum Theater plays (one about rebuilding trust following intergroup conflict and one about a public health issue); we also included a control group that did not receive any intervention. Both Forum Theater interventions increased participants' sense of community and willingness to engage in collective action. Only the play about intergroup conflict increased intergroup trust and reduced social distance toward a disliked group. Specifically tailored Forum Theater thus has the potential to improve intergroup attitudes, sense of community, and collective action intentions in postconflict societies.

T1  - Genocidal Rape In South Sudan: Organization, Function, and Effects
AN  - 2438999899
AB  - Different labels have been used to characterize violence against civilians in South Sudan since the beginning of the third civil war (2013- present). The United Nations categorized the violence as "on the edge of," or as "potential" genocide. This article contends that mass rape by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and affiliated militias against civilians is genocidal, based on over 325 interviews collected in South Sudan and Uganda's refugee camps in 2015–2017, including with rape survivors and witnesses. The article investigates the organization and commission of systematic gang-rapes in two of the most conflict-stricken areas of South Sudan. It argues that genocidal rape is two-pronged. In addition to destroying the target groups, genocidal rape also secures gains for the perpetrators. Much of the literature on rape as a weapon of war has thus focused on what it does (or what it is meant to do) to the victim group and what it accomplishes militarily. This article also explains what genocidal rape does for the perpetrators, and how it impacts society's social stratification. Genocidal rape not only obliterates victim groups: in destroying and transferring wealth to the perpetrators, it is part of a capitalist logic that consolidates ethnic groupness and domination.

T1  - ‘That is why we raise children’: African American fathers' race-related concerns for their adolescents and parenting strategies
AN  - 2460974833
AB  - Introduction
The current study highlights the voices and perspectives of African American fathers, with specific emphasis on their race-related concerns for their adolescents as well as how these concerns guide their parenting strategies.
Method
Twenty-four African American fathers participated in 1.5–3 h long focus group interviews. All fathers (M = 42.24 years, SD = 6.93) resided in a mid-sized city in the Southeastern United States. All participants were either biological fathers (n = 20) or non-biological (n = 4) fathers. Fathers were residential (76%) and non-residential (24%), with at least one adolescent child (M = 14.32 years, SD = 5.80; Range: 10–16 years). Fifty-eight percent of fathers (n = 14) had both male and female children, 29% had only female children (n = 7) and 13% had only male children (n = 3). After codebook development and refinement, key themes were explored using a theoretical thematic analysis.
Results
In response to race-related and other social risks for African American adolescents, fathers articulated a number of parenting motivations and intentions: 1) fathers' own racial experiences; 2) negative media images of Black youth and families (e.g. media influences, negative stereotypes, and portrayals of Black fathers); 3) preserving families through community support; 4) developing awareness of discrimination and coping strategies; 5) cultivating positive personal and cultural identities; and 6) achievement as necessity. Also, gender emerged as a critical lens for African American fathers’ concerns and parenting strategies.
Conclusion
Overall, our investigation highlights African American fathers’ own meaning-making around concerns for their adolescents as well as how they shape parenting processes.

T1  - Practices of exclusion, narratives of inclusion: Violence, population movements and identity politics in post-2014 northern Iraq
AN  - 2405145730
AB  - This article examines the practices and narratives of inclusion and exclusion in Iraq in relation to ethnic and religious minorities displaced by the Islamic State and the resulting war. Examining the displacement in Iraq through the lens of citizenship, and utilising 29 in-depth qualitative interviews with internally displaced people (IDPs) in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, this article argues that displacement has been accompanied by practices and narratives meant to include internally displaced people in a particularistic articulation of belonging rather than to ensure a substantive participation as Iraqi or Kurdistan Region of Iraq citizens. Rhetoric of citizenship in Iraq changes between civic and ethnosectarian belonging based on conflict dynamics and the competition for power, whilst remaining ethnosectarian in reality. Thus, internally displaced people and their citizenship have become entangled in wider ethnosectarian competition in Iraq, and narratives and practices of citizenship change to fit the objectives of these wider actors, mainly Baghdad and Erbil, rather than being based on inclusiveness and civic identity.

T1  - Examining Multidimensional Poverty in Sri Lanka: Transitioning Through Post War Conflict
AN  - 2561645512
AB  - This paper analyses the trend and changes in Sri Lanka’s multidimensional poverty before the ethnic war in 2007, the transition through 2009 and after the war in 2012/13. Using multiple correspondence and stochastic dominance analyses, the change in multidimensional poverty for various groups over time is considered using provincial and sectoral decompositions. Evidence shows that multidimensional poverty has declined since 2007. This is seen for war-affected and non-affected provinces as well as all ethnic groups. In particular, the after-war decline was caused by considerable improvements in the rural sector and some improvement in the urban sector but little change in the estate sector. Quantile regression analysis revealed that the war-affected Northern and Eastern provinces, and the ethnic minority of Tamils are still worse off than their counterparts after the war. To reduce multidimensional poverty, a targeted policy of priming up the peace dividend efforts comprising infrastructural development and improving employment opportunities within a coherent policy framework in the war-affected provinces should be undertaken. To address regional imbalance, improving living conditions and incomes in the estate sector in particular cannot be neglected and a public–private partnership could be effective in addressing multidimensional poverty.

T1  - Individual and community-level impact of infertility-related stigma in Malawi
AN  - 2412337781
AB  - Infertility, a common experience among women and men worldwide, remains on the margins of public health and medicine in low-resource settings. Previous studies identified associations between individual experiences of infertility and negative outcomes, particularly in contexts where childbearing is imperative, but few have examined broader implications of infertility and infertility-related stigma on communities. To understand the production and impact of infertility-related stigma, this study analyzes 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted with 104 women and men in rural Malawi. FGDs, conducted July–September 2018, were used to elicit the range of community norms around family formation, pregnancy, fertility, and infertility. Data were analyzed through memo-ing during and after data collection and collaborative, thematic coding. We found that stigma manifested within existing systems of gender and power. Aligning with Link and Phelan's stigma framework (2001) there were three primary mechanisms by which infertility-related stigma was produced and reinforced: labeling of a person perceived to be infertile (i.e., establishing ‘other’), perpetuating negative stereotypes associated with suspected causes of infertility (e.g., abortion, multiple sexual partners, weak sperm), and consequences of infertility that reinforced stigma (e.g., social ridicule and distancing, divorce). Labels, presumed causes, and consequences of infertility were entrenched within gender and sexuality norms. Women perceived as infertile were unable to follow a normative path to achieving adult status, presumed to be sexually transgressive, and considered "useless." Men's masculinity was questioned. Both women's and men's identities, as well as social positions within relationships and communities, were threatened by perceptions of infertility. Ultimately, the manifestation of infertility-related stigma contributed to an environment wherein the risk of being perceived as infertile was highly consequential and unrelenting. Pervasive stigma, at the community-level, impacts decisions around contraceptive use and timing of childbearing, as women and men not only wanted to avoid infertility, but also the appearance of infertility.

T1  - Ethnic Violence and Birth Outcomes: Evidence From Exposure to the 1992 Conflict in Kenya
AN  - 2390463540
AB  - This study is an examination of the effect of intrauterine exposure to electoral violence on child birth weight, an outcome that has long-term effects on an individual’s education, income, and health in later life. We consider the electoral violence that resulted from the introduction of multiparty democracy in Kenya as an exogenous source of shock, using a difference-in-differences method and a mother fixed-effects model. We find that prenatal exposure to the violence increased the probabilities of low birth weight and a child being of very small size at birth by 19 and 6 percentage points, respectively. Violence exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy decreased birth weight by 271 grams and increased the probabilities of low birth weight and very small size at birth by 18 and 4 percentage points, respectively. The results reaffirm the significance of the nine months in utero as one of the most critical periods in life that shapes future health, economic, and educational trajectories.

T1  - Tribalism in a Pediatric Emergency Department
AN  - 2370383902
AB  - This ethnography explored the organizational culture of a busy urban pediatric emergency department (ED) in the United States. EDs uniquely combine extreme patient acuity, high census, a high-stress unpredictable environment, and fast-paced complex communication. We found that tribalism characterized the organizational culture and was exacerbated by resource scarcity, changing leadership, and high patient volume. Tribalism affected work climate and job satisfaction but is entrenched and difficult to change. We examine the historical, social, and institutional factors that contributed to tribalism and the ways in which tribalism characterized how providers and staff perceived and recreated interprofessional dynamics. This study contributes to existing work on tribalism in health care by looking at factors that impact perceptions of "us vs. them" and ways tribalism was manifested in the day-to-day practice of team-based care.

T1  - Feminist methods in a “post-truth” political climate: objectives, strategies, and divisions
AN  - 2403183783
AB  - The legitimacy of feminist ways of knowing and the well-being of marginalized identities they attend to are endangered by a “post-truth,” North American political climate. There thus arises an urgent need to examine and vindicate the significance of feminist methods (FM) for women and people of color (WPC). This article contributes to this goal by critically examining the themes that have hitherto organized FM as a category of efforts to reverse WPC’s historical dispossession in the academy. This article identifies three thematic objectives of FM (symbolic, social, and economic empowerment of WPC to reverse their historical dispossession), three thematic strategies of FM to accomplish these objectives in research design (centering WPC in the research agenda, designing more inclusive methods, innovating new theoretical concepts to analyze findings), and two thematic debates that continue to divide FM (styles of intersectionality and identity in the feminist movement as an analytical approach and political effort at large). This article concludes by situating these thematic distinctions in Lamont and Swidler’s broader articulation of methodological tribalism, opening dialogue on the political and analytical advantages of and need for superior methodological pluralism in FM.

T1  - Interrogating the tribal: the aporia of ‘tribalism’ in the sociological study of the Middle East
AN  - 2321281070
AB  - In this paper, we intend to deconstruct the term ‘tribalism’ as a colonial category, which figures as a prominent concept in social studies on Kurds as well as the Middle East at large. Blithely used, tribalism has occupied a central place, especially in the existing scholarship on Kurdistan. Some earlier anthropological works have gone so far as to regard tribalism as the ‘DNA’ of Middle Eastern people. Drawing on recent studies on Latin America, Africa and Central Asia, we argue that the use of tribalism as if it is the natural constitution of Kurdish society has caused a significant misrepresentation and oversimplification of socio‐political life in Kurdistan as well as the broader Middle East. In a way, the existing body of scholarship on this region has reproduced statist‐nationalist discourses at the expense of dominated communities (e.g., Kurds). The historical context of both colonial powers and nation‐states ‘combating tribes and tribalism’ coincided with the emergence of the discourse of racial biopolitics. Thus, the use of the term tribalism to define certain nations or ethnic groups should not be viewed as merely an application of socio‐anthropological categories. Hence, we argue that the ethical aspects and implications of the use of tribalism by both colonial powers and later by nation‐states to define certain ethnic groups must not be overlooked.

T1  - A BLURRED CASE: THE DIVERSITY DEFENSE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN THE U.S.
AN  - 2413370544
AB  - Much of the pivotal debate concerning the validity of affirmative action is situated in a legal context of defending or challenging claims that there may be broad societal gains from increased diversity. Race-conscious affirmative action policies originally advanced legal sanctions to promote racial equity in the United States. Today, increasingly detached from its historical context, defense or rejection of affirmative action is otherwise upheld to achieve diversity. A “diversity” rationale for affirmative action calls for increasing tolerance of the “other,” reducing negative stereotypes, and moderating prejudice as goals—all objectives that deviate from the former aim of race-targeted inclusion intended to resolve racial discrimination in employment and college admissions. Diversity policy provides a tapered defense for affirmative action, one detached from principles of justice and equity. The current article suggests that, despite the fact that the ostensible benefits of “racial inclusion as diversity” may be the remaining legal prop for affirmative action in the U.S., there is a need to consider whether diversity intrinsically can engender the benefits that affirmative action policy seeks to provide.

T1  - Association of Religious Activities and Social Interaction of Christian and Sikh Minorities with Muslims in Pakistan
AN  - 2379528775
AB  - Faith in any religion takes significant importance in a country where intolerance and extremism are high. Acceptance and tolerance are keys for adjustment in religious activities and are pertinent for smooth running and dynamism. In contrast to it, intolerance and non-acceptance in religious activities is a burning issue with respect to adjustment problems faced by minorities in a country. This study aims to explore the adjustment problems faced by minorities, especially by Christians and Sikhs for the performance of their religious activities in district Peshawar and Swat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The prime aim and goal of the study is to illustrate the ways minorities are targeted (Christians and Sikhs) and have to adjust with Muslim majorities for the performance of their religious activities, along with making efforts to strengthen various modes of social interaction within themselves in the targeted area. For the measurement of variable, five-level Likert scale was used, and the chi-square test was applied to find out the association level of an independent variable with the dependent variable. Based on the Sekaran table, a total of 372 respondents were selected from the local minorities to analyse the adjustment problems faced by minorities in the performance of their religious activities. The findings of the study reveal that Christians and Sikhs usually celebrate their religious festivals and rituals publicly which highlights the strong social interaction between majorities and minorities in the target area. But still, slight issues of disturbances with their religious rituals and festivals were found in some places of the target area.

T1  - A peace of bricks and mortar: thinking ceasefire landscapes with Gramsci
AN  - 2258603381
AB  - This article addresses the ways in which Nicosia has been affected by division due to the ethno-political conflict and the gentrification efforts that have attended attempts to reunite the city. It examines two spaces of civic action in particular that have involved reconstruction and rehabilitation of two areas in the capital's UN-controlled Buffer Zone: one by a peace and reconciliation initiative and another by the local variant of the global Occupy movement. In doing so, it addresses the question of how conflict politics becomes imbricated in the politics of urban development. The article examines the role of organic intellectuals in the making of war heritage and the transformation of post-conflict landscapes amid processes of gentrification. In the cases we are examining, we want to trace the processes of creating landscapes that memorialise not only ethnic conflict but the multiple political conflicts that unfold in time and space.

T1  - What's visible is my race, what's invisible is my contribution: Understanding the effects of race and color-blind racial attitudes on the perceived impact of microaggressions toward Asians in the workplace
AN  - 2290894320
AB  - The study examined perceptions of racial workplace microaggressions against Asians. Microaggressions signal that the target's racial group is highly visible to the perpetrator. In this study, we examined the perceived negative effects associated with this type of heightened racial visibility, and whether these effects are equally discernable to all based on one's race and color-blindness. Asian and White participants were given a series of vignettes depicting different types of microaggressions, consisting of both blatant (microassault) and subtle forms (microinsult and microinvalidation). In addition, we examined a new form of subtle microaggression (overvalidation) that occurs when the perpetrator treats Asians in a seemingly positive way based on stereotypes about Asians (e.g. assigning predominantly quantitative tasks to Asians because they are perceived to be good at math). Results revealed that compared to Whites, Asians saw a smaller difference in negative effects between the blatant microassault and subtle overvalidation and microinsult conditions. Additionally, participants lower on color-blindness perceived a smaller difference in negative effects on the target between the microassault and all forms of subtle microaggressions. Finally, we found that color-blindness played a stronger role among Whites than Asians such that compared to Whites higher on color-blindness, Whites lower on color-blindness perceived a smaller difference in negative effects on the target between the microassault and subtle microaggressions. No such difference existed among Asians. Implications for raising awareness of the negative effects of subtle microaggressions that render Asians (in)visible in the workplace are discussed.

T1  - Cooperation in the midst of violence: land deals and cattle raids in Narok and Laikipia, Kenya
AN  - 2258091369
AB  - What drives the formation of ties and networks in ethnically hybrid spaces despite the occurrence of conflict? We approach this question by examining the actors involved, the institutions affected, and the economic and environmental contexts surrounding such tendencies. This study explores socially thick arrangements between Maasai and Kikuyu in Narok and their role in the non-violent use of formerly contested lands. In Laikipia, we examine how young Samburu and Kikuyu cooperate in a dangerous yet economically beneficial network involving cattle-rustling ventures. We revisit the history of land settlement in Kenya's Rift Valley, particularly in the study areas of Narok and Laikipia, and show how access and settlement rights to land are negotiated peacefully, encouraging ethnic assimilation and cooperative social and economic relations. Based on this context and the exploration of our case studies, we argue that the formation of alliances in multi-ethnic settings tends to override other identities when mutual benefits drive such associations.Alternate abstract:Qu'est-ce qui stimule la formation de liens et de réseaux dans des espaces ethniquement hybrides malgré l'existence d'un conflit ? Les auteurs abordent cette question en examinant les acteurs impliqués, les institutions affectées et les contextes économiques et environnementaux qui entourent ces tendances. Cette étude explore les arrangements socialement denses entre Maasai et Kikuyu à Narok et leur rôle dans l'utilisation non violente de terres autrefois contestées. Dans le comté de Laikipia, les auteurs examinent le mode de coopération entre jeunes Samburu et Kikuyu au sein d'un réseau dangereux et néanmoins économiquement avantageux impliquant des vols de bétail. Ils reviennent sur l'histoire du peuplement rural dans la Vallée du Rift au Kenya, notamment dans les zones d’étude de Narok et Laikipia, et montrent comment l'accès à la terre et le droit d’établissement se négocient de manière pacifique, encourageant ainsi l'assimilation ethnique et les relations sociales et économiques de coopération. S'appuyant sur ce contexte et sur l'examen de leurs études de cas, les auteurs soutiennent que la formation d'alliances en milieu multi-ethnique a tendance à primer sur d'autres identités lorsque ces associations sont motivées par des avantages mutuels.

T1  - The Geography of Rape: Shaming Narratives in Norwegian Rape Cases
AN  - 2277037359
AB  - This article discusses how perpetrators and victims are constructed in legal rape cases and how these constructions are informed by notions of gender, sexuality, race, and nation. It presents an in-depth frame analysis of two legal cases that were processed by Norwegian appellate courts in 2012. In so doing, I show how the allocation of shame and sympathy for victims and perpetrators is connected to citizenship through gender and race discrimination. The analysis suggests that whereas the perpetrator with a majority racial background was subject to so-called reintegrative shaming, the perpetrator with a minority racial background was subject to stigmatic shaming. The politics of shame in the context of rape thus manifests as an attribution of guilt (but to a lesser extent shame and stigmatization) to the majority perpetrator, whereas the minority perpetrator was constructed as a deviant outlaw deserving of public shame. Prior relationship with the perpetrator, sexually “risk-taking” behavior, and alcohol consumption were associated with negative stereotyping of victims. Moreover, the court regarded violence committed by the perpetrator from a racial-majority group as a deviation from the civilized and gender-equal mainstream culture. I therefore argue that geography constitutes a specific element in the legal processing of rape cases. With the prosecution of rape as a medium, the courts produce and reproduce a moral community in which some sexual citizens are admitted a share and others are not, while the legal process simultaneously manages the sexual rights of citizens in different physical and social spaces.

T1  - Remoteness is power: disconnection as a relation in northern Chad
AN  - 2235481179
AB  - Remoteness is as much about a position in topological as in topographical space. Remote areas might look inaccessible from the outside, but, for Ardener (Ardener, E. 1989. The voice of prophecy and other essays, M. Chapman (ed.). Oxford: Blackwell), feel open and vulnerable from the inside, as their connectivity with the outside world is never fully controlled by locals. Drawing on material gathered in northern Chad, we argue that this lack of conceptual reciprocity can also lead to the opposite: a trope of permanent aggression, based on the local endorsement of external negative stereotypes. From the outside, the ‘locals’ are seen to be archetypical raiders, thieves and uncouth. From the inside, people concur in these descriptions to a surprising degree, insisting on their disorder, unpredictability and violence. This endorsement of alterity grants northern Chad a particular place in Saharan history, geography and ethnography.Alternate abstract:Le pouvoir de l’éloignement: la déconnexion comme mode de relation dans le Nord du TchadL’éloignement concerne autant une position dans l'espace topologique que dans l'espace topographique. Les zones isolées peuvent sembler inaccessibles de l'extérieur, mais selon Ardener (1989), de l'intérieur elles semblent ouvertes et vulnérables, leur relation avec le monde extérieur n’étant jamais totalement contrôlée par les populations locales. À partir de données recueillies dans le Nord du Tchad, notre analyse suggère que ce manque de réciprocité conceptuelle peut également conduire à une situation inverse : une figure d'agression permanente, s'appuyant sur l'approbation locale de stéréotypes négatifs externes. De l'extérieur, les « populations locales » sont perçues comme des archétypes de pilleurs, de voleurs et de rustres. De l'intérieur, celles‐ci adhèrent de manière surprenante à ces descriptions, insistant sur leur caractère désordonné, imprévisible et violent. Cette acceptation de l'altérité confère au Nord du Tchad une place particulière dans l'histoire, la géographie et l'ethnographie du Sahara.

T1  - A quarter century of system justification theory: Questions, answers, criticisms, and societal applications
AN  - 2203035905
AB  - A theory of system justification was proposed 25 years ago by Jost and Banaji (1994, Br. J. Soc. Psychol., 33, 1) in the British Journal of Social Psychology to explain ‘the participation by disadvantaged individuals and groups in negative stereotypes of themselves' and the phenomenon of outgroup favouritism. The scope of the theory was subsequently expanded to account for a much wider range of outcomes, including appraisals of fairness, justice, legitimacy, deservingness, and entitlement; spontaneous and deliberate social judgements about individuals, groups, and events; and full‐fledged political and religious ideologies. According to system justification theory, people are motivated (to varying degrees, depending upon situational and dispositional factors) to defend, bolster, and justify aspects of existing social, economic, and political systems. Engaging in system justification serves the palliative function of increasing satisfaction with the status quo and addresses underlying epistemic, existential, and relational needs to reduce uncertainty, threat, and social discord. This article summarizes the major tenets of system justification theory, reviews some of the empirical evidence supporting it, answers new (and old) questions and criticisms, and highlights areas of societal relevance and directions for future research.

T1  - The Politics of IDP Education Provision: Negotiating identity and schooling in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq
AN  - 2191314379
AB  - The expansion of Islamic State control in Iraq led to massive internal displacement. Iraq now has one of the largest internally displaced populations in the world. Many families found relative safety in government‐controlled towns throughout the country; a large proportion sought refuge in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), having fled from its northern territories where Arabs, Kurds, Yezidis, Assyrians and Turkmen each claimed demographic dominance. Consequently, the KRI has become a sanctuary to almost a million Iraqi IDPs of varying ethnic backgrounds and cultures. This article draws on extensive regional fieldwork to explore the relationship between education provision for displaced populations and broader ethno‐sectarian and socio‐political influences. The article will unpack the research question: “In what ways does education for IDPs in KRI exacerbate or mitigate conflict?” and will highlight key areas in which misunderstanding of identity politics has resulted in reduced quality education for displaced populations.

T1  - “I Didn’t Come to School for This”: A Qualitative Examination of Experiences With Race-Related Stressors and Coping Responses Among Black Students Attending a Predominantly White Institution
AN  - 2175188990
AB  - Exposure to race-related stressors such as discrimination may take a toll on Black undergraduates attending predominantly White institutions (PWIs) who must contend with these stressors in addition to stressors common to the developmental space of emerging adulthood and the transition to college. The aim of this study was to explore Black students’ experiences of race-related stressors, coping responses, and the role of natural mentors (i.e., nonparental adults from students’ preexisting social networks who serve a mentoring role in students’ lives) in the coping process. We conducted semi-structured interviews with Black college students (n = 12) at a PWI and their natural mentors (n = 10) with whom they discussed issues related to race. Thematic analysis of data indicated that Black students faced a number of race-related stressors yet employed a set of coping responses including processing the event on one’s own, talking about it with others, and engaging in behavioral strategies such as working harder in school in an effort to disprove negative stereotypes. Findings reflected intentional socialization processes in regard to coping with race-related stressors. We discuss trade-offs associated with identified coping responses and the need for institutional efforts to reduce race-related stressors and foster more inclusive campus environments.

T1  - Using Grounded Theory to Understand a Cutting-Edge Issue: Effects of Integrative Tactics on Chinese Gay Men’s and Lesbians’ Social Well-Being
AN  - 2334154098
AB  - This study aims to demonstrate how grounded theory can be used to explore and analyze negotiation processes between self-identified gay men and lesbians and their parents. For a majority of Chinese gay men and lesbians, marriage proves to be the primary concern that drives negotiations with parents. Extant research documents the precarious consequences of gay men’s and lesbians’ social well-being yielded by these negotiations, which primarily employ distributive negotiating tactics. As integrative tactics prove to be conducive to favorable outcomes, their application in same-sex children’s negotiation with parents informs the present study. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 Chinese participants (15 gay men and 10 lesbian women). Grounded theory analysis of interviewee data identified a grounded theory of soft-power-based negotiation, which illustrated detailed negotiation processes between gay men and lesbians and their parents and critical conditions mediating this process. The grounded theory elaborated concrete soft-power bases and integrative tactics used by participants and their parents. Conditions for integrative tactics to sustain gay men and lesbians’ social well-being emerged. Results implied viable solutions for resolving conflicts between social minorities and social majorities in general.

T1  - Camp settlement and communal conflict in sub-Saharan Africa
AN  - 2170232563
AB  - Are areas that host encamped refugees more likely to experience communal conflict, and under what conditions? Building on insights from the refugee studies literature suggesting that settling refugees in camps can intensify intercommunal tension in host communities, this article investigates the effect of refugee encampment on the occurrence of communal conflict at the subnational level in sub-Saharan Africa. It first tests for a general relationship between the overall presence and population intensity of encamped refugees and communal conflict before assessing whether this relationship is moderated by local-level characteristics, including interethnic linkages and political and economic marginalization within the host region. The basic findings show that communal conflict occurs more frequently in regions where refugees are camp-settled. Tests for interactive effects indicate that refugee camps have a significant marginal effect on conflict only if they are located in areas with politically marginalized host groups. Origin country/host region ethnic ties are shown to exert significant moderating effects. Moreover, results from an extended set of analyses show that the form of refugee settlement matters, as the presence and population intensity of self-settled refugees are related to decreases in the occurrence of communal conflict.

T1  - Status Change Model of Interethnic Riots
AN  - 2318719619
AB  - The status change riot model opens up a new avenue of riot explanation. One that takes into consideration ethnic group relations and factors of group status and honor—i.e., dignity. The riot model asserts that the potential for a riot arises when new and old concepts about group statuses, and as such, ideas about appropriate intergroup behaviors, give rise to disputative intergroup interactions. The model affirms that a trigger event either by itself or in accumulation with other events drives actors to a dignity threshold that prompts them to riot. The model further relates that, once started, a riot will follow a general riot pattern that ends in either a status resolution or an increased strain in ethnic group relations.

T1  - Muslim gay men: identity conflict and politics in a Muslim majority nation
AN  - 2159334954
AB  - While a number of investigations have examined how gay Muslim men view homosexuality in relation to religious Western homophobia, this research constitutes the first account of the experiences of self‐identified gay men living in an African, Muslim nation, where same‐sex sex is both illegal and actively persecuted. We interviewed 28 gay men living in Tunisia in order to understand how they assimilate their sexual, religious and ethnic identities within a highly homophobic culture. Utilizing notions of homoerasure and homohysteria (McCormack and Eric Anderson ,b), and examining the intersection of identity conflict and new social movement theory, we highlight four strategies that participants use to negotiate the dissonance of living with conflicting identities in a context of religious homophobia: (1) privileging their Islamic identities and rejecting homosexuality as a legitimate sexual identity; (2) rejecting Islam and accepting homosexuality as a legitimate sexual identity; (3) interpreting Islam to be supportive of homosexuality; and (4) creating a non‐penetrative homosexuality to be compatible with literal Qur'anic interpretations. We discuss the multiple difficulties these men face in relation to religious intolerance and ethnic heteronormativity, and reflect upon the possibilities and obstacles of using Western identity politics towards the promotion of social justice within a framework of growing homohysteria.

T1  - The Outsider’s Advantage: Distrust as a Deterrent to Exploitation
AN  - 2182479228
AB  - Trust creates vulnerability to exploitation. This article approaches this paradox by comparing the exploitability of categorical trust within social groups to the deterrent effect of categorical distrust between rival groups. The empirical setting is a 2008 stockbrokerage fraud perpetrated on an ethnically diverse population of investors in Kenya’s Nairobi Securities Exchange. As expected, investors prefer brokerages operated by coethnics and avoid brokerages operated by ethnic rivals, but clients coethnic with the corrupt brokerage are not protected from victimization in the fraud. Instead, the brokerage’s rival-group clients receive this protection. Both patterns are primarily seen in high-conflict areas rather than being true across all settings. Mechanism tests suggest that monitoring stimulated by rivals’ distrust drives this result, but deepening relational embedding with the brokerage attenuates it. A concluding discussion positions these findings in the larger social capital literature and considers whether social homogeneity might be a causal factor in opportunism.

T1  - Debunking the myth of job hopping amongst black professionals in corporate South Africa
TT  - Debunking the myth of job hopping
AN  - 2091589980
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to critically examine the facticity of the dominant construction of black professionals as job hoppers that derail workforce reforms in corporate South Africa particularly in leadership roles.Design/methodology/approachHistorical literature review was conducted to trace the genesis of the alleged racialised job hopping phenomenon. Melissa Steyn’s (2015) idea of Critical Diversity Literacy was also applied to critically examine the implicit power dynamics, strengths, limitations and biases involved in the construction, valorisation, circulation and contestation of this dominant narrative.FindingsThe authors found the popular racialised job hopping phenomenon to be an overgeneralisation that lacks credible evidence. It ignores multiple variables that are crucial in studying employee turnover behaviour.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper is conceptual. It is mainly based on critical literature reviews. Empirical studies could be undertaken within this domain in the future to confirm or disconfirm some of the findings of this paper.Practical implicationsThese allegations are emblematic of the endemic systemic racism in South Africa’s corporate labour market that remains an enclave of whiteness.Social implicationsRace is a highly contentious phenomenon and a major field of social inequality. Black bodies confront numerous challenges that undermine their human rights and opportunities to participate meaningfully in society and the economy. This paper calls for organisations to play an active role in healing racial divisions and building social cohesion by critically examining, challenging and changing discourses that propel inequality.Originality/valueBy addressing one of critical socio-economic and political issues confronting the world’s most unequal society, the paper hopes to stimulate healthy debate that can bring real change for marginalised groups in workplaces.

T1  - How Race and Unemployment Shape Labor Market Opportunities: Additive, Amplified, or Muted Effects?
AN  - 2430650268
AB  - The manner in which social categories combine to produce inequality lies at the heart of scholarship on social stratification. To date, scholars have largely pointed to two primary ways that negatively stereotyped categories may aggregate: 1) additive effects, whereby one category has similar consequences across the other category, and 2) amplified congruence, whereby a secondary category exacerbates the negative effects of the first category. This article develops an alternative potential aggregation pattern—muted congruence—which posits that when individuals evaluate others that occupy multiple social positions about which stereotypes are highly congruent, such as being black and being unemployed, the additional category membership will have limited influence over the ultimate evaluation. Using evidence from a field experiment, where fictitious applications were submitted to real job openings, I examine which aggregation pattern most accurately reflects how race and unemployment shape actual hiring decisions. In line with predictions from the “muted congruence” perspective, the findings indicate that racial discrimination is prominent, but that there are limited additional negative effects of unemployment for African American workers. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for understanding the aggregation of social categories in the production of inequality.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate diversity conflict intersections and how the meanings of diversity markers such as gender and race might be transformed. It highlights the resources of South African women leaders in higher education institutions for doing so.Design/methodology/approachThis study proceeds from a social constructivist perspective, seeking to uncover narrated conflict experiences via a hermeneutical approach.FindingsWomen leaders in South Africa experience diversity conflict across multiple intersecting diversity markers, such as gender, race, ethnicity and class. They are united by inner resources which, if utilized, might bring about transformation.Research limitations/implicationsIntersectional approach to diversity conflict is a viable means for uncovering positive resources for transformation across intersecting diversity markers.Practical implicationsPractitioners wishing to overcome diversity conflict should identify positive resources across intersecting diversity markers. This way, organizations and individuals might bring about transformation.Social implicationsIn societal environment wherein one diversity marker is institutionalized on a structural level, such as race in South Africa, diversity conflict might be enlarged beyond its actual scope, thereby becoming insurmountable. This needs to be prevented.Originality/valueThis paper studies diversity conflict intersections in a highly diverse societal environment in organizations facing transformational challenges and from the perspective of women leaders.

T1  - Improving outgroup attitudes in schools: A meta-analytic review
AN  - 2055207508
AB  - To provide information for educators, educational psychologists, school psychologists, and social psychologists, we conducted a quantitative meta-analytic test of n = 50 studies dating from 1995 to 2015 that evaluated the effects of in-school interventions on attitudes toward outgroup members (defined as members of different ethnic or religious backgrounds or different age groups, persons with either physical or mental disabilities, or persons with other distinctive features). Overall, the analysis revealed a mean effect size of d + = 0.36 with a 95% confidence interval that ranged from 0.17 to 0.55, indicating significant, moderate intervention effects, supporting the proposition that meaningful changes in outgroup attitudes can be obtained by applying anti-bias programs in schools. Results from our analysis did not provide evidence that teacher-led interventions produce positive outcomes, yet we found that interventions delivered by researchers promote positive attitudes toward outgroup members. Further, a closer examination demonstrated that one-on-one interventions are most effective at tackling intergroup attitudes. However, classroom-wide programs are more likely to be introduced into regular school activities because of their efficiency and the limited resources available for interventions.

T1  - Stereotypes and perceived solidarity in ethnic enclave tourism
AN  - 2025830991
AB  - This study considers how ethnic attitudes or stereotypes held by Japanese residents (as the majority ethnic group) of Brazilian residents (as the minority ethnic group) factor into the former's perceived emotional solidarity with the latter. The aim of this work is to (1) initially assess the factor structure of the Ethnic Attitude Scale (EAS) and Emotional Solidarity Scale (ESS) and (2) to determine if underlying factors of the EAS serve to explain factors of the ESS. Following a multistage sampling scheme, 456 Japanese households within Oizumi completed an on-site, self-administered questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses of the EAS and ESS revealed consistent two- and three-factor structures with extant findings in the literature. Japanese residents tended to indicate they perceived Brazilian residents slightly favorably on items from each of the EAS factors (i.e. character and intelligence and social evaluation), while responding with ambivalence to items within the ESS factors (i.e. welcoming nature, emotional closeness, and sympathetic understanding). Structural paths (in five of six scenarios) revealed that EAS factors explained between 27% and 59% of the variance in the ESS factors. Implications, limitations, and future research are discussed at the close of the paper.

T1  - Gender Differences in Political Knowledge: Bringing Situation Back In
AN  - 2021700429
AB  - One of the best-known empirical findings in the political sciences is the gender difference in political knowledge: women show less political knowledge than men. Conventional research argues that this difference is mainly a product of socialization, structural factors, and biology. Our paper brings a new perspective to the explanation of the gender gap in political knowledge. Based on an online survey and an experiment1, we emphasize the relevance of gender stereotypes as a situational pressure that reduces the performance of women in a political knowledge test. Two conclusions emerge from the analysis: First, our results indicate the existence of a negative stereotype related to the political knowledge of women. Second, the activation of gender stereotypes affects performance on a political knowledge test. Consistent with previous research on stereotype threat, our results indicate that the performance of men on a political knowledge test is affected by gender stereotypes.

T1  - The Secret Drama at the Patient’s Bedside—Refusal of Treatment Because of the Practitioner’s Ethnic Identity: The Medical Staff 's Point of View
AN  - 2017873412
AB  - Patients’ refusal of treatment based on the practitioner’s ethnic identity reveals a clash of values: neutrality in medicine versus patient-centered care. Taking the Israeli–Palestinian conflict into account, this article aims at examining Israeli health care professionals’ points of view concerning patients’ refusal of treatment because of a practitioner’s ethnic identity. Fifty in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 managers and 40 health care professionals, Jewish and Arab, employed at 11 public hospitals. Most refusal incidents recorded are unidirectional: Jewish patients refusing to be treated by Arab practitioners. Refusals are usually directed toward nurses and junior medical staff members, especially if recognizable as religious Muslims. Refusals are often initiated by the patients’ relatives and occur more frequently during periods of escalation in the conflict. The structural competency approach can be applied to increase awareness of the role of social determinants in shaping patients’ ethnic-based treatment refusals and to improve the handling of such incidents.

T1  - Engaging in extreme activism in support of others’ political struggles: The role of politically motivated fusion with out-groups
AN  - 2390636379
AB  - Humans are a coalitional, parochial species. Yet, extreme actions of solidarity are sometimes taken for distant or unrelated groups. What motivates people to become solidary with groups to which they do not belong originally? Here, we demonstrate that such distant solidarity can occur when the perceived treatment of an out-group clashes with one’s political beliefs (e.g., for Leftists, oppressive occupation of the out-group) and that it is driven by fusion (or a feeling of oneness) with distant others with whom one does not share any common social category such as nationality, ethnicity or religion. In Study 1, being politically Leftist predicted European-Americans’ willingness to engage in extreme protest on behalf of Palestinians, which was mediated by fusion with the out-group. Next, in Study 2, we examined whether this pattern was moderated by out-group type. Here, Norwegian Leftists fused more with Palestinians (i.e., a group that, in the Norwegian context, is perceived to be occupied in an asymmetrical conflict) rather than Kurds (i.e., a group for which this perception is less salient). In Study 3, we experimentally tested the underlying mechanism by framing the Kurdish conflict in terms of an asymmetrical occupation (vs. symmetrical war or control conditions) and found that this increased Leftist European-Americans’ fusion with Kurds. Finally, in Study 4, we used a unique sample of non-Kurdish aspiring foreign fighters who were in the process of joining the Kurdish militia YPG. Here, fusion with the out-group predicted a greater likelihood to join and support the Kurdish forces in their fight against ISIS, insofar as respondents experienced that their political orientation morally compelled them to do so (Study 4). Together, our findings suggest that politically motivated fusion with out-groups underpins the extreme solidary action people may take on behalf of distant out-groups. Implications for future theory and research are discussed.

T1  - Piecing Together Past and Present in Bhutan: Narration, Silence and Forgetting in Conflict
AN  - 2051224437
AB  - What happens when conflict is silenced in official narratives but not forgotten among a population? This article explores this question using interview data from anthropological fieldwork in Bhutan. In Bhutan, the ethnic conflict of the early 1990s is surrounded by silence and is not openly discussed. Despite this silence, young Bhutanese have formed a multiplicity of narratives about the conflict. The article highlights three different narratives of conflict, as well as the oblivion found among informants. The main argument is that the silence surrounding the conflict in Bhutan has contributed to two forms of societal rift: between the authorities and the people, and between people themselves. The article contributes to the discussion about what role social memories play in conflicts, by suggesting that silence may cause wariness and hinder processes that help societies to move past conflict in a constructive way.

T1  - Ethnic Stratification and the Equilibrium of Inequality: Ethnic Conflict in Postcolonial States
AN  - 2036505829
AB  - Why are ethnic movements more likely to turn violent in some multiethnic countries than in others? Focusing on the long-term legacies of European overseas colonialism, I investigate the effect of distinct ethnic cleavage types on the consequences of ethnic group mobilization. The colonial settler states and other stratified multiethnic states are characterized by an equilibrium of inequality in which historically marginalized groups lack both the organizational strength and the opportunities for armed rebellion. In contrast, ethnic mobilization in the decolonized states and other segmented multiethnic societies is more likely to trigger violent conflict. I test these arguments in a global quantitative study from 1946 to 2009, using new data on the linguistic and religious segmentation of ethnic groups. The results confirm that the extremely unequal colonial settler states experience less violence than the decolonized states and other multiethnic countries. Ethnic conflict is generally more likely the more segmented and less hierarchically structured multiethnic states are. Specifically, stable between-group hierarchies reduce the risk of governmental conflict, whereas segmentation affects secessionist violence.

T1  - Who runs away from home and why? How families, schools, and bullying influence youth runaways
AN  - 1959212160
AB  - While prior research establishes that youth who experience family problems are more likely to leave home before reaching adulthood, we know less regarding how peer victimization in the form of bullying may influence youths' likelihood of becoming runaways. Youth often run away from home to escape family conflict or abusive home environments. Mental illness, behavioral problems, and delinquent peers are also powerful forces predicting the likelihood of running away from home. Additionally, recent literature suggests that negative experiences at school may increase youths' decisions to leave home prematurely. In this article, I review literature that addresses who runs away from home, including variations by age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, family structure, mental health, problem behaviors, and peer networks. I also suggest directions for future research, including an approach that considers how families and schools individually and collectively affect youths' likelihood of running away from home. Finally, I recommend a focus on bully victimization to better understand how victimization outside of the family affects the likelihood that youth will become runaways.

T1  - Wider-community Segregation and the Effect of Neighbourhood Ethnic Diversity on Social Capital: An Investigation into Intra-Neighbourhood Trust in Great Britain and London
AN  - 1978440127
AB  - Extensive research has demonstrated that neighbourhood ethnic diversity is negatively associated with intra-neighbourhood social capital. This study explores the role of segregation and integration in this relationship. To do so it applies three-level hierarchical linear models to two sets of data from across Great Britain and within London, and examines how segregation across the wider-community in which a neighbourhood is nested
 impacts trust amongst neighbours. This study replicates the increasingly ubiquitous finding that neighbourhood diversity is negatively associated with neighbour-trust. However, we demonstrate that this relationship is highly dependent on the level of segregation across the wider-community in which a neighbourhood is nested. Increasing neighbourhood diversity only negatively impacts neighbour-trust when nested in more segregated wider-communities. Individuals living in diverse neighbourhoods nested within integrated wider-communities experience no trust-penalty. These findings show that segregation plays a critical role in the neighbourhood diversity/trust relationship, and that its absence from the literature biases our understanding of how ethnic diversity affects social cohesion.

T1  - Complexity of Risk: Mixed-Methods Approach to Understanding Youth Risk and Insecurity in Postconflict Settings
AN  - 1978439864
AB  - In settings of intergroup conflict, identifying contextually relevant risk factors for youth development is an important task. In Vukovar, Croatia, a city devastated during the war in former Yugoslavia, ethno-political tensions remain. The current study utilized a mixed-methods approach to identify two salient community-level risk factors (ethnic tension and general antisocial behavior) and related emotional insecurity responses (ethnic and nonethnic insecurity) among youth in Vukovar. In Study 1, focus group discussions (N
 = 66) with mothers, fathers, and adolescents of age 11 to 15 years old were analyzed using the constant comparative method, revealing two types of risk and insecurity responses. In Study 2, youth (N
 = 227, 58% male, M
 = 15.88, SD
 = 1.12 years) responded to quantitative scales developed from the focus groups, discriminate validity was demonstrated, and path analyses established predictive validity between each type of risk and insecurity. First, community ethnic tension (i.e., threats related to war/ethnic identity) significantly predicted ethnic insecurity for all youth (β = .41, p
 < .001). Second, experience with community antisocial behavior (i.e., general crime found in any context) predicted nonethnic community insecurity for girls (β = .32, p
 < .05) but not for boys. These findings are the first to show multiple forms of emotional insecurity at the community level; implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - A House Divided: Threat Perception, Military Factionalism, and Repression in Africa
AN  - 1929625813
AB  - Why do African regimes repress certain contentious challenges but not others? We argue that in addition to opposition claims and tactics, African regimes are especially likely to view challenges expressing ethnic and/or religious claims as threatening. However, in theorizing the decision to use repression, we relax the assumption that the state is a unitary actor. Leaders with a history of factionalism in their security forces face a delegation problem: orders to repress may not be followed or could even cause intraregime violence and/or defections. For this reason, states with divided security forces are less likely to enact repression. This potential for fracturing the regime will be greatest when the challenge has ethnic or religious claims and targets the state, implying an interactive effect. Using the Social Conflict in Africa Database, we find that regimes with a history of past military factionalism are generally less likely to use repression and are especially less likely to repress contentious challenges making ethnic or religious claims.

T1  - Hooks down! Anti-apartheid activism and solidarity among maritime unions in Australia and the United States
AN  - 1900913802
AB  - Our research compares and contrasts the transnational activism of maritime unions in Australia and the United States in what became the first and longest example of global solidarity in the post-World War II era - the anti-apartheid movement. Dockworkers, with a deep history of solidarity, occupied a strategic position to exert real influence on the South African state by refusing to unload South African cargo. We analyze the actions of the Waterside Workers' Federation (WWF) in Australia and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) in the US, namely by exploring notions of solidarity and political unionism among marine transport workers, ideological motivations for solidarity activism, ethnic and race relations among workers, and labor connections these maritime unions made beyond the waterfront. We find and account for similarities and differences in Australian and US labor activism that often is underrepresented and incompletely explained in the literature.

T1  - Squeezed between identity politics and intersectionality: A critique of 'thin privilege' in Fat Studies
AN  - 1891754345
AB  - With the rise of 'globesity', fat activism and Fat Studies have become political players in countering negative stereotypes and the devaluation of fat bodies. Both groups are diverse, yet share a common goal to celebrate and/or accept fatness, and challenge practices and discourses that reinforce 'normal' bodies (such as diets, 'fat talk' and medicalisation). In this article, we reflect on our engagement with a Fat Studies conference, and critically interrogate the assumptions that underlie this particular space. It is not surprising that fat activists and Fat Studies scholars bring different ideologies to the table, yet the differences between them have not been adequately scrutinised or theorised. Drawing upon Linda Alcoff's feminist philosophy, we examine how identity politics and intersectional perspectives are both used in fat activism, yet have the effect of creating unresolved tensions between singular and multiple embodied identities. We argue that an identity politics approach (exemplified through embodied visibility and declarations of 'thin privilege') has the potential to create boundaries for policing and exclusion, and is thus at odds with the much broader axes identified by intersectorial approaches. Rather than dismiss the power of identity politics, we argue for a careful reframing of the relationship between identity politics and intersectionality in fat activism and Fat Studies. We suggest that unexamined contradictions that arise from this mismatch may be counterproductive to the important subversive aims of the movement.

T1  - Informal Training Experiences and Explicit Bias against African Americans among Medical Students
AN  - 2424651982
AB  - Despite the widespread inclusion of diversity-related curricula in U.S. medical training, racial disparities in the quality of care and physician bias in medical treatment persist. The present study examined the effects of both formal and informal experiences on non-African American medical students’ (N = 2,922) attitudes toward African Americans in a longitudinal study of 49 randomly selected U.S. medical schools. We assessed the effects of experiences related to medical training, accounting for prior experiences and attitudes. Contact with African Americans predicted positive attitudes toward African Americans relative to white people, even beyond the effects of prior attitudes. Furthermore, students who reported having witnessed instructors make negative racial comments or jokes were significantly more willing to express racial bias themselves, even after accounting for the effects of contact. Examining the effects of informal experiences on racial attitudes may help develop a more effective medical training environment and reduce racial disparities in healthcare.

T1  - How do Migrant Workers Respond to Labour Abuses in "Local Sweatshops"?
AN  - 1865658128
AB  - This article aims to provide empirical evidence on understanding how migrant workers' responses to labour exploitation in low-wage economies are articulated. Inspired by the low levels of conflict among workers in small urban sweatshops in Italy and Argentina, we ask ourselves what contextual and subjective factors prevent workers from organising collectively. Here we argue that in order to understand the nature of their responses, it is necessary to consider not only the organisation of the labour process, but also the class divisions within migrant communities. We also bring in briefly the role of the state in (mis)regulating migrant labour exploitation. We conclude by showing that workers' responses are highly individualised and that community leaders with economic interests in sweatshop economies may play a role in securing their continuation by channelling the workers' responses towards the defence of the "ethnic economy".

T1  - Gold mining, indigenous land claims and conflict in Guyana's hinterland
AN  - 1939227444
AB  - In recent decades, Guyana's gold-rich interior has been the location of numerous, mostly low-latent, conflicts. In each case, groups of Afro and Indo-Guyanese originating from the country's coastal cities and towns--popularly referred to as 'Coast Landers'--have clashed with indigenous Amerindians over control of remote parcels of land containing gold deposits. Each appears to have a valid argument in support of its position: the former contend that they are legally entitled to work these lands, having obtained the requisite permits from the central government to mine for gold, whilst the latter maintain that such decisions constitute a breach of their human rights, and draw attention to key legislation in support of their case. This article broadens understanding of the dynamics of these conflicts by reflecting more critically on the arguments presented by both parties. Drawing heavily on research conducted in Mahdia-Campbelltown, one location where frictions between Coast Lander mining groups and Amerindians are particularly serious, it is argued that these disputes are not about control of gold riches as is popularly believed but rather a product of deeply-rooted ethnic tensions between these parties.

T1  - Twilight of the Proletariat: Reading Critical Balkanology as Liberal Ideology: Review of Central European Affairs
AN  - 1921412707
AB  - Critical Balkanology is a sub-discipline of Central and East European Studies that deconstructs and renders arbitrary the claims of ethnic nationalisms and Western "colonial" representations of the Balkans. Yet, this critical and nominally anti-racist project is parasitic on a hegemonic Euro-Atlantic liberal ideology in that it cannot see beyond the singular individual as victim and vanguard, thereby obscuring and/or effacing an awareness of class inequality. Tomislav Longinović's Vampire Nation: Violence as Cultural Imaginary (2011) is emblematic of this project. I place this text under an immanent critique and a contrapuntal reading as an example of how one can rescue class consciousness from this literature and push the limits of its politics while, in Longinović's case, reading it against the socioeconomic contradictions of post-Milošević Serbia. Longinović's tracing of the vampire metaphor as a way of understanding the consumptive nature of both ethnic nationalism and Western imperialism reveals a politics that stigmatizes Serbia's plebeian history in favour of a Westernized and urban middle class youth cult of techno-culture, rock music, and the disembodied voices of (male) intellectuals - a form of epistemic violence that parallels processes of privatization, social cleansing, and class oppression consuming the bodies of (sub)proletarians.

T1  - Is STEM running out of steam for Asian Americans? College admissions officers' perceptions of applicants
AN  - 1868236806
AB  - While many people view Asian Americans as 'model minorities' who excel in math, science and music, they are also negatively stereotyped as nerdy and unsociable. Research has shown that Asian Americans have to outperform other races academically to receive equal consideration by colleges. This study is the first to test whether this bias is directed towards all Asian Americans or only those who fit the model minority stereotype. The present experiment investigates the effect of race and stereotypes on perceptions of students in the college admission process. College admission officers (N = 79) were randomly assigned to view a shortened version of a college application. The participants rated the student whose application they saw according to likelihood of being accepted into college, social competence, academic competence and contribution to a college's diversity. The stereotypical Asian American student was perceived to be significantly less likely to be accepted into college and had a lower perceived social competence than the other three students. Additionally, students who participated in counter-stereotypical Asian activities were perceived as being more likely to be accepted, more socially competent and to contribute more diversity than students who participated in stereotypical Asian activities. A multiple regression revealed that social competence was the only significant predictor of likely acceptance. This study suggests that rather than all Asian American students being disadvantaged in the college admissions process, it is only those who fit common stereotypes who are affected.

T1  - "My Honor Will Be Erased": Working-Class Women, Purchasing Power, and the Perils of Modernity in Urban Nepal
AN  - 1847546680
AB  - Urbanization, the expansion of capitalist markets, and the rapid democratization of the political sphere have precipitated enormous shifts in Nepal's social organization, including how women from diverse caste and ethnic backgrounds participate in the newly monetized economy as laborers and consumers. Young working-class Nepali women have unprecedented access to disposable income. With their wages, they enjoy expanded purchasing power and, through consumption practices, craft their identity as modern commodity consumers. At the same time, as participants in the public sphere of wage labor, working-class women are deeply aware of the social risks they are taking as publicly visible women. These risks include being labeled "over-modern" and "open" -- descriptors with undertones of sexual immorality. "Open" women are subject to gossip, ridicule, and other forms of gender-based social and sexual violence. Drawing on twenty months of ethnographic research conducted with one group of young working-class women -- female trekking guides -- I contextualize my informants' experiences of wage earning and consumption. I explore the justifications my informants use to legitimate the pleasure they take in commodity consumption as well as the strategies they deploy to counter negative stereotypes associated with their status as public women. I end with a discussion of anxiety as a productive force in the lives of my informants and show how tensions between the pleasures of purchasing power and the perils of being labeled "over-modern" bracket their experiences of day-to-day living.

T1  - Engaging with diversity: Framing multiculturalism as a learning opportunity reduces prejudice among high White American identifiers
AN  - 1891309305
AB  - Multiculturalism (i.e., acknowledgment and appreciation of diversity), despite its positive consequences, is often met with resistance among majority group members, particularly those whose race/ethnicity is central to their self-concept. Building upon findings that multiculturalism lowers White Americans' prejudice when presented as an abstract relative to concrete concept, we tested whether and when even concrete forms of multiculturalism can improve intergroup attitudes. Across two experiments, highly identified White Americans exhibited less racial prejudice when induced to view multiculturalism as a concrete learning opportunity than as a concrete set of policies (Study 1) or a concrete ideology more generally (Study 2). This effect was mediated by high identifiers' increased perceptions that diversity benefits themselves and society as a whole. Implications for prejudice reduction and fostering majority group members' active involvement in diversity-relevant issues, as well as the applicability of our studies to other cultural contexts, are discussed.

T1  - "You Can't Give a Syringe with Unity": Rwandan Responses to the Government's Single Recategorization Policies
AN  - 1852958737
AB  - Rwanda's postgenocide government has implemented policies that resemble social psychological models of single recategorization, banning references to ethnic groups and replacing these with a superordinate, Rwandan identity. While social psychological research suggests problems with this approach, little is known about how people make sense of recategorization in the aftermath of ethnic conflict and genocide. The present interview study investigates the responses of 56 Rwandans to these single recategorization policies. Despite strong societal pressures, a variety of positions were apparent--showing how people actively construe categories, and the complexity of single recategorization in real-world settings. The findings suggest several novel insights and policy implications, including the need for context-specific approaches, utilitarian reasons for single recategorization, the role of malleability of identities in promoting social recategorization, and the potential use of recategorization models as transitional measures in postconflict societies.

T1  - Talking to Latino Children About Race, Inequality, and Discrimination: Raising Families in an Anti-Immigrant Political Environment
AN  - 1819287054
AB  - Objective: The passage of several anti-immigrant policies has been linked to heightened levels of discrimination for the Latino immigrant community. Many children are likely to be affected, considering that 10 million children in the United States are children of Latino immigrants. Informed by the ecodevelopmental framework, this study examines parent-child interactions concerning race, inequality, and discrimination. Method: This study uses in-depth qualitative interviews with Latino immigrant parents (N = 54), a majority of them women (79.6%, SD = 6.47) with on average 3 children (SD = 1.42). Constructivist grounded theory methods are used to complete the analysis. A constant comparative approach is used while completing initial, focused, and axial coding. Multiple steps are taken to support the trustworthiness of the study. Results: Findings indicate that parents use a range of messages to support their children as they are faced with issues of race, inequality, and discrimination. Parents (a) comfort their children to ensure their safety; (b) educate their children about nativity and documentation status; (c) encourage children to adapt and expect discrimination; (d) reinforce negative stereotypes; (e) model advocacy and advise children to advocate for their themselves and others; (f) build children's ethnic pride; and (g) talk to their children about the value of diversity and empathy. Conclusion: Consistent with the ecodevelopmental framework, Latino parents play a critical role in children's understanding and processing of their experiences with discrimination. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed.

T1  - Plastic fantastic? Problematising post-feminism in erotic retailing in England
TT  - ¿Fantástico plástico? La problematización del post-feminismo en la venta de productos eróticos en Inglaterra; [...][FULLWIDTH QUESTION MARK][...]
AN  - 1808750200
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted)
Sex shops in England have traditionally been perceived as masculinised consumption spaces, located at the margins of both the city and the clock (in decaying urban zones, hidden from view and frequented under the cover of darkness). Recent decades have witnessed the emergence of fashion conscious and female-orientated 'erotic boutiques', keen to disassociate themselves away from negative stereotypical representations of sex shops, through marketing themselves as stylish, fun, acceptable and safe, and, above all, empowering spaces for women to explore their sexuality. This article considers how erotic boutiques offer a post-feminist sexual address to women through claims of female empowerment, an embrace of traditional femininity and an endorsement of the aestheticisation of the female body. More specifically, I explore the post-feminist tensions between female sexual subjectivity and objectivity, by unpacking, and reflecting on, the relations between erotic boutiques and the space of the body. This is achieved by an analysis of how the products and services (and how they are marketed and displayed) promote idealised representations of female bodily sexual pleasure, adornment and knowledge that can apparently be obtained by the consumption of specific products and commodified sexual knowledges. The article consequently considers and questions a seeming inextricable entwinement of post-feminist sexual empowerment with sexual consumerism.

T1  - Population Growth and its Implications for Global Security
AN  - 1821055936
AB  - Between 2015 and 2050 world population is projected to increase by nearly 2.5 billion, rising from 7.3 billion to an estimated 9.8 billion. The vast majority of that projected increase -- an estimated 97 percent -- will occur in the developing world. Demography is not destiny, but population growth in the developing world is a challenge-multiplier. In recent decades, notable gains have been made in reducing the incidence of hunger and poverty in the world, but progress has been slow in countries with high fertility rates. The nations with the fastest growing populations tend to rank high on global indices of hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, and fragility; and many of these countries face enormous obstacles to economic development in the form of climate change, regional or ethnic conflict, or water scarcity. Most of these countries also have large numbers of unemployed young people between the ages of 15-24, a demographic factor that can contribute to, or exacerbate, political instability and conflict. Unless fertility rates in these countries fall faster than currently anticipated by demographers, many of these countries face an uncertain future. Lack of progress in improving living conditions in these countries could lead to greater political instability and conflict and increase the growing number of refugees and internally displaced persons in the world.

T1  - Biopedagogies and Indigenous knowledge: examining sport for development and peace for urban Indigenous young women in Canada and Australia
AN  - 2015508400
AB  - This paper uses transnational postcolonial feminist participatory action research (TPFPAR) to examine two sport for development and peace (SDP) initiatives that focus on Indigenous young women residing in urban areas, one in Vancouver, Canada, and one in Perth, Australia. We examine how SDP programs that target urban Indigenous young women and girls reproduce the hegemony of neoliberalism by deploying biopedagogies of neoliberalism to 'teach' Indigenous young women certain education and employment skills that are deemed necessary to participate in competitive capitalism. We found that activities in both programs were designed to equip the Indigenous girls and young women with individual attributes that would enhance their chances of future success in arenas valued by neoliberal capitalism: Eurocentric employment, post-secondary education and healthy active living. These forms of 'success' fall within neoliberal logic, where the focus is on the individual being able to provide for oneself. However, the girls and young women we interviewed argued that their participation in the SDP programs would help them change racist and sexist stereotypes about their communities and thereby challenged negative stereotypes. Thus, it is possible that these programs, despite their predominant use of neoliberal logic and biopedagogies, may help to prepare the participants to more successfully negotiate Eurocentric institutions, and through this assist them participants in contributing to social change. Nevertheless, based on our findings, we argue that SDP programs led by Indigenous peoples that are fundamentally shaped by Indigenous voices, epistemologies, concerns and standpoints would provide better opportunities to shake SDP's current biopedagogical foundation. We conclude by suggesting that a more radical approach to SDP, one that fosters Indigenous self-determination and attempts to disrupt dominant relations of power, could have difficulty in attracting the sort of corporate donors who currently play such important roles in the current SDP landscape.

T1  - Biopedagogies and Indigenous knowledge: examining sport for development and peace for urban Indigenous young women in Canada and Australia
AN  - 1805980269
AB  - This paper uses transnational postcolonial feminist participatory action research (TPFPAR) to examine two sport for development and peace (SDP) initiatives that focus on Indigenous young women residing in urban areas, one in Vancouver, Canada, and one in Perth, Australia. We examine how SDP programs that target urban Indigenous young women and girls reproduce the hegemony of neoliberalism by deploying biopedagogies of neoliberalism to 'teach' Indigenous young women certain education and employment skills that are deemed necessary to participate in competitive capitalism. We found that activities in both programs were designed to equip the Indigenous girls and young women with individual attributes that would enhance their chances of future success in arenas valued by neoliberal capitalism: Eurocentric employment, post-secondary education and healthy active living. These forms of 'success' fall within neoliberal logic, where the focus is on the individual being able to provide for oneself. However, the girls and young women we interviewed argued that their participation in the SDP programs would help them change racist and sexist stereotypes about their communities and thereby challenged negative stereotypes. Thus, it is possible that these programs, despite their predominant use of neoliberal logic and biopedagogies, may help to prepare the participants to more successfully negotiate Eurocentric institutions, and through this assist them participants in contributing to social change. Nevertheless, based on our findings, we argue that SDP programs led by Indigenous peoples that are fundamentally shaped by Indigenous voices, epistemologies, concerns and standpoints would provide better opportunities to shake SDP's current biopedagogical foundation. We conclude by suggesting that a more radical approach to SDP, one that fosters Indigenous self-determination and attempts to disrupt dominant relations of power, could have difficulty in attracting the sort of corporate donors who currently play such important roles in the current SDP landscape.

T1  - Financial Strain, Major Family Life Events, and Parental Academic Involvement During Adolescence
AN  - 1787037122
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Academic Success: Peer, Parent, Teacher, Ethnic, Community, and Genetic Influences 
Parental academic involvement--whether through school participation and communication, or supervision and assistance at home--often has been cited as a way to enhance academic achievement. Yet, little is known about how the financial and life pressures faced by families can compromise parents' ability to become involved in their adolescents' education. In the current study, these dynamics were examined among Mexican-origin families, who often may face challenging financial and familial circumstances, and whose students may have more difficulty in secondary school. Parents of Mexican-origin ninth and tenth grade students from two high schools in Los Angeles (N = 428; 50 % female) completed quantitative interviews. The results revealed that financial strain predicted less involvement at school, and major family life events predicted less involvement at home, even after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Moreover, both of the associations between parental stress and parental academic involvement were mediated by lower levels of relationship quality between parents and adolescents, but not by conflict within the parent-adolescent dyad or parental depressive and somatic symptoms. The findings suggest that stress may limit parents' ability to become involved their adolescents' education, and highlight the importance of understanding family dynamics when examining parental academic involvement among Mexican-origin families.

T1  - CoBRAS as a Predictor of Attitudes toward Redistributing Resources to Improve Predominantly Black Schools
AN  - 1841956066
AB  - Research supports the use of the Color-Blind Racism Attitudes Scale (CoBRAS) as a measure of color-blindness, but relatively little is known about whether it is predictive of policy attitudes. This study adds to that literature by investigating the extent to which CoBRAS predicts attitudes toward resource redistribution as a method of addressing the Black-White achievement gap. Structural equation modeling performed on data from 215 participants revealed that CoBRAS is a useful tool in predicting attitudes toward redistributing resources to benefit predominantly Black schools, even after controlling for social dominance and attributions for "the gap. " Researchers are encouraged to continue exploring the properties of CoBRAS to achieve a thorough understanding of its empirical potential.

T1  - From Territorial to Temporal Ambitions: The Politics of Time and Imagination in Massive Multiplayer Online Forecasting Games
AN  - 2342343469
AB  - In 2010, the online forecasting game Urgent Evoke, produced by Jane McGonigal, former Director of Gaming at the Institute for the Future and the World Bank Institute, elicited praise by gaming critics as a model for “serious gaming.” The game promised to show how players could think about long-term solutions to urgent social problems like hunger, poverty, conflict, and climate change using the African continent as its test bed. Players imagined future temporal outcomes through remixing media. In a qualitative analysis of actual game play during the real-time introduction of the game for teaching organizational communication, Evoke became a platform for student inquiry for questioning its underlying design as an expansion of territorial and temporal conquest. Evoke served as a springboard for building a literacy of critical time among students in accessing stakeholder power to determine the future. Students challenged, created, and followed the cultural capital of promissory visions in circulation. The curriculum design for using serious and forecasting games like Evoke must account for the conceptual development of what Sarah Sharma calls critical time or chronopolitics, a hidden politics of time that shapes our approaches to cultures, organizations, and innovation. By placing spatial and temporal dynamics center stage, we investigated how serious games produce a chronopolitics of time differentiating among people by class and ethnicity. Alternative Reality Games offer the potential for building a literacy of critical forecasting time to understand the practices for anticipating the future as temporal networks of power, different and uneven.

T1  - The Metaphors on International Intervention: A Discourse Analysis of the Sri Lankan English Newspaper Editorials
AN  - 2188118505
AB  - The metaphors used in the Sri Lankan English newspaper editorials during the peace talk time (2001-2007) commenting on the international intervention in the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict reveal community based ideological and attitudinal positions of the newspapers published in Sri Lanka. Metaphors literally contribute to our understanding of reality. The frames and scripts used for legitimization and de-legitimization of the issues related to international intervention and facilitation in the peace talk, peace process and monitoring the ceasefire bring out certain realities comfortable to certain people, groups or communities. The binary positions projected in the editorial discourse are identified. Discourse constitutes power in constructing ideational, textual and interpersonal constructs which are ideological. It can transmit and even legitimize power in society. During the peace talk time, the editorials are expected to develop constructive discourse on conflict intervention and resolution to make a positive impact on legislative changes but they display ‘ethno-nationalist’ tendencies. The study analyzes whether the media has been a part of the problem or a part of the solution. Since newspaper and editorial discourses are the constructions of journalists and editors of the elites, the biased ideologies are “hidden or subtle in expressions and often revealed in mild forms”. This study takes up selected editorials of the Sri Lankan English newspapers which appeared mainly during the Memorandum of Understanding between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eezham during that period, to relate the discourse themes with rhetorical and metaphorical features.

T1  - Balance Without Equality: Just World Beliefs, the Gay Affluence Myth, and Support for Gay Rights
AN  - 1700673227; 201525953
AB  - The harmfulness of negative stereotypes toward gay and lesbian people has been established, but the effect of positive stereotypes has not been thoroughly examined. Gay and lesbian Americans continue to struggle against interpersonal and institutionalized discrimination, yet many people do not see them as a politically disadvantaged group, and voter support for gay rights has been inconsistent and somewhat unpredictable. Drawing on previous research regarding reactions to disadvantaged and advantaged targets, we examined the social cognitive underpinnings of support for gay rights. After accounting for general anti-gay attitudes and degree of religious affiliation, we found that global endorsement of just world beliefs negatively predicted support for gay rights, and that this effect was mediated by an inclination to perceive discrimination against gay and lesbian people as less of an issue in American society. Additionally, we found that endorsement of the 'gay affluence' stereotype also negatively predicted support of gay rights, particularly among non-student adults, and that this effect was moderated by character beliefs about gay and lesbian people pertaining to wealth-deservingness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Fate of Obamacare: Racial Resentment, Ethnocentrism and Attitudes about Healthcare Reform
AN  - 1616081986
AB  - Health care has been a contentious issue in American politics for decades, and scholars are beginning to understand the reasons behind public support for, and opposition to, healthcare reform. Using national survey data, we measure the impact of various racial attitudes, including Racial Resentment and Ethnocentrism, on white support for healthcare reform. We measure participants' attitudes across a range of important dimensions of healthcare reform and examine a randomized experiment with a control group that frames legislation as "recent" healthcare reform and a treatment condition that frames legislation as "President Obama's" healthcare reform. The findings demonstrate that racial attitudes and Ethnocentrism continue to play a role in both support and opposition to healthcare reform.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - From Blackface to Beulah: Subtle Subversion in Early Black Sitcoms
AN  - 1748865577; 201600702
AB  - In 1965 the actor/comedian Bill Cosby made television history as the first African American to star in a dramatic series produced by a major network. No doubt inspired by the successes of the Civil Rights Movement, NBC's decision to air I Spy had broken with a decade old tradition to severely curtail and/or altogether omit black actors from television. This exclusionary practice had been precipitated by the economic pressures applied by both blacks and whites as they boycotted the sponsors of what they deemed to be objectionable depictions of black life. While black leaders and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) pleaded for more 'positive' depictions of African Americans, Southern white supremacists rejected anything but the most stereotypical and retrogressive interpretation of blacks. Television's early black actresses operated within this context and were challenged with the seemingly impossible task of imparting negatively stereotyped roles - the only ones available to African Americans between 1951 and 1954 - with dignity. Through their interpretations Ethel Waters, Hattie McDaniel, Ernestine Wade, and Amanda Randolph were able to create layered characters that appealed to both whites and blacks. These talented actresses utilized nuance and body language to create a subtext that helped to alleviate the racist content of period programs, and thus communicated more to their diverse audiences than a cursory evaluation of their lines might suggest. Although the major television networks responded to the complaints by simply refusing to cast African American leads, the subtle acts of subversion employed by the female characters on Beulah and Amos 'n' Andy helped to humanize the black experience and challenged racial dogma, in turn making the comedic careers of subsequent African American pioneers possible.

T1  - Sexist Behavior Undermines Women's Performance in a Job Application Situation
AN  - 1520331033; 201420698
AB  - Can sexist behavior in a job application context threaten women and cause them to underperform on a subsequent cognitive ability test? In a simulated job interview, 46 women and 46 men -- undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Heidelberg, Germany -- were confronted with either sexist (dominant and physically close) behavior by a male interviewer or non-sexist (friendly and neutral) behavior by the same confederate. Participants then solved math items and language-related items from a German standard intelligence test. In accordance with our hypothesis, the results indicated that female participants in the sexist condition performed significantly worse on the mathematical test than female participants in the control condition. The performance of female participants on the language-related test and male participants on both the math and language-related tests did not differ by experimental condition. After the sexist job interview, women's impaired performance, occurring on the math items only (i.e., specific to the domain in which women are negatively stereotyped), suggests an influence of psychological and interpersonal processes on seemingly objective test outcomes.

T1  - Class Struggle and Religious Difference in the Workplace: The Politics of Representing Islam in Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche's Dernier maquis (2008)
AN  - 1992366925
AB  - The aim of this article is to explore how the 2008 film Dernier maquis, by Maghrebi-French director Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche, attempts to correct a perceived absence in French cinema of Islam by focusing its narrative on the conflict that ensues between Mao, a French Muslim boss, and his Muslim immigrant workers, when Mao unilaterally appoints an imam to preside over the mosque he has constructed for his workers in a pallet yard located on a remote industrial estate on the outskirts of Paris. The article analyzes how, in Dernier maquis, Ameur-Zaïmeche combines issues of class struggle and exclusion of the immigrant worker in contemporary France, with the potentially problematic place of ethnic and religious difference within the Republican nation.

T1  - Measurement Equivalence Across Subnational Groups: An Analysis of the Conception of Nationhood in Switzerland
AN  - 1559007343; 201432592
AB  - Because of their higher status, members of national majorities (e.g., linguistic, ethnic, or religious) are likely to develop a stronger sense of ownership of the nation than members of national minorities (Sidanius, Feshbach, Levin, & Pratto, 1997), which is reflected in a stronger attachment to the nation as a whole (e.g., Staerkle, Sidanius, Green, & Molina, 2010). Accordingly, members of national majorities are expected to hold a stricter conception of nationhood, that is, to be stricter regarding who should or should not belong to the national community (Kunovich, 2009). Based on data from two large surveys (European Social Survey [ESS] 2002 and International Social Survey Programme [ISSP] 2003), the present study tests this expectation by comparing conceptions of nationhood across the two largest linguistic subnational groups in Switzerland. However, observed differences between the groups can either reflect substantive differences or result from measurement artifacts, as distinctive features of the subnational groups (e.g., different languages; Davidov & De Beuckelaer, 2010) may impact the measurement itself. Therefore, measurement equivalence should be tested for before undertaking substantive mean comparisons (e.g., Steenkamp & Baumgartner, 1998). Although measurement equivalence testing is frequently carried out in cross-national studies (e.g., Davidov, 2009; Reeskens & Hooghe, 2010), it is rarely established when comparing data drawn from distinct national subgroups within countries (see, however, Billiet, 2003; Billiet, Maddens, & Beerten, 2003). Thus, this study has both a substantive and a methodological rationale: Beyond testing the assumption that members of national majorities hold a stricter conception of nationhood than members of national minorities, it aims at illustrating the necessary steps of analysis -- using exploratory and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses -- for conducting valid latent mean comparisons across subnational groups.

T1  - Race, Ideology, and the Tea Party: A Longitudinal Study
AN  - 1371428234
AB  - The Tea Party movement, which rose to prominence in the United States after the election of President Barack Obama, provides an ideal context in which to examine the roles of racial concerns and ideology in politics. A three-wave longitudinal study tracked changes in White Americans’ self-identification with the Tea Party, racial concerns (prejudice and racial identification), and ideologies (libertarianism and social conservatism) over nine months. Latent Growth Modeling (LGM) was used to evaluate potential causal relationships between Tea Party identification and these factors. Across time points, racial prejudice was indirectly associated with movement identification through Whites’ assertions of national decline. Although initial levels of White identity did not predict change in Tea Party identification, initial levels of Tea Party identification predicted increases in White identity over the study period. Across the three assessments, support for the Tea Party fell among libertarians, but rose among social conservatives. Results are discussed in terms of legitimation theories of prejudice, the “racializing” power of political judgments, and the ideological dynamics of the Tea Party.

T1  - The dynamics of ethnic discrimination, identities and outgroup attitudes: A pre-post longitudinal study of ethnic migrants
AN  - 1373428369; 201328406
AB  - This longitudinal study among ethnic migrants from Russia to Finland (N = 127) examined the relationships between anticipated and perceived discrimination, ethnic and national identities, and outgroup attitudes towards the national majority group. The study included one pre-migration and two post-migration assessments. First, associations between the variables studied were tested using a conventional autoregressive sample-level modelling approach. Second, individual trajectories and the associations between the individual-level changes in the variables included in the models were tested. Although there were no sample-level effects over time, there were significant relationships between changes in discrimination and changes in identification and outgroup attitudes at the individual level. The results indicated that changes in perceived discrimination were not reflected in increased ethnic identification. However, participants who perceived higher levels of discrimination after migration than they anticipated before migration were, in the post-migration stage, more likely to disidentify from and to increasingly show negative attitudes towards the national majority group. The study complements previous research by examining the identity and attitudinal reactions to perceived ethnic discrimination starting from the pre-migration stage and highlights the value of incorporating both group and individual perspectives to the research on perceived discrimination.

T1  - 'Walk with your head high': African and African-Caribbean fatherhood, children's mental well-being and social capital
AN  - 1520330914; 201419751
AB  - Objectives. The findings presented in this article were unanticipated and came to light during a study which investigated African and African-Caribbean fathers' views about preventive primary care services. This article reports findings which indicate that African and African-Caribbean fathers strive to enable and protect children's mental well-being and create social, cultural and symbolic forms of capital. It also seeks to identify implications for health and social care policy and practice in England. Design. There is limited literature examining African and African-Caribbean fathers' health experiences in England. Consequently an exploratory research approach was required. This involved nine, in-depth, semi-structured qualitative group interviews undertaken with 46 African and African-Caribbean fathers. The data were analysed thematically using abductive reasoning, informed by Bourdieu's theoretical work. Results. Fathers were striving to enable and protect children's mental well-being through providing authoritative, loving, affectionate fatherhood involving reasoning, good communication and promoting self-esteem. These practices were seen to be necessary if children were to prosper in a harsh social world characterised by structural hazards including racism, negative stereotypes and limited opportunities. The fathers reported their efforts to develop what Bourdieu has termed symbolic, cultural and social capital as means of promoting the mental well-being of their children and the children of others. Conclusion. The implications for theory, future research, public health policy and practice, in relation to the needs of African and African-Caribbean fathers and families, are also discussed, with specific focus on how to realise the potential of African and African-Caribbean fathers' positive contributions to family and community health.

T1  - The Role of Stereotype Threats in Undermining Girls' and Women's Performance and Interest in STEM Fields
AN  - 1081861097; 201238071
AB  - In the present manuscript we draw on the Multi-Threat Framework to explore gender-related math attitudes and how they put girls and women at risk for stereotype threats. Gunderson et al. (2011) detail how negative stereotypes about women's math abilities are transmitted to girls by their parents and teachers, shaping girls' math attitudes and ultimately undermining performance and interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The social psychological phenomenon of stereotype threat complements this approach and demonstrates the additional ways in which gender-related math attitudes undermine girls' and women's interest and performance in STEM domains. Considering the phenomenon of stereotype threat also identifies how stereotypes and other gender-related math attitudes can undermine women's and girls' interest and performance in STEM domains even when women and girls have positive math attitudes.

T1  - Money Can't Buy Me Hygge: Danish Middle-Class Consumption, Egalitarianism, and the Sanctity of Inner Space
AN  - 919903849; 201201804
AB  - In this article, the style of social interaction known as hygge is analyzed as being related to cultural values that idealize the notion of 'inner space' and to other egalitarian norms of everyday life in Scandinavian societies. While commonly experienced as a pleasurable involvement in a social and spatial interior, hygge is also examined as a mode of withdrawal from alienating conditions of modernity. In spite of its egalitarian features, hygge acts as a vehicle for social control, establishes its own hierarchy of attitudes, and implies a negative stereotyping of social groups who are perceived as unable to create hygge. The idea of hygge as a trait of Scandinavian culture is developed in the course of the interpretation, and its limitations are also discussed against ethnographic evidence that comparable spatial and social dynamics unfold in other cultural contexts.

T1  - U.S. Immigration Policy and Immigrant Children's Well-being: The Impact of Policy Shifts
AN  - 881465225; 201117590
AB  - America is built upon a history of immigration; yet current immigration policy and anti-immigrant sentiment negatively affect the vulnerable population of immigrant families and children. Immigrant children face many problems, including economic insecurity, barriers to education, poor health outcomes, the arrest and deportation of family members, discrimination, and trauma and harm to their communities. These areas of immigrant children's economic and material well-being are examined in light of restrictive and punitive immigration policies at the federal and local level. Implications for social policy reform, such as decriminalization, are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Yes We Can!: Prejudice Reduction Through Seeing (Inequality) and Believing (in Social Change)
AN  - 1910818168
AB  - We investigated the effect of differential perceived efficacy to reduce racial inequality (in the context of increased awareness of illegitimate in-group advantages) on White Americans' intergroup attitudes and antidiscrimination behavior. White American university students read a passage describing the underrepresentation of African Americans in their university's faculty and then wrote letters to the university administration in support of appointing more African Americans to the faculty. We experimentally varied feedback concerning efficacy to change institutional racism. Before writing their letters, participants were told that there was a low, moderate, or high chance that their efforts would be effective. Later in the experiment, participants' perceived efficacy to influence their university system was measured. Intergroup attitudes improved and antidiscrimination actions increased among participants with higher perceived efficacy in comparison with participants with low perceived efficacy. Collective guilt partially mediated the effects of efficacy beliefs on antidiscrimination actions and fully mediated the effects of efficacy beliefs on intergroup attitudes.

T1  - How social experience is related to children's intergroup attitudes
AN  - 743066892; 201043101
AB  - Intergroup attitudes were assessed in 7 and 10 years old European American and African American children from ethnically heterogeneous schools and in 7 and 10 years old European American children from ethnically homogeneous schools in order to test hypotheses about racial biases and judgments regarding cross-race peer interactions (N = 302). Using an Ambiguous Situations Task, the findings revealed that European American children attending homogeneous schools displayed racial bias in their interpretations of ambiguous situations as well as in their evaluations of cross-race friendship. Bias was not found, however, in the interpretations and evaluations of European American or African American children from heterogeneous schools. This study is the first to empirically demonstrate significant and direct relationships between intergroup contact in the school environment and children's intergroup biases as well as judgments about the potential for cross-race friendships.

T1  - Cultural Intimacy and Subversive Disorder: The Politics of Romance in the Republic of Macedonia
AN  - 740962452
AB  - Using the example of intimate relations between ethnic Albanian men and ethnic Macedonian women in the Republic of Macedonia, I explore the utility of Michael Herzfeld's invaluable insights into the interconnections among state power, cultural intimacy, and subversive disorder in states where different groups compete for state power. In these states, the absence of conditions that are conducive to the production of cultural intimacy points to the articulation of the state with socially constructed and embedded understandings of what might count as just, proper, and legitimate official response to violations of moral canon.
