T1  - Love thy neighbour? Religion and ethnoracial boundaries among second-generation West African youth
AN  - 2696429385
AB  - Immigration scholars and religious studies scholars have explored generational changes in religiosity. Less clear is the significance of religion in the lives of Black immigrant second-generation youth. Moreover, while there is research on intraracial boundary-negotiations between Black Americans and Black immigrants in the United States, it is rarely discussed in the context of religion. Drawing on interviews with seventy one second-generation West African teenagers in New York City, this paper explores the role of religion in the integration of Black immigrant second-generation youth. I find that religion is a primary tool through which ethnoracial boundaries are maintained between the children of West African immigrants and their Black American counterparts. I spotlight three means through which religion matters for ethnoracial boundaries: congregational demographics, religious codes of conduct and Islamophobia. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that religion is a key component of second-generation ethnoracial identity-formation.

T1  - Early Adolescents Demonstrate Peer-Network Homophily in Political Attitudes and Values
AN  - 2680546571
AB  - Research on political homophily has almost exclusively focused on adults, and little is known about whether political homophily is present early in life when political attitudes are forming and friendship networks are rapidly changing. We examined political homophily using a social network approach with rural middle school students (N = 213; mean age = 12.5 years; 57% female) from a remote U.S. community. Preregistered analyses indicated that early adolescents were more likely to spend time with people who shared similar political attitudes and values. These effects were most consistent for right-wing authoritarianism, patriotism, and anti-immigration attitudes. Our results show that political homophily is evident at an early age when young people are forming their political beliefs and making decisions about their friendships, suggesting that peer political-attitude socialization may emerge early in life.

T1  - Which Integration Policies Work? The Heterogeneous Impact of National Institutions on Immigrants’ Labor Market Attainment in Europe: IMR
AN  - 2646911240
AB  - Can specific policies support the economic integration of immigrants? Despite the crucial importance of this question, existing evidence is inconclusive. Using data from the European Social Survey, we estimate the effects of integration and anti-discrimination policies, alongside social expenditure and labor market regulation, on the labor market performance of 6,176 non-European immigrants across 23 European countries. We make three contributions: 1) we investigate the distinct role of discrete policy areas for labor market integration outcomes, 2) we allow for heterogeneous effects of policies on immigrants with different characteristics, and 3) we examine immigrants’ occupational attainment while accounting for their selection into employment. We find that immigrants’ employment chances are negatively associated with national levels of expenditure on welfare benefits but positively associated with policies facilitating immigrant access to social security. We also find that labor market rigidity is negatively associated with immigrants’ occupational attainment, but we find little evidence that policies aimed at supporting the transferability of immigrants’ qualifications promote their occupational success. Our results strongly suggest that anti-discrimination policies are important for immigrant economic integration. Yet while these policies are associated with greater occupational success for all female immigrants, they seem to be only positively associated with the occupational attainment of higher-skilled and non-Muslim immigrant men. As this article suggests, anti-discrimination policies can foster immigrants’ labor market success, yet these policies currently fail to reach those who face the strongest anti-immigrant sentiments — that is, unskilled male immigrants and Muslim immigrant men.

T1  - Perspectives of Nursing Students towards Schizophrenia Stigma: A Qualitative Study Protocol
AN  - 2700639243
AB  - Aim: This study aims to explore fourth-year nursing students’ knowledge of schizophrenia and their attitudes, empathy, and intentional behaviours towards people with schizophrenia. Design: This will be a descriptive qualitative study using focus-group interviews. Methods: Fourth-year nursing students on clinical placement in a hospital in Hunan province will be invited for focus-group interviews. Snowball and purposive sampling will be used to recruit nursing students for this study. Five focus-group interviews, each including six participants, will be conducted to explore participants’ knowledge, attitudes, intentional behaviours, and empathy towards schizophrenia. The interview will be conducted through the online Tencent video conference platform and the interview data will be collected through the same platform. All interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim and analysed with the approach of the content analysis supported by NVivo 12. Simultaneous data collection and analysis will be performed, and the interviews will be continued until data saturation is met. The findings of this study will be helpful in developing effective interventions to decrease the stigma toward schizophrenia among nursing students and those who study healthcare disciplines.

T1  - Skin tone bias and the US presidency: The portrayal of a Black incumbent and a Black candidate in newspaper photographs
AN  - 2614034785
AB  - Across cultures, darker skin tone is associated with lower social status. We propose that Black politicians are subject to skin tone biases in US newspapers, with hostile biases resulting in them being portrayed as more dark‐skinned. We hypothesized that such biases occur as a function of negative racial attitudes. We contrast this with an ingroup bias hypothesis, according to which partisans denigrate Black politicians of the other side, but not their own side. The present research evaluated skin tone biases toward President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Dr. Ben Carson, a Republican, in US newspapers. We collected published photographs of President Obama during his first term in office (n = 3781 from 34 newspapers) as well as for Dr. Carson during his 2015–2016 presidential run (n = 1049 from 53 newspapers) from high‐circulation newspapers, which had endorsed Democratic or Republican presidential candidates. Blind coders rated the darkness of Obama's and Carson's skin tone. Multilevel modeling revealed that Democratic‐leaning newspapers portrayed both Obama and Carson as lighter than Republican‐leaning newspapers. Findings did not support a partisan ingroup bias. We conclude that Black politicians of either party are subject to a skin tone bias, where Republican‐leaning newspapers portray them with darker skin tones, regardless of whether they are a Democrat or a Republican.

T1  - Public Spaces and Conflict Transformation: From Mostar's Old Bridge to Its United World College
AN  - 2573030778
AB  - The purpose of this analysis is to offer a complementary approach to top-down ethnic conflict resolution which depends upon international organizations, peace treaties, laws, and political elites. While legal and institutional approaches can possess merit, they neglect the necessity of engaging people and rebuilding community. Further, citizens can perceive a top-down approach as coercive. This paper focuses upon an alternative approach of transformation through the construction of post-war public spaces which create places for interaction and sociability, and thereby possess healing power. We adopt the philosophy of architect Lebbeus Woods, who offered specific principles for the post-war reconstruction of Sarajevo. These guidelines included an acknowledgement of the damage and destruction, but also the necessity of community participation in rebuilding. We also accept the contentions of Keller Easterling who identified the potential coerciveness of 'extrastatecraft', that is structures imposed upon a community from above by the state, or from outside by international organizations. The specific focus of this research is upon Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the work of international organizations and national political leaders ended the military conflict in 1995, but still fails to reconcile the three ethnic groups to a shared future. The method is rooted in comparative political anthropology, which entails an evaluation of processes, agency, and structures, as well as an account for the emotional aspects of identity and politics. Interviews regarding conflict and reconstruction, and ethnographic observations of public spaces are employed. The work concludes that the contributions of the United World College - Mostar contrasts to the relative failure of the reconstruction of the Old Mostar Bridge partially are due to the emphasis of the former on community engagement and inclusion. The results admit the difficulty of post-conflict transformation in ethnically divided systems, but contend that both the process and outcome of community engagement in the reconstruction of public spaces facilitates reconciliation and democratization.

T1  - Out of Place: Race and Color in Jamaican Hotels, 1962–2020
AN  - 2609427717
AB  - Because hotels are a microcosm of society, they offer a useful case study to explore social inequalities, including racial divisions. This article examines the experiences of African-Jamaican hotel workers and guests from independence in 1962 till the present to demonstrate the salience of Jamaica's race and color relations. It argues that hotel workers and guests at times challenged the racialized practices that they experienced but more often refrained from doing so because of their socialization into a longstanding ethos of "Black is nuh good" and exposure to a nationalist ideology that projected a vision of racial harmony. The article also shows that through their responses to claims of racial discrimination in hotels, a variety of stakeholders, including tourist organizations, failed to challenge the island's racial hierarchy which placed Whites on top, light-skinned Jamaicans in the middle, and dark-skinned Jamaicans at the bottom.

T1  - A Macrolevel Study of Police Killings at the Intersection of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender
AN  - 2524155748
AB  - We investigate macrolevel sources of police use of fatal force at the intersection of race, ethnicity, and gender. Focusing on 580 U.S. counties from 2013 to 2018, we build a unique dataset and analyze whether violent crime, social disorganization, and racial conflict indicators predict police killings among six victim subgroups of Black, Hispanic, and White men and women. Regression results show that violent crime—and social disorganization, albeit less consistently—is positively associated with police killings of men, irrespective of race/ethnicity, and Hispanic women while having no significant impact on Black or White women. We find nuanced evidence that racial conflict shapes police use of fatal force across all six racial-ethnic-gender subgroups. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings.

T1  - Transformed by contested digital spaces? Social media and Ukrainian diasporic ‘selves’ in the wake of the conflict with Russia
AN  - 2509092646
AB  - The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had a profound effect not only on the warring countries but also on diasporas that are related to them. Bringing together theories of diasporic identities and new media, this paper explores how Ukrainian diasporic ‘selves’ are affected by the ongoing conflict with the focus on the role of social media in the formation of their national and ethnic identities. With a series of in‐depth interviews conducted in Europe and North America, this study identifies the functions of social media in diasporic self‐understanding, representation of national culture and online commemoration and mourning. The findings reveal that social media provide diasporic subjects with a space for the negotiation and performance of ethnic and national identities. Within this space, however, they experience ongoing contestation that makes ‘new’ diaspora members more prone to relate to the radicalised discourses on national history, explanations of the conflict and Ukrainian monolingualism.

T1  - Cold War, state-building and social change: perspectives from two Southeast Asian borderlands
AN  - 2492472518
AB  - This article analyzes two key frontlines during the Cold War, border areas in the provinces of Savannakhet (central Laos) and Nakhon Phanom (northeastern Thailand), adjacent to the Lao-Vietnamese and Thai-Lao borders, respectively. We investigate the distinct transformative experiences of war and revolution on members of the same ethnic minority – the Phutai – in both locations. The wartime trajectories of these populations diverged significantly, partly because their territories experienced very different pre-Cold War histories. As a consequence, Phutai in Thailand moved through homogeneous ethnic space between Thailand and Laos. In contrast, the Phutai in Laos, hemmed in by political, topographic, and ethnic boundaries, contributed to the building of a communist proto-state. The Phutai were confronted by different communist projects, which also shaped their distinct revolutionary experiences: the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) boosted ethnic minorities’ resistance against the Thai state’s nationalist ideology, while the Lao revolutionary movement facilitated ethnic minorities’ social mobility within the Pathet Lao apparatus. Whether through confrontation in Thailand or accommodation in Laos, Phutai in both locations played active roles in the multi-layered history of the region.

T1  - Mythmaking, Identity Formation and Ethnic Nationalism in Post-colonial Nigeria Through the Lens of Yoruba and Igbo Nationalism
AN  - 2487343110
AB  - Numerous accounts blame colonialism for the challenges to stability in multiethnic post-colonial states in Africa. The post-colonial state it is said, disrupted the homogeneous ethnic society, thereby sparking an intractable conflict between the two. One implication then, is the inevitability of conflict and instability, with suggestion of a return to default precolonial arrangement, or an “original position”, to disentangle the diverse ethnic identities artificially lumped together. Another argument seeks to leverage on the constructedness of ethnic identities as a basis for dismissing them and privileging the post-colonial state over its constituents. I problematise these arguments from both historical and philosophical viewpoints. Using the Yoruba and Igbo ethnic groups of Nigeria as fodder, I argue that mythmaking, though primordial, plays a significant role that is both constructivist and instrumental in the identity (re)construction process of ethnic groups. I conclude that social cohesion in post-colonial states requires a political framework that manages diversity through a free, other-regarding mode of dialogue as well as recognition of group rights, in a way that makes both the ethnic group and the state stable, yet open to constant renegotiation.

T1  - Migration, Corruption, and Ideological Centrism: Explanations of Anti-Establishment Attitudes in the Czech Republic
AN  - 2541391952
AB  - Although the Czech Republic has experienced an unprecedented rise of anti-establishment political parties in recent decades, a systematic examination of anti-establishment attitudes among the public is still missing from the scholarly literature. This paper tests different explanations for anti-establishment attitudes among the voting population, working with the concepts of anti-political establishment parties, populism, and taking into account the specific national context. Using original data from the 2017 Czech National Election Study (N = 919), we show that anti-establishment attitudes among the Czech public stem from feelings of low political efficacy, the perceived salience of corruption, and anti-immigration attitudes. These results demonstrate that researchers need to consider contextual specifics, including the nature of diverse anti-establishment actors, when searching for the causes of anti-establishment attitudes in a particular country or region.

T1  - Exclusion of Muslims in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. A Comparative Analysis of Anti-Muslim Attitudes in France, Norway, Poland and Czech Republic
AN  - 2502909219
AB  - There are worrying signs of rising intolerance towards Muslim immigrants in the majority of European societies. We use data from the 2014/2015 wave of European Social Survey to analyse negative attitudes toward Muslim immigrants in France, Norway, Poland and the Czech Republic. Results of the analyses reveal that both levels and determinants of the anti-Muslim attitudes vary greatly. The levels are highest in Czech Republic and Poland, the two countries that have a very low Muslim population. Nevertheless, contact with immigrants reduces hostility toward Muslims also in these two countries. We find that theoretical approaches commonly used in studies of anti-immigrant attitudes are better suited to explain negative attitudes in Western European than in Eastern European countries. We argue that future research on hostility toward immigrants in Europe should focus more on Eastern European countries, as attitudes toward immigrants in several of these are worryingly negative.

T1  - The relational legacies of colonialism: peace education and reconciliation in Rwanda
AN  - 2533582816
AB  - This article argues that decolonising educational undertakings is a difficult task, even when the ambitions to apply decolonising approaches are clearly articulated. Our case analysis of two contemporary master’s in peace education programmes in Rwanda, that explicitly focus on reconciliation, shows evidence of limited capacity by the educators to decolonise them. We draw from semi-structured interviews with students and teachers, as well as text analysis of syllabuses, course guides, etc, and demonstrate that access for all societal groups to the programmes is restricted: the extent of decolonisation of the education itself, including alternative narratives of the conflict history as well as the conceptualisation of ethnic ‘identity’ within peace education, is still limited. These master of arts programmes thus preserve colonial legacies and contribute to maintain historical hierarchical relations between the Hutu and Tutsi groups in the country.

T1  - Centralised–decentralisation: State program of poverty reduction for ethnic minorities in Vietnam’s northern upland region
AN  - 2469843596
AB  - Building on ethnographic fieldwork in Vietnam’s northern upland region, this article uses the case of state programs of poverty reduction for the country’s ethnic minorities to add insights to scholarly understandings of the composition and workings of socialist states in today’s Asia. Scholars have widely rejected the idea of Asian socialist states as monolithic, totalising entities in favour of seeing those states as internally divided. However, they have mostly examined how Asian socialist states are divided vertically into the central government and local authorities, which either manipulate central policies for local interests or side with villagers to defy central superiors. The approach leaves the central government relatively intact as a unified, coherent whole. This article argues that the Vietnamese state is equally divided at the central level by documenting ethnographically the striking lack of coordination and synchronisation amongst central agencies responsible for implementing poverty reduction programs. This dysfunction is caused by what I term ‘centralised–decentralisation’, meaning that each of those central agencies has remarkable autonomy to decide how to implement the programs assigned to them, even in ways in conflict with other central state organisations.

T1  - A Successive Threat Theory of Police Expenditures
AN  - 2435148598
AB  - Ethnic succession theory is concerned with the process and consequences of racial and ethnic migration into and out of cities. Minority threat theory is a branch of conflict theory that is concerned with the extent to which racial and ethnic minorities are perceived as threatening to the powerful. In this article, we propose a blend of these theories called successive threat theory which posits that racial and ethnic groups are perceived as threatening when they first move into a city, but as they assimilate, the perceived threat dissipates. The primary contribution of this theory is the previously undeveloped and untested notion that different minority groups may serve as threats in different time periods. Using time series analysis of annual data on Chicago from 1893 to 1965, we find support for the theory.

T1  - Everyday peace capture: Nationalism and the dynamics of peace after violent conflict
AN  - 2376599627
AB  - Nationalism is arguably one of the most detrimental peace‐breaking factors in conflict‐affected societies. This article examines how ethno‐nationalist elites, subterranean movements, and ordinary people can become blockages to sustainable peace and reconciliation after violent conflict. It argues that peacebuilding and state‐building imposed from outside as conflict transformation approaches without acceptable peace settlement and resolute solution of the disputes among parties in conflict risk enabling the co‐optation of power‐sharing arrangements by ethno‐nationalist elites, contestation of peace and reconciliation by subterranean mono‐ethnic movements, and the occurrence of vernacular peace‐breaking acts. This negative mutation of nationalism not only harms peace, justice, and development but also undermines the rights and needs of distinct identity groups. Under these conditions, escaping the nationalism trap in conflict‐affected societies requires seeking political change through post‐ethnic politics and reconciliation through everyday pacifist acts undertaken by the affected communities themselves. The article draws on Kosovo to illustrate empirically the dynamics of peace‐breaking and practices of everyday nationalism. It seeks to bridge debates on nationalism and post‐conflict peacebuilding and offer alternative pathways for rethinking strategies of peace in divided societies.

T1  - Color‐Conscious Multicultural Mindfulness Training in the Counseling Field
AN  - 2373623049
AB  - The Color‐Conscious Multicultural Mindfulness (CCMM) training focuses on addressing intercultural relationship ruptures, individual inequity, and systemic disparities. In this randomized control study, the authors examined the CCMM training effectiveness with 39 prelicensed counselors and counseling students using repeated measures analyses of covariance. Participants reported statistically significant changes in multicultural competence; mindfulness; and color‐blind racial attitudes related to privilege, institutional discrimination, and blatant racism. Implications for counselor training practices and future research are provided.

T1  - ‘Art is my language’: Afghan cultural production challenging Islamophobic stereotypes
AN  - 2355230950
AB  - Afghans and Afghanistan have, since September 11, risen to prominence in Western popular imagination as a land of tradition, tribalism and violence. Afghan women are assumed to be silent, submissive, and terrorised by Afghan men, who are seen as violent patriarchs driven by an uncompromising mediaeval religion. These Islamophobic tropes also inform perceptions of Afghans seeking asylum. In transit, identities are further reduced; asylum seekers lose even a national identity and become a Muslim threat – criminals, terrorists or invaders. These narrative frames permeate political discourse, media, and reports of non-governmental organisations (seeking donor funds to ‘save’ Afghan women). Drawing on fieldwork in Afghanistan and Indonesia, this article looks at how Afghans in Kabul and Indonesia are using art and other forms of cultural production to challenge over-simplified hegemonic narratives in the West, to open spaces for dialogue and expression within their own communities, and to offer a more nuanced account of their own identities.

T1  - Defying state amnesia and memorywars: non-sectarian memory activism in Beirut and Belfast city centres
TT  - Relever le défi de l’amnésie de l’Etat et de la mémoire des guerres: activisme de mémoire non sectaire dans les centres villes de Beyrouth et de Belfast
AN  - 2353604011
AB  - In divided societies that endure intrastate violence, ethnonational groups harness memory to support claims for territorial sovereignty and victimhood. Yet, in peace processes, rather than seek to deal with the legacy of the past, the state often enacts a culture of amnesia to support the logic of political transition, while at the communal level the rival ethnic groups proliferate commemorative practices as part of memorywars. These twin forces – amnesia and ethnicized memory – are also often embedded into post-conflict urban reconstruction, particularly the city centres of the municipal capitals. In this paper, I explore how non-sectarian movements imprint memory into city centre space to challenge the paradoxical forces of forgetting and ethnic communal remembrance. Towards this, I explore the memorywork of non-sectarian groups whose politics transcend established ethnic cleavages, such as trade unionists, movements resisting the privatization of public space and activists mobilizing to protect public services. In this paper I draw on a range of theoretical frameworks, including reflective nostalgia and ghosts and hauntings. Using fieldwork data, I look at non-sectarian memorywork in Beirut and Belfast city centres. These city centres generate contrasting uses and meanings for the local population.

T1  - ‘The majority of our people belong to the working classes’: the Ancient Order of Hibernians in the United States, c.1850–1884
AN  - 2353195481
AB  - The Ancient Order of Hibernians has received attention only in broad studies of class and ethnicity in various US urban centres. This article addresses the class contradictions within the Catholic fraternal and Irish nationalist Hibernian movement during the formative period from around 1850 to 1884. Slightly more affluent Hibernian leaders of the lower middle and middle class sought an accommodation with the Catholic Church and mainstream American society. However, they were frequently hampered by the activities of some sections of their rank and file who continued to operate in the mode of Irish Ribbonism. Violence was deployed by working-class Hibernians in a range of settings, forcing its leaders to denounce bloodshed at their conventions and in the press. The relationship of Hibernianism to physical force Irish republicans, determined to stage a revolt in Ireland, also brought issues around class and violence to light. Despite violence and factionalism among different layers of the movement, Hibernianism, bound together by an ethnic Irish nationalism, Catholicism and elements of militant republicanism, survived and even expanded. It was therefore well placed to capitalize on a steady stream of Irish immigrants and the ‘golden age’ of ethnic societies from the 1890s onwards.

T1  - AN ASSESSMENT OF PRIMARY SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL PROCESSES IN PROMOTING PEACE, HARMONY, AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN GOVERNMENT PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF THE ADDIS ABABA CITY GOVERNMENT, ETHIOPIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHER EDUCATION
AN  - 2478261805
AB  - Ethiopia has been suffering from absence of peace and recurrent conflicts emanating mainly from lack of tolerance of ethnic and religious differences. The purpose of the current study, therefore, is examining the contribution of primary school instructional processes to the prevalence of peace and harmony and reduction of conflicts and the implication it has for teacher education. A descriptive study design using quantitative method was used to study the current situation in schools. The instrument used for the study was questionnaire. Fifty per cent of teachers undergoing in-service education in the Addis Ababa University in the 2017-18 Academic Year were selected as sample using stratified simple random sampling technique. The validity of the instrument was determined using expert opinions and reliability was established by administering the questionnaire to 10 non-participating teachers. Data were collected by the researcher and an assistant and analyzed using mean, percentage and one way ANOVA. Outcomes suggested that the contents of harmony and conflict were not adequately taught and, consequently, lacked sufficient internalization by students Based on the outcomes, it was concluded that the contribution of instructional processes to the prevalence of peace and mitigation of conflicts was not sufficient. It was, thus, recommended that teachers should more extensively teach about the contents of peace and harmony. Moreover, the teacher education curriculum should include these same contents, and teachers need to be trained in the ways they could better teach the concepts and promote cooperation and collaboration among students.

T1  - 'PEOPLE GET KILLED CAUSE OF THERE [THEIR] SKIN. IT CANNOT BE STOPPED': A MIDLANDS CASE STUDY CONSIDERING EXPERIENCES OF RACISM AMONGST PUPILS IN UK SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY
AN  - 2420699188
AB  - This paper investigates UK pupil experience of racism and race-hate-related extremism. World Café research was conducted with 57 school and college pupils aged 14-17 years from a city in the Midlands. The college students mainly reflected upon their secondary school experience. Follow-up questionnaires captured demographics. Just under half of the participants were black and minority ethnic (BAME) pupils, and the rest were white British. Race-hate victimisation ranged from verbal abuse to physical assault, including Islamophobic abuse (including headscarves being removed) and attacks with weapons. Some experiences indicated underlying far-right extremist ideology. Teachers were perceived as favouring white pupils when incidents occurred, with some teachers described as 'racist'. As well as racial hate between white and BAME pupils and between BAME pupils of different origins, inter-school racial conflict was apparent. Schools with higher BAME pupil populations were negatively labelled by pupils from white majority schools. Both BAME and white pupils reported being victims of racial abuse, but BAME victimisation was more apparent in school. Race-hate in schools was reflected in the community and exacerbated through social media communication and media reporting. The British government needs to better address racism and race-related far-right extremism in schools in conjunction with community efforts.

T1  - Contested terrain: explaining divergent patterns of public opinion towards immigration within Europe
AN  - 2376776381
AB  - Mass immigration has become an enduring feature of open, integrated and dynamic economies, with most wealthy post-industrial societies experiencing large migration inflows in recent years (OECD 2017). At the same time, public opposition to immigration has become a major disruptive force in developed democracies, with the emergence of a new family of political parties, the populist radical right (Mudde 2007), who draw their support primarily from voters who oppose immigration (Ivarsflaten 2008). Immigration is economically vital yet politically contentious. Indeed, the present political and academic relevance of this topic area is greater than ever due to the Great Recession of 2008 which resulted in increased anti-immigrant sentiments in several countries (Billiet, Meuleman, and De Witte 2014; Kuntz, Davidov, and Semyonov 2017), large flows of refugees into both old and new immigration countries in Europe, and widespread political repercussions, with views of immigration for example playing a significant role in the British vote to leave the EU.

T1  - Opportunities and challenges doing interdisciplinary research: what can we learn from studies of ethnicity, inequality and place?
AN  - 2328633065
AB  - This Special Issue Introduction critically reflects on the interdisciplinary working project on ethnicity, inequality and place undertaken by the ESRC Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity. We argue that CoDE is uniquely placed to undertake this interdisciplinary work and discuss the extent to which the project pushed thinking beyond that of our disciplinary homes to provide innovative insights into the significance of place for understanding ethnic inequalities and identities. From the six papers in the Special Issue, this Introduction identifies four cross-cutting themes on ethnicity and place: processes of exclusion, the importance of temporal context and change, tensions of scale in the way ethnicity and place together shape experiences and inequalities, and the conceptualisation of ethnicity as dynamic, multi-faceted and socially constructed. We argue that the project has succeeded in terms of cross fertilisation of ideas, challenging ontological and epistemological divisions, and facilitating interdisciplinary learning, adaptation and appreciation. We also identify difficulties that were experienced. We suggest that interdisciplinary ideas flourish in an environment where they can fail and conflict, but where failure and conflict does not disrupt the underlying momentum of the work. We conclude in favour of interdisciplinary, democratic and co-produced research as a tool for social change.

T1  - When the West Meets the East: Cultural Clash and Its Impacts on Anomie in a Sample of Chinese Adolescents
AN  - 2282709982
AB  - Criminological studies conducted in China have highlighted the important role of Chinese culture and anomie theory in explaining crime patterns and delinquency among adolescents. None of the studies, however, have empirically tested the relationship between cultural attachment and anomie. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of ethnic identity associated with cultural attachment on anomie in the Chinese social setting. Specifically, the effects of both attachment to conventional Chinese culture and attachment to Western popular culture (WPC) were examined; the interaction between the two may shed some important light on how culture and cultural conflict can lead to anomie among Chinese adolescents. The data analyzed were collected from a sample of more than 6,500 middle school students. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. The study found that attachment to traditional Chinese cultural values, especially showing respect to conventional figures/values, reduces anomie among adolescents. In contrast, attraction to WPC and being socially labeled as a big fan of WPC elevate the levels of anomie reported by the students. Reflections on cultural conflict and relevant policy implications are provided in the "Discussions and conclusions" section.

T1  - Does being Roma matter? Ethnic boundaries and stigma spillover in musical consumption
AN  - 2264600930
AB  - Manele songs, an updated version of traditional Romani music, are excluded from mainstream Romanian media due to their association with the country's large Roma minority. The genre is at the intersection between Romania's democratic transition and growing efforts to strengthen boundaries between the country's marginalized Romani minority and the non-Romani majority population. But we find that media discussions around manele underscore a fluid relationship between ethnic boundaries and stigmatized cultural consumption. All those who listen to manele are portrayed in negative terms by the media, no matter whether ethnic markers are used as part of the portrayal. In the context of manele, genre-based stereotypes extend beyond ethnic boundaries to assign negative social value to a wide swathe of people who consume the genre. The stigma spillover surrounding manele audiences therefore underlines the ways in which Roma identity is fluid, and anyone associated with the Roma can be relegated to the lower rungs of social status. Manele show how the political process of ethnic boundary-making draws a wide net over those located at the bottom of power hierarchies.

T1  - Speciesism, generalized prejudice, and perceptions of prejudiced others: GPIR
AN  - 2285045368
AB  - Philosophers have argued there is a normative relationship between our attitudes towards animals (“speciesism”) and other prejudices, and psychological work suggests speciesism relies on similar psychological processes and motivations as those underlying other prejudices. But do laypeople perceive such a connection? We compared perceptions of a target who is high or low on speciesism with those of a target who is high or low on racism (Studies 1–2), sexism (Study 2), or homophobia (Study 3). We find that just like racists, sexists, and homophobes, speciesists were both evaluated more negatively and expected to hold more general prejudicial attitudes and ideologies (e.g., thought to be higher on SDO and more prejudiced in other ways). Our results suggest that laypeople seem intuitively aware of the connection between speciesism and “traditional” forms of prejudice, inferring similar personality traits and general prejudicial attitudes from a speciesist just as they do from a racist, sexist, or homophobe.

T1  - CASM: A Deep-Learning Approach for Identifying Collective Action Events with Text and Image Data from Social Media
AN  - 2282769904
AB  - Protest event analysis is an important method for the study of collective action and social movements and typically draws on traditional media reports as the data source. We introduce collective action from social media (CASM)—a system that uses convolutional neural networks on image data and recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory on text data in a two-stage classifier to identify social media posts about offline collective action. We implement CASM on Chinese social media data and identify more than 100,000 collective action events from 2010 to 2017 (CASM-China). We evaluate the performance of CASM through cross-validation, out-of-sample validation, and comparisons with other protest data sets. We assess the effect of online censorship and find it does not substantially limit our identification of events. Compared to other protest data sets, CASM-China identifies relatively more rural, land-related protests and relatively few collective action events related to ethnic and religious conflict.

T1  - Bisexual Lives and Aging in Context: A Cross-National Comparison of the United Kingdom and the United States
AN  - 2258638622
AB  - Research on bisexual histories and identities in later life is limited and reflects only single-nation studies. This article compares findings from two independently conducted studies of bisexual aging, in the United Kingdom and the United States, using a discourse analytic and life course perspective. The goals were to compare how participants narrated and made sense of their bisexual experiences in later life and to examine ways in which historical and cultural contexts shaped their accounts. Findings indicate that similar histories around lesbian separatism and the HIV/AIDS epidemic enabled shared discursive resources, while differing ethnic and racial relations enabled distinctive discursive possibilities. In both studies intersectional experiences, particularly including being a person of color and having a transgender history, profoundly affected individual narratives. Future research will benefit from creative conceptualizations of bisexuality, applying the life course perspective in research and practice, and supporting the diverse and resilient ways bisexual older adults use language.

T1  - More Than Just Hurdles: How Fieldwork Difficulties Provide Insights into Conflict
AN  - 2235524679
AB  - How do emotions surrounding past instances of intergroup violence influence future conflict? Previous research argues that emotions stemming from past violence—particularly anger— can drive the continuation of conflict (Bar-Tal 2000; Horowitz 2001). I sought to answer this question using a behavioral economics experiment that examined how experimental primes of anger about past ethnic violence influenced intergroup conflict. The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is one of the longest-running continual conflicts. It is notable for its strong ingroup–outgroup identities, with a history of victimization on both sides that has been used as justification for current violence (Morris 2011; Tessler 2009).

T1  - 'Enclaves of exposure': A conceptual viewpoint to explore cross-ideology exposure on social network sites
AN  - 2258134850
AB  - Previous studies indicate mixed results as to whether social media constitutes ideological echo chambers. This inconsistency may arise due to a lack of theoretical frames that acknowledge the fact that contextual and technological factors allow varying levels of cross-cutting exposure on social media. This study suggests an alternative theoretical lens, divergence of exposure – co-existence of user groups with varying degrees of cross-ideology exposure related to the same issue – as a notion that serves as an overarching perspective. We suggest that mediated spaces, such as social media groups, can serve as enclaves of exposure that offer affordances for formation of user groups irrespective of offline social distinctions. Yet social elements cause some of them to display more cross-ideology exchange than others. To establish this claim empirically, we examine two Facebook page user networks ('Sri Lanka's Killing Fields' and 'Sri Lankans Hate Channel 4') that emerged in response to Sri Lanka's Killing Fields, a controversial documentary broadcast by Channel 4 that accused Sri Lankan armed forces of human rights violation during the final stage of the separatist conflict in Sri Lanka. The results showed that the Facebook group network that supported the claims made by Channel 4 is more diverse in terms of ethnic composition, and is neither assortative nor disassortative across ethnicity, suggesting the presence of cross-ethnicity interaction. The pro-allegiant group was largely homogenous and less active, resembling a passive echo chamber. 'Social mediation' repurposes enclaves of exposure to represent polarized ideologies where some venues display cross-ideology exposure, while others resemble an 'echo chamber'.

T1  - Tolerated but not equal
AN  - 2221718867
AB  - Tolerance is an ambivalent attitude. It allows living in plurality but not in equality. The tolerant tradition of the Ottoman Empire, for example, is based on a very clear political and social hierarchy between different religions. Dominants boast of their tolerant tradition. Tolerance is also about imposing limits on the other in a unilateral way. In Republican Turkey where theoretically all citizens are equal, the majority of Turkish-speaking Sunnis tolerate non-Muslim minorities, Alevis, Kurds. It is the ‘liberal’ currents of this ethno-religious majority that pronounce themselves tolerant of others. However, minorities do not demand tolerance but equality because the history of Turkey for more than a century with the genocide of Armenians, pogroms, massacres, deportations have shown those who say they are tolerant can switch to each moment in extreme violence against those whom they now consider intolerable. In this framework, the discourse of tolerance prepares the ground for the reproduction of the domination of a double nationalism, religious and ethnic, under cover of a republican equality all theoretical.

T1  - The passport as means of identity management: making and unmaking ethnic boundaries through citizenship
AN  - 2195295458
AB  - This paper explores how the non-resident citizenship made available for Hungarians living beyond Hungary's borders impacted the national identification of newly naturalised non-resident Hungarians. Through the analysis of 51 semi-structured in-depth interviews with recently naturalised Hungarians in Romania, Serbia, the U.S. and Israel, the paper compares how citizenship as a legal institution is perceived, practiced and consumed by Hungarians living in Hungary's neighbouring countries and overseas diasporas. Not denying the instrumental implications of the Hungarian passport, the paper argues that it is also an important means of constructing national identities. My empirical research shows that the passport strengthens the holder's sense of belonging to the national group. In addition, citizenship is also considered as a valuable symbolic asset which can be instrumentalised as means of social closure. Non-resident Hungarians use their Hungarian passports to prove their European ancestry and/or belonging to the Hungarian nation. At the same time, the passport also enables its holder to distance herself from the populations in their home-states in order to elevate the holder's social status.

T1  - Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity‐Based Prejudice
AN  - 2177674152
AB  - Very little developmental research has focused on children's and adolescents’ beliefs and attitudes regarding sexual orientation and gender identity/expression (SOGIE), despite documented evidence of the frequency and negative developmental consequences of bullying and harassment related to SOGIE. Although limited research on perpetrators of these types of harassment is beginning to emerge, little of the work is framed around this concept. In this article, I define SOGIE‐based prejudice, outline a multidimensional approach to understanding this phenomenon, and review the available developmental literature as it is related to age, gender, intergroup contact, and social reasoning. SOGIE‐based prejudice involves attitudes about three distinct phenomena: beliefs about homosexuality (e.g., acceptability of same‐sex sexuality, how someone becomes gay or lesbian), attitudes about social interactions (e.g., exclusion, using antigay language, comfort interacting with a gay peer), and attitudes about rights (e.g., access, institutional discrimination). I conclude with recommendations for research on this issue.

T1  - War increases religiosity
AN  - 2346393566
AB  - Does the experience of war increase people’s religiosity? Much evidence supports the idea that particular religious beliefs and ritual forms can galvanize social solidarity and motivate in-group cooperation, thus facilitating a wide range of cooperative behaviours including—but not limited to—peaceful resistance and collective aggression. However, little work has focused on whether violent conflict, in turn, might fuel greater religious participation. Here, we analyse survey data from 1,709 individuals in three post-conflict societies—Uganda, Sierra Leone and Tajikistan. The nature of these conflicts allows us to infer, and statistically verify, that individuals were quasirandomly afflicted with different intensities of war experience—thus potentially providing a natural experiment. We then show that those with greater exposure to these wars were more likely to participate in Christian or Muslim religious groups and rituals, even several years after the conflict. The results are robust to a wide range of control variables and statistical checks and hold even when we compare only individuals from the same communities, ethnic groups and religions.Data from three diverse post-conflict societies show that individuals with greater war exposure, several years later, were more likely to participate in religious groups and rituals. This reveals a link from violent conflict to religiosity.

T1  - The Campus as Crucible: A Critical Race Analysis of Campus Climate in the Experiences of American Muslim Undergraduates
AN  - 2186801559
AB  - Background/Context: Muslim communities in the United States have increasingly been the target of the state security apparatus, virulent public discourse, and increasing cultural xenophobia. Since 2001, individuals perceived to be from Muslim backgrounds have experienced dramatically increasing numbers of racially motivated attacks. What is often called "Islamophobia," or anti-Muslim discrimination or racism, has continued to rise in the past decade. Muslim communities face an acute political and cultural attack in which their actions and words are increasingly scrutinized and questioned. College campuses have been particular sites of contestation. This article explores how Muslim undergraduates understand their campus experiences. Purpose/Objective/Focus of Study: I examine how Muslim students expressed feelings of isolation and alienation on their campus community in a context of state surveillance programs targeting Muslim students and communities. In particular, I explore student narratives of being conscious of peer suspicion. Further, I investigate how self-consciousness of their outsider status created an environment where Muslim students feel they must continually attempt to make their peers comfortable with their presence while also challenging dominant stereotypes of Muslims. This study gives voice to Muslim undergraduate students as they negotiate prejudices, scrutiny, and discrimination on college campuses. Setting: Data was collected in southern California because there is a critical mass of community, concentration of students, and number of political advocacy and service providers for the diverse Muslim communities in the region. Focusing on this age group allows for an examination of this specific generation's understandings of race, identity, and citizenship, because they came of age amidst a rise in discrimination and racism against those associated with Islam and Muslims. Data Collection and Analysis: Data was collected through semi-structured life history interviews and ethnographic observations of Muslim undergraduates in Southern California. The interviews spanned between three and five hours each and were conducted over multiple meetings with each participant. Drawing from a critical feminist framework, interviews were conducted not simply to garner data, but rather to allow students the opportunity explore their own experiences, analyze their histories, and engage in social analysis. The research utilized a multi-level coding scheme in order to understand individual meaning-making processes. Findings/Results: This study reveals that Muslim students often feel politically and culturally targeted and isolated on their campuses and do not feel that their peers and teachers engage with them as full members of the campus community. Implications: This study contributes to the growing body of literature that demonstrates the multiracial demographic of students who choose the term Muslim as a primary form of identity. This study reveals that Muslim students often felt politically and culturally targeted and isolated on their campuses and did not feel that their peers and teachers engaged with them as full members of the campus community. Colleges and universities must take proactive steps to engage Muslim students in dialogue about their concerns, fears, and questions about issues of freedoms and protections on campus.

T1  - Polarization Without Poles: Machiavellian Conflicts and the Philippines’ Lost Decade of Democracy, 2000–2010
AN  - 2159538460
AB  - The Philippines’ long democratic experience has been remarkably free of deeply politicized cleavages. Roman Catholicism as a hegemonic religion prevents religious polarization, ethnic identity fragmentation limits ethnic polarization, and weak parties forestall ideological or class polarization. Nevertheless, the country suffered a crisis of polarization during the short-lived Estrada presidency (1998–2001) and that of his successor, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001–2010). The severe conflict was a product of power maneuvers by anti-Estrada forces, followed by anti-Arroyo actors returning the favor, given her gross abuses of power. Echoing Machiavelli’s famous distinction, the conflict pitted Estrada’s popoli (the many) against Arroyo’s oligarchic grandi (the few). This Machiavellian conflict ended with an oligarchic reassertion of Madisonian democratic rule through the electoral victory of Benigno Simeon Aquino III in 2010. We conclude the article by considering whether the populist challenge of current president Rodrigo Duterte (2016– ) might spark a similarly destabilizing conflict in the years to come.

T1  - Hybridity, ethnicity and nationhood: legacies of interethnic war, wartime rape and the potential for bridging the ethnic divide in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina
AN  - 2153868930
AB  - Relying on the biographical narrative Leila, a girl from Bosnia and the recorded narratives by adolescents born of wartime rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina we illustrate the difficulties and symbolic implications associated with negotiating hybrid identities in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina against the dominant post-conflict discourse based on 'pure' ethnicities. We argue that in today's Bosnia and Herzegovina, hybrid identities are marginalized by official politics and societal structures as a legacy of the war. However, they simultaneously embody the symbolic tools through which ethnic divisions could be overcome, envisioning and recalling a multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina as a supra-national designation.

T1  - Not Just a National Issue: Effect of State‐Level Reception of Immigrants and Population Changes on Intergroup Attitudes of Whites, Latinos, and Asians in the United States
AN  - 2151163668
AB  - National discourse about immigration in the United States has become increasingly unwelcoming. In two studies, we examine whether regional‐level (state) information about welcoming (vs. unwelcoming) immigrant policies in the context of either stable or increasing rate of immigration can influence intergroup relations in receiving communities. Among Whites (Study 1), welcoming policy proposals elicited more positive attitudes toward immigrants generally and toward Latinos, the ethnic group most closely associated with immigration in the United States, but only when rate of immigration is constant. In contrast, among Latinos (Study 2), an unwelcoming reception led to more positive attitudes toward immigrants (legal and undocumented) but again only when rate of immigration is constant. Asians’ attitudes (Study 2) toward immigrants were not affected by contextual information about immigration. Together, these findings suggest that local conditions can affect community members’ attitudes toward immigrants and toward specific ethnic groups associated with immigration.

T1  - Care Work in Transition: Transnational Circuits of Gender, Migration, and Care
AN  - 2133225079
AB  - This article presents a broad overview of the emerging field of scholarship on gender, migration and care work. The first section provides a rationale for linking the embodied intimate labor of sex workers and surrogate mothers to more traditional caregiving among nannies, nurses and eldercare aids. Through an intersectional optic on power and domination in care workers’ everyday lives, we highlight the ways in which love’s labor is lost and devalued in the sphere of the home as workplace, the family and community as employer, the state as labor recruiter, and the labor market as a site of ethnic boundaries and exclusions. Distinguishing different types of care and its institutional and geographic location matters in explaining current care in transition. Care work, in many domains, has become appropriated by markets. We consider how political, institutional, and cultural factors have shaped, and are reshaping, the ideas and norms of care in the context of transnational care worker migration. Too often, studies of gendered care migration fail to account for the differential impacts of state migration and care policies for women across class and social status within single country contexts. Care workers are beginning to challenge new forms of commodified care work. The final section explores how grassroots efforts to organize and advocate for the rights of domestic workers have evolved in countries in both the Global North and South.

T1  - Cultural Precarity: Migrants' Positionalities in the Light of Current Anti-immigrant Populism in Europe
AN  - 2099575654
AB  - The Brexit referendum was an earthquake to those in otherwise privileged positions: white intra-European migrants. Poles form the largest among these groups in the UK. As much as they are vulnerable to discrimination as non-British citizens, these migrants benefit from their whiteness and European heritage. They are objects of anti-immigrant campaigns, but they are not free of anti-immigrant sentiments and racist attitudes. This article uses the notion of 'cultural precarity' to highlight their ambivalent positionalities in Britain and how those have been changing since the Brexit vote. Drawing on three studies conducted among Poles in England between 2010 and 2017, it explores how the neoliberal and culturalist logics of belonging determine the migrants' conditions. By applying the lens of 'cultural precarity', the article is attentive to both to the migrants' vulnerability and the moments of everyday resistance to anti-immigrant populism now at work across Europe. The Brexit case is instructive for other contexts for it demonstrates how migrants construct their own cultural and racial proximity to dominant groups to counter vulnerability and secure inclusion.

T1  - Collective victimhood beliefs among majority and minority groups: Links to ingroup and outgroup attitudes and attribution of responsibility for conflict
AN  - 2132684057
AB  - We examined perceived ingroup and outgroup victimhood beliefs across group status and how these were uniquely associated with ingroup and outgroup attitudes and attribution of responsibility among majority (Turkish, N = 141) and minority (Kurdish, N = 86) group members in Turkey. We further explored whether the extent to which collective victimhood beliefs were shared via ingroup and outgroup members predicted our dependent measures beyond the subjective perception of ingroup victimhood. Findings showed that both groups perceived higher ingroup victimhood compared to outgroup victimhood and this difference was more pronounced among the minority group. Perceived outgroup victimhood beliefs, compared to ingroup victimhood beliefs, were more closely related to intergroup outcomes, and led to more positive outgroup and more negative ingroup outcomes. Both groups shared collective victimhood beliefs more with their ingroup friends than their outgroup friends and ingroup sharing of collective victimhood was a stronger predictor of intergroup outcomes, relating to more positive ingroup and more negative outgroup outcomes. Outgroup sharing of collective victimhood was related to more positive outgroup attitudes and lower ingroup responsibility among the Turkish group, whereas it was not related to outgroup attitudes and negatively related to ingroup attribution of responsibility among the Kurdish group. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings were discussed.

T1  - Perceived Need for Treatment and Engagement in Mental Health Services Among Community-Referred Racial/Ethnic Minority Adolescents
AN  - 2015704394
AB  - This study examines clinical and family predictors of perceived need for treatment and engagement in mental health treatment services among community-referred racial/ethnic minority adolescents and their primary caregivers. Findings indicated that the majority of families perceived a need for treatment, but that perceived need was not associated with treatment engagement. Family factors (i.e., low cohesion and high conflict within the family) predicted perceived need for treatment among adolescents, whereas clinical factors (i.e., adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptomatology) predicted caregiver perceived need for adolescent treatment. Neither clinical nor family factors predicted treatment engagement.

T1  - In Pursuit of a Twenty-first Century Just City
AN  - 2133313600
AB  - A reexamination of the role of equity in planning is critical at this contentious period in US history. Racism and anti-immigrant sentiments have arisen in our public policy debates, cities have again experienced riots, and inequality has grown. Equity has long been a center of tension throughout planning history, and the field has struggled to balance activism and technocratic expertise. This article provides a literature review to inform and explore how planners can engage equity in this current contentious time period.

T1  - The civility of strangers? Caste, ethnicity, and living together in postwar Jaffna, Sri Lanka
AN  - 2080435683
AB  - The question asked by this article is as follows: How do different kinds of people live together in a hierarchical world that has been challenged and transformed through the leveling effects of deep ethnicization and war? I examine two different kinds of relationships in contemporary postwar Jaffna: first, an inter-ethnic, external Tamil/Muslim division that has led to people relating to each other as categorical strangers; and second, an intra-ethnic, internal caste relationship through which different castes relate to each other as intimate strangers. These inter-ethnic and intra-caste distinctions have been forged through recent histories of violence and struggle, and indicate key tensions and transformations around postwar life on the Jaffna peninsula, part of the former warzone during the Sri Lankan civil war and long considered the ideological heart of Tamil nationalism. When ethnic mobilization—the possibility of egalitarian mutuality and solidarity as well as the pain, trauma and sacrifice of war, and ethnic cleansing—emerges within deeply hierarchical worlds that continually produce modes of distinction, what kinds of struggles arise within inter-ethnic and intra-caste relations? Given that public life is historically built on unequal participation, and that living together has been a historical struggle, we need to ask how we understand the particular embedded civilities that have made living together such a problem over time. Rather than see civility as an abstract code of prescriptions in relation to the maintenance of non-violent order, I suggest that it is possible to see different modalities of civility produced with regard to specific others/strangers. These modalities can conflict with each other, given that civility can be either hierarchically produced or governed by an egalitarian drive toward public forms of dignity and equality. I propose that civility has a social location, discourses, and understandings in hierarchical worlds that are necessarily different depending on who is speaking.

T1  - Diaspora mobilisation for conflict and post-conflict reconstruction: contextual and comparative dimensions
AN  - 2076972561
AB  - This special issue seeks to move the scholarly conversation beyond notions of conflict-generated diasporas as simply agents of conflict or peace. The field is ripe to unpack the notion of context for diaspora mobilisation in International Relations, the focus and novelty of this special issue. Theorising in this volume goes beyond current prevalent thinking that contexts are host-states in which diasporas live, and original home-states to which they are transnationally connected. The emphasis here is that diasporas have linkages to different contexts, and that their embeddedness in these contexts - simultaneously or sequentially in time - either shapes their mobilizations or is shaped by them. The volume theorises about spatialities and temporalities of diaspora engagement: it emphasises spatial notions such as multi-sited embeddedness, positionality, and translocalism on the one side, and temporal notions such as critical junctures, transformative events, simultaneity, crises, and durability of conflicts on the other. This collection further adds new thematic areas to current scholarly inquiry, opening the discussion beyond interest in diaspora remittances, economic development, and extraterritorial voting. The authors take little-explored paths to examine diasporas as agents in transitional justice processes, contested sovereignty, and fragile and de facto states, as well as in civic and ethnic-based activism.

T1  - The making and unmaking of ethnic boundaries in the public sphere: The case of Norway
AN  - 2036639972
AB  - This article employs theories of ethnic boundary-making to explore when and under what conditions ethnicity and religious background shape minorities' experiences when participating in the public sphere in Norway. Drawing on in-depth interviews with elite individuals with various ethnic and religious minority backgrounds, the analysis calls into question interpretations made in other studies, which tend to imply an all-encompassing significance of race, ethnicity or religion. Although the analysis support previous findings in that negative comments and harassment do occur, the interviews demonstrate a variety of experiences and positions and that several individuals are able to strategically cross existing ethnic boundaries. Overall, the findings suggest that important changes are occurring in Norway's mediated public sphere. The question is whether these changes point to broader, societal processes of boundary-blurring or rather are opportunities offered to exceptional individuals while the existing hierarchy of ethnic categories stays intact.

T1  - Does the ethno-religious diversity of a neighbourhood affect the perceived health of its residents?
AN  - 2078152965
AB  - Concerns about the diversification of Britain, and its impact on social capital and health are widely debated. The literature has however produced a fuzzy discourse, full of assumptions and claims that are rarely tested. We attempt to disentangle some of these assumptions by providing empirical evidence on the mediating and moderating influence of inter-ethnic conflict and contact, and examine whether they underlie the erosion of health among minorities and white British respondents residing in diverse local areas. Analyses were conducted using multilevel models that relied on geocoded data from a random stratified sample of adults 16–75 years collected in the 2009–2011 Citizenship Survey merged to small area aggregated statistics from the 2011 UK census. The final sample comprised of minorities (n = 13,236) and white British (n = 15,021) residing in England. We find that local area deprivation matters much more for the health of minorities and whites than diversity. Yet, residing in diverse areas can be problematic for whites if it is accompanied by high levels of social distance measured by negative attitudes towards immigrants. Greater contact among minorities and whites, residing in more diverse areas appears to have no significant effect on health. Overall, the findings supported our hypothesis that residing in areas of greater diversity has a differential impact on minorities when compared to whites. In particular, diversity appear to be more beneficial for minorities, especially newly arriving migrants. The effect of contact as measured by social capital is dwarfed in comparison to the effect of deprivation, underlying the importance for policy makers to tackle structural inequalities.

T1  - The Invisible Village: An Exploration of Undergraduate Student Mothers’ Experiences
AN  - 2003307526
AB  - This study explored the experiences of mothers in college using a qualitative design. Results showed that a lack of financial resources was the chief barrier for student mothers in their educational pursuits while social/emotional support was the most important contributor to student mothers’ success in college. Participants relied heavily on student loans to cover costs of childcare or family to help watch their children. Role conflict experienced by student mothers has implications on family and college retention. Implications of this study included the adaptation and revisions of policies at the state and federal levels in addition to implications at the university level. Limitations of the study included a lack of racial and ethnic diversity and only including student mothers currently enrolled in college. Several recommendations for future research are described.

AN  - 1993508764
AB  - Otherwise known as Black Rock City, Burning Man is an artistic event, that, mounted annually in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert, has become the inspiration for a global cultural movement. While it has been the subject of considerable attention from ethnographers and sociologists, Burning Man has persistently resisted classification. In this article, I undertake a tentative approach to Burning Man via a concept integral to Maffesoli’s postmodern social philosophy popular within Anglophone sociology: the neo-tribe. Ethnographic attention to Burning Man illustrates spectacular aspects of neo-tribalism. It is cyclical, immediate, sensual, enchanted, collaborative and offers multiple sites of belonging for participants, many of whom will self-identify as ‘tribal’ or ‘neo-tribal’. And yet Burning Man is also demonstrative of an optimising modernist ‘project’ complicating, if not incongruent with, postmodern tribalism. With Black Rock City theme camps, art projects and build teams echoing a design-orientated maker culture, and an organisation – the Burning Man Project – dedicated to propagating and scaling (making) the ethical, civic and progressive dimensions of this culture, this article demonstrates the paradoxical proclivities of Burning Man’s tribal character. The objective of the article is to forge a fuller understanding of Burning Man and other ‘transformational’ events illustrative of an alternative tribalism, and to explore ways the phenomenon both approximates and deviates from Maffesoli’s thesis.

T1  - Scripts, regions and states of the Konkani language in independent India
AN  - 2571465851
AB  - The linguistic pluralism with its democratic enunciation has remained internal to the political processes of state formation in independent India. Konkani language acquires a distinctive status in debates on language-based political autonomy movements in twentieth-century India. As an inter-state, inter-regional language with scriptal plurality, it has a wider expanse with multilingual and multicultural historical ancestry and lineage. The Konkani controversy shows the magnitude of an interface between languages, scripts, regions and states having axial effects on the social, cultural and political survival and sustainability of languages in a multilingual country. The case of Konkani shows that language is not simply a means of communication but a marker of ethnic-regional identities and boundaries drawn around their linguistic differentiations. The question of Konkani language and script controversy is as much about the processes of linguistic democratization and mobilization. Konkani question is also one related to the linguistic–cultural right, linguistic equality, identity and democratic equity amidst linguistic plurality and its complex registers of identity formation and resistance. The conflict and consensus over Konkani language reveal dense and complex set of interlinkages between caste, class, community, religion, language and state and their uneasy alliances at various points of time in the making of the nation-state project of post-independence India.

T1  - From ‘Tourkopolis’ to ‘Metropolis’: Transforming Urban Boundaries in Late Nineteenth-Century Iraklio (Candia), Crete
AN  - 2078812746
AB  - This article examines the case of Iraklio, Crete, on its passage from the Ottoman regime to the Autonomous Cretan Polity in 1898, to interrogate current categories of ethnic boundaries used in historical and social research. It proposes an ‘archaeological’ method of investigating such boundaries in space. It conceives of the city as a field of interaction between the predominant religious groups of Muslim and Christian, and the way these groups have been represented in historical research and public memory. It also shows how understandings of ethnic boundaries were fashioned by colonial, especially British, sanitary and civic planning projects. Finally, it demonstrates how subaltern Muslim spaces, gendered places and ‘dangerous’ neighbourhoods were transformed into paradigmatic cases for understanding spatial segregation in cultural terms.

T1  - Polarizing Figures: Executive Power and Institutional Conflict in Asian Democracies: PROD
AN  - 2016865616
AB  - Polarization does not necessarily pit left against right, rich against poor, secular against religious, or ethnicity against ethnicity. Rather than polarizing along deep social or ideological cleavages, today’s democracies often polarize over the perceived abuse of power by popularly elected chief executives. We argue that such conflicts are built into the definition and design of democracy, which requires both vertical accountability (i.e., inclusivity) and horizontal accountability (i.e., constraints) and divides sovereignty into separate institutions. We illustrate our institutional theory of polarization through a comparative analysis of polarizing crises in five Asian democracies since 2000. What mattered most for these crises’ severity and eventual resolution was not the depth of social cleavages, but how the leading elite opponents of polarizing figures managed their removal from office.

T1  - Model (undocumented) minorities and "illegal" immigrants: centering Asian Americans and US carcerality in undocumented student discourse
AN  - 1952107406
AB  - As the numbers of immigrant apprehensions, detentions, and deportations increase, and in context of anti-immigrant sentiment, education scholars must better contend with the way that carcerality affects undocumented student experiences. Carcerality refers to social and political systems that formally and informally promote discipline, punishment, and incarceration. Guided by Critical Race Theory, I examine interview data from 15 undocumented Asian Americans to show that the portrayal of undocumented student exceptionalism that typically characterizes the discourse on their experiences obscures the centrality of carcerality in shaping how young people with undocumented status navigate their lives. The narratives of undocumented Asian Americans represent a shift in undocumented discourse as these students de-emphasized their academic mobility, demonstrated a hyper-awareness of punitive immigration policies, and were traumatized by and practiced nondisclosure in response to deportation threats. However, while these students developed resistance strategies that they believed would both physically and psychologically protect their presence in the US, some reinforced white supremacist perceptions of the illegality of other undocumented immigrants. Undocumented Asian American experiences illuminate the nuanced relationship between the criminalization of undocumented immigrants, race, and education, and how a legacy of carcerality is vital to deciphering the contemporary educational experiences of undocumented students in the US.

T1  - Las conversaciones de paz en Colombia y el reconocimiento de los cultivadores de coca como víctimas y sujetos de derechos diferenciados
AN  - 2561440341
AB  - RESUMENEn este artículo argumento que en Colombia la guerra contra las drogas viene siendo influenciada por el discurso de verdad, reparación y reconciliación en el marco de las negociaciones de paz con las FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), evidenciándose en el reconocimiento de los campesinos cocaleros como víctimas por parte del gobierno, así como en la apropiación de dicho discurso por parte de los campesinos cocaleros al replantear su lucha por su descriminalización en términos de la demanda de su reconocimiento como sujetos políticos con derechos diferenciados. Dos puntos centrales sobresalen en esta demanda: primero, que los campesinos cocaleros asumen su situación de víctimas no sólo del conflicto armado sino del narcotráfico y segundo, que se posicionan como grupo social que, aunque no étnicamente diferenciado como los pueblos indígenas y afros, se definen como grupo culturalmente diverso que, requieren se les garantice sus derechos y continuidad como grupo social y político con arraigo en el campo. Sostengo que más allá del ejercicio de la política de la identidad, se trata del ejercicio de la política de inclusión diferenciada que conlleva la redefinición de la ciudadanía y la puesta en marcha de acciones regidas por el principio de la interculturalidad.Alternate abstract:In this article I argue that the conduct of the war on drugs in Colombia has been influenced by the discourse of truth, reconciliation, and reparation at the core of the peace negotiations with the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). The government’s recognition of peasant coca growers (campesino cocaleros) as victims of the conflict is one example of this influence, and another is the cocaleros’ own appropriation of the discourse of reparation to frame their struggle for decriminalization as a demand for recognition by the state as political subjects with special rights. This demand brings up two points. First, campesino cocaleros consider themselves victims of both the armed conflict and widespread drug trafficking in the rural areas where they live and work. Second, although, unlike Colombia’s indigenous and Afro-descended populations, they share no identifying ethnic identity, they identify as a culturally diverse social and political group, whose rights and survival must be defended based on another defining characteristic: their rootedness on the land. I argue that this defense goes beyond the exercise of the politics of identity to the exercise of the politics of differentiated inclusion, which entails the redefinition of citizenship and the setting up of actions based on principles of interculturality.

T1  - The Meaning of Honorary Whiteness for Asian Americans: Boundary Expansion or Something Else?
AN  - 1988038787
AB  - Research on interracial intimacy divides between quantitative comparisons of interracial and same-race marriages and qualitative studies of existing interracial unions. This article bridges the divide by examining how interracial dating histories differ from same-race dating histories among Asian Americans, a group that sociologists consistently regard as potentially having attained a racial status as "honorary whites." Synthesizing the literatures on ethnic boundaries, homogamy, and interracial intimacy, the author examines the role of boundary processes in differentiating same-race and interracial dating histories. What does becoming honorary whites, as indicated by participation in racial exogamy, actually mean for Asian Americans? Using a unique sample of 83 Asian Americans with a wide range of dating histories, the author finds that social networks are a crucial mechanism for differentiating racial endogamy and exogamy. In addition, my results show that becoming honorary whites has critically involved boundary repositioning, rather than boundary transcendence, blurring, or expansion.

T1  - Using Internet Search Data to Produce State-level Measures: The Case of Tea Party Mobilization
AN  - 1955324277
AB  - This study proposes using Internet search data from search engines like Google to produce state-level metrics that are useful in social science research. Generally, state-level research relies on demographic statistics, official statistics produced by government agencies, or aggregated survey data. However, each of these data sources has serious limitations in terms of both the availability of the data and its ability to capture important concepts. This study demonstrates how state-level Google search measures can be produced and then demonstrates the effectiveness of such measures in an empirical case: predicting state-level Tea Party movement mobilization. Drawing on existing studies of the Tea Party movement and theories of right-wing and conservative mobilization, state-level Google search measures for anti-immigrant sentiment and economic distress are developed and compared to traditional metrics that are typically used to measure these concepts, such as the unemployment rate and the international immigration rate in their ability to successfully predict Tea Party event counts. The results show that the Google search measures are effective in predicting Tea Party mobilization in a way that is consistent with existing theory, while the traditional measures are not.

T1  - The Association of Ethnic Pride With Health and Social Outcomes Among Young Black and Latino Men After Release From Jail
AN  - 1944027556
AB  - The goal of this study was to understand whether ethnic pride among young, incarcerated Black and Latino men was associated with successful community reentry. We interviewed 397 Black and Latino men 16 to 18 years old in a New York City jail and then again 1 year after their release to determine the relationship between participants' sense of ethnic pride during incarceration, and substance use, violence, recidivism, and education/employment after release from jail. Participants with higher ethnic pride scores were less likely to engage in illegal activities and be reincarcerated. Ethnic pride was also associated with feeling safe in gangs and positive attitudes toward avoiding violence in situations of conflict. Ethnic pride was not associated with substance use, education, or engagement in community-based organizations post release. This study demonstrated that ethnic pride might be a source of strength that young men of color can harness for successful community reentry after release from jail.

T1  - Queer Genealogies of (Be)Longing: On the Thens and Theres of Asian America in Karen Tei Yamashita's I Hotel
AN  - 2030928914
AB  - This article explores how familial logics of (inter)generationality undergird narratives about the origins and development of Asian American studies in ways that posit the "community" and the "academy" as competing formations within a generational conflict between a radical past and an institutionalized present. As a counterpoint to such accounts, it examines Karen Tei Yamashita's I Hotel (2010) to chart a queer genealogy of (be)longing that brings to bear relations, affinities, and contingencies that exceed a generational model of the history of the field. Specifically, the first novella Eye Hotel reimagines modes of Asian American literary paternity by playing with and disassembling enduring tropes of normative familial relationality. Through the depicted relationship between protagonists Chen Wen-guang and Paul Wallace Lin, Eye Hotel envisions forms of queer (be) longing that reframe ethnic studies' projects of social justice as productive, erotic exchanges of intimacy, rather than reproductive legacies of filial transmission.

T1  - Intra-group interactions and inter-group violence: Sikh mobilization during the partition of India in a comparative perspective
AN  - 1923804040
AB  - Theories of ethnic conflict posit ethnic mobilization by elites as a necessary condition for ethnic war. What is less well understood is why ethnic mobilization succeeds in some instances, but not in others. This article examines this question using a case that is yet to be systematically explored from this perspective: Sikh mobilization during the partition of British India in 1947. During the period February-July 1947, there were two clear instances in which a section of Sikh elites tried to mobilize group members. While the first attempt at mobilization in March failed to elicit sufficient mass participation, the second attempt, in July, was more effective and created the preconditions for the violence that ensued in August. What explains this variation in mobilization outcomes? We contend that this difference can be traced back to key changes in elite strategy from March to July. In March, mobilization failed because the Sikh elites who were committed to the path of violence left the onus of the mobilization on a small group of extremists and mass sentiments, ignoring serious intra-community differences based on class and caste inequalities. By contrast, in July, they emphasized the issue of land dispossession and gave credible indications of their resolve to use violence to defend individual rights to land. These actions produced greater compliance because of the specific capacity of anti-land dispossession politics to blur intra-group social inequalities and heighten inter-group tensions based on land dispossession.

T1  - Long-term effects of ethnic cleansing in the former Polish-German borderlands
AN  - 1944220821
AB  - In compulsory population transfers and expulsions such as those wrought by partition, costs may accrue not only to the banished, but also to the places left behind. In particular, forcibly removing portions of the population rends social networks and discards location-specific skills and knowledge; these costs may be even worse if the expellees are replaced by refugees from elsewhere. The case of the interwar German-Poland borderlands, now Polish territory, shows that even six-plus decades after a population expulsion, ethnically cleansed and resettled places are appreciably different, with higher crime rates, lower civic engagement (measured by voter turnout), and less efficient public services (as measured by educational statistics). Although post-conflict population transfers might increase local social cohesion in some dimensions, this does not guarantee improved economic and sociological outcomes. Expelling local populations can, instead, cause highly persistent damage.

T1  - John Anthony La Rose: Committed to praxis
AN  - 1903890862
AB  - It is timely that on the 10th anniversary of his death, we should revisit the ideas and the work of John Anthony La Rose, a largely unsung Caribbean hero in the struggle against neocolonial domination and racism. As an activist and outspoken opponent of all forms of injustice, La Rose was especially well known for his contributions to the struggles involving ethnic, national and various other minority groups globally. To this extent, he was a resolute warrior, and his political involvement was aided in the age of globalisation, which has been marked by comparatively rapid, large-scale international migrations that have occasioned numerous encounters between and among different ethnic and national groups globally. As is known, those encounters have often resulted in conflict: war, genocide, ethnic cleansing, displacement of millions, prejudice and discrimination against the poor, blacks, Latinos, Muslims, gypsies and so on; and these served to fuel his passions. As a Trinidadian living in Britain, La Rose had a front seat to the formal and informal practices of racism, and from that front seat he was to become a key voice within the Caribbean diaspora. Indeed, the recent development of academic interest in diaspora studies benefits greatly from La Rose's praxis. For central to the concern with diaspora studies in the global age is the injustice that is faced by numerous ethnic, racial and national minorities the world over, and it is that specific form of injustice that fuelled La Rose's social and political passions when he moved to Britain and took up residence in the very belly of the beast.

T1  - Cross-group friendships and outgroup attitudes among Turkish-Kurdish ethnic groups: does perceived interethnic conflict moderate the friendship-attitude link?
AN  - 1870118847
AB  - We investigated associations between cross-group friendships, perceived interethnic conflict, and outgroup attitudes in the context of intractable Turkish-Kurdish conflict in Turkey. Measures of cross-group friendship quantity, perceived conflict, outgroup attitudes, multiculturalism, and outgroup responsibility for conflict were completed by Turkish (N=320) and Kurdish (N=153) participants (Mage=21, 156 males, 317 females). Both cross-group friendships and perceived conflict were related to outcome variables. While cross-group friendships were beneficial for both groups' outgroup attitudes when perceived conflict was lower; when perceived conflict level was higher, positive associations between friendships and attitudes became non-significant for the Turkish group and negative for the Kurdish group. Implications of the findings for the intergroup contact theory have been discussed.

T1  - Pondering the Colour of Empathy: Social Work Students’ Reasoning on Activism, Empathy and Racism
AN  - 2196662303
AB  - Australia is a multicultural society. However, its history of British colonisation has contributed to enduring overt and covert discrimination, racism and black/white racial divisions. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the recipients of ongoing racial discrimination, they are the most disadvantage groups in Australia and they are significantly overrepresented as social work clients. An anti-racist stance is core to social work practice, and some literature has suggested that cultivating empathy can help reduce racism and provoke activism for social justice. In 2014, a classroom-based inquiry exploring barriers to activism extended previous student-centred research exploring empathy and racism. The findings suggest that some students hesitant to commit to action for social justice for reasons including a lack of confidence, and a lack of time and information. Facilitating social work students’ confidence, increased understanding of everyday acts of activism and skill development including critical empathy may bolster their confidence and their action for social justice.

T1  - The Sweden Democrats and the ethno-nationalist rhetoric of decay and betraya
AN  - 2007447418
AB  - Sweden was long considered an ”exceptional case” with no representatives of the radical right in parliament. However, the Sweden Democrats (SD) entered parliament in the 2010 parliamentary election, pointing towards the demand for ethnic nationalism also in Sweden. This article explores the party’s rhetoric with particular references to the politics of decay and betrayal and its construction of a Swedish golden age. The rhetoric of decay echoes the ethnicity-based nationalisms articulated in other parts of Europe alongside nationalist claims of homogenous origins, a common destiny and an inherited social solidarity. The empirical material consists of political election programs since 1989 (SD 1989), high profile speeches and the party journal (SD Kuriren).

T1  - “Walking through Tokyo”: Wackwitz and the liminal spaces of postmodern everyday life
AN  - 1923318997
AB  - This study critically examines the activities and views of the transnational flaneur Stephan Wackwitz, which are described in his essay collection Tokyo. It particularly focuses on the descriptions of liminal spaces, such as streets, shopping malls, game salons, railway stations, and airports, where the author encounters social, cultural, and ethnic boundaries and realizes that the modern hierarchy of the real and virtual is upside down, taboo and normal displaced, and familiar and foreign mixed. This “orderly disorder” is analyzed in this study as a temporary tension that occurs during globalization at the thresholds of the liminal spaces of postmodern everyday life.Alternate abstract:Cet article suit d’une façon critique les pas et les regards du flâneur transnational que Stephan Wackwitz décrit dans sa collection d’essais « Tokyo ». Il se concentre particulièrement sur les descriptions des espaces liminaux comme les rues, le centre commercial, le salon de jeu, la gare ferroviaire et l’aéroport où l’auteur rencontre les frontières sociales, culturelles et ethniques et se rend compte que la hiérarchie moderne entre le réel et le virtuel est à l’envers, le tabou et le normal se sont déplacés, le familier et l’étranger sont mixtes. Ce « désordre ordonné » est analysé dans cet article comme la tension provisoire qui arrive pendant la globalisation aux seuils des espaces liminaux de la vie quotidienne postmoderne.

T1  - From language maintenance and intergenerational transmission to language survivance : will “heritage language” education help or hinder?
AN  - 1906430849
AB  - In much of his work on reversing language shift, Fishman cautioned those devoted to improving the sociolinguistic circumstances of regional, ethnic, and religious languages against a premature dependence on schools, especially schools controlled by speakers of the dominant societal language. He argued that efforts on behalf of minoritized languages that seek such recognition before intergenerational transmission has been established within the group frequently leads to intergroup conflict and to disillusionment. In this article, I draw from Fishman’s stated concern about the limitations of school effectiveness in connection with mother tongue transmission as put forth in his discussions of reversing language shift, but I problematize the notion of language maintenance and intergenerational transmission from the perspective of current theoretical shifts in the fields of sociolinguistics and applied linguistics. I focus on the dilemmas facing the implementation and design of heritage language teaching and assessment programs given the various mechanisms involved in curricularizing language: that is, in the process of treating language as if were an ordinary academic subject.

T1  - Multiple and Fluid: Religious and Diasporic Belonging in Venice’s Maritime State in the Late Medieval and Early Modern Period
AN  - 2114205282
AB  - As a result of the Ottoman territorial conquests, the Venice of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was a site of an unprecedented influx of immigrants from its colonies in the Adriatic and the eastern Mediterranean. Venice’s own polycentric and plural legal and institutional system provided a backdrop for complex processes of accommodation and contestation of cultural difference. Both state institutions and legal categories struggled to respond to the demands of Venice’s increasingly diverse populations. Immigrants themselves negotiated the legal and social categories of the state, and drew on different conceptions of social membership, in order to formulate their own claims about identity and belonging. This article focuses on two specific social sites where notions of community and belonging were elaborated: the establishment of Venetian civic ritual and the resulting negotiation of local religion in the eastern Adriatic commune of Kotor (Cattaro), and the working of lay religious corporations of foreigners in Venice, which complicated metropolitan and colonial perspectives and created a more reciprocal understanding of the world in which both colonial administration and local populations picked their way between multiple legal, linguistic, and ethnic boundaries. Religious devotion emerges not simply as a reflection of wider social, economic, and cultural changes, but as a dynamic and active agent in their negotiation.

T1  - An empirical test of self-control theory in Roma adolescents
AN  - 1773820127
AB  - The current study tested the applicability of self-control theory in Roma adolescents, one of the largest ethnic minorities in Europe; it compared mean levels in deviance measures and correlates (parenting and low self-control) in Roma versus non-Roma Czech youth. Questionnaire data were collected from Roma (n = 239, 47.5% female, Mage = 14.02) and non-Roma (n = 130, 47.7% female, Mage = 14.71) adolescents residing in the Czech Republic. Measures included maternal parenting processes, low self-control, and deviance (alcohol use, school misconduct, and theft). Findings from SEM analyses provided evidence that perceived maternal support predicted lower deviance both directly and indirectly via low self-control, while perceived maternal conflict predicted lower self-control and higher deviance. No differences were found between Roma and non-Roma adolescents in mean deviance scores or in the links between parenting, low self-control, and deviance. Roma adolescents did not differ from ethnic Czech adolescents in rates of deviance or the developmental processes focused on age-appropriate indicators of deviance. Thus, this evidence further extends the reach of Gottfredson and Hirschi's seminal theoretical work to ethnic minorities outside of North America.

T1  - Tribalism Versus Community Organization: Geography of a Multi-Tribal Bedouin Locality in the Galilee *
TT  - Plemienność kontra organizacja społeczności: geografia wieloplemiennej miejscowości beduińskiej w Galilei
AN  - 1952388356
AB  - Currently the Bedouin community in Israel is in very advanced stages of transition from a traditional to a modern society. The intersection between a traditional nomad population and a country with a modern Western lifestyle is a basic and material point of conflict. The Bedouin tribes that settled in the rainy and densely populated Galilee area were affected by their economic, social and geographic proximity to the surrounding agricultural rural region. This geographic proximity also directly affected the relatively rapid transition from nomadism to settlement. Beginning in the 1960s, Israeli government policy began regulating the Bedouins' spontaneous settlement. This step was designed to encourage trends toward social change and modernization in Bedouin society by means of urbanization. The initiative also stemmed from the desire to prevent spontaneous Bedouin settlement that was characterized by broad spatial dispersal and to concentrate the Bedouins in a limited number of towns. The transition to permanent residence forced the Bedouins living there to cope with cultural and social difficulties. On the one hand, the Bedouin tribal and clan structure strives to preserve itself, while on the other the selection of local leadership requires relinquishing tribalism in favor of the community structure. This research focuses on Zarzir, a Bedouin locality in the Galilee region of northern Israel comprising five tribes. The research revealed that the residents of this multi-tribal community demonstrated they were able to bridge between traditional values and modern values, contributing to the process of their adjustment to living in an urban residential environment. They slowly overcame their tribal pride and mutual suspicion and began to understand that it would be more beneficial to promote an independent municipal organization based on democratic elections according to candidates' management skills rather than based on tribal traditions.Alternate abstract:Beduini w Izraelu znajdują się obecnie na bardzo zaawansowanym etapie przejścia ze społeczności tradycyjnej do nowoczesnej. Zderzenie tradycyjnej wspólnoty wędrownej z krajem o nowoczesnym zachodnim stylu życia jest fundamentalnym i materialnym punktem zapalnym. Plemiona beduińskie, które osiadły w obfitym w opady oraz gęsto zaludnionym rejonie Galilei, odczuły gospodarczą, społeczną i geograficzną bliskość otaczającego je regionu rolniczego. To geograficzne sąsiedztwo spowodowało także względnie szybką transformację z nomadyzmu do osadnictwa. Począwszy od lat 60. XX w. władze izraelskie regulują spontaniczne osady Beduinów. To przejście do stałego pobytu wymusiło na zamieszkujących te tereny Beduinach radzenie sobie z trudnościami natury kulturowej oraz społecznej. Z jednej strony starają się oni zachować swoją strukturę plemienną i klanową, z drugiej jednak wybór lokalnych przywódców wymaga od nich porzucenia jej na rzecz organizacji społeczności. Niniejsze badania koncentrują się na miejscowości Zarzir (lokalnym samorządzie w rejonie Galilei w północnym Izraelu), w której zamieszkuje pięć plemion. Badania wykazały, że mieszkańcy tej wieloplemiennej społeczności stopniowo przezwyciężyli swoją dumę plemienną oraz wzajemną podejrzliwość, a także zrozumieli, że bardziej korzystne będzie promowanie niezależnej organizacji opartej na demokratycznych wyborach spośród kandydatów posiadających umiejętność zarządzania, a nie na tradycjach plemiennych.

T1  - The Flemish Lions Singing: Community imagination and historical legitimisation of nationalism at the 76th Flemish National Song Festival
AN  - 1841724222
AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine how music is used as a tool to express political claims as well as to strengthen the collective consciousness of the Flemish nationalist movement in the context of the 76th Flemish National Song Festival (Vlaams Nationaal Zangfest, VNZ). The VNZ is a music festival focused on preserving and spreading the cultural heritage represented by vernacular, popular, and historical repertoires of Flanders, the Dutch-speaking community of Belgium. This festival, rather than being simply a cultural event, is a political meeting of Flemish nationalists, where music is used to gather people and to express this political embeddedness. The author's objective in this paper - drawing on a relational approach that sees music as a socially embedded practice whose political meaning is defined within the relations occurring in live performance - is to shed light on the way in which music participates in the collective imagination of the Flemish community in ethnic terms and contributes to the diffusion and legitimisation of the political issues of Flemish nationalists. To this end, the paper firstly outlines the conflict between the Dutch and French-speaking communities in Belgium, the modern Flemish movement and the potential role, in this context, of a social practice such as music. In this part the theoretical perspective and methodology are clarified. In the second part the show is analysed through an ethnographic approach based on direct observation, non-directive interviews and textual analysis of songs. The paper concludes by highlighting how music provides the Flemish movement with a framework through which political issues are articulated and people's commitment to the ideals of Flemish nationalism are displayed.

T1  - Trash Talk: Interpreting Morality and Disorder in Negev/Naqab Landscapes
AN  - 1729372514
AB  - In contexts of land conflict and deep social divisions, evaluations of dirty and disordered landscapes carry social and political weight. This article employs a "political dwelling" perspective in southern Israel to examine how links between Bedouin character, litter and disorder, and lawlessness have become widespread, even naturalized, among many government officials and Jewish residents and even some Bedouin Arab residents. Contemporary trash talk draws on, but simultaneously masks, a history of state-building projects that employed Orientalist evaluations of order and disorder and segregationist approaches to development. While this masking of social construction is a property of all symbolically powerful social distinctions, I argue that the distinctions undergirding trash talk are especially accessible for normalization because of the language of nature within which they are expressed -- natural landscapes, ethnic groups, and human nature. As a result, trash talk naturalizes links between dirty places, disorderly people, and the need to remove (or reform) them. This trash talk has profound emotional and material consequences for Bedouin residents of Israel because the discourse makes it easier for many within mainstream Israeli society to treat Bedouin Arabs themselves as matter out of place and to justify various acts of social control.

T1  - Dead heroes and living deserters: the Yugoslav People's Army and the public of Valjevo, Serbia, on the verge of war 1991
AN  - 2697560322
AB  - With the withdrawal of the Yugoslav People's Army from Slovenia, the Yugoslav conflict escalated into a full-scale war in Croatia in the summer of 1991. The article explores the involvement of the Yugoslav People's Army in the war in East Slavonia from the local perspective of the Serbian town of Valjevo. Touching upon Serbia's political and social radicalization in Valjevo in the second half of the 1980s, it discusses the process of the local garrison's military mobilization and an incidence of mass desertion by Valjevo reservists in September 1991. Based on local archive material, press releases, and interviews with former soldiers, the account focuses on the city's national engagement, the garrison's deployment in combat, and the process of “reimplanting” patriotism after the reservists' desertion. It reveals that the engagement of Valjevo's troops completed the city's mental process of ethnic segregation. The outbreak of violence in Croatia in 1991 destroyed the Yugoslav People's Army as a pillar of Yugoslav statehood and permanently transformed the identities of Valjevo's soldiers.

T1  - Ethnic Conflict and Lands Rights in Myanmar
AN  - 1728663308; 201535075
AB  - Burma/Myanmar1 has been affected by ethnic conflict and civil war since independence in 1948. The situation further worsened after the military coup in 1962, when minority rights were further curtailed. Myanmar's ethnic minority groups have long felt marginalized and discriminated against, resulting in a large number of ethnic armed opposition groups fighting the central government -- dominated by the ethnic Burman majority -- for ethnic rights and autonomy. Their main grievances are the lack of influence in the political decisionmaking processes; the absence of economic and social development in their areas; and what they perceive as Burmanization policies by successive governments since independence including repression of their cultural rights and religious freedom. The advent of a new quasi-civilian government has caused a significant change in the political atmosphere, raising the prospect of fundamental reforms in national politics and economics for the first time in many decades. These include introducing new and revising existing laws that will have great impact on ethnic communities and ethnic rights in the country. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority Stress and Stress Proliferation Among Same-Sex and Other Marginalized Couples
AN  - 1700673711; 201527160
AB  - Drawing from 2 largely isolated approaches to the study of social stress-stress proliferation and minority stress-the authors theorize about stress and mental health among same-sex couples. With this integrated stress framework, they hypothesized that couple-level minority stressors may be experienced by individual partners and jointly by couples as a result of the stigmatized status of their same-sex relationship-a novel concept. They also consider dyadic minority stress processes, which result from the relational experience of individual-level minority stressors between partners. Because this framework includes stressors emanating from both status-based (e.g., sexual minority) and role-based (e.g., partner) stress domains, it facilitates the study of stress proliferation linking minority stress (e.g., discrimination), more commonly experienced relational stress (e.g., conflict), and mental health. This framework can be applied to the study of stress and health among other marginalized couples, such as interracial/ethnic, interfaith, and age-discrepant couples. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Gossip makes us one": A qualitative analysis of the role of gossip in the process of Taiwanese immigrants' social integration in Canada
AN  - 1768824946
AB  - Intergroup marriage has been widely used as an indicator to predict the social integration of immigrants. The assumption is that higher rates of intergroup marriage represent more harmonious outcome of an integrated society. As compared to the U.S., first and 1.5 generation immigrants in Canada have been found to be less likely to intermarry, and their cultural preference of a spouse of the same race/ ethnicity has been argued to be the key factor. However, the process of how these immigrants' cultural preference is maintained in a multicultural context requires exploration. This study elaborates on the role of gossip in the process of the maintaining of ethnic boundaries among recent immigrants using the case of Taiwanese immigrants in Canada. With an examination of their attitudes toward intergroup marriage, the results of the role of gossip indicate, 1) the seemingly impermeable ethnic boundaries established by recent immigrants can be challenged and modified through gossip, and 2) gossip makes the process of integration possible along both horizontal (i.e., coethnic peer of the same cohort) and vertical (i.e., parents to children and vice versa) axis within the same race/ethnic group of immigrants.

T1  - In the Shadow of the Razor Wire: Class and Insecurity in Guatemala's Urban Core
AN  - 1690736572
AB  - Home invasion was a major crime concern for those I interviewed. All interviewees living in single-family homes had contracted one or, in some cases, two different security firms with armed rapid response teams. Residents adamantly understood their consumption of security firms to be a requirement of life in el Centro. As one interviewee summarized, the security firm "es una necesidad" ("it is a need"). The process of selecting security firms for some took into account perceptions of military ability developed during the civil war. One informant would only consider "Israeli" firms (not always Israeli-owned but having an Israeli-sounding name) because he thought the Israelis had been so "important to Guatemala's military during the conflict." Another informant sought a security firm that was not managed by a known corrupt ex-military agent, as "contracting a company of this type makes a robbery more likely." Such individuals, he said, are "motivated by money," and "many times it is the company itself that robs you." The concern with ensuring the quality of a security firm is probably a result of the minimal requirements for employment with a security firm in Guatemala: 18 years of age, a sixth-grade education and working knowledge of Spanish (Dickins de Girón 2011:111). References, advice and chastisement from friends were all absolutely essential in the process of shopping for a "good" agency. The process of framing the consumption of security firms as a need that is mediated through relationships of trust has roots both in the social history of violence and ethnic separation and in the spatial arrangements of Guatemala's municipal space.              Security firms primarily draw their employees from the rural labourers who have migrated to the city in search of well-remunerated employment as rural plantation work has decreased (Dickins de Girón 2011:104). Guards are recruited from departments of the country that are primarily Mayan (113). The ethnic background of the primary respondents was not lost on my informants, who did not trust the "morals" of the men who responded to possible breaches or did "rounds." Their potential duplicity as thieves disguised as security guards was reminiscent of the many conversations inter- viewees had with me about the "theft-prone" character of their indigenous housemaids. Both types of workers were allowed in the home, but their "character" was always under surveillance by residents-often judged by their ability to submit to instruction, look smart but not too smart and act como se debe ("as one should"). For many residents, the muchachas' (maids') or guards' knowledge of the privileges that their employers enjoyed every day was corrupting and drove "the help" to jealousies and thievery. As one informant put it, "Where they come from, they do not have this. They can't access it."              [Dora] opened the wood square that served as a peephole in response to the loud knocking that had reverberated all the way to the second patio, where she was preparing lunch with the cook. We looked past the metal bars embedded in the century-old wooden door to see that a young man with tools and building materials stood on the sidewalk. "I was sent by Don Juan to fix the bathroom." Dora closed the square and said to me without responding to the youth, "You always have to see who it is. You never just open the door." She undid the lock, and the young man struggled through the opening with the load of materials and tools, taking care not to get caught in the quick rebolting of the entry door. We led him past the tiled room that housed the car in the evenings into the main courtyard and to the bathroom door. "You tell me when you are done," Dora said, as we left the unnamed youth to his tasks. Walking back to the second patio, Dora stopped to remove a dead leaf from a climbing plant on the edge of the patio and whispered to the youngest of her maids, at work mopping the floor, "Ojo" ("keep an eye out"), as she gestured toward the bathroom door with her mouth. Why let the young man in, if she didn't know him, I asked, as we sat to prep the green beans. "I know Don Juan, and that is his muchacho," she responded, adding, "You have to always know who you are letting in." Anticipating what she thought might be my next question, she said, "And yes, Gabrielita, this is how it has always been. The safety of the house depends on it. You already know that."

T1  - Globally Themed Organizations as Labor Market Intermediaries: The Rise of Israeli-Palestinian Women's Employment in Retail
AN  - 1700675648; 201525892
AB  - This paper examines the labor-market incorporation of minority women. Industrial transformations and the expansion of service and retail have increased women's labor-market participation, but there remains a large variation between minority women groups, where multiple boundaries may hinder labor-market integration. Past research has explored the role of formal labor-market intermediates in overcoming social boundaries. But a precondition for labor-market intermediation is that majority employers perceive minorities as potential workers and minorities perceive the majority as potential employers. In this paper, we expand the concept of labor-market intermediation to include the social construction of groups as legitimate economic actors, and examine the role of organizational structures in this social construction. Using a comparative analysis of two Jewish malls and nearby shopping streets, and based on 190 interviews with various actors, we show that while supply of workers and demand for work are necessary factors, they are not sufficient for explaining the incorporation of Palestinian women into retail labor markets. Instead, we point to the unintended effect of the globally themed organization of the shopping malls on the erosion of social boundaries and the formation of consumption relations between Israeli-Palestinian women and Jewish employers, which turned into employment relations.

T1  - Free and Unfree Labour and Ethnic Conflicts in the Brazilian Transport Industry: Rio de Janeiro in the Nineteenth Century
AN  - 1667950665; 201509059
AB  - Over the course of the nineteenth century, major changes transformed the transport of people and freight in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil during this period. These transformations involved both technological change, as transport evolved first from carriages and carts to horse-drawn trams and then to electric trams, as well as economic developments, such as the establishment of the first tram companies, many of which became important vehicles for foreign capital to enter Brazil. Although there has been extensive research from various angles into the changes undergone by the city's transport sector, there remains, however, a significant lacuna in the existing literature: the workers involved in that sector. The aim of this article is to analyse the workforce of the urban transport sector in Rio de Janeiro in the nineteenth century, and to understand the labour that these workers provided, how they were affected by the transformations in the sector, and, at the same time, how they responded to those transformations. During this period, issues such as the connections between free and unfree labour, ethnic conflicts, and work regulation were very important in transport work in Rio de Janeiro, and they are explored in the text.

T1  - History's remainders: On time and objects after conflict in Cyprus
AN  - 1660025313; 201508607
AB  - In the aftermath of war, those who remain must rebuild lives in spaces that bear the scars of conflict. This essay focuses on one such space, the unrecognized state in north Cyprus, which has experienced waves of displacement, ethnic cleansing, and the appropriation and redistribution of 'enemy' property. Families raise children in plundered spaces; grandchildren play in gardens replanted after war; houses are furnished with the remains of others' lives. In such contexts, the questions of what belongs to whom, and who belongs where, or with whom, are particularly contested, while the future of these places and objects remains uncertain. This essay asks what everyday historical work may be done with looted homes and objects, and it shows how practices with and stories about belongings may also be ways of helping us to 'belong' in history.

T1  - Conviviality in everyday multiculturalism: Some brief comparisons between Singapore and Sydney
AN  - 1700674174; 201525506
AB  - This article considers the question of conviviality in everyday multiculturalism. It elaborates the concept of 'convivial multiculture' through case studies from Sydney and Singapore. In comparing these two contexts, the article considers what underpins conviviality across three themes: spatial ordering, where consideration is given to the role of built environment and material furnishings of place in shaping encounters with difference; connecting and bridging work, where we discuss the concept of 'transversal enablers', and intercultural gift exchange; and intercultural habitus, where disposition, habit and linguistic accommodation are discussed. It closes with some reflection upon larger forces that mediate local encounters, and the necessity to consider the full range of interactions, patterns, behaviours and meanings at work, and the interconnection between 'happy' and 'hard' forms of coexistence.

T1  - Productive Intolerance: Godly Nationalism in Indonesia
AN  - 1545321229
AB  - Abstract              Since democratization, Indonesia has played host to a curious form of ethnic conflict: militant vigilante groups attacking a small, socially marginal religious sect called Ahmadiyah. While most scholars attribute the violence to intolerance by radicals on the periphery of society, this article proposes a different reading based on an intertwined reconfiguration of Indonesian nationalism and religion. I suggest that Indonesia contains a common but overlooked example of "godly nationalism," an imagined community bound by a shared theism and mobilized through the state in cooperation with religious organizations. This model for nationalism is modern, plural, and predicated on the exclusion of religious heterodoxy. Newly collected archival and ethnographic material reveal how the state's and Muslim civil society's long-standing exclusion of Ahmadiyah and other heterodox groups has helped produce the "we-feeling" that helps constitute contemporary Indonesian nationalism. I conclude by intervening in a recent debate about religious freedom to suggest that conflicts over blasphemy reflect Muslim civil society's effort to delineate an incipient model of nationalism and tolerance while avoiding the templates of liberal secularism or theocracy.

T1  - The Myanmar Peace Center: Its Origins, Activities, and Aspirations
AN  - 2468686966
AB  - Ganesan discusses the origins, activities, and aspirations of the Myanmar Peace Center (MPC). MPC is one of the newest organizations with a focus on peace in Asia. It was initially formed in October 2012 with a core group of 13 members. Since then it has gone on to become a much larger and also much more institutionalized organization. The nature of its work differs from that of most other peace research centers in that it is the organization appointed by the Myanmar President and government to bring an end to ethnic and sectarian conflict in the country. The MPC, unlike other organizations, is actively involved in negotiating peace with the country's major ethnic insurgent groups, many of which have been fighting the government for almost six decades now. The author traces the origins of the MPC and its mandate within the Myanmar government's ongoing attempts to sign a nation-wide ceasefire deal to bring closure to the long history of ethnic conflict that has plagued the country.

T1  - Fencing a Field: Imagined Others in the Unfolding of a Neighborhood Park Conflict
AN  - 1531933328; 201424616
AB  - This article offers a detailed analysis of a neighborhood dispute over fencing a public park. Unlike the archetypal turf battles between longstanding and new neighborhood residents described in previous research, here the daily visits of Latino 'outsiders' coming into a local public space produce conflict over park usage and control. The usually cited conditions for conflict, such as reactionary residents resisting ethnic transition and protecting their backyards, do not apply in this case, as the park sits amidst a relatively stable, affluent, white 'liberal' neighborhood. This case study shows how sources of tension and trouble extend beyond the property interests and actions of the park users to include the more symbolic and indirect concerns about identity as reflected in park use. Together with longstanding concerns over neighborhood reputation and property values, changing demographics and greater sensitivity to the perception of racism distinctively shaped the unfolding of conflict in this case. The bumpy course of conflict and shifting opinions about the fence shed light on the new complexities and contradictions of contemporary social diversity and exclusion in city parks and other public spaces.

T1  - The making of Malaysian solidarity: A historical look at education and social cohesion in Sarawak
AN  - 2488746895
AB  - In a multi-ethnic, multicultural and multi religious country like Malaysia an education system that promotes inclusion and participation of all citizens, where diversity of learners is recognised and acknowledged would certainly enhance national solidarity. Such an inclusive education, which aspires to promote social cohesion through greater understanding, respect and interactions among students, may be grounded on the four principles/pillars of learning to know, learning to do, learning to be and learning to live together. The demographic plurality of Malaysia which consists of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia, and the states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo calls for this inclusive education system. How much do Malaysians know about one another? In particular, how much do Malaysians from Peninsular Malaysia know about their fellow citizens in Sabah and Sarawak, and vice versa? Sarawak, being the only state in Malaysia ruled by ‘white Rajahs’ for about a century, offers an interesting opportunity to see whether the education system evolved has promoted inclusion and social cohesion within itself as well as within the larger Malaysian society. By analysing the history of Sarawak education, beginning with the Brooke rule from 1841 to 1946, and continuing to the British administration from 1946 to 1963 this article concludes that social cohesion beyond inter-ethnic boundaries was not considered an important agenda during the Brooke as well as the British administrations thus leaving the present government with the ongoing monumental task of effectively utilising education in the making of the Malaysian solidarity .

T1  - Do National Feelings Influence Public Attitudes towards Immigration?
AN  - 2076977386
AB  - This study empirically explores the link between national feelings and attitudes towards immigrants, as expressed by American citizens. Based on symbolic politics theory, I argue that a person's symbolic concerns toward the nation are an important predictor of immigration attitudes. Employing the 2004 General Social Survey, I use the structural equation model and expose the multidimensional nature of national feelings. Focusing on three types of national feeling-nationalism, national identity and national pride-I find that each has differing impacts on attitudes toward immigrants. Nationalism provokes anti-immigrant sentiment, while national pride leads to pro-immigrant sentiment. On the other hand, national identity has no positive or negative impact on immigration attitudes. The results imply that American citizens' attitudes toward immigrants can be traced to their attitude toward the country.

T1  - Psychological Essentialism and Nationalism as Determinants of Interethnic Bias
AN  - 1559004863; 201431891
AB  - The present study examined whether individuals without strong national identity (i.e., low nationalism) would be susceptible to temporarily elicited essentialism to alter their mental representations of ethnic boundaries, and thus increase interethnic bias. To test these ideas we experimentally induced essentialist beliefs among Japanese subjects about the boundary between Japanese and Chinese ethnicities, while measuring the strength of nationalism as an individual variable. The results were generally consistent with predictions, suggesting that the activation of essentialist beliefs can strengthen interethnic biases among people without strong nationalism.

T1  - Situational Radicalism: The Israeli "Arab Spring" and the (Un)Making of the Rebel City
AN  - 1429639752; 201336624
AB  - Monterescu and Shaindlinger analyze the emergence of political subjectivity in the Israeli Spring (an overlooked moment in the Arab Uprisings, in which Israeli's and Palestinians expressed solidarity with the movements in the surrounding countries). They argue that the potentially revolutionary subject of "the sovereign people" was empty in this case (not to mention that other similar symbols/signifiers lost their concreteness) and these emptied symbols failed to provide the impetus to keep the movements moving. The movement's exclusion (or maybe even movements' exclusions!) of alternate political identities ("alterities") undermined the movement's potential for radical change. Although it claimed to represent 'the people,' a dominant majority imposed its identity on minorities, either speaking for them or excluding them entirely -- thus undermining the pluralistic and radical qualities that the movement purported to represent.

T1  - Intergroup Perception and Proactive Majority Integration Attitudes
AN  - 1448995929; 201342720
AB  - Few social psychological investigations have focused on the potential active role of the majority in integration. The present study examines the relationship between intergroup perception and majority attitudes toward the proactive integration of immigrant minorities in Norway. It assesses how and whether perceived entitativity of immigrants, endorsement of counterstereotypic portrayals of immigrants and metaperspectives along the appraisal dimensions of warmth/competence predict the integration attitudes of majority members in Norway as measured by the Majority Integration Efforts (MIE) scale. Correlational and multiple regression analysis yielded two strong (perceptions of positive immigrant integration intentions and perceived entitativity) and two moderate (perceptions of high immigrant competence in Norwegian society and metawarmth) predictors of these attitudes. Further analysis indicated that the main effect of perceived immigrant entitativity on MIE attitudes was partially mediated by perceptions of counterstereotypic intentions and competence. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. We conclude by highlighting how the perception of immigrants' positive integration intentions and their heterogeneity as a group may best promote majority support for proactive integration efforts.

T1  - Contested alien spaces and the search for national identity: a study of ethnicity in light of xenophobic violence on migrants in South Africa
AN  - 2570341434
AB  - Despite great strides made in transforming the State from authoritarian rule to multi-party democracy since 1994, the government of South Africa is facing the challenge of high influx of migrants especially from African countries north of the Limpopo River. The project of building a Rainbow Nation has been mainly centred on racial transformation but the high influx of migrants especially from African countries resulted in the reproduction of new forms of hatred and resentment. The new African migrants increased the competition of accessing national resources in a country with high inequalities yet with plenty of resources. It may be suggested that the increase in xenophobic violence since the early 2000s might be posited in a broader context. This study insisted on the argument that the xenophobic violence against African immigrants in South Africa is also embodied in the new ethnic constructions of nationalism in Africa in the era of globalisation where human mobility has become an important element in defining the African political landscape and access to resources. Historically, tensions and conflicts among ethnic groups in colonial and post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa, in general, also manifested the competitions resulted from the desire to control national resources and safeguarding social order. Xenophobic violence reflects discriminatory tendencies which are not only driven by the desire to legitimise entitlements to national resources but also of perceiving African non-nationals as a threat to social order and ethnic identity.

T1  - Lowell Immigrant Communities in the Climate of Deportations
AN  - 1347781634; 201322192
AB  - In the climate of increased anti-immigrant sentiment, deportations of immigrants from the United States are on the upsurge. This article begins with a review of current immigration laws enabling detentions and deportations of undocumented immigrants, as well as permanent legal residents with a prior criminal conviction. It then explores how immigrants and refugees interact with this national climate in Lowell, Massachusetts, a traditional immigrant city in the Northeast of the United States. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions have clearly had an impact on Lowell. Our findings indicate that fear and mistrust of local authorities is driving behavior of immigrants, who are reluctant to seek medical services or to report violence to the police, whom they suspect of collaborating with ICE.

T1  - Constrict in the School Context: The Impact of Ethnic School Diversity on the Quantity and Quality of Friendships
AN  - 1073472824
AB  - Constrict theory states that, in the short run, ethnic diversity in any context lowers both the quantity and the quality of interpersonal contacts. We test this theory in the school context, expecting that ethnic school diversity yields fewer and lower quality friendships. Moreover, we investigate whether the associations hold when controlling for the school's socioeconomic situation, and whether the relations between ethnic school diversity and the social outcomes differ between natives and immigrants. Multilevel analyses on data from the Flemish Educational Assessment, consisting of 10,546 natives and 1,324 immigrants in 85 secondary schools, show that ethnic diversity yields fewer friendships and a lower attachment to friends. However, this appears to be due to the schools' socioeconomic composition. For immigrants, moreover, a higher ethnic diversity yields more friendships and a higher attachment to friends. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Doing Multiculturalism: An Interactionist Analysis of the Practices of a Multicultural Sorority
AN  - 1928211552
AB  - Despite the many references to multiculturalism in academic works and media accounts, we know little about what it is like in practice. Drawing on data from interviews, ethnographic observations, and archival materials from a multicultural sorority chapter, this article highlights three main ways its members do multiculturalism: (1) recognizing and valuing differences, (2) teaching and learning about differences, and (3) bridging differences via personal friendships and organizational alliances. Broad racial ideologies and the culture of the university and the Greek system, however, created the conditions under which sorority members do multiculturalism, including their focus on some differences (e.g., race, ethnicity, and sexual identity) and neglect of others (i.e., class and gender). While the multicultural sorority sought to lessen racial divisions on campus and their approach opposed colorblind ideology, they presented little challenge to the hegemony of the campus Greek system. This study has implications for understanding Greek Letter Organizations, multiculturalism as a collective practice, and how countering colorblind ideology can reproduce other inequality-legitimating ideologies.

T1  - Some Remarks about Linguistic Expressions in Writings about Ethnicity and Conflict: The Case of Yugoslavia
AN  - 925712452; 201205499
AB  - The paper suggests that the extensive and frequently controversial literature about the 1990s Yugoslav crisis can be viewed as an opportunity for reflection on the discourse itself. The article examines the role of ethnonyms and some related linguistic expressions used in scholarly and other writings about the demise of Yugoslavia. The examination has shown that the linguistic simplifications covering different social groups with umbrella expressions such as the Croats, the Serbs, etc. may constitute a source of puzzlement and even inaccuracy. It is argued that ethnic studies in general would gain much by paying more attention to nuances than by relying on ethnonyms as if they were clear-cut concepts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Class, ethnicity, gender and Latino entrepreneurship
AN  - 887747560
AB  - For Salvadorans, strong communities characterized by ethnic cohesion and ethnic-based social capital are essential features that help establish Salvadoran entrepreneurship, especially in light of their lower class status and their culturally rooted distrust of market institutions, which hinder their access to class-based resources.  "Institutional gatekeepers" (169) confirm entrepreneurs' perception that structural opportunities and federal support for Latino small business is limited and generally ineffective; at the same time, government leaders and gatekeepers suggest that Latinos need stronger leaders and community organizers to combat the barriers to enterprise that Latinos face, which include the recent economic downturn of the economy and a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment.

T1  - “Foreign Brides” Meet Ethnic Politics in Taiwan: IMR
AN  - 2558413905
AB  - A great number of women from China, Vietnam, and Indonesia recently arrived in Taiwan to marry men of lower social strata. Such an unusual pattern of migration has stimulated debates about the status and the citizenship of the new arrivals. This study analyzes Taiwanese responses toward these marriage migrants by using a national survey conducted in 2004. Three aspects of restrictive attitudes were tapped concerning these newcomers: (1) rights to work; (2) access to public health insurance; and (3) full citizenship. Immigrants from China were most opposed, compared to women with other origins (Southeast Asia, Japan, Europe, and the US). The seemingly unrelated regression estimation regression results do not support the split labor market hypotheses, as marriage migrants do not appear to be economic threats toward members of the lower classes. In contrast, ethnic nationalism plays a key role in determining the natives’ restrictive attitudes. The case of Taiwan represents a special genre, where ethnic politics selectively arouses the social rejection of women immigrants of certain origins.

T1  - Playing the role of 'cultural expert': teachers of ethnic difference in Britain and Australia
AN  - 868009812; 201113428
AB  - This article brings together the findings of two separate studies in Britain and Australia that sought to examine the experiences of teachers of ethnic difference. Drawing on qualitative data, we examine how early-career and mid-career minority ethnic teachers in Britain and Australia, respectively, understand and take up the role of 'cultural expert', a position generated through expectations that they will be mentors and role models for ethnic minority students as well as curriculum and pedagogy leaders within schools. The newly qualified British teachers were generally positive about their positioning as cultural experts because the recognition of their knowledge about minority ethnic cultures, traditions and languages enabled them to develop self-esteem and, in turn, led them towards self-actualisation. The experienced Australian teachers, however, perceived their role as 'cultural expert' as problematic because the demands and associated increase in workload led to disenchantment and burn-out and reduced opportunities for their career development on a broader level. We conclude by raising issues around teacher education and the recruitment of minority ethnic teachers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Crisscrossing Gender, Ethnicity, and Race: African Religious Legacy in Cuban Contemporary Women's Art
AN  - 1046178826
AB  - Despite the many redistributive social policies that the Cuban Revolution implemented, the crisis of the Special Period has had severe consequences for Afro-Cubans, who are overrepresented in the poorer sectors of Cuban society. At the same time, the loss of many social benefits and increased social competition have fueled previously underlying racial prejudices. Like other cultural manifestations, such as Cuban rap music, the visual arts have launched a public discussion about the growing social fracture set offby the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of racial inequalities. From 1997 to 2011, the Queloides art exhibits have presented the work of a number of artists that are currently focusing their artistic practices on issues of race and racism. A strategy implemented in the artwork to contest social processes of racialization has been the representation of Afro-Cuban religious practices, previously marginalized or reduced to folklore. In this context, the use of the Afro-Cuban legacy enables women artists to reflect on the consistency of identity markers such as race, gender, and ethnicity. In this article, I am particularly interested in revealing how subjectivity informs this artwork and how it is conceived as a site for reinvention at which identity markers are restructured and redefined.

T1  - Conflict and Cooperation in Market Spaces: Learning from the Operation of Local Networks of Civic Engagement in African Market Trade
AN  - 743042741; 201027382
AB  - This paper is concerned with conflict and the operation of local networks of civic engagement in the Nigerian market place. African markets are commonly significant meeting points-associational sites -- for diverse ethnic and social groups: the economic and social exchange which takes place there in the 'everyday' is the epitome of social engagement and cooperation. But at times of tension the market place is a frequent flashpoint where conflict becomes tangible and conflagration a regular outcome. We examine the role of a range of internal and external institutions and actors in market and trader dispute regulation. Our case study analysis shows the remarkable role which is regularly played by local actors and networks of civic engagement within and in the vicinity of the Nigerian market space to diffuse tension and, where disputes emerge, to reinstate order. These components are a reflection of the value placed on traditional market trading spaces in Nigerian society: they remain essential to the livelihood and wellbeing of millions of people, rich and poor.
