T1  - Predictors of Public Support for Social Safety Net Policy During the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2684209133
AB  - Introduction: U.S. residents had varying experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and social safety net policy in 2020. Past research has suggested that partisanship, ideology, racial attitudes, and personal experience may each influence policy attitudes. In this study, we explore whether variation in support for social safety net policy in 2020 is predicted by negative experiences of the pandemic when controlling for racial attitudes, partisanship, and ideology. Methods: Support for 12 social safety net policies in 2020 was estimated using data from a nationally representative panel survey of U.S. adults conducted in 2020 (n=1,222). Logistic regression was used to examine differences in the predicted probability of supporting a majority of social safety net policies related to health, housing, and employment by partisanship, ideology, racial attitudes, and negative experiences of the pandemic. Analyses were conducted in 2021. Results: Higher levels of symbolic racism was a consistently strong predictor of lower social safety net policy support across health, housing, and employment policies; as was identifying as either Conservative or Republican. Negative experiences of the pandemic were generally unpredictive of support for the social safety net policy. Conclusions: Despite the pandemic's consequences as well as the potential for social safety net policy to address these consequences, negative experiences of the pandemic failed to predict policy support, even as racial attitudes, partisanship, and ideology strongly predicted these preferences in 2020. Building public support for social safety net policy requires communication strategies that identify the shared benefits of these policies.

T1  - Ethnic Stereotypes in the Central Highlands of Vietnam: Minority Students’ Perspectives
AN  - 2668841058
AB  - This study examines ethnic stereotypes toward majority and minority people in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It contributes a more multidimensional perspective on ethnic stereotypes by exploring minority students’ perspectives on how their ethnic group stereotypes Kinh majority people and how they are being stereotyped by the Kinh. Status and solidarity are used as the theoretical lens to gain insights into different stereotype traits and the social meanings underlying the stereotypes. Interviews with eight students in a college in the Central Highlands, which were carried out in 2013, are the main data source. Findings reveal that the students highly appreciated Kinh people’s status-related traits and minority people’s solidarity-related traits. The stereotypes functioned as maintaining the social status quo – where the Kinh justified their position and advantages, while the minorities tended to accept the perceived social status hierarchies. Implications for diminishing negative stereotypes, improving minorities’ existing status, fostering trust-based cross-ethnic contact, and inspiring mutual respect among people of all ethnicities, are hence suggested.

T1  - Profiles of Racial Socialization Messages from Mothers and Fathers and The Colorblind and Anti-Black Attitudes of Asian American Adolescents
AN  - 2661728877
AB  - Racial equality requires coalitions and solidarity across racial groups, but there continues to be racially colorblind and anti-Black attitudes within the Asian American community, a diverse community consisting of individuals with ancestral origins in East, Southeast, and South Asia. However, there is limited research on the factors that contribute to the development of these attitudes among Asian Americans. Parents could potentially play an important role in perpetuating or challenging the colorblind and anti-Black messages that pervade U.S. society. Thus, the current study investigates how 309 Asian American adolescents’ (M age = 16.8; SD = 1.15; 50.5% female) perceptions of parents’ racial socialization messages about race and racism relate to the youth’s racial attitudes. Latent profiles of youth’s perceptions of mothers’ and fathers’ racial socialization messages and their associations with colorblind racial attitudes and anti-Black attitudes were examined. For mothers, three socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant, Race Hesitant, and Race Embracing; for fathers, two socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant and Race Embracing. Adolescents with Race Embracing mothers reported less anti-Black attitudes compared to those who had Race Hesitant mothers. For fathers, there were no differences among the profiles and anti-Black attitudes. However, surprisingly, adolescents with Race Embracing fathers were more likely to have colorblind racial attitudes compared to those with Race Avoidant fathers. The findings highlight the importance of racial socialization in the development of Asian American adolescents’ racial attitudes to continue fighting for interracial solidarity.

T1  - Historical Continuities and Changes in the Ethnic Politics of Hmong-Miao Millenarianism
AN  - 2645711147
AB  - Millenarian movements used to be regarded as native reactions to enormous social disruptions caused by colonial intrusion, doomed to failure and at best a step on the way to more “modern” forms of collective social resistance. In fact, they have both pre-dated and outlasted colonialism, featuring in ethnic politics across Asia and beyond to this day. Nevertheless, its encounter with modernity has not left millenarianism unchanged, as is shown in this article’s historical case study. A comprehensive timeline and mapping of past and present Hmong-Miao millenarian activity highlights several enduring features including a context of economic and political crisis, their transnational nature, the prevalence of manipulation and/or coercion, and specific cultural symbols within supernatural predictions. Equally important are the historical developments, from pan-ethnic to mono-ethnic and from violent to peaceful (but still threatening to political and religious authorities), reflecting historical trends of ethnicisation and territorialisation. The mechanics of such reproductions and transformations are then unpacked, before the Hmong-Miao experience is compared with millenarian activity from other groups of upland Southeast Asia. Millenarianism continues to play a role in voicing social discontent, challenging power structures and moulding ethnic relations, but needs to be examined and understood within evolving socio-political contexts.Alternate abstract:Second-language abstract (Vietnamese)Trong lịch sử, những phong trào báo hiệu thời đại hoàng kim (millenarian movements) được các nhà nghiên cứu giải thích là cách phản ứng của người địa phương đối với tình trạng đảo lộn xã hội do sự thực dân hóa phương Tây. Những phong trào này được coi là “lạc hậu”, chắc chắn thất bại và sẽ bị thay thế bởi loại kháng cự “hiện đại” hơn. Thực ra, hiện tượng thời đại hoàng kim (millenarianism) đã có mặt trước thời kỳ thực dân và vẫn tồn tại đến ngày nay, tiếp tục biểu lộ trong hoạt động chính trị sắc tộc khắp Châu Á. Bài này tìm hiểu lịch sử hiện tượng thời đại hoàng kim trong cộng đồng dân tộc H’mông-Miao để so sánh các phong trào cũ với các phong trào mới, xảy ra gần đây. Có nhiều đặc điểm giống nhau từ trước đến nay bao gồm: tình trạng khủng hoảng kinh tế-chính trị, phong trào vượt phạm vi quốc gia, luận điệu lôi kéo hoặc ép buộc, biểu tượng văn hóa đặc trưng, và lời tiên tri siêu nhiên. Cũng có hai sự phát triển theo niên đại quan trọng: các phong trào báo hiệu thời đại hoàng kim đã biến đổi (1) đối với mặt sắc tộc từ đa dạng đến một sắc tộc thôi; (2) từ hoạt động mãnh liệt đến hoạt động hòa bình. Hai xu thế phát triển này phản ánh hai quá trình lịch sử là ‘sắc tộc hóa’ (ethnicisation) và ‘lãnh thổ hóa’ (teritorialisation). Bài này cũng so sánh trải nghiệm H’mông-Miao với các hoạt động tương tự của những dân tộc khác trong khu vực miền núi Đông Nam Á. Hiện tượng thời đại hoàng kim tiếp tục thể hiện vai trò lên tiếng về những bất mãn xã hội, thách thức cấu trúc quyền lực và ảnh hưởng tới các mối quan hệ xã hội, nhưng chúng ta phải tìm hiểu hiện tượng này trong bối cảnh xã hội, chính trị thay đổi.

T1  - Resisting Privilege: Effects of a White Privilege Message Intervention and Conservative Media Use on Freedom Threat and Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2662236714
AB  - Identifying ways to effectively communicate about racial/ethnic disparities is a place where communication scholars can make vital contributions. Yet, existing studies on this subject are scarce. Borrowing from reactance theory and the 3D model of White identity management, the present study tested whether exposing White adults to White privilege messaging helps them to become more aware or deny racial privilege. The results of our experiment revealed that there was a main effect for reading about racial privilege and increased awareness of privilege. However, in keeping with reactance theory, if the message stoked a perceived threat to freedom, message exposure resulted in the denial of both blatant and institutional racism. We also found a moderating role for Fox News viewing such that awareness of racial privilege was not affected by the intervention for heavy Fox News viewers, but it was for low Fox News viewers. We conclude that messages focused on explaining White privilege are promising, but there are risks.

T1  - Criminal Justice Students’ Perceptions and Awareness of Racism and Discrimination
AN  - 2635446142
AB  - The recent focus on the controversial deaths of minorities at the hands of police officers has led to increased attention on racial bias among the law enforcement community. However, this focus does not extend to criminal justice students. Instead, research examining undergraduates’ racial attitudes focuses on the general student body. In addition to reviewing literature related to criminal justice students’ attitudes toward a variety of criminal justice and social issues, the current study used multiple regression analyses to examine racial and gender differences in a Southwestern University’s criminal justice students’ perceptions of and sensitivity to racism. Findings from the study indicate that male criminal justice students in the sample and White criminal justice students are more likely to have lower perceptions of racism than their female and non-White counterparts, respectively. Additionally, findings for criminal justice students’ sensitivity to racism suggest that White male criminal justice students’ sensitivity to racism only statistically significantly differs from non-White females with White males more likely to be less sensitive than non-White females. Furthermore, the current research provides a benchmark for research related to criminal justice students’ perceptions of racism and discriminatory practices and their attitudes toward minorities. Results, study implications, recommendations, and future research are discussed.

T1  - Why So Much Ado About a Hairdo? Examining How the Hair Choices of Black Women Vary by Occupation
AN  - 2643280738
AB  - To better understand negative stereotypes and biases against natural Black hairstyles (e.g., afros, braids, dreadlocks), this study examines the hair style choices of Black women working in four occupational groups finance, medicine, law, and technology). Using literature on identity shifting, professional identity, and professional appearance norms, we predicted variation in the hairstyle choices of Black women employed in these four occupations. Results indicate Black women technology professionals were significantly more likely to wear natural hairstyles than any of the other three occupations. Black women lawyers were significantly less likely than either physicians or women in technology to wear natural hairstyles. As predicted, the more conservative and formal the work environment, the more likely Black woman adjust their hairstyle to mirror white standards of what is viewed as professional.

T1  - Diversity and age stereotypes in portrayals of older adults in popular American primetime television series
AN  - 2592134884
AB  - To examine the prevalence and diversity of older adults on primetime television, and age stereotyping in these portrayals, we analysed the contents of 112 episodes of popular American television series aired between 2004 and 2018. We identified 6.6 per cent of characters as aged 65 and older – a slight improvement to the values reported in previous studies. However, older adult characters are still grossly under-represented, considering the actual proportion of older adults in the general population of the United States of America. Further, the typical older character was young-old, male, Caucasian, middle-class, able-bodied and straight – if his sexuality was referenced. Older women still face double discrimination in media representations. In addition, older adult characters with ethnicities other than Caucasian and African American are virtually invisible in primetime fiction series. Similarly, old-old characters, sexual minorities and persons with disabilities are particularly rare among older adult characters in this type of programming. Finally, portrayals of 51.9 per cent of characters included at least some elements of age stereotypes, most of which were positive. The most commonly applied positive and negative stereotypes were found to be the golden ager and the shrew, respectively. The findings are discussed in the context of the dominant discourse of ageing and the potential implications of how various social groups perceive ageing and older adults.

T1  - Brexit, COVID‐19, and attitudes toward immigration in Britain
AN  - 2602939379
AB  - ObjectiveA key issue in Britain's referendum on European Union membership was the free movement of labor into Britain, with Brexit “Leavers” having more negative attitudes toward immigrants than “Remainers.” Such anti‐immigrant attitudes are driven by feelings of threat. The coronavirus pandemic presented a new threat in the context of ongoing Brexit negotiations. This paper examines how the COVID‐19 pandemic affected anti‐immigrant attitudes and how these effects differ between Leavers and Remainers.MethodsUsing an online survey in Spring 2020 of 3,708 individuals residing in the UK, we experimentally test the effect of priming COVID‐19 thoughts on anti‐immigrant attitudes, and examine whether this effect varies by Brexit identity.ResultsWe show that COVID‐19 may exacerbate anti‐immigrant attitudes among Leavers while having little effect on Remainers.ConclusionThese findings support the idea that the coronavirus pandemic might have presented a new, viral, threat that heightened anti‐immigrant attitudes among certain political identities.

T1  - The Han saviour behind the blackface: racialised and gendered media representations in Africa–China popular geopolitics
AN  - 2579221129
AB  - In this article, I provide a critical look into the cultural politics of racialised and gendered representations in Africa–China related mediascapes from the perspective of “popular geopolitics.” Geopolitical frameworks have been used in political science and international relations research to analyse Africa–China issues, but have been remarkably overlooked as methodological tools for making sense of the cultural politics of Afro-Chinese racialised politics and narratives, and their implications. To breach this gap, I focus on a number of recent controversial incidents (e.g. an advertisement, a theatrical skit, and debates around social media posts) that weave old and new racist rhetoric/tropes, and gendered stereotypes, into evolving processes of racialisation that inform everyday geopolitical imaginaries of the Africa–China encounter. This is followed by a brief discussion where I use the notion of “multiple triangulations” to trace the routes through which negative stereotypes about blackness could have entered China. By specifically looking at contemporary popular media representations of Africa and blackness, I show how “race,” ethnicity, gender, class and nationalism, problematically underwrite, and are written into a rhetoric that evinces geopolitical asymmetries that characterise crucial areas of Africa–China relations. Throughout the article, I argue that there is an emerging pattern where Chineseness is discursively constructed as a “replacement” for whiteness.

T1  - Concealment of nonreligious identity: Exploring social identity threat among atheists and other nonreligious individuals: GPIR
AN  - 2558389135
AB  - Negative attitudes toward the nonreligious persist in America. This may compel some nonreligious individuals to conceal their identity to manage feelings of social identity threat. In one correlational study and one experiment, we found evidence of social identity threat and concealment behavior among nonreligious Americans. Our first study showed that Southern nonreligious individuals reported higher levels of stigma consciousness and self-reported concealment of nonreligious identity, which in turn predicted lower likelihood of self-identifying as “atheist” in public settings than in private settings. Our second study successfully manipulated feelings of social identity threat by showing that atheists who read an article about negative stereotypes of their group subsequently exhibited higher concealment scores than did atheists who read one of two control articles. Implications for how nonreligious individuals negotiate social identity threat and future directions for nonreligion research are discussed.

T1  - Discourses about race in the United States: A thematic analysis of short essays
AN  - 2566522241
AB  - Conversations around race have come to the forefront of public discourses in the United States with incidents of police brutality leading to movements such as Black Lives Matter and its opposition, All Lives Matter. Although there is substantial psychological literature focusing on racial attitudes and intergroup relations, much of this research is experimental, failing to capture diverse and evolving viewpoints of people in the United States. In the present study, our aim was to understand folk definitions and diverse perspectives about the role of race in the United States in participants' own words. We thematically analyzed submissions to The Race Card Project (n = 913), a publicly available platform, and responses from a sample of college students describing perspectives on race (n = 1092). A total of 27 identified themes were organized in four domains: opinions about race, race-based interactions, race and identity, and emotions. Opinions about race ranged from color-blind ideology to racial equality, race as divisive or providing community, and excessive focus on race. References were made to historic and current race relations, assumptions based on skin color, prejudice and discrimination, White privilege, and "reverse racism." These findings contribute to evolving scholarly understanding of race in the United States, with implications for informing initiatives to promote race relations and reduce experiences of discrimination for individuals of color.

T1  - Associations of regional racial attitudes with chronic illness in the United States
AN  - 2556435690
AB  - Rationale A growing body of literature has identified a robust relationship between the experience of racial discrimination and negative self-reported physical and mental health outcomes. Objective The current study seeks to identify which factors -at the community level- predict racial disparities in actual disease manifestation. This study focuses on the extent to which regional demographics and racial attitudes, both implicit and explicit, are associated with prevalence rates of several diseases for Black and White patients in the United States. Methods Implicit and explicit racial attitudes obtained from Project Implicit (Xu et al., 2017) were aggregated at the county level to predict variation in the prevalence rates of several chronic illnesses among Medicare recipients. Results When controlling for economic indicators, Black and White patients who live in areas with high implicit and explicit racial bias tend to exhibit a higher incidence of chronic health problems, including cancer, stroke, asthma, diabetes, and heart failure. These relationships tended to be stronger for Black patients. Additionally, patients in racially diverse and racially segregated regions also tended to exhibit a higher incidence of chronic health problems. Conclusion Findings from the study highlight the reliable relationship between both racial biases and regional demographics and the incidence rates of several chronic diseases, particularly in Black patients.

T1  - Schooling, education, and the reproduction of inequality: understanding Black and Minority Ethnic attitudes to learning in two London schools
AN  - 2541139230
AB  - The argument here places the personal reflections of BAME students and educators at the forefront in this discussion of racial inequity in the British educational system. The contributors are stakeholders who have an investment in schooling, either as student or educator, that cannot be reduced to the four walls of the classroom. It features interviews and personal communications that shed light on what needs to be done to correct disparities in educational outcomes for BAME students. Emphasis is placed on the quality of their contributions and the importance of having a positive black presence in their teaching and learning environments. It features candid reflections on the rights or wrongs of having a Black History Month (BHM) celebration, especially in the wake of the introduction in 2008 of Black History as the ‘Slave Trade’ in the National Curriculum, which many considered, and still believe was ill thought through at the time.

T1  - Support for the political community in a community that doesn’t support you: immigrant youths’ exposure to anti-immigrant attitudes
AN  - 2534831632
AB  - Expressions of hostility in immigrants’ surrounding environment have been shown to negatively influence their relation to the political society. The impact of such contextual hostility on immigrant youths and political community support however remains unexplored. Filling these gaps, I test the hypothesis that contextual hostility decreases immigrant youths’ political community support, captured with a sense of national pride. In addition, I test two rivalling hypotheses regarding the influence of contextual hostility on the so-called second generation of immigrants, expecting the impact to be either weaker or stronger among the second generation of immigrants in comparison to the first generation. Analysing survey data on the political beliefs of youths in secondary school classes in Sweden, my main finding is that immigrant youths in school classes with high levels of anti-immigrant attitudes are less supportive of the political community, entailing a potential legitimacy problem for the democratic system. The impact of anti-immigrant attitudes among the second generation of immigrants is in turn weak or non-existing.

T1  - Xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes in the time of COVID-19: GPIR
AN  - 2497530756
AB  - The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nations and individuals has almost certainly led to increased feelings of threat and competition, heightened uncertainty, lack of control, and a rise in authoritarianism. In this paper we use social psychological and sociological theories to explore the anticipated effects on xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes worldwide. Based on our analysis, we discuss recommendations for further research required during the ups and downs of the pandemic, as well as during recovery. We also discuss the need for research to address how to best counteract this expected surge in xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes. As the pandemic persists, it will be important to systematically examine its effects on xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes, and to develop and implement strategies that keep these negative attitudes at bay.

T1  - Racial Issues and Behavior Analysis: Experiences and Contributions From Brazil
AN  - 2624218339
AB  - Racial disparities are a major social issue that affects not only Brazil but also the world. Racial inequalities in Brazil are highlighted in several social indicators, such as living conditions, years of education, mortality rates, and unemployment rates, among others. The current article aims to highlight the Brazilian contribution to research exploring the relationship between racial issues and behavior analysis to bring visibility to the work of Brazilian researchers and professors. Four contributions of Brazilian researchers are highlighted: (a) behavior-analytic accounts of racial prejudice, (b) stereotype threat (a phenomenon that shows that the performance of an able individual can be impaired when a negative stereotype about this person’s group is highlighted), (c) institutional racism in the Brazilian Military Police Force, and (d) the use of latency-based measures to assess racial biases. We finish with suggestions for future research and for increasing collaboration between Brazilian researchers and researchers in English-speaking (and other) countries, making our contributions more accessible to foreign researchers and students.

T1  - Antisemitism, Anti-Zionism, and the American Racial Order: Revisiting the American Council for Judaism in the Twenty-First Century
AN  - 2578185974
AB  - Like their British counterparts, American Jewish leaders have also articulated antisemitism differently at different points in time and revisiting those historical articulations can likewise shed light on the fears, priorities, and political imaginations of the actors who embraced them.

[...]competing Jewish conceptions of antisemitism have occasionally come into conflict with one another, fueling intra-Jewish disputes and resource struggles that clarify the stakes of American Jewish politics in a given period.

The analysis that follows excavates the largely forgotten post-1948 history of the Council; establishes its ideological continuity with earlier, more politically dominant forces in American Jewish life; and explores the linkages between its anti-Zionism, its approach to antisemitism, and its conservative racial politics.4 Far from being of purely antiquarian significance, the history of the Council reveals how American Jewish constructions of antisemitism are in part a reflection of the way their proponents understand the position of Jews in the American racial order.5 The closing section sketches the development of the communal antisemitism paradigm that emerged hegemonic in the wake of the Council's downfall—the so-called "new antisemitism" paradigm—and highlights the role of reconstituted racial anxieties in its own formulation.6 Both the "new antisemitism" paradigm and the paradigm advanced by the Council link race, antisemitism, and anti-Zionism in a unique ideological assemblage intended to advance the interests of its adherents.

In the aftermath of the Six-Day War, as Israel cemented its Cold War alliance with the United States, Jewish organizations pulled back from domestic struggles for racial and economic justice in favor of colorblind liberalism in the public sphere and a more Israel-centric program of communal regeneration internally.7 Following a transitional period in which Jewish organizations subsumed antisemitism under the broader rubric of "prejudice," they reconceptualized it in the 1970s around the security of the Jewish state.8 While critical accounts of the new antisemitism paradigm correctly situate its development in the context of New Left and Black Power reactions to the 1967 war, a comparison with the Council reframes it as part of a longer history of American Jewish debate over the definition of antisemitism and its relationship to Jewish racial and national identity.

The elite consensus in favor of a religious definition of Jewishness crystalized in the aftermath of Reconstruction, when reassertions of white supremacy at home and imperialism abroad intersected with Jewish mass migration and popular eugenic discourses to engender a surge of racial antisemitism.13 After 1897, the development of a more centrally organized Zionist movement anchored largely by recent Eastern European immigrants added a new dynamic of political conflict to existing divides between immigrant Jews and native-born Jewish elites of Central European ("German") extraction.14 As Eric Goldstein has shown, the tendency of early Zionists to fortify their nation-building project with references to Jewish racial identity was increasingly seen by members of the Jewish establishment as a clear and present danger to their continued social integration with white American society.

T1  - Ethnic Stereotype Formation and Its Impact on Sojourner Adaptation: A Case of “Belt and Road” Chinese Migrant Workers in Montenegro
AN  - 2576412652
AB  - Ethnic stereotypes are cognitive markers that are formed and modified because of intercultural contact with a new cultural group. There is now much empirical evidence that explicates how stereotypes of ethnic groups can impact individuals’ acculturation experiences. However, what is unknown is how previously nonexistent ethnic beliefs are formed as a result of contact with the local culture. One hundred and seventy-four (N = 174) overseas Chinese construction workers were contacted through the Chinese Consulate in Montenegro and agreed to participate in the present study. The online questionnaire asked workers to describe Montenegrin majority members in terms of five characteristics. These traits formed the stereotype markers that were classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Sojourners also answered questions that measured perceived cultural distance, social exclusion, knowledge of Montenegrin culture, feelings of social exclusion, and their sociocultural adaptation. Results show that both positive and negative stereotypes are correlated with less social exclusion and better socio-cultural adaptation. Perceived cultural distance, knowledge of host culture and length of stay was mediated by stereotypes on adaptation outcomes. Interestingly longer sojourn did not lessen the type of stereotype, nor did it reduce cultural distance. Contribution to the stereotype literature and practical understanding of how Chinese sojourners see majority members will be discussed.

T1  - Portrayal of Immigrants in Danish Media—A Qualitative Content Analysis
AN  - 2544532760
AB  - Media coverage can affect audiences’ perceptions of immigrants, and can play a role in determining the content of public policy agendas, the formation of prejudices, and the prevalence of negative stereotyping. This study investigated the way in which immigrants are represented in the Danish media, which terms are used, what issues related to immigrants and immigration are discussed and how they are described, and whose voices are heard. The data consisted of media articles published in the two most widely read Danish newspapers in 2019. Inductive qualitative content analysis was conducted. The portrayal of immigrants was generally negative. Overall, immigrants were portrayed as economic, cultural and security threats to the country. The most salient immigrant groups mentioned in the media were non-Westerners, Muslims, and people ‘on tolerated stay’. Integration, xenophobia and racial discrimination were the three immigrant-related issues most frequently presented by the media. The media gave voice mainly to politicians and immigrant women. The material showed that Danes have a strong affinity for ‘Danishness’, which the papers explained as a major barrier to the integration and acceptance of immigrants in Denmark.

T1  - The #MeToo Movement and Korean Journalism: Comments on Online News Coverage of the Trial of Former Governor Ahn Hee-jung
AN  - 2544274839
AB  - The purpose of this study is to reveal the discursive structure of Korean society regarding sexual violence through an analysis of news coverage of the Me Too movement, particularly as it regards allegations against former South Chungcheong Province Governor Ahn Hee-jung, and comments left by netizens on portal news sites. Media reports and commenters on news emphasized the vetting of sexual assault victims, exacerbating secondary victimization in this case. The media knowingly presented Ahns case devoid of context and actively supported perceptions that "the victim initiated the situation." Secondary victimization caused by the media and news comment sections is a distinctive phenomenon found in situations related to Korea's portal services. Negative stereotypes of victims of sexual violence and attitudes that are suspicious of testimonies from victimized women are reproduced into a sense of public opinion, illustrating need for feministic intervention into online comment culture.

T1  - Potential Impact of COVID-19–Related Racial Discrimination on the Health of Asian Americans
AN  - 2456178650
AB  - Anti-Asian discrimination and assaults have increased significantly during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, contributing to a "secondary contagion" of racism. The United States has a long and well-documented history of both interpersonal and structural anti-Asian discrimination, and the current pandemic reinforces longstanding negative stereotypes of this rapidly growing minority group as the "Yellow Peril." We provide a general overview of the history of anti-Asian discrimination in the United States, review theoretical and empirical associations between discrimination and health, and describe the associated public health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, citing relevant evidence from previous disasters in US history that became racialized. Although the literature suggests that COVID-19 will likely have significant negative effects on the health of Asian Americans and other vulnerable groups, there are reasons for optimism as well.These include the emergence of mechanisms for reporting and tracking incidents of racial bias, increased awareness of racism's insidious harms and subsequent civic and political engagement by the Asian American community, and further research into resilience-promoting factors that can reduce the negative health effects of racism.

T1  - Six Propositions against Ageism in the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2419922583
AB  - The risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 and of dying from it increases with age. This statistical association has led to numerous highly problematic policy suggestions and comments revealing underlying ageist attitudes and promoting age discrimination. Such attitudes are based on negative stereotypes on the health and functioning of older adults. As a result, the lives of older people are disvalued, including in possible triage situations and in the potential limitation of some measures against the spread of the pandemic to older adults. These outcomes are unjustified and unethical. We develop six propositions against the ageism underlying these suggestions to spur a more adequate response to the current pandemic in which the needs and dignity of older people are respected.

T1  - Concerns regarding immigration in Germany: how subjective fears, becoming unemployed and social mobility change anti-immigrant attitudes
AN  - 2417039318
AB  - This article analyzes how anti-immigrant attitudes shift when individuals experience changes in their subjective and objective economic situations. To do this, we use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP, N ≈ 14,700) and apply fixed-effects multinomial logit panel regression models as a statistical framework. The social identity approach is applied as a theoretical perspective to explain how individual incidents can lead to group-based devaluations. Our findings show almost no effect of social mobility and shifts in the household income, while more disruptive events, such as becoming unemployed, significantly increase the probability of having stronger anti-immigrant attitudes. However, the largest shift in anti-immigrant attitudes is observed when fears of a worsening economic situation increase.

T1  - Attitudes and Beliefs of Italian Educators and Teachers Regarding Children Raised by Same-Sex Parents
AN  - 2188816958
AB  - Teachers and educators represent meaningful relationships for children, and their attitudes can have a major influence on a child’s development. This research examined the role of background characteristics, contact experiences, and sexual prejudice in determining beliefs about children’s adjustment in same-sex parent families. The sample consisted of 323 Italian teachers and educators working in nursery schools, kindergartens, and primary schools. The Scale on Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families was used to assess adults’ beliefs about negative impacts on children raised in same-sex parent families. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test the association between individual and normative opposition to same-sex parenting and background information, political and religious orientation, contact experiences, sexual prejudice, and beliefs about same-sex couples’ parenting abilities. Sexual prejudice, religious involvement, and negative beliefs about two-father couples emerged as strong predictors of individual and normative opposition to same-sex parenting, whereas political orientation and negative beliefs about two-mother couples predicted only the individual form of opposition. Empirical data are essential in understanding the level of prejudice and discrimination in schools in order to provide policies and programs designed to improve knowledge and competencies to deal with same-sex parent families and their children.

T1  - Race Still Matters: The Relationship Between Racial and Poverty Attitudes Among Social Work Students
AN  - 2456177102
AB  - The attitudes that social work students hold about race and poverty impact the effectiveness of their practice in the field. This study assessed color-blind racial attitudes and attitudes towards poverty of graduating BSW students (n=41) and MSW students (n=128) from three accredited social work programs. Results indicate a correlation between color-blind racial attitudes and attitudes toward poverty for BSW students, but not MSW students. BSW students had fewer color-blind racial attitudes and more favorable attitudes toward poverty than MSW students. Several predictors of their attitudes were found: their educational status, personal experience of poverty, political ideology, and type of diversity course taken. Implications include the need to approach diversity education from an anti-oppression approach.

T1  - Welfare Stereotypes and Conditional Cash Transfer Programmes: Evidence from Brazil's Bolsa Família
AN  - 2455575858
AB  - Some observers claim that conditional cash transfer programmes limit the stigma of taking welfare and thereby promote social inclusion for beneficiaries. This article uses data from the 2014 AmericasBarometer to test these claims in relation to Brazil's Bolsa Família programme (BFP). The results show that, despite the programme's innovative design, beneficiaries encounter the stigmatisation and negative self-stereotypes that characterise more traditional anti-poverty programmes. Many Brazilians, recipient and non-recipient alike, endorse explicitly negative stereotypes of Bolsa Família assistance recipients. Moreover, the level to which respondents endorse these stereotypes strongly predicts their level of support for the BFP. These results highlight the pervasive nature of negative stereotypes towards the poor, even in the context of the developing world, and are consistent with the predictions of social psychological theories of system justification.

T1  - Mindful aging: The association between trait mindfulness and expectations regarding aging among middle-aged and older adults
AN  - 2385097627
AB  - Objectives: Positive Expectations Regarding Aging serve as a protective factor of healthy aging; however, negative stereotypes regarding aging continue to dominate popular aging discourse. It is proposed that trait mindfulness (TM) is associated with aging expectations through the cultivation of openness, curiosity, and non-judgment to one’s thoughts, emotions, and sensations, whether they are positive or negative.Methods: Associations between the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Expectations Regarding Aging Survey (ERA-38) were examined among 201 participants aged 55+ years.Results: Analyses revealed that higher levels of TM was significantly associated with positive aging expectations, controlling for retirement and socioeconomic status (= 14.0%, F(5,192) = 7.17, p < .001).Conclusion: The development of TM, notably the facet of non-judgment, may be used to promote positive aging expectations to help support healthy aging.

T1  - Stereotype Threat and Psychosocial Outcomes Among African Americans: A Population-Based Approach
AN  - 2367631037
AB  - The current study is a population-based test of stereotype threat effects in a national study of African Americans. Stereotype threat activation is operationalized as the additive interaction between identity threat (i.e., perceiving race as barrier to life goals) and high endorsement of negative stereotypes among African American respondents (N = 3750) to the National Survey of American Life. Those classified as experiencing stereotype threat are hypothesized (1) to have the lowest scores on measures of cognitive functioning, perceived mastery, and educational attainment; and (2) these effects would be stronger than the negative stereotypes only group. Limited support was found for the hypotheses. Extension of stereotype threat to social inequities in the broader African American community may be premature.

T1  - 'The State of the Continent is Good': African 'Foreigners' and Foreign Direct Investment, Seen from Subimperial South Africa
AN  - 2493525716
AB  - African elites' perpetual hope for export-led growth based on primary commodity extraction continues to suffer from harsh economic, political and now also climatic and public-health realities. Among the contradictions, COVID-19's economic lockdown amplified two of the most difficult aspects of South Africa's regional and inter-ethnic relations: increased working-class desperation as township economies suffered the most from the pandemic, and the inability to send remittances back home. Although new dimensions emerged during 2020 – e.g., mass social-media trolling, Cabinet ministers' biases translated into legislation, and protests at African countries' Pretoria embassies – there were indications well before COVID-19 that local hostility to the continent's people would ratchet up, just as Cyril Ramaphosa took the African Union chair. Xenophobic upsurges regularly witnessed in Johannesburg suggest that this ongoing melting pot of African entrepreneurs suffers some of the continent's most extreme political-economic contradictions. However, there are antidotes to top-down neoliberalism still emanating from the African Development Bank and World Economic ForumAfrica, some of which are potentially progressive, including unprecedented anti-authoritarian protests in at least 18 countries. But the first step is recognising just how much the official rhetoric, even from organic African elite sources, departs from reality.Alternate abstract:Le perpétuel espoir des élites africaines d'une croissance portée par les exportations et fondée sur les produits miniers continue de souffrir des dures réalités économiques, politiques et aujourd'hui, climatiques et de santé publique. Dans ces contradictions, le confinement économique dû au COVID-19 a amplifié deux des aspects les plus difficiles des relations régionales et interethniques de l'Afrique du Sud : le désespoir accru de la classe ouvrière, les économies des townships ayant le plus pâti de la pandémie, et l'incapacité d'envoyer des fonds chez eux. De nouvelles dimensions ont émergé en 2020, par exemple, le trolling dans les médias sociaux, la traduction en lois de préjugés de ministres du gouvernement, et les manifestations devant les ambassades de pays africains à Pretoria, étaient, bien avant la COVID-19, des indications de l'exacerbation de l'hostilité locale envers les populations du continent, ce, au moment où Cyril Ramaphosa assumait la présidence de l'Union africaine. Les poussées xénophobes régulièrement observées à Johannesburg suggèrent que ce creuset d'entrepreneurs africains souffre de certaines des contradictions politico-économiques les plus extrêmes du continent. Cependant, contre le néolibéralisme pyramidal, il existe encore des antidotes qui émanent de la Banque africaine de développement et du Forum économique mondial-Afrique, dont certains sont potentiellement progressistes ; parmi eux, les manifestations sans précédent contre l'autoritarisme tenues dans au moins 18 pays. Mais la première étape consiste à reconnaître à quel point la rhétorique officielle, même celle d'élites africaines, s'écarte de la réalité.

T1  - A Social-Developmental Model of Radicalization: A Systematic Integration of Existing Theories and Empirical Research
AN  - 2444992356
AB  - Radicalization and violent extremism are pressing problems across the world. After initially addressing problems in defining radicalization and extremism, this article sketches a new social-developmental model based on a systematic integration of theories and empirical findings. We propose a three-step model of radicalization starting with ontogenetic social-developmental processes during the most dynamic period for social development, from early childhood to late adolescence. These processes include the interaction of societal, social, and individual risk and protective factors. In adverse cases this interplay encourages the establishment of proximal radicalization processes between early adolescence and middle adulthood. We assume that four interrelated but distinct social-developmental processes are central conditions for radicalization and extremism: identity problems, prejudice, political or religious ideologies, and antisocial attitudes and behavior. These proximal processes are triggered by actual societal, social, or individual conflicts (such as economic crisis, victimization) and marked by continuous intergroup processes. The more intense the proximal processes, the greater the likelihood of extremist attitudes and behavior. The article closes by discussing implications for early prevention and an outlook for further research.

T1  - Causal Relationship or Not? Nationalism, Patriotism, and Anti-immigration Attitudes in Germany
AN  - 2406941458
AB  - Despite broad research on the connection between in-group and out-group attitudes, empirical studies dealing with the relationship between nation-related and anti-immigration attitudes rarely provide a consistent theoretical framework. On one hand, it is assumed that if persons agree with nationalistic statements, they might develop an orientation against strangers. On the other hand, one might imagine the existence of simple factor correlations among nationalism, patriotism, and anti-immigration attitudes. It can be argued that if people form a group, they will be automatically confronted with out-group members. Both proposals can claim some plausibility. But as several empirical studies mirror varying theoretical assumptions, the author compares different structure models on the basis of German International Social Survey Programme data. Two models lead to satisfactory solutions. Their respective theoretical meaning is discussed in detail. As a result, personal construct theory is integrated here as a theoretical framework with which to explain the correlational structure of a model with three factors without assuming any causality between them.

T1  - Campus Racial Incidents, Hate Crimes, and White Male and Female Students’ Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2328370215
AB  - Despite popular claims that the United States has reached a “post-racial” era—one in which race no longer matters for determining one’s life chances—college students continue to have strong views toward whether or not racial discrimination is still a major problem in this country. Utilizing multilevel modeling on data merged from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program’s (CIRP) 2005 Freshman Survey (TFS) and 2009 College Senior Survey (CSS), as well as the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS) and the Office of Postsecondary Education Campus Safety and Security database, this study examined individual and institutional predictors of white male and female college students’ senior-year views on whether racial discrimination is still a major problem in the United States, with a particular focus on campus racially biased incidents and hate crimes. Results show that having a reported hate crime on campus did not have a significant association with white students’ senior-year views, while a higher level of news coverage of campus racially biased incidents significantly predicted white women’s senior-year views on racial discrimination. Implications of the findings with respect to higher education research, policy, and practice are discussed.

T1  - “Illegal” by Association: Do Negative Stereotypes Divide or Unite Latinxs in the United States? 
AN  - 2323310237
AB  - In current American political discourse, individuals tend to mistakenly conflate being an undocumented immigrant with being Latinx. This conflation puts Latinxs who are legal residents or citizens (Latinx‐Americans) at risk of being negatively impacted by policies intended to deter undocumented immigrants. We examine whether being the target of anti‐immigration policies would lead Latinx‐Americans to politically engage on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 1 found that when Latinx‐Americans were led to believe that what happens to undocumented immigrants will affect them personally (linked fate), those who were primed with greater conflation of the two groups expressed more positive attitudes toward undocumented immigrants and other Latinxs. Study 2 found that this pattern of effects extended to the willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 2 also examined the role of emotions (anger and fear) in mediating the relationship between the conflation of Latinxs with undocumented immigrants and collective action intentions. Together, the findings shed light on how current immigration policies affect relations among key subgroups within the Latinx community and the conditions under which Latinx‐Americans will mobilize on behalf of undocumented immigrants.

T1  - A group is more than the average of its parts: Why existing stereotypes are applied more to the same individuals when viewed in groups than when viewed alone: GPIR
AN  - 2251003752
AB  - Categorizing people into groups is fundamental to stereotype formation. Thus, across four studies, we hypothesize that perceiving people in the context of groups (vs. alone) will amplify the application of existing stereotypes. Consistent with hypotheses, our first two studies demonstrate that Black people in groups (vs. the same Black people viewed alone) are perceived as more representative of Black people in general (Study 1), and more representative of negative stereotypes of Black people (Study 2). Similarly, Study 3 finds that positive stereotypes of Asian people (i.e., “hard-working” and “good at math”) are perceived as more representative of Asian people in groups than those same Asian people viewed alone. Finally, Study 4 demonstrates that increased stereotyping of groups is driven by attributes associated with groups (i.e., proximity) rather than the number of exemplars. We conclude that groups are not only integral to the formation of stereotypes, but also to their application.

T1  - Interminority Friendships and Intergroup Attitudes Across Middle School: Quantity and Stability of Black-Latino Ties
AN  - 2231660411
AB  - Cross-ethnic friendships are associated with better intergroup attitudes, especially among youth from societally dominant groups. In spite of the increasing diversity of the United States school-age population, it is not clear whether friendships between ethnic minority youth (“interminority” friendships) similarly predict intergroup attitudes. Moreover, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that can help account for such friendship effects. To address these gaps, the current study examines the number and the stability (a potential mechanism) of unique cross-ethnic friendships as predictors of intergroup attitudes in a sample of 2580 Black and Latino youth (52% female, 73% Latino) attending 26 ethnically diverse California public middle schools. Youth nominated their close friends across the three years of middle school. Multilevel analyses revealed that the presence of at least one stable Black-Latino friendship positively predicted attitudes, over and above the number of such friendships. These findings indicate that lasting friendships between youth of different ethnic backgrounds may be particularly potent in shaping adolescents’ attitudes, as opposed to several, transient relationships. Implications for facilitating stable friendships between youth of different racial/ethnic backgrounds are discussed, including suggestions for future research on interminority friendships.

T1  - Sexual Identities and Racial Attitudes among Black, Latinx, and White Individuals
AN  - 2299052586
AB  - Some recent studies suggest that lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people are generally more racially progressive than heterosexuals. However, the findings of these "political distinctiveness" studies are up for some debate. Other studies find no sexuality gaps in racial attitudes, and these studies overlook the possibility of bisexual people having unique racial perspectives. These distinctiveness studies also ignore the possibility of racial and sexual identities influencing racial attitudes at the same time. In using the American National Election Survey of 2016 as a data source (N = 3,987), this work found limited and conditional support for a sexuality gap in racial attitudes. In most cases, heterosexual people and sexual minorities converge in their racial interpretations, but there are some cases of stark differences between heterosexual individuals and lesbian-gay counterparts. Finally, an analysis of intersecting identities displayed some instances where the impact of a sexual identity varied by a person's racial background. For example, Black and Latinx bisexual people did not perceive racism or internalize racial stereotypes at especially high levels, but Latinx bisexual individuals were more supportive of Black protests against the police than Black bisexual individuals.

T1  - Using Cultivation Theory to Understand American College Students' Perceptions of Arabs in the Media
AN  - 2249649157
AB  - Research has shown that Arab portrayals on television have an effect on viewers' beliefs about Arabs in general. Based on questionnaire responses from 429 undergraduate students, this study sought to examine perceptions of Arabs on television. Results revealed that college students have predominantly antagonistic views about Arabs in general and on television. These findings suggest that television can affect the way college students view reality regarding Arabs and how these perceptions can perpetuate negative stereotypes.

T1  - Ethics of medical research in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations
AN  - 2310560305
AB  - Conducting ethical health research in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations requires an understanding of their unique cultural values and the historical context. The assimilation of Indigenous people with the broader community through colonial policies such as the dispossession of land and forcible removal of children from their families in the Stolen Generation, deprived entire communities of their liberty. Poorly designed research protocols can perpetuate discriminatory values, reinforce negative stereotypes and stigmas and lead to further mistrust between the Indigenous community and healthcare professionals. The manuscript offers a fresh perspective and an up-to-date literature review on the ethical implications of conducting health research in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

T1  - Historical Knowledge of Oppression and Racial Attitudes of Social Work Students
AN  - 2217546275
AB  - Racism has a long history in the United States. For generations, people of color have been systematically oppressed, whereas White people have benefitted from unearned privilege. Despite major advances in civil rights, the ongoing presence and legacy of racism and White privilege result in pervasive inequities. Social work education prepares graduates to advocate for racial justice. The present study describes the historical knowledge of oppression that students (N=305) possess at the beginning of their MSW education and examines the relationship between this knowledge and the endorsement of a color-blind ideology. Students with more historical knowledge reported fewer color-blind beliefs; millennial generation students reported fewer color-blind beliefs than older students. Implications are discussed for race-conscious and competency-based social work education.

T1  - American Indian historical trauma: Anticolonial prescriptions for healing, resilience, and survivance
AN  - 2173767387
AB  - The American Indian historical trauma (HT) concept is an important precursor to racial trauma (RT) theory that reflects the distinct interests of sovereign Indigenous nations but shares much of the same promise and challenge. Here, that promise and challenge is explored by tracing HT’s theoretical development in terms of its anticolonial ambitions and organizing ideas. Three predominant modes of engaging HT were distilled form the literature (HT as a clinical condition, life stressor, and critical discourse), each informing a research program pursuing a different anticolonial ambition (healing trauma, promoting resilience, practicing survivance) organized by distinct ideas about colonization, wellness, and Indigeneity. Through critical reflection on these different ambitions and dialogue of their organizing ideas, conflict between research programs can be mitigated and a more productive anticolonialism realized in psychology and related health fields. Key recommendations emphasized clarifying clinical concepts (e.g., clinical syndrome vs. idiom of distress), disentangling clinical narratives of individual pathology (e.g., trauma) from social narratives of population adversity (e.g., survivance stories), attending to features of settler-colonialism not easily captured by heath indices (e.g., structural violence), and encouraging alignment of anticolonial efforts with constructive critiques establishing conceptual bridges to disciplines that can help to advance psychological understandings of colonization and Indigenous wellness (e.g., postcolonial studies). This conceptual framework was applied to the RT literature to elaborate similar recommendations for advancing RT theory and the interests of ethnic/racial minority populations through engagement with psychology and related health fields.

T1  - The impact of cocurricular community service on student learning and perceptions of poverty and homelessness
AN  - 2160681473
AB  - Efforts to combat homelessness are hampered by perceptions involving negative stereotypes. One method to change perceptions is university-based cocurricular community service that gives students direct interactions with individuals experiencing homelessness and poverty. This qualitative study collected data with undergraduate volunteers working with individuals experiencing homelessness to determine the impact on perceptions of poverty and homelessness, knowledge, and skill development. Qualitative analyses revealed five key themes: (1) understanding homelessness/poverty, (2) understanding social welfare programs, (3) development of communication and leadership skills, (4) gaining financial literacy, and (5) self-knowledge. Results are discussed for practice, policy, and future research, including a pre/posttest design.

T1  - When “Scurry” vs. “Hurry” Makes the Difference: Vermin Metaphors, Disgust, and Anti‐Immigrant Attitudes
AN  - 2151164561
AB  - In three studies, we demonstrate that common metaphors used to describe immigrants in news media interact with national, but not political, identity to lead to feelings of disgust as well as anti‐immigrant attitudes. The first study demonstrates that the current discourse in the U.S. surrounding unauthorized immigrants includes metaphors that readily activate thoughts of vermin (e.g., rodents). The second study shows that when these metaphors are present in a news article about immigrants, the more participants identify as American the more disgust they experience reading the article. The final study further shows that after reading a news article in which the vermin metaphors are present, the more participants identify as American the more likely they are to support stringent immigration policies. This research shows the power of metaphor to shape intergroup attitudes and support for government policies.

T1  - The 'intergroup paradox' in Andalusia (Spain): an explanatory model
AN  - 2105056398
AB  - The widely renowned theory of group-threat predicts anti-immigrant backlash when immigration societies experience economic downturns. However, despite skyrocketing unemployment and widespread misgivings about immigration's impact, no discernible wave of anti-immigrant sentiment has emerged in Spain; the ensuing puzzle accentuates in the southernmost region of Andalusia, where jobless rates surged beyond 35%. This study examines why anti-immigrant animosity remained stable at low levels, even receded, amidst such inauspicious conditions. Our explanatory model expects increasingly adverse pressures of perceived group-threat on natives' sentiment toward immigrants to be compensated by increasingly benign impact of various benevolent predispositions and situational perceptions. To test these assumptions, we compute a repeated logistic regression model, discern coefficient from sample effects and examine time-trends among vulnerable populations; data were collected at the crisis' onset (2008) and nadir (2013). Defying expectations, neither perceived group-threat nor principled pro-immigration credos (Universalism; pro-diversity) were found to affect the evolution of anti-immigrant sentiment appreciably throughout the economic downturn; however, ideological polarisation and elite-bashing yielded increasingly benign impact. These findings suggest that intergroup tensions were kept latent by a dynamics of political competition that has side-lined immigration as salient social issue: the prevalence of anti-austerity, anti-corruption political rhetoric contributed to pre-empting anti-immigrant sentiment.

T1  - Intergroup contact versus conflict in Catalan high schools: A multilevel analysis of adolescent attitudes toward immigration and diversity
AN  - 2085137629
AB  - Western educational systems are often insufficiently prepared for the ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity resulting from immigration. In Catalonia, one of the wealthiest regions of Spain, a diverse, recent, and large-scale immigration coincides with a popular nationalist movement and increasingly salient national identifications. Focusing on a context where ethnic, national, religious, and linguistic divisions intersect daily, our aim was to determine if both beneficial and detrimental effects of intergroup contact exist by measuring three separate dependent variables, xenophobia, appreciation of diversity, and attitudes toward immigrant rights, among native (n = 1219) and nonnative (n = 379) students during their last year of compulsory education (10th grade). Multilevel modeling, with students nested within 82 classrooms in 30 high schools throughout Catalonia, revealed effects of national identifications, frequency of contact, socioeconomic status, and classroom ethnic composition. Results provide strong support for intergroup contact theory in that classrooms with higher proportions of immigrant students demonstrated less xenophobia and more positive attitudes towards immigrant rights overall. Implications of classroom characteristics were qualified by national identification and intergroup interactions. Simultaneously, modest detrimental implications of intergroup contact were unveiled in that higher proportions of immigrants in a classroom predicted lower appreciation of diversity; immigrants were more likely to embrace diversity when they were a minority in the classroom, though native and immigrant students were both low on appreciation of diversity in majority-immigrant classrooms. Findings also highlight the critical importance of national identification in a context where national identities are often contested.

T1  - The First Time I Heard the Word: The “N‐Word” as a Present and Persistent Racial Epithet
AN  - 2017688239
AB  - The main point of this paper is to interrogate the process of interpellation and to point to the prevalence of the process of “re‐production” of particular social formations in the contemporary United States where the racial epithet “nigger” continues to work as a mechanism of a persistent racial ideology. While several scholars have discussed the ways in which the Black body is hailed into being, a strict focus on the production of the racialized Black body overlooks the ways that whiteness depends upon this production and is therefore similarly (re)produced through the reproduction of the other (i.e. blackness). It is argued that first encounters with the “n‐word” have the power to discipline racial bodies by simultaneously hailing multiple racialized subjects into being and that this process is most productive during the early stages of youth. By drawing upon ethnographic data from a variety of ethnically and racially identified individuals, the author argues that this process may be common to all people within the United States, regardless of racial origin, and that the “n‐word,” as a racial epithet, continues to be used to situate racialized subjects on opposing sides of the “color line.”

T1  - Diversity leadership multiculturalism: The challenge of the securitisation of Chinese migrants in Australia
AN  - 2193487901
AB  - The paper makes three claims. The first one is that despite the recent setbacks or the alleged failure of multiculturalism, Australia has advanced the idea and practice of multiculturalism through developing a diversity leadership programme that aims to attract and recruit different cultural and ethnic peoples into a variety of leadership positions. The second claim is that the securitisation of Chinese migrants or Chinese‐Australians has a negative impact on diversity leadership multiculturalism. This is a worrying trend, but it is not a serious concern among security experts at all. The third claim is that diversity leadership multiculturalism can offer a fresh approach or strategy to dealing with both human and national security through defending the equality and rights of minorities and migrants. As a security instrument, multicultural policies and practices are the best means to win over the hearts and minds of migrants. This in turn aids democratic processes on a national scale and hence helps to bolster national security. In consideration of these three claims, this paper also explores the normative implications of Kymlick's theory of desecuritisation: the prioritising of cultural diversity and meritocracy without being compromised by colour or race; the upholding of the equality principle in returning to a democratic norm; and the revising of the sequence of desecuritisation prior to the development of multiculturalism. While multiculturalism has been well maintained in Australia, and free speech is held up as an entrenched part of Australian society, as it should be in any democracy, I should also acknowledge that security concerns on the threat from China, in particular on actual and potential Chinese influence in Australia is a legitimate one. Nevertheless, as Kymlicka (2010, pp.106‒107) correctly points out, “the securitisation of ethnic relations erodes both the democratic space to voice minority demands and the likelihood that those demands will be accepted”. This paper will illustrate and highlight the mechanisms of this erosion through the case of Australia.

T1  - Reasons for the underachievement and school drop out of Spanish Romani adolescents. A mixed methods participatory study
AN  - 2069025629
AB  - This study applied concept mapping (CM), a mixed methods approach, to examine how the members of a multi-ethnic educational community (students, families and teachers) define the causes for the high rates of early school leaving found among their Gitano or Spanish Romani students. The study had a participatory focus and aimed to generate a common framework leading to a joint assessment of the problem. Data were collected in a high school in which 19% of students were Gitanos; a combination of integrated qualitative and quantitative techniques were used. All sectors of the school community participated actively in the processes of collecting, structuring and interpreting data. The resulting concept map showed a multifactorial matrix where six main issues intersected: ethnic differences and intercultural relations; the influences and encouragement of families; adolescent risk behaviours; students’ individual values, expectations and practices; the accumulation of learning gaps that make school progress harder for some students; and the effects of remedial programmes, particularly those of compensatory education, that seem to be reinforcing segregation without bridging gaps. The articulated knowledge that participants provided was comprehensive, detailed and insightful. There was much intercultural agreement on some explanations but considerable dissent on others. Non-Gitanos blame Gitano families for not doing enough for their children’s education and for maintaining gender and marriage institutions that clash with the values and aims of the school. Gitano families and students reject these reasons and point to racist attitudes and exclusionary processes as key reasons for dropping out of school.

T1  - And What About Siblings? A Longitudinal Analysis of Sibling Effects on Youth’s Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 1993516063
AB  - Within the process of political socialization, the family is of particular importance. Apart from parents, however, little is known about the role of other close family members. The present study examined if siblings affect each other’s intergroup attitudes (i.e., intolerance towards immigrants, social dominance orientation). Drawing on a sample of 362 sibling dyads (older siblings: Mage = 17.77, 53.6% female; younger siblings: Mage = 13.61, 61.3% female), the results showed that older siblings’ intergroup attitudes predicted younger siblings’ attitudes, but this effect was moderated by gender. Specifically, older siblings’ intolerance and social dominance orientation were only found to affect their younger sisters, yet not their younger brothers. Although younger siblings’ intergroup attitudes had no main effect on older siblings, a significant moderation by age indicated that younger siblings affected older siblings’ social dominance orientation with increasing age. These moderation effects of age and gender were not mediated by the quality of family relationships. The findings also remained the same when parental intergroup attitudes were taken into account. While siblings were generally identified as an important agent of political socialization in youth, the results also highlight the necessity to further examine the mechanism that either facilitate or hinder sibling effects.

T1  - Stereotype Threat and Educational Tracking: A Field Experiment in Chinese Vocational High Schools
AN  - 2313919308
AB  - Educational tracks create differential expectations of student ability, raising concerns that the negative stereotypes associated with lower tracks might threaten student performance. The authors test this concern by drawing on a field experiment enrolling 11,624 Chinese vocational high school students, half of whom were randomly primed about their tracks before taking technical skill and math exams. As in almost all countries, Chinese students are sorted between vocational and academic tracks, and vocational students are stereotyped as having poor academic abilities. Priming had no effect on technical skills and, contrary to hypotheses, modestly improved math performance. In exploring multiple interpretations, the authors highlight how vocational tracking may crystallize stereotypes but simultaneously diminishes stereotype threat by removing academic performance as a central measure of merit. Taken together, the study implies that reminding students about their vocational or academic identities is unlikely to further contribute to achievement gaps by educational track.

T1  - Populism: A Puzzle Without (and for) World-Systems Analysis
AN  - 2139158494
AB  - This essay shows how world-systems analysis provides a more rigorous explanation for the recent rise of disparate populisms, countering negative stereotypes of mainstream accounts that obscure how formative populist leaders emerged from authentic progressive movements which challenged capitalists. Existing analyses have also failed to specify the varied economic projects of populists, their likely social bases and their relationships to world markets. The essay recommends relational comparisons of populists to unravel populism 's puzzles and advance world-systems analysis.

T1  - Minority identities and negative attitudes toward immigrants: prejudice and spatial difference amongst the coloured population in South Africa
AN  - 2015016508
AB  - South African communities, and their social identities, are overwhelmingly constructed around and projected through racial classifiers. Historical and political developments promoted segregationist, exclusionist policies that culminated in restricted but permanent primordialist, racial and ethnic classifications arguing that each group has a unique but constant culture and identity. Such racialized limitations problematized 'mixed race' individuals classifying them in an empty epithet of 'Coloured' that lacked racial 'purity' and therefore as a group were inferior and peripheral. From the perspective of a reference group - in South Africa that is informed by a racialized hierarchy - peripheral identities were subjected to negative stereotypes. Therefore, it is assumed that as the Coloured community experienced negative stereotyping, there would be an acute sensitivity to perceptions of prejudice. Using racial and ethnic identifiers as an overarching process to scaffold Gordon Allport's hypothesis of intergroup contact and prejudice as a point of departure the question posed is whether members of Coloured population are prejudiced of other marginalised minorities, particularly black African and Asian immigrants in South Africa? The purpose of this study is to determine if significant social distance attitudes exist from the perspective of the Coloured population toward African immigrants. In 2014, an amended Bogardus Social Distance Scale was administered to (n = 214) individuals who identify themselves as Coloured in former segregated suburbs in Port Elizabeth to examine prejudice within the communities. The conclusion reached is that social distance attitudes of selected members of the Coloured population are prejudiced toward those outside of the community. The findings are that prejudice against a particular group is not uniform but that this behaviour toward others is influenced by persistent reference group racism.

T1  - University Students' Perceptions of Parents and Childless or Childfree Couples
AN  - 1972989669
AB  - Earlier studies have documented persistent negative stereotypes of childless or childfree adults, though acceptance has increased in recent decades. Recent studies have also shown negative biases against parents, especially mothers, in work-related contexts. The current study used college students' responses to hypothetical vignettes (N
 = 1,266) to compare perceptions of childless and childfree adults and parents using means comparisons with generalized linear modeling methods, controlling for student and vignette characteristics. Results showed that parents were perceived as warmer, but with less positive marital relationships, than those without children. Mothers were perceived as more stressed and childless men and women as more emotionally troubled, but there were few differences in work-related perceptions. Childless wives with no plans to have children were perceived as least warm, whereas husbands were perceived as least stressed. Results indicate some persistent negative stereotypes of childless adults along with negative perceptions of stress and marital strains related to parenthood.

T1  - "Us Against Them" or "All Humans Are Equal": Intergroup Attitudes and Perceived Parental Socialization of Muslim Immigrant and Native Dutch Youth
AN  - 1978439991
AB  - Intergroup attitudes of Muslim immigrant youth and native youth in the Netherlands were examined in relation to perceived parental socialization. Our aim was to gain insights into parent-child (dis)similarity in antagonistic and egalitarian attitudes and to understand differences between these two groups in this respect. Data come from qualitative interviews with 22 Turkish Dutch, Moroccan Dutch, and native Dutch youth (aged 16-22) who were prone either to intergroup antagonism (i.e., held hostile and negative attitudes toward out-groups) or to egalitarianism (held egalitarian attitudes). Interviews were analyzed using the constant comparison method. Results show that in the majority youth group, egalitarianism as well as intergroup antagonism were quite comparable across two generations. The attitudes of Muslim minority youth diverged more from those of their parents and appeared to be related to the pedagogic relationship between parents and children. Minority youth prone to antagonism perceived a lack of adequate parental responses to their negative experiences in the context of Islamophobia. Egalitarian minority youth reported that their parents were quite sensitive to their communications about perceived exclusion and that they responded with advice and support. Findings are discussed with reference to the social learning theory and the ethnic socialization strategies identified by Hughes et al.

T1  - Racemaking in New Orleans: racial boundary construction among ideologically diverse college students
AN  - 1900916462
AB  - We explore how an ideologically diverse group of white students at Tulane University respond to evidence of racial inequality in post-Katrina New Orleans. In line with prior research, we find commonalities in racialized attitudes and behaviors between students whose racial ideologies otherwise differ. Drawing from anthropological theories of boundary construction and sociological work on colour-blind racism, we argue that the Otherization of non-whites is part of the everyday worldviews and social practices of white Americans. We draw on fieldwork in New Orleans to demonstrate that racist stereotypes and beliefs in racial difference continue to be transmitted within white social spaces. We find that even the most progressive Tulane students are engaged in the construction and reinforcement of symbolic and spatial boundaries between themselves and African Americans. This achieves the purpose for which racial stereotypes were originally constructed - namely, the persistence of racial inequality.

T1  - Cultural orientation, parental nurturance, and parent-child conflict among Asian American parents in New York City
AN  - 2027237301
AB  - Although a growing number of studies in recent years have examined the cultural values and practices as well as family relationships of Asian Americans, few have focused on Asian Americans in the East Coast, the most populous and fastest growing place of Asian Americans in the U.S. Using data from the Study of Asian American Families with a sample of 572 Asian American parents from 11 ethnic subgroups in New York City, this study examined whether parents' cultural orientations (e.g., cultural values and practices on family priority and parental authority) were associated with parental nurturance (e.g., attitudes and behaviors related to warmth, affection, and support toward their children) and conflict with their children. The results showed that parents who endorsed and engaged more toward their own cultural values and practices tended to have less parental nurturance and more conflicts with their children. These associations varied across the ethnic subgroups of Asian American parents. The mediation analyses found that parental nurturance played a significant buffering role in helping parents who adhered strongly to their own cultural values and practices reduce the conflicts with their children. The findings provide implications for culturally sensitive services and interventions, including helping Asian American immigrant parents increase intercultural interactions and parenting skills.

T1  - Extending trust to immigrants: Generalized trust, cross-group friendship and anti-immigrant sentiments in 21 European societies
AN  - 1896772044
AB  - The aim of this study is twofold. First, we expand on the literature by testing whether generalized trust is negatively related to anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe. Second, we examine to what extent the relation between generalized trust and anti-immigrant sentiments is dependent upon cross-group friendships. We apply multilevel linear regression modeling to representative survey data enriched with levels of ethnic diversity covering 21 European countries. Results show that both generalized trust and cross-group friendship are negatively related to anti-immigrant sentiments. However, there is a negligible positive relation between generalized trust and cross-group friendship (r = .10), and we can clearly observe that they operate independently from one another. Hence, trusting actors are not more likely to form more cross-group friendships, and cross-group friendship do not lead to the development of more generalized trust. Instead, the findings show that generalized trust leads immigrants too to be included in the radius of trusted others and, as a consequence, the benign effects of generalized trust apply to them as well. We conclude that the strength of generalized trust is a form of generalization, beyond the confines of individual variations in intergroup experiences.

T1  - Discrimination Towards Ethnic Minorities: How Does it Relate to Majority Group Members' Outgroup Attitudes and Support for Multiculturalism
AN  - 1877047286
AB  - We examined how ethnic discrimination targeting ethnic minority group members would affect majority group members' attitudes and multiculturalism towards ethnic minority groups in the context of Turkish-Kurdish interethnic conflict. Study 1 (N = 356) demonstrated that the extent to which majorities (Turkish) believed there was ethnic discrimination towards minorities (Kurdish) in the Turkish society was associated with positive outgroup attitudes and support for multiculturalism through decreased levels of perceived threat from the outgroup. Study 2 (N = 82) showed that Turkish participants who read bogus news reports about the prevalence of ethnic discrimination towards the Kurdish were more positive towards this ethnic group (higher levels of support for multiculturalism, culture maintenance, and intergroup contact) compared to participants in the neutral condition. Furthermore, participants who were presented with lower levels of discrimination (few companies have been discriminatory against the Kurdish) were more positive towards Kurdish people than participants who were presented with higher levels of discrimination (most companies have been discriminatory against the Kurdish). Regardless of the intensity of discrimination, information about the prevalence of ethnic discrimination improved majority members' attitudes towards ethnic minority groups. Practical and theoretical implications of the studies were discussed.

T1  - The Defense of My Aging Self: A Report From the Field
AN  - 1871603665
AB  - This article offers a field report -- experiences, thoughts, and anecdotes -- of my personal passage into older adulthood and my attempts to maintain a healthy sense of personhood in the context of the normative ageism in my world. Specifically, I illustrate how my career-long engagement with the scientific base of gerontology -- particularly life-span developmental and social psychology -- has been a key ally in informing my aging and in assisting my defense against internalization of negative stereotypes. Also, I offer some thoughts drawn from personal life experience that may inform research and application efforts designed to modify some of the psychological motives that sustain ageism in our shared environment.

T1  - The (im)plausibility of racism in Europe: policy frameworks on discrimination and integration
AN  - 1862142676
AB  - Rodríguez Maeso and Araújo analyse the reproduction of a dominant understanding of racism in policy discourses of integration and discrimination used by monitoring agencies in Portuguese and European Union (EU) institutional contexts. More specifically, they question the political concern over racism and discrimination vis-à-vis the idea of Europe 'becoming increasingly diverse' and the need to gather 'evidence' of discrimination. To that end, they examine periodic reports issued by EU monitoring agencies since the 1990s-paying specific attention to reporting on school segregation of Roma pupils in Portugal-and national integration policies and initiatives that, since the 2000s, have targeted mainly Roma and black families and youth. They argue that the dominant discourse of integration and cultural diversity conceives of racism as external to European political culture, and as a 'factor' of the 'conflictive nature' of social interactions in ethnoracially heterogeneous settings. This paves the way for calls for the 'strengthening of social cohesion'-on the assumption that policy initiatives need to act on the 'characteristics' of so-called 'vulnerable' populations-whereas institutional arrangements and everyday practices remain unchallenged.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting: An Effect of Gender
AN  - 1923040587
AB  - The definition of family in Australia has been continuously changing over the past four decades. The 21st century has brought with it various images of family, with an increase of awareness to same-sex families; however, the acceptance of such family structures does not appear to be widespread and is often determined by sex. Substantive literature demonstrates differences between men and women in attitudes toward same-sex parenting, with theory suggesting that gender role norms may explain this. Despite large efforts to determine sex differences in attitudes toward same-sex parenting, little research, and even less in Australia, has been done to investigate whether there are differences in reasons behind negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting between men and women. To further this understanding, an Australian sample (N= 790) ranging in age from 18-78 completed a survey regrading attitudes toward same-sex parenting, in addition to relevant demographic information. Participants reported more positive attitudes about parenting by lesbians as compared to parenting by gay men. Reasons behind attitudes toward same-sex parenting also differed between males and females. Results suggested that the impact of socially prescribed gender norms may affect prejudice toward same-sex families. Despite an increase in tolerance for sexual minorities recently, policies that continue to discriminate against same-sex parenting rights demonstrates the importance of continuing to identify potential influences of same-sex family prejudice to reduce the potentially negative impacts associated with the prejudice.

T1  - Class Advantage, Commitment Penalty: The Gendered Effect of Social Class Signals in an Elite Labor Market
AN  - 1846272850
AB  - Research on the mechanisms that reproduce social class advantages in the United States focuses primarily on formal schooling and pays less attention to social class discrimination in labor markets. We conducted a resume audit study to examine the effect of social class signals on entry into large U.S. law firms. We sent applications from fictitious students at selective but non-elite law schools to 316 law firm offices in 14 cities, randomly assigning signals of social class background and gender to otherwise identical resumes. Higher-class male applicants received significantly more callbacks than did higher-class women, lower-class women, and lower-class men. A survey experiment and interviews with lawyers at large firms suggest that, relative to lower-class applicants, higher-class candidates are seen as better fits with the elite culture and clientele of large law firms. But, although higher-class men receive a corresponding overall boost in evaluations, higher-class women do not, because they face a competing, negative stereotype that portrays them as less committed to full-time, intensive careers. This commitment penalty faced by higher-class women offsets class-based advantages these applicants may receive in evaluations. Consequently, signals of higher-class origin provide an advantage for men but not for women in this elite labor market. [web URL: http://asr.sagepub.com/content/81/6/1097.abstract]

T1  - In the wake of radical right electoral success: a cross-country comparative study of anti-immigration attitudes over time
AN  - 2076975938
AB  - This paper tests the theoretically assumed relationship between the parliamentary presence of radical right parties (RRPs) and anti-immigration attitudes over time. Data come from six rounds of the European Social Survey between 2002 and 2012. Using multi-level models with applications for repeated cross-sectional data, the study examines the implications of changes tied to the political advancements of the radical right with a focus on three possible scenarios: people's attitudes about immigration have generally become more negative, opposition towards immigration has become more dependent on immigrants' ethnicity, and attitudes towards immigration have become more polarised. Contrary to expectations, it is found that neither the presence, the representational strength, nor the nationalistic framing of an RRP affect opposition towards immigration over time. Thus, the conclusion is that the RRPs, so far, have not driven anti-immigration attitudes in Europe. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the concluding section.

T1  - The other neighbour paradox: fantasies and frustrations of 'living together' in Antwerp
AN  - 1786264985
AB  - In this paper, Vollebergh investigates the commitment to establishing intercultural encounters by so-called 'active' white Flemish residents in Antwerp, and their perpetual disappointment with the responses of their neighbours of orthodox Jewish and Moroccan backgrounds. Instead of viewing these relationships either as a product of culturalist social cohesion policies, or as a vernacular ethical achievement that escapes culturalist politics, she argues that we should understand them through the figure of the Neighbour. Combining the theories of Emmanuel Levinas and Slavoj Zizek, she suggests that the neighbourly relation is a paradox in which the Neighbour as a nearby Other induces both an ethical desire for total openness in the engagement with this Other, as well as the uncanny sense that his/her Otherness haunts and makes impossible such an engagement. When viewed in this way, vernacular intercultural relationships, and the fantasies and frustrations surrounding them, emerge as the site where residents of multi-ethnic neighbourhoods in postcolonial Europe engage and struggle with existential and ethical questions of human interconnection and, especially, the effects of the culturalist inflection that these questions have gained.

T1  - Disparities in Depressive Symptoms Between Heterosexual and Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth in a Dutch Cohort: The TRAILS Study
AN  - 1764290625
AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth experience elevated levels of depressive symptoms compared to heterosexual youth. This study examined how differences in depressive symptoms between heterosexual and LGB youth developed from late childhood to early adulthood. The association between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms was estimated from age 11 to 22 using data from the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal Dutch cohort study. Of the 1738 respondents (54.8 % girls) that provided information on sexual orientation, 151 self-identified as LGB. In line with the Minority Stress Framework, it was tested whether self-reported peer victimization and parental rejection mediated the association between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that LB girls and bisexuals were at increased risk of depressive symptoms already at age 11. The difference increased over time and was related to pubertal development in girls and bisexual individuals. Furthermore, self-reported peer victimization (for both boys and girls), as well as parental rejection (for girls/bisexuals), mediated the association between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms. The authors conclude that already in late childhood, associations between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms are found, partly due to minority stress mechanisms.

T1  - Racial Resentment, Old-Fashioned Racism, and the Vote Choice of Southern and Nonsouthern Whites in the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 1727759938
AB  - Objective 
The effects of racial attitudes on the vote choice of whites in the 2012 U.S. presidential election are examined, with a specific focus on the simultaneous effects of both racial resentment and old-fashioned racial prejudice. 
Methods 
Data are taken from the 2012 American National Election Study (ANES). Models of vote choice are estimated separately for southern and nonsouthern whites. 
Results 
Findings show that racial resentment alone affected the vote choice of southern whites, but among nonsouthern whites both racial resentment and old-fashioned racism exerted independent effects on vote choice. Furthermore, it was among independents that the effects of racial attitudes were most visible. 
Conclusions 
Overall, it is estimated that racial attitudes cost Obama support among white voters, and likely made his victories in a number of swing states a lot closer than they would have been absent the effects of racial attitudes. Consistent with prior literature, findings also demonstrate that the election of the first African-American president has primed old-fashioned racial prejudice.

T1  - Comparing direct and imagined intergroup contact among children: Effects on outgroup stereotypes and helping intentions
AN  - 1762010089
AB  - We conducted an experimental intervention aimed at comparing the effectiveness of direct and imagined intergroup contact. Italian elementary school children took part in a three-week intervention with dependent variables assessed one week after the last intervention session. Results revealed that direct and imagined intergroup contact, compared to control conditions of direct and imagined intragroup contact, had an additive impact when it came to reducing negative stereotypes of immigrants and fostering future helping intentions toward this group. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Xenophobia across the class divide: South African attitudes towards foreigners 2003-2012
AN  - 1784417787
AB  - In May 2008 anti-immigrant riots in South Africa displaced more than a hundred thousand people. Despite the media attention that the riots attracted, there has been no study that presents trend data on anti-immigrant sentiment for the period after 2008. This paper uses data from the nine rounds of the South African Social Attitudes Survey over the period 2003-2012 to fill this gap and test the success of government commitments to reduce anti-immigrant prejudice. The results reveal that attempts to combat xenophobia have been ineffectual, with anti-immigrant sentiment prevalent and widespread in 2012. Afrophobia was observed, with a majority of citizens identifying foreign African nationals as the group they least wanted to come and live in South Africa. The government is advised to urgently address the alarming and widespread pervasiveness of anti-immigrant sentiment in South Africa.

T1  - Negotiating the Imagined Geography of Europeanness in Polish State Bureaucracies
AN  - 1761735574
AB  - This article explores how the fluctuating cartography of East and West and the varying degrees of perceptive Europeanness influence everyday practices of the people working in Polish state bureaucracies, who professionally advance European integration within a national framework. While an important part of their self-image is formed through the dissociation from cultural 'Eastness' and the backwardness they ascribe to fellow citizens, they still experience negative stereotyping and mistrust from the part of the EU-15 'Westerners'. Consequently, East-Central European state officials oscillate on the continuum between cultural 'East' and 'West' and constantly negotiate distance, relatedness and thus their own liminal position. By scrutinising how Polish state officials aim at positioning themselves on the mental map of Europe, this article shows that they attempt to escape the cultural pattern of negative stereotyping and mistrust by using a functionalist narrative of efficiency. This is a rhetorical strategy employed to cope with existing asymmetries.

T1  - Relative Deprivation and Relative Wealth Enhances Anti-Immigrant Sentiments: The V-Curve Re-Examined
AN  - 1721911191
AB  - Previous research has shown that negative attitudes towards immigrants and support for anti-immigrant parties are observed both among those experiencing relative deprivation and those experiencing relative gratification (so called v-curve). Whereas the effect of relative deprivation is intuitive, the effect of relative gratification is more difficult to explain. Why would economic prosperity provoke negative attitudes towards immigrants? We first present correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) support for the v-curve. In Study 1, in a national Swiss referendum, a higher percentage anti-immigrant voting was found in cantons with relatively lower and relatively higher relative disposable income. In Study 2, in a hypothetical society, more opposition to ‘newcomers’ joining society was found among poor or above average wealth group members than among those in a moderate wealth group condition. In Study 3, we replicate this finding and also show that opposition to immigration is higher for all wealth groups when societal inequality is growing rather than declining. In a final study, we examine different forms of relative gratification and mediators of the relationship between relative gratification and opposition to immigration (i.e., identification, collective self-definition as competent and cold, and fear about future wealth). Only fear about future wealth mediates this relationship. We conclude that, paradoxically, relative gratification effects are partly due to the fear of future deprivation.

T1  - Skin Tone and Individuals' Perceptions of Commonality and Competition with Other Racial and Ethnic Groups
AN  - 1700928379
AB  - Previous research has shown that skin tone influences how individuals perceive themselves and others. There is considerable variation in skin tone between and among whites, Latinos, and blacks, and considering the role of skin tone in shaping racial attitudes is potentially important. In this paper, we explore the effects of skin tone on perceptions of commonality and competition among whites, blacks, and Latinos. Simply, does skin tone shape how whites, blacks, and Latinos view each other? Using data from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we explore the effects of individual self-perceptions of skin tone on racial attitudes. We find that skin tone has an effect only on blacks' perceptions of Hispanics; light-skinned blacks are less likely to perceive commonality and more likely to perceive employment competition with Latinos, relative to blacks with darker skin tones. We also find some evidence to suggest that the effect of skin tone on blacks' perceptions of commonality with Latinos is moderated by education.

T1  - Individual Psychological Factors and Complex Interpersonal Conditions that Predict LGBT-Affirming Behavior
AN  - 1694641946
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Genetic Influences on Peer and Family Relationships Across Development, Part II              To counter homophobic behavior in schools, research is needed on heterosexual youth who act as allies to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth by engaging in LGBT-affirming behavior (e.g., voicing support, engaging in advocacy, countering homophobia). Among 624 heterosexual high school students (M ^sub age^ = 16.11; 53 % female; 88 % white), this study found that critical thinking, self-reflection, lower sexual prejudice, having more LGBT friends, and having sexual orientation-based discussions with peers were associated with engaging in more LGBT-affirming behavior. Several factors moderated the association between having sexual orientation-based discussions and LGBT-affirming behavior: the association was stronger among youth who described the tone of these discussions as more positive, who more often used positive problem-solving strategies, and who reported low sexual prejudice. The degree to which conversations were challenging did not moderate this association. Finally, having LGBT friends was more strongly associated with affirming behavior for youth who felt more connected and had more sexual orientation-based discussions with these friends. The findings underscore the need for research to identify other factors that prompt heterosexual youth to act as allies to LGBT youth.

T1  - Intergroup Contact is Related to Evaluations of Interracial Peer Exclusion in African American Students
AN  - 1679664462
AB  - There are few published studies on the influence of intergroup contact on ethnic minority public school students' evaluations of interracial exclusion. In this study, African American children and adolescents (N = 158, 4th, 7th, and 10th grade; 67.1 %) were individually interviewed regarding peer exclusion for scenarios depicting cross-race peer exclusion in various contexts. The level of positive intergroup contact, attribution of motives for exclusion, wrongfulness ratings, reasoning about exclusion, estimations of the frequency of exclusion, and awareness of the use of stereotypes to justify racial exclusion were assessed. Intergroup contact was significantly related to attributions of racial motives, higher ratings of wrongfulness, greater use of moral reasoning, and higher estimations of the frequency of exclusion. In addition to context effects, with increasing grade participants were more likely to refer to the historical and social circumstances contributing to the manifestation of racial stereotypes used to justify exclusion. The findings are discussed in terms of the existing research on intergroup relations and evaluations of social exclusion.

T1  - Documenting Portrayals of Race/Ethnicity on Primetime Television over a 20-Year Span and Their Association with National-Level Racial/Ethnic Attitudes
AN  - 1708525439; 201528961
AB  - The current study content analyzes the 345 most viewed U.S. television shows within 12 separate television seasons spanning the years 1987 to 2009. Using multilevel modeling, the results from this comprehensive content analysis then are used to predict national-level racial/ethnic perceptions (between the years 1988 and 2008) with data from the American National Election Studies (ANES). Content analysis results reveal severe underrepresentation of Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, and a tendency to depict ethnic minorities stereotypically (e.g., overrepresentation of hyper-sexualized Latino characters). Multilevel-modeling analysis indicates that both the quantity and quality of ethnic media representations contributes to Whites' racial attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Looking at Muslims: the visibility of Islam in contemporary French cinema
AN  - 1680151553; 201514082
AB  - Tarr analyses the representation of Islam in five feature films made since 2006 that centre on the changing identities of Muslims in contemporary France. She locates the films within the context of the rise in Islamophobia in France following 9/11 and anxieties about immigration and terrorism, but also in relation to France's troubled postcolonial history and French republican ideology. In particular, the French notion of laicite (secularism) has given rise to active hostility to any public expression of religious or cultural difference, particularly on the part of Muslims. Cinematic representations of Muslims, and particularly of the children of migrants from the Maghreb, have, therefore, since the mid-1980s, been treated with caution in order not to alienate mainstream Franco-French audiences and to facilitate the second generation's integration into French society. However, the five feature films addressed here-two mainstream popular comedies, Mauvaise foi/Bad Faith (2006) and L'Italien/The Italian (2010), and three independent, low budget, auteur-led, realist films, Dans la vie/Two Ladies (2008), Dernier maquis (2008) and La Desintegration/Disintegration (2012)-offer new narratives that challenge fears of Islam by foregrounding the protagonists' negotiation of their Muslim identities in a French context and, by implication, argue for the integration of Islam as a legitimate referent of French identity. However, their construction of Islam does not extend to positive representations of young veiled women, and they thus still risk confirming the oppressive majority view that certain practices associated with Islam, such as the wearing of the veil, are incompatible with the secularism of the French Republic.

T1  - Individual values, cultural embeddedness, and anti-immigration sentiments: Explaining differences in the effect of values on attitudes toward immigration across Europe
TT  - Individuelle Werte, kulturelle Einbettung und immigrations-feindliche Einstellungen: Wie sich die Unterschiede in den Wirkungen von Werten auf Einstellungen zur Immigration in Europa erklären lassen
AN  - 1673138694
AB  - Issue Title: Soziale Kontexte Und Soziale Mechanismen              During the last decade, many European countries have faced sizeable immigration inflows accompanied by high prevalence of negative sentiments toward immigrants among majority members of the host societies. We propose that basic human values are one important determinant of such negative attitudes, and we seek to explain variation across countries in the strength of the effects of values. Based on Schwartz' (1992, 1994) basic human value theory, we hypothesize that universalism values are conducive to positive attitudes toward immigration, while conformity-tradition reinforce anti-immigration sentiments. We furthermore hypothesize that these value effects are moderated by two contextual variables. Both value effects are expected to be weaker in countries with a higher level of cultural embeddedness. Furthermore, negative effects of conformity-tradition values are hypothesized to be cushioned by a lower proportion of immigrants in the country. A multilevel analysis of data from 24 countries from the fourth round of the European Social Survey (2008-2009) supports these hypotheses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the measurement properties of the theoretical constructs exhibit equivalence across countries, thereby justifying statistical comparisons.

T1  - Impression management pressures on racial attitude surveys
AN  - 1660020336; 201506340
AB  - For decades, researchers have expressed concern that self-report racial attitude measures are vulnerable to distortion from pressures respondents feel to present themselves as unprejudiced. A common response to this problem is to measure social desirability separately from racial attitudes and control for its variance in statistical analyses. The present study is designed to test whether such controls are sufficient. Participants rated items from both racial attitude and social desirability scales in terms of the amount of pressure they would feel to respond in a particular way regardless of their true attitudes. Participants report significantly greater response pressure on racial attitude items than on social desirability items, and ratings on the two types of items have only moderately shared variance. Implications for controlling social desirability in racial attitude research are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Mexican American and European American Adolescents' Dating Experiences across the Ecosystem: Implications for Healthy Relationships within an Ecodevelopmental Framework
AN  - 1551001375; 201428849
AB  - Dating health interventions that target the complex, multi-systemic spheres in which adolescents experience their first romantic relationships are required. This study utilizes an ecodevelopmental approach to better understand Mexican American and European American youths' perceptions of how peers, parents, school, and the media act both independently and collectively to affect their dating lives, also elucidating how such systems are at times in conflict. Seventy-five middle adolescents participated in focus groups divided by gender and ethnicity to uncover differences and similarities within and across groups. Findings underscore the importance and widespread effects of romantic relationships for adolescents' social development and the need for intervention programs that target multiple points of intervention while attending to meso systemic conflicts across systems.

T1  - Only connect? Older lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) adults and social capital
AN  - 1507749873
AB  - The concept of social capital is widely used in the social sciences and has, to an extent, been applied to the lives and social networks of older lesbian, gay and bisexual (hereafter LGB) adults. Developing existing research, this paper argues that while not without its problems, the concept of social capital enriches our understanding of these networks, whilst simultaneously deconstructing the negative stereotypes surrounding homosexuality in later life. However, little attention has been paid to the social factors that mediate access and participation in lesbian and gay communities and the implications of this on the quality and experience of later life. Drawing on qualitative research conducted in the United Kingdom, this paper illustrates how biography, gender and socio-economic status are significant mediators in the development and maintenance of social capital by older LGB adults. It concludes with a set of recommendations aimed at improving the social capital of older LGB adults, together with the importance of 'queering' the concept itself.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Gender and White College Students' Racial Attitudes
AN  - 1442674271
AB  - New forms of racial attitudes among whites, including racial resentment, help to uphold institutionalized inequalities in the United States. As a way to dismantle institutionalized forms of racial inequalities, colleges and universities have implemented various curricula and programs designed to expose students to diversity and reduce social inequalities. This study attempts to uncover the extent to which college experiences affect levels of racial resentment among white students, with emphasis on whether the effects differ for women and men. Findings from a representative sample of students at a large Midwestern university revealed that white men showed higher levels of racial resentment than white women and that their attitudes were significantly affected by many college experiences. By contrast, white women are less affected by aspects of their college experience.   [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Deficient or Resilient: A Critical Review of Black Male Academic Success and Persistence in Higher Education
AN  - 1462797413
AB  - What contributes to persistent trends of Black male educational underachievement? Past literature has often used a deficit-informed framework to answer this question, portraying Black male students as incapable, unintelligent, disadvantaged, and at-risk to fail, feeding into negative stereotypes. In this article, our primary objective is to depart from this deficit-informed orientation, seeking out themes that speak to, and explain, Black male resiliency while discussing major developments in research on Black college men in both PWIs and HBCUs. We aim to fill gaps in existing research by using a more heuristic framework, one that may guide future research on Black male collegiate experiences and success by drawing upon resilience theories.

T1  - Ethnicity and social cohesion in the post-Soviet Baltic states
AN  - 1448992675; 201342898
AB  - This article examines the efforts of post-Soviet Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to promote social cohesion by addressing the ethnic and linguistic cleavages that are part of the legacy of Soviet rule. In examining the particular situation of each Baltic state and the response to international pressure for integration and social inclusion policy, Muiznieks, Rozenvalds and Birka note the roles of threat-perception, the historic context, the linguistic and citizenship policy, as well as socio-economic inequality, in facilitating Russian-speakers' sense of belonging to their respective Baltic state. While ostensibly aimed at fostering a sense of belonging to the national state, Baltic integration and social inclusion policy has often had a contradictory effect, especially in Estonia and Latvia, where the emphasis on the majority language and culture as a prerequisite for access to citizenship and formal membership has enhanced the threat-perceptions of minorities, and led to their alienation or identification with the external homeland of Russia. In Lithuania, early inclusion of minorities into the polity has had a beneficial long-term impact in terms of their identification with their country of residence, demonstrated by the fact that Russian-speakers express a greater sense of belonging to Lithuania. A review of the available survey data on the Baltic states suggests that the same cannot be said for Estonia and Latvia, where minorities express a weak sense of belonging to the state. This suggests a challenging road ahead for Estonia and Latvia in achieving social cohesion, understood by minorities as a sense of membership in the community and feelings of mutual recognition. Furthermore, all three Baltic states, Latvia in particular, have yet to address growing socio-economic inequality, which threatens to cause long-term difficulties for social cohesion.

T1  - A time to make (and lose) friends: effects of soccer tournaments on German adolescents' attitudes toward foreigners
AN  - 1433108426
AB  - The present research examined the effects of one's national sports team defeats in international competitions on adolescents' out-group attitudes and the moderation of these effects by in-group identification. We conducted two longitudinal studies surveying German adolescents (Soccer World Championship 2006 and European Championship 2008). Both studies showed deterioration in adolescents' evaluations of people from the countries whose soccer teams defeated the German team (Italy and Spain). There was no generalization to other national groups. The deterioration in out-group evaluations was shown to be more pronounced for adolescents reporting a high in-group identification. The results are discussed in terms of macro-societal effects on adolescents' attitude development and the function that intergroup bias serves for social identity.

T1  - People, Race and Place: American Support for Person- and Place-based Urban Policy, 1973-2008
AN  - 1315603440; 201308273
AB  - This article examines an idea that is often asserted but rarely tested: that Americans associate big cities with African Americans and that, as a result, racial attitudes influence support for urban policy. Thirty-five years of public opinion data show that cities are in fact a 'racialised' concept, and that the relationship between racial attitudes and support for place-based urban policy is as large as that between racial attitudes and support for person-based assistance to the poor. The sources of these racial associations, however, appear to differ. Attitudes about race and cities correlate more closely with attitudes about crime, while attitudes about race and person-based redistribution correlate more with opposition to residential integration. Lastly, the evidence shows that even Americans who do not hold prejudiced views associate urban problems with African Americans, suggesting that social policy, be it person- or place-based, will always need to contend with racial attitudes.

T1  - The language of sacrifice: masculinities in Northern Ireland and the consequences of the Great War
AN  - 1283644053; 201303397
AB  - In the aftermath of the First World War, veterans often became symbols of broken masculinity, standing in the popular imagination every Armistice Day as emblems of the futility of war. In stark contrast, Ulster-reconstituted as Northern Ireland after the partition of Ireland in 1921-did not consign the Great War to the pages of history. Veterans of the trenches became cherished icons of manly heroism and bravery. However, the sectarian tensions that pre-dated the war by many years infiltrated commemorations of ex-servicemen, and some men were honoured far above others. Soldiers from the 36th (Ulster) Division were remembered in a 'language of sacrifice' as valiant unionist heroes whose blood shed at the Somme had sanctified the British connection; men who had fought elsewhere, particularly in the 10th (Irish) or 16th (Irish) Divisions, were pointedly omitted from this pantheon of warrior masculinities. Veterans of the 36th Ulsters were given preference in labour, political and social circles, while presumed nationalists were discriminated against and even terrorized by those who felt that service in the Ulster Division was the only acceptable war record. The consequences of the Great War created a hierarchy that had far-reaching consequences in Northern Ireland for the rest of the century. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An American Drag Queen in West Berlin: The Negotiation of Homosexual Identity, Transgressive Behavior and Social Acceptance in late 1960s and early 1970s West Germany
AN  - 962490341
AB  - My work analyzes a number of confrontations between Tobi Marsh, a gay drag queen, and his German-Jewish landlord, Stark, in late 1960s and early 1970s West Berlin. Based upon an extensive personal interview with Marsh, my work uses subjective testimony to examine the complexity of lived-experience for gay men in Bundesrepublik society right at the time when the West Germany government extended full political and legal equality to gay men. Marsh's testimony details two separate incidents during which Stark, who knew Marsh was openly gay and performed as a drag queen, attacked Marsh's sexual orientation. While perhaps not significant in and of itself, a closer look at Marsh's account reveals that Stark made use of very specific social contexts in order to condemn Marsh's sexual identity. In fact, on both occasions some other social transgression entirely served as a catalyst to the confrontation, one a racial transgression and another an ethno-religious transgression. In both cases, however, Stark made use of the situation of a "double-transgression" to censure Marsh and his company first and foremost as homosexuals. At the same time, the sexual nature of Stark's outbursts reveals that Stark was actually concerned about the tenuous standing and respectability of his own person and household as a likewise marginalized individual in West German society. Indeed, Stark's attacks on Marsh's homosexuality were disguised attempts to assert his own position in "respectable" West German society at Marsh's expense. Marsh's run-ins with Stark, then, both add to the growing literature on the various forms of informal prejudice suffered by gay men in post-World War II West German society and serve as a larger lens through which to view the rich complexity of life for gay men in a country still undergoing democratization where social belonging was being negotiated along a number of fronts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Minority comparison model: Effects of Whites' multiracial evaluation on symbolic racism and racialized policy preferences
AN  - 1438560998; 201341969
AB  - Most Racial Studies primarily focus on African Americans without paying attention to nonblack minorities, and it fails to capture recent increase in racial diversity. Based on previous theories and empirical findings, we propose a new model, minority comparison model, which accounts for theoretical shortcomings in Racial Studies. This model (1) captures psychological processes that compare blacks and nonblacks, and (2) explores the effects of whites' multiracial evaluation on racialized policy preferences. Drawing on a 2008 national representative sample, this study finds that whites who have positive stereotype of nonblacks (e.g., Hispanics and/or Asians) but negative stereotype of blacks show substantially higher symbolic racism and stronger opposition to Affirmative Action, whereas whites who have positive stereotype of blacks but negative stereotypes of nonblacks have stronger opposition to expansive immigration policy. Our study offers new ways of understanding and accounting for symbolic racism in modern context, and shows how whites' preferences in racialized policies are influenced by multiracial evaluation.

T1  - THE RACIALIZATION OF PUBLIC DISCOURSE: Antisemitism and Islamophobia in Italian society
AN  - 1551001697; 201429071
AB  - The objective of this research is to understand the nature and diffusion of antisemitism and Islamophobia in Italy. It is based on 1528 interviews among a representative sample of the Italian population stratified according to age, gender, and residence. The questionnaire used was built by a set of different scales: antisemitic, Islamophobic, and three others scales to take into account authoritarian, ethnocentric, and anomic attitudes. To test assumptions regarding the impact of these predictors of antisemitic and Islamophobic prejudice, it was decided to adopt the statistical technique of path analysis. Outcomes of our research draw attention on the distribution of antisemitism and Islamophobia among Italian people, their nature as a combination of old and new prejudices, and their linking with broader sets of attitudes such as anomie, ethnocentrism, and authoritarianism.

T1  - Acculturation, Gender, Depression, and Cigarette Smoking Among U.S. Hispanic Youth: The Mediating Role of Perceived Discrimination
AN  - 897013979; 21293915
AB  - Hispanic youth are at risk for experiencing depressive symptoms and smoking cigarettes, and risk for depressive symptoms and cigarette use increase as Hispanic youth acculturate to U.S. culture. The mechanism by which acculturation leads to symptoms of depression and cigarette smoking is not well understood. The present study examined whether perceived discrimination explained the associations of acculturation with depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking among 1,124 Hispanic youth (54% female). Youth in Southern California completed surveys in 9th-11th grade. Separate analyses by gender showed that perceived discrimination explained the relationship between acculturation and depressive symptoms for girls only. There was also evidence that discrimination explained the relationship between acculturation and cigarette smoking among girls, but the effect was only marginally significant. Acculturation was associated with depressive symptoms and smoking among girls only. Perceived discrimination predicted depressive symptoms in both genders, and discrimination was positively associated with cigarette smoking for girls but not boys. These results support the notion that, although Hispanic boys and girls experience acculturation and discrimination, their mental health and smoking behaviors are differentially affected by these experiences. Moreover, the results indicate that acculturation, gender, and discrimination are important factors to consider when addressing Hispanic youth's mental health and substance use behaviors.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Determinants of Neighborhood Satisfaction: Racial Proxy Revisited
AN  - 916898670; 21706255
AB  - Understanding the factors that drive individuals' residential preferences is a critical issue in the study of racial segregation. An important debate within this field is whether individuals--especially whites--prefer to live in predominantly white neighborhoods because they wish to avoid the social problems that may be more likely to occur in predominantly black neighborhoods (i.e., the racial proxy hypothesis) or because of racial factors that go beyond these social class-related characteristics. Through a multilevel analysis of data from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study and several administrative sources, we assess the extent to which the racial proxy hypothesis describes neighborhood satisfaction among whites, African Americans, and Latinos living across a broad range of neighborhood contexts. The racial proxy perspective applies weakly to whites' satisfaction: whites report less satisfaction in neighborhoods with more minority residents, and only some of their dissatisfaction can be attributed to local social characteristics. The racial proxy hypothesis applies more strongly to blacks' and Latinos' satisfaction. In some cases, especially for Latinos, higher levels of satisfaction in integrated neighborhoods can largely be attributed to the fact that these places have better socioeconomic conditions and fewer social problems than predominantly minority communities. At the same time, effects of racial/ethnic composition persist in unique and somewhat divergent ways for blacks and Latinos, supporting the assertion that racial composition matters, above and beyond its relation to social class. Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals balance both socioeconomic and race-related concerns in their residential preferences.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Metamorphosis of Black Movement Activists into Black Organic Intellectuals
AN  - 887495784; 201118107
AB  - Examination of the profiles and trajectories of 15 current or past leaders of the Brazilian Association of Black Researchers points to the emergence in Brazil of a new category of intellectuals who may be called "black organic intellectuals" -- academics with the marks of black ancestry (such as dark skin) who have been directly or indirectly influenced by the black social movements and therefore do not resign themselves to racial prejudice and discrimination and racial inequalities. The active academic ethos that guides their professional behavior as university professors leads them to study these inequalities and to promote policies aimed at racial equality and the elimination of racism from Brazilian society.

T1  - Reexamining Racial Resentment: Conceptualization and Content
AN  - 1928618086
AB  - There is an ongoing debate in the racial attitudes literature about the degree to which new racism measures actually tap negative racial beliefs. Racial resentment is one construct that has been criticized on such grounds. To date, Kinder and Sanders (1996) have proposed the most commonly utilized measure of racial resentment, which is largely based on a similar construct--symbolic racism. The authors enter this discussion by proposing and testing an alternative racial resentment measure, one that is more explicit. They analyze data from two convenience samples of college students and from two national adult samples. They find the Explicit Racial Resentment (EXR) measure to have strong measurement properties and associations with known correlates of racial attitudes, suggesting promise as a survey-based indicator of underlying racial resentment.

T1  - The Effect of Negative Performance Stereotypes on Learning
AN  - 835113602; 201101373
AB  - Stereotype threat (ST) research has focused exclusively on how negative group stereotypes reduce performance. The present work examines if pejorative stereotypes about women in math inhibit their ability to learn the mathematical rules and operations necessary to solve math problems. In Experiment 1, women experiencing ST had difficulty encoding math-related information into memory and, therefore, learned fewer mathematical rules and showed poorer math performance than did controls. In Experiment 2, women experiencing ST while learning modular arithmetic (MA) performed more poorly than did controls on easy MA problems; this effect was due to reduced learning of the mathematical operations underlying MA. In Experiment 3, ST reduced women's, but not men's, ability to learn abstract mathematical rules and to transfer these rules to a second, isomorphic task. This work provides the first evidence that negative stereotypes about women in math reduce their level of mathematical learning and demonstrates that reduced learning due to stereotype threat can lead to poorer performance in negatively stereotyped domains.

T1  - The Mexicans and "Us Gringos": A Case Study of Activist Work With Unauthorized Migrants
AN  - 758124250; 201056756
AB  - Lacking access to social services, unauthorized Mexican day laborers constitute a vulnerable population. This case study uses a critical theory perspective to examine activist efforts to support migrants when professional social workers were unavailable. Using qualitative methods, this study sought to answer three questions: (1) What strategies did unauthorized day laborers and activists deploy to contest anti-immigrant sentiments in a suburban community; (2) how were these strategies shaped by the workers' subterranean status as undocumented and poor; and (3) what are the implications for social work practice? This study seeks to delineate interventions and to identify how migrants themselves perceive such efforts. Adapted from the source document.

Students were randomly assigned to a colorblind, multicultural, or control ideology. They completed group-specific measures and general measures of diversity. Results indicate that successful anti-bias interventions require focus on the particular level from which intergroup attitudes are being formed. Second, the effectiveness of these opposing theories is a factor of the history of within group socialization practices. Finally, widespread use of these prominent ideologies in different sectors of society poses a threat to social tolerance in more diverse group settings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Cosmopolitan Way of Life for All?: A Reassessment of the Impact of Urban and Region on Racial Attitudes From 1972 to 2006
AN  - 1928242634
AB  - The purpose of this article is to re-evaluate the independent impact of urban and regional residency on racial tolerance from 1972 to 2006. Recent scholarship has questioned the extent to which the effects of these subcultures reflect general toleration and/or more deep-seated underlying racial attitudes. Using data collected by the National Opinion Research Center's General Social Survey, this article builds upon past research by including different measures of racial tolerance borrowed from the contemporary work of Schuman, Steeh, Bobo, and Krysan to reassess the impact of these subcultures over a four-decade period. Findings indicate that Southerners remain more obdurate regardless of how racial tolerance is measured and this effect appears to be persisting across the four-decade period. The impact of urbanism, on the other hand, and its effect across time is much more variable and dependent on how racial tolerance is measured. This article further discusses these findings in the framework of the classical theories of Louis Wirth and Samuel Stouffer.

T1  - Sources of Negative Attitudes toward Immigrants in Europe: A Multi-Level Analysis: IMR
AN  - 215273066
AB  - In recent times, many nations are experiencing an increase in anti-immigrant attitudes on the part of natives. Most papers only explore one or two sources of anti-immigrant attitudes at a time, which provides an incomplete picture of the effects at work. This paper tests eight different explanations for anti-immigrant attitudes: cultural marginality theory, human capital theory, political affiliation, societal integration, neighborhood safety, contact theory, foreign investment, and economic competition. Analysis is conducted using combined data from the European Social Survey and Eurostat/OECD and individual-, regional-, and national-level predictors. Results indicate that key predictors of anti-immigrant attitudes are regional and national interpersonal trust, education level, foreign direct investment, and political variables.

T1  - The time and space of race: reflections on David Theo Goldberg's interrelational and comparative methodology
AN  - 743065726; 201043309
AB  - Maldonado-Torres identifies and analyses key elements in the methodology of David Theo Goldberg's The Threat of Race, highlighting its relevance for ethnic studies, area studies and postcolonial studies generally, and for the study of race and ethnicity specifically. He focuses on Goldberg's conceptualization of the history or the time of race, as well as on the geopolitical and economic dimensions of race and racism. Goldberg's account of race as a 'foundational code' of modernity undergirds his perspective and the way in which these themes relate to each other, making his work relevant for the theorizing of race and racism at large, and not only for the theorization of race and neoliberalism today. To that extent, Maldonado-Torres interrogates Goldberg's view of the relation between racial naturalism and racial historicism, and his resistance to the concept of racialization. He also calls for a more detailed discussion of how racial historicism relates to ethnicity vis-a-vis race. As for the space of race, Goldberg makes substantial contributions to an interrelational understanding of contemporary racisms, going beyond typical divides between US ethnic studies and areas studies. Yet there is also work in these and other disciplines that can make further contributions to his thinking. Adapted from the source document.
