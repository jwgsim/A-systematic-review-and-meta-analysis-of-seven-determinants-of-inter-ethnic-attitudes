T1  - Integrazione in Europa. Un’esplorazione empirica tra vincoli strutturali e reazioni contestuali
AN  - 2567972533
AB  - The paper highlights the dynamics related to the problem of the integration of immigrants in Europe, focusing on the spread of prejudices and on the multiple conditions of exclusion. The main aim refers to the effectiveness of integration policies implemented in Europe. For this purpose, data from different sources are analysed to measure the degree of hostility versus tolerance towards foreign immigrants, both through official data and with the analysis of online comments published on Twitter during the period of European elections.

T1  - International Platforms, International Prejudice in the Platformization of Crafting
AN  - 2447803461
AB  - The platformization of crafting in an unequal world encourages discriminatory attitudes toward ethnic Others. Imagining that the “magic circle” of a subcultural platform can insulate users from racism is deeply misguided. We examine this thesis through a mixed-methods approach combining an online survey assessing perceived experiences of racism online and willingness to communicate with people of different ethnicities, discourse analysis of crafters’ online posts, and ethnographic interviews. As the e-commerce platform Etsy allowed “manufactured goods” to be sold in their marketplace as handmade, Western crafters channel their frustrations with a broken platform economy into racist sentiment against Chinese crafters. This study explores the implications of these Orientalist sentiments as a reinforcement of Western exceptionalism around originality and creativity, and it analyzes White fragility and the assumption of Whiteness within the crafting subculture.

T1  - How language shapes prejudice against women: An examination across 45 world languages.
AN  - 2419108107
AB  - Language provides an ever-present context for our cognitions and has the ability to shape them. Languages across the world can be gendered (language in which the form of noun, verb, or pronoun is presented as female or male) versus genderless. In an ongoing debate, one stream of research suggests that gendered languages are more likely to display gender prejudice than genderless languages. However, another stream of research suggests that language does not have the ability to shape gender prejudice. In this research, we contribute to the debate by using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) method which captures the meaning of a word from the context in which it occurs. Using text data from Wikipedia and the Common Crawl project (that contains text from billions of publicly facing websites) across 45 world languages, covering the majority of the world's population, we test for gender prejudice in gendered and genderless languages. We find that gender prejudice occurs more in gendered rather than genderless languages. Moreover, we examine whether genderedness of language influences the stereotypic dimensions of warmth and competence utilizing the same NLP method.

T1  - CULTURAL ISSUES IN VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND RITUAL KILLINGS IN NIGERIA: ASSESSING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AN  - 2427545294
AB  - The issue of violence against women has remained a growing source of concern to social scientists, human rights groups and the international community as a whole. Various studies have identified violence against women as a serious public health concern that inhibits gender parity and sustainable development. Violence against women, unfortunately, is disturbingly widespread in Nigeria and has assumed critical dimensions including forced marriage, trafficking in women, rape, acid baths and the killing of women for ritual purposes. As noted by various reports available to this study, the spate of killings for ritual purposes is at an alarming rate in Nigeria with women documented as primary victims. This study emerged from the recognition that the killing of women for ritual purposes is a serious gender-based violence with development implications, and is not unconnected to harmful cultural beliefs and prejudices regarding the female identity and the value of women in the society. To substantiate this thesis, a cross-sectional survey involving four hundred respondents conveniently selected from four purposively selected cities in the Southern part of Nigeria; namely Lagos, Warri, Yenagoa and Port Harcourt, was carried out. Data collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics such as charts and percentage analysis, revealed that women are usually killed for ritual purposes than men mainly because women are perceived as soft targets and 'objects' with intrinsic 'enriching ' value. The study thus recommends the formulation and implementation of policies that protect women from violence and the abolition of cultural beliefs that endanger women in the society.

T1  - Attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities: A meta‐cognitive approach to persuasion
AN  - 2398196181
AB  - Attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities are becoming critical for promoting diversity and egalitarianism within organizations. The few interventions designed to promote positive attitudes toward people with disabilities have relied on changing either the direction and/or the amount of thoughts people generate with regard to this discriminated, understudied group. In the present research, we examine the impact of a different psychological process of attitude change based on meta‐cognition, or thinking about thinking. We used a meta‐cognitive approach to changing prejudiced attitudes because thoughtful processes are often overlooked or denied with regard to this particular group. Specifically, we explored the impact of thought confidence on attitude change across two studies designed to change attitudes toward the incorporation of people with disabilities in companies. In each study, participants first generated either positive or negative thoughts about the proposal (thought valence manipulation). Then, the confidence in those thoughts was measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). In concert with the self‐validation hypothesis, results showed that when thought confidence was relatively high (vs. low), thought valence had a greater impact on attitudes. Thus, thought valence was more predictive of attitudes when participants were confident in their thoughts. Specifically, confidence in thoughts enhanced persuasion for positive thoughts but reduced persuasion for negative thoughts. These findings provide insights into assessing effects of interventions aiming at improving attitudes toward the inclusion of minority groups in organizations.

T1  - History and/through Oral Narratives: Relocating Women of the 1971 War of Bangladesh in Neelima Ibrahim's A War Heroine, I Speak
AN  - 2367754433
AB  - In the postmodern era, one of the primary objectives of oral narratives is to tell the untold stories of history. Amidst the allegations that historical representation of war narratives often tends to be gendered and biased, these oral narratives of women offer not only a fresh perspective to the wars like the 1971 war of Bangladesh, Sri Lankan Civil War (1983 - 2009) and Kashmir Insurgency (1989 - Present), but also become their own version of pain, suffering, prejudice, and plight. In that sense, they become the voice of the voiceless, giving the victims a chance to assert themselves, despite their subaltern position. They also converge as tools to reinvestigate or rather question the 'representation' of war history and the politics of submerging women in traditional documented historiography. In the context of the 1971 war of Bangladesh, Neelima Ibrahim's Aami Birangana Balchi (first published in Bengali in 1994, translated in English as A War Heroine, I Speak by Fayeza Hasanat in 2017), was the first narrative of its own kind that addressed victimization and survival of the Biranganas or literal brave heroines of the 1971 war. Ibrahim, being an active member of the humanitarian group 'Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation and Welfare Foundation' was a close observer of their struggle and thus, she recorded their narratives and published it. In a theoretical framework, where oral narratives play a seminal role in this sort of representations, this paper will broadly discuss Neelima Ibrahim's narratives of Biranganas of the 1971 war of Bangladesh.

T1  - A View of the Disaster and Victory from below: Serbian Roma Soldiers, 1912–1918
AN  - 2511165640
AB  - The Kingdom of Serbia fought in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918. These events merged into a devastating experience of an all-out war, completely reshaping all aspects of contemporary life. As the first centenary of these events has recently shown, the memories of wartime still play a very prominent role in the Serbian national narrative. By 1915 around 20% of Serbian combatants belonged to some of the country’s minorities. Second class citizens on the social margins of society, the Serbian Roma constitute those whose wartime history is the least known to research and the public. However, the wartime diaries kept by Serbian soldiers are full of causal references to their Roma fellow combatants. This article provides an overview of the duties Roma soldiers played in the war, based on the perspective of Serbs who were fighting alongside them. The article tackles the general image and the position of the Roma population in the Kingdom of Serbia. In addition, the horrific challenges the war created for Serbian society are tackled from the perspective of those who were, already in peace time, in the most disadvantageous situation socially and economically. Overall, despite the unifying experience which the wartime suffering imposed on all citizens of the Kingdom, the old prejudices towards the Roma survived after 1918.

T1  - Support for National Flag‐Displays in Times of Change: A Question of National Identification?
AN  - 2323309643
AB  - Flag‐displays can be used within national groups to communicate majority supremacy over ethnic minorities. In two studies set in an Australian context (N = 88 and N = 102), we explain how mode of national identification (glorifying identifiers versus attached identifiers) differently predicts support for multicultural values and national flag‐displays. In line with the hypotheses, we found that attached identifiers were more supportive of multicultural values and national flag‐displays by ethnic minorities than glorifying identifiers. In contrast, glorifying identifiers supported flag‐displays by the majority more than did the attached identifiers. Study 2 demonstrates that glorifying identifiers’ use of the national flag is explicitly meant to exclude other groups. As expected, support for multicultural values and endorsement of the flag as an exclusion tool helped to explain the relationship between identification and flag‐displays. As such, results revealed the attitudes behind a novel form of prejudice that is currently on the rise.

T1  - Perceptions of Tuberculosis Among Individuals Born in a High-Endemic Setting, Now Living in a Low-Endemic Setting
AN  - 2183928734
AB  - Of all individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) in Sweden 2015 were 90% born in other countries. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to avoid TB transmission. Lack of knowledge about TB and anticipated negative social consequences have proved to be significant contributing factors to delay in seeking health care. This study aimed to understand the perception of TB among people originating from a high-endemic region, currently living in a low-endemic region. A qualitative study design, with male and female participants from a high-endemic region divided into focus groups. A semi-structured interview guide was used to elicit their perceptions of TB. A qualitative content analysis was performed on the recorded material from the interviews. The informants noted that their attitude towards individuals with TB had changed, previously they had felt prejudiced towards them whereas now they felt supportive. It seems possible to diminish TB stigma by ensuring suitable health care is available in combination with correct information about transmission, infectiousness and treatment.

T1  - Implicit Evaluative Biases Toward Targets Varying in Race and Socioeconomic Status
AN  - 2285655847
AB  - Generally, White (vs. Black) and high-status (vs. low-status) individuals are rated positively. However, implicit evaluations of simultaneously perceived race and socioeconomic status (SES) remain to be considered. Across four experiments, participants completed an evaluative priming task with face primes orthogonally varying in race (Black vs. White) and SES (low vs. high). Following initial evidence of a positive implicit bias for high-SES (vs. low-SES) primes, subsequent experiments revealed that this bias is sensitive to target race, particularly when race and SES antecedents are presented in an integrated fashion. Specifically, high-SES positive bias was more reliable for White than for Black targets. Additional analyses examining how implicit biases may be sensitive to perceiver characteristics such as race, SES, and beliefs about socioeconomic mobility are also discussed. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of examining evaluations based on race and SES when antecedents of both categories are simultaneously available.

T1  - How young and older people differ in discriminatory behaviour towards older people? An explanation of the knowledge–attitude–behaviour continuum model
AN  - 2264140515
AB  - This study examined the causal relationship between knowledge, attitudes and discriminatory behaviour towards older people and further explored age-group differences using multi-group analysis. Data were collected from 1,500 Korean adults aged 20 and older in 2011 using the multi-stage quota sampling method. Trained investigators collected data with a developed survey questionnaire in person and a structural equation modelling method was used for data analysis. Attitudes towards older people was measured using two variables: ‘image of older people’ and ‘prejudice against older people’. The findings revealed that the younger and older generations demonstrated differences regarding the causal relationship between knowledge, attitudes and discriminatory behaviour towards older people. The paths model between independent and dependent variables in the structural equation modelling was non-equivalent in younger and older groups. For both groups, knowledge about ageing and older people led to a positive influence on their image of and prejudice against older people. The effect of prejudice on discriminatory behaviour was significant in the younger group, but not in the older group. Further implications for practice and future research to reduce ageism were discussed.

T1  - History and/through Oral Narratives: Relocating Women of the 1971 War of Bangladesh in Neelima Ibrahim's A War Heroine, I Speak
AN  - 2292915277
AB  - In the postmodern era, one of the primary objectives of oral narratives is to tell the untold stories of history. Amidst the allegations that historical representation of war narratives, tend to be gendered and biased, these oral narratives of women offer not only a fresh perspective to the wars like the 1971 war of Bangladesh, the Sri Lankan Civil War (1983 - 2009) and the Kashmir Insurgency (1989 - present), but also become their own version of pain, suffering, prejudice, and plight. In that sense, they become the voice of the voiceless, giving the victims a chance to assert themselves, despite their subaltern position. They also converge as tools to reinvestigate or rather question the representation of war history and the politics of submerging women in traditional documented historiography. In the context of the 1971 war of Bangladesh, Neelima Ibrahim's AamiBiranganaBalchi (first published in Bengali in 1994, translated in English as A War Heroine, I Speak by Fayeza Hasanat in 2017), was the first narrative of its own kind that addressed victimization and survival of the Biranganas or literal brave heroines of the 1971 war. Ibrahim, being an active member of the humanitarian group 'Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation and Welfare Foundation' was a close observer of their struggle and thus, she recorded their narratives and published it. In a theoretical framework, where oral narratives play a seminal role in this sort of representations, this paper will broadly discuss Neelima Ibrahim's narratives of Biranganas of the 1971 war of Bangladesh.

T1  - Uncovering the Citizenship Effect: The Impact of Citizenship Status on Federal Sentencing Outcomes
AN  - 2426551259
AB  - Scholarly literature on racial disparíties has only recently begun to examine the interaction of race/ethnicity and citizenship status in the criminal justice system. Through the use of measures of ethnic threat, the current study expands the research on citizenship and sentencing by examining if outcomes differ according to the local population. Using federal sentencing and district-level data, we estimate the effect of the interaction between citizenship status and ethnicity on sentencing outcomes. Results indicate that individuals who are both Hispanic and non-U.S. citizens receive significantly harsher punishments than U.S. citizens, regardless of ethnic threat at the district level.

T1  - Third-party prejudice accommodation increases gender discrimination
AN  - 2256512399
AB  - We investigated how gatekeepers sometimes arrive at discriminatory hiring selections to accommodate prejudiced third parties due to role demands (i.e., the "third-party prejudice effect"). Studies 1 and 2 show that individuals in charge of personnel decisions were significantly less likely to select a woman when a relevant third party (the chief executive officer of the company in Study 1; the "proposer" in an ultimatum game in Study 2) was prejudiced against women. Gatekeepers accommodate third-party prejudice in this way in order to avoid conflict in relations and task-related problems that would likely occur if the gatekeeper introduced a member of the target of prejudice into an organization. Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that both interpersonal and task-focused concerns significantly mediated third-party prejudice accommodation. Furthermore, experimentally reducing task-focused concerns significantly reduced the accommodation of third-party prejudice against women (Study 4). We also found that gatekeepers accommodate third-party prejudice regardless of their own beliefs and attitudes (Studies 5 and 6), or their own desire to get along or affiliate with the third party (Study 7), and despite leading to feelings of guilt (Studies 4 and 5). Both men and women accommodated third-party prejudice against women. A role-based framework can be useful to understand the persistence of gender inequality in various fields and organizations, even as individuals endorse increasingly gender-egalitarian views.

T1  - Character Assassination in Ancient Rome: Defamation in Cicero's First Catilinarian Oration from a Historical-Psychological Perspective
AN  - 2206164699
AB  - [...]we possess the complete text of the speeches, even though their published versions have been altered from the words that Cicero actually spoke in 63 BCE (a point to which we will return).

[...]despite our great distance to the Roman Republic, in time as well as in cultural values and habits, Cicero and Catiline operated within a political and social framework that had (some) features in common with our own time, such as the individual's acceptance of majority rule, the attention paid to public opinion, negative campaigning and personal attacks on political opponents, and coalition-building.

According to Ulrich Beck's definition, enemy images are "culturally generated prejudices and heterostereotypes that have been dramatically composed, enhanced, and made legitimate", and which are then employed to "create and expand the apparatus of state authority and the military."

According to the affective intelligence theory, which is probably the most applicable in our case, emotion does not only color people's voting choices, but also effects the way they process information about candidates.

T1  - Protecting commonly targeted groups in the context of ‘new politics’: the case of Ireland
AN  - 2185149177
AB  - This article addresses the big ‘P’ politics of hate by examining the circumstances that produced an apparent radical and sudden shift among the parties of government in Ireland from long-standing resistance to the introduction of hate crime legislation to an expansive approach to protecting commonly targeted minorities. By means of a directed qualitative content analysis of parliamentary debate regarding the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016, we argue that four factors aid comprehension of this uncommon pattern - the range of the Irish political spectrum, the current balance of power in parliament, the approach to the protection of difference adopted by established parties and finally, the permeability of the Irish political system and the consequent influence of civil society organisations representing targeted communities on the parliamentary debate. We argue that, rather than underscoring the national influence of global trends and international good practice, recent developments in Ireland demonstrate the importance of attending to the peculiarities of the local context in interpreting the meaning and significance of responses to hate crime.

T1  - Imagined contact with famous gay men and lesbians reduces heterosexuals’ misidentification concerns and sexual prejudice
AN  - 2171670674
AB  - Gay men and lesbians experience bigotry at alarmingly high rates. Traditionally, researchers have focused on reducing sexual prejudice; however, research indicates that heterosexuals’ concerns about being misidentified as gay/lesbian also contribute to the derogation of gay/lesbian individuals. Thus, reducing misidentification concerns is a critical part of decreasing negativity toward gay/lesbian individuals. In the current work, we explored a novel addition to the imagined contact paradigm—imagined contact with famous outgroup members—for reducing misidentification concerns. We found that imagined contact with famous gay men/lesbians reduced misidentification concerns within the imagined interaction and engendered an eagerness to befriend the famous gay/lesbian interaction partner. Moreover, we found that the reduction of these misidentification concerns led to fewer general contagion concerns, and increased eagerness to befriend led to decreased sexual prejudice. The current work develops a useful intervention for improving multiple responses toward gay men and lesbians.

T1  - ORGANIZATIONAL IRRESPONSIBILITIES OR ABSENCE OF TERRITORIAL GOVERNANCE? REFLECTIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IN THE MINAS-RIO PROJECT
AN  - 2637299985
AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse social and organizational dimensions of the environmental licensing and implementation process of the mining project Minas-Rio, discussing methodological and managerial frailties highlighted by the accumulation of reports regarding irregularities, socioenvironmental conflicts, and flaws in the venture’s masterplan. This situation reveals authoritarian systems of business management and territorial governance, which fail to sustain local development, subjecting families to the disruption of their traditional livelihood. In 10 years (2007-2017) following the case, qualitative methods - participative techniques - were used to collect data, allowing the comprehension of the environmental licensing processes, negotiations and conflicting clashes between actors. It was observed that tools for public corporate planning did not prove to be able to guarantee the management of the impacts on water resources: watercourses had springs and stretches trapped and communities declared themselves affected by the water drying and pollution, being assisted only with precarious supply solutions.Alternate abstract:

En 10 años (2007-2017) de seguimiento del caso, se adopta métodos cualitativos - técnicas participativas - para la obtención de datos, permitiendo la comprensión de los procesos de licenciamiento ambiental, negociaciones y enfrentamientos conflictivos entre actores. Se constató que instrumentos de planificación pública no se mostraron capaces de garantizar la gestión de los impactos de la minería sobre recursos hídricos: cursos de agua tuvieron nacientes sepultados, y comunidades se declaran perjudicadas por la disminución y contaminación del agua, siendo atendidas por precarias soluciones de suministro.Alternate abstract:

T1  - "Sounds Like Something a White Man Should Be Doing": The Shared Experiences of Black Women Engineering Students
AN  - 2423035145
AB  - Black women engineering students often find themselves in an uninviting space in a field dominated by White men. Thus, as Black women matriculate toward completion of their engineering degrees, they encounter instances of racism, sexism, and prejudice that result from the intersection of their race and gender. In an effort to identify and understand their similar experiences, the present study used Black feminist theory and intersectionality. Nine undergraduate Black women engineering students at a predominantly White institution engaged in semi-structured life history interviews. The interviews revealed two themes that exposed how others view participants, how participants view themselves, the similarities among Black women engineering students ' experiences, the different ways Black women can be oppressed, and the ways in which Black women experience and respond to different forms ofprejudice.

T1  - Resisting hostility generated by terror: An agent-based study
AN  - 2167016810
AB  - We propose an agent-based model leading to a decrease or an increase of hostility between agents after a major cultural threat such as a terrorist attack. The model is inspired from the Terror Management Theory and the Social Judgement Theory. An agent has a cultural identity defined through its acceptance segments about each of three different cultural worldviews (i.e., Atheist, Muslim, Christian) of the considered society. An agent’s acceptance segment is composed from its acceptable positions toward a cultural worldview, including its most acceptable position. An agent forms an attitude about another agent depending on the similarity between their cultural identities. When a terrorist attack is perpetrated in the name of an extreme cultural identity, the negatively perceived agents from this extreme cultural identity point of view tend to decrease the width of their acceptance segments in order to differentiate themselves more from the threatening cultural identity. We generated a set of populations with cultural identities compatible with data from a survey on attitudes among a large sample representative of the population of France; we then simulated the reaction of these agents facing a terrorist attack from Muslim extremists. For most populations, the average attitude toward Muslims becomes more negative. However, for some specific populations, we noticed the opposite effect as the average attitude of the population toward Muslims becomes less negative. In these populations, the Muslim agents strongly differentiate themselves from the terrorists’ extreme cultural identity, and the other agents are aware of these changes. These reactions are due to particular properties of their cultural identities that are identified in this paper.

T1  - African American Men Theological Perspectives
AN  - 2410429335
AB  - The most outstanding characteristics of the African American male are the stereotypes promulgated by whites. He is presented in image physically, intellectually, socially, and sexually as dangerous and intolerable. Although he may have religious orientations to places of worship, he is generally held to be without commitment to theology with soundness of understanding and purpose. This study investigates the self-reported views held by African American men as a function of theology and religion. Employing a mixed descriptive-exploratory methodology, this study sets forth views held by African American men toward religion as it may impact their decision making and lives. The study findings have immediate significance to race relations as a function of religion and church holdings.

T1  - 'The battlefield is in Brussels': Islamophobia in the Visegrád Four in its global context
AN  - 2139171787
AB  - A common popular and scholarly opinion of Islamophobia in the so-called 'Visegrád Four' or 'V4' (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary) sees it as caused by circumstances unique to Eastern Europe. Specifically to blame, it is alleged, is a distinctive local history of intolerance, especially antisemitism, and the fact that under socialism these countries were exempt from the post-war soul-searching that took place in Western Europe. Kalmar's paper, instead, decentres Islamophobia in the V4 by considering it less as a limited regional phenomenon, and more in terms of how it is linked to Islamophobia in other European Union member states and the United States. As elsewhere, foremost among the conditions that encourage Islamophobia in the V4 is the alienation of certain publics on the periphery, which is an effect of global neoliberal policies. These have generated, along with Islamism and Islamophobia, a reinvented, essentializing discourse of difference between Eastern and Western Europe. In spite of that alleged difference, however, Islamophobic populism in the V4 is not just a regional threat to liberal democracy, but targets all of the European Union and the world.

T1  - The prejudice against asylum seekers scale: presenting the psychometric properties of a new measure of classical and conditional attitudes
AN  - 2124669061
AB  - This paper reports the initial psychometric properties for the recently developed prejudice against asylum seekers scale (PAAS)-a new measure of the classical and conditional components of negative attitudes towards asylum seekers. Across three studies the initial psychometric evidence is presented: An exploratory factor analysis suggested that the 16 items of the PAAS accurately factor onto the two hypothesized subscales (Study 1), which was ratified using a confirmatory factor analysis (Study 2). The presented reliability estimates (internal consistency: Studies 1-3; test-retest reliability: Study 3) verified the stability of the measure. Finally, evidence of the validity for the scale (criterion, construct, and known-groups; Study 2) and for the independent predictive validity of each subscale is presented. In summary, the evidence presented here suggests that the PAAS is a psychometrically sound measure of classical and contemporary prejudice against asylum seekers.

T1  - Emotions as mediators of the stereotype–discrimination relationship: A BIAS map replication: GPIR
AN  - 2109035276
AB  - A central theoretical assumption in the Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) map framework is that emotions mediate the relationships between stereotypes and intergroup behavior. Despite the BIAS map’s popularity, very few studies have tested the model’s mediation hypotheses and none have tested them by replicating the original study (Cuddy, Fiske, & Glick, 2007, Study 1). We provide a replication in a Norwegian sample (N = 244). The results supported that stereotype content is related to behavior tendencies, mediated through emotional prejudices. However, for each of the four behavior outcomes the effect of stereotype content was mediated through one emotion rather than two as predicted by the BIAS map. Our findings both converge and diverge from those of Cuddy and colleagues, and provide support for theoretical propositions unsupported by the original study. Overall, the study provides empirical support for the BIAS map framework and its cross-cultural validity.

T1  - Generalized Discrimination Perceptions and American Jewish Perception of Antisemitism
AN  - 2030042610
AB  - Why do American Jews, who are highly successful in several regards, perceive so much antisemitism and discrimination? Previous research has focused on individual characteristics, Jewish identity, and environmental factors. This paper adds another factor, perceptions of discrimination against non-Jews, arguing that when Jews perceive high levels of discrimination against non-Jews, they fear that discrimination against non-Jews will spread to Jews. The paper used data from the 2013 Pew Survey of American Jews to test this hypothesis, and the analysis finds support for it. The conclusion puts the findings into context and offers suggestions for future research.

T1  - 'They treat us like criminals': urban public spaces and ethnic discrimination in Italy
AN  - 2081349322
AB  - Mantovan's article analyses the processes that lead to discrimination against migrants in the public spaces of Italy's towns. Her analysis is based on a three-year research project conducted in northeastern Italy using mixed methods-ethnographic observation, semi-structured interviews, a press review, an analysis of relevant documentation and data collection-and remaining constantly in touch with research conducted in various Italian cities. Starting from an idea of a city whose evolution is the product of alliances, conflicts, active networks of individuals and their respective competing interests, Mantovan sheds light on how discrimination against immigrants in Italy's urban public spaces is the result of a process of social construction implemented by a number of social actors (journalists, citizens' committees, politicians and police forces) who represent the visible presence of migrants in these public spaces as deviant and unlawful, especially if they are undocumented immigrants and/or of low socio-economic status. She also argues for the importance of taking into consideration the contribution of economic and political dynamics, both global and national, to the generation of these phenomena by interacting with those at the local level.

T1  - Will We Build A Wall? Fear of Mexican/Latino Immigration in U.S. History
AN  - 2283957214
AB  - A presidential election was won on the strength of a nativist philosophy which asserts that the U.S. must build a wall of separation with its closest neighbor to the South. The current president has voiced not only his frustration and prejudices but the nativist sentiments of the public. The emphasis on "building the wall" and the antagonism expressed towards Mexico have deepened the centuries-old sense of fear and separation felt by members of the Mexican/Latino immigrant group. Can we look at history in search of plausible explanations? This paper examines past and contemporary reasons that might explain the observable antagonism to the Mexican/Latino population in the U.S. today.

T1  - Muslims' Experience of Islamophobia in Major Scottish Cities: Different Experiences and Diverse perceptions
AN  - 2100342581
AB  - According to some researchers (Hopkins, 2004a; Hopkins & Smith, 2008), there is a perception among certain Muslims that anti-Muslim racism is higher in areas where there is a high density of Muslim residents, such as Glasgow. In contrast, other Muslims may feel that Islamophobia is higher in places with fewer numbers of Muslim residents. Through an investigation of Muslims' experiences of Islamophobia in major Scottish cities, this paper discusses the influence of the size of Muslim communities in experiencing Islamophobia1. It also examines the importance of other possible factors, such as socio-economic status and deprivation on Islamophobia. To this end, the experience and accounts of 33 Muslim participants in major Scottish cities (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee) were documented and analyzed through qualitative methods. The findings of this paper suggest that Muslims' individual and social aspects of life play a more important role on Islamophobia, as opposed to the size of their population in a certain area. More precisely, the analysis of Muslims who experienced Islamophobia suggests that Muslims' identity and visibility, especially racial and religious signifiers such as skin color, beard or hijab, were crucial to their experiences of Islamophobia.

T1  - Perceived threat to national values in evaluating stereotyped immigrants
AN  - 1992034306
AB  - The present research examined the psychological reasons behind Americans' (un)willingness to accept immigrants. Participants read a scenario depicting immigrant groups allegedly expected to arrive in the United States and evaluated how much the immigrants would influence two types of American national values: civic values (e.g., political ideology) and ethnic values (e.g., shared culture and customs). Across three studies, competitive immigrant groups were stereotyped to be untrustworthy and perceived to threaten American civic values, but not ethnic values. Value threat then mediated the predicted competition-prejudice relationship in Study 3. Perceived vulnerability of in-group boundary might specify one motivated cause of derogating immigrants.

T1  - Outgroup members’ internal criticism promotes intergroup openness: The role of perceived risk
AN  - 2008940929
AB  - Research suggests that hearing an outgroup member voice internal criticism increases individuals’ openness to the outgroup's perspective. We replicate and extend these findings in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israeli participants exposed to a Palestinian official voicing internal criticism reported more openness to the Palestinian narrative of the conflict, an effect that was mediated by an increase in participants’ perception that Palestinians are open‐minded and a subsequent increase in their hope for more positive relations between the two groups. In our extension of these findings, we examined a complementary mechanism contributing to the effectiveness of the criticism manipulation, specifically the extent to which participants perceive that the Palestinian official took a risk voicing criticism of Palestinians. Positive messages from a hostile outgroup may be received with suspicion, but if they are articulated under great risk to the speaker, greater credibility may be granted. Across two studies, we demonstrate that the criticism conveys risk to the speaker and that this risk is predictive of the perceived credibility of the speaker, and participants’ subsequent openness to the outgroup's perspective.

T1  - Race and recession: Effects of economic scarcity on racial discrimination
AN  - 1982175893
AB  - When the economy declines, existing racial disparities typically expand, suggesting that economic scarcity may promote racial discrimination. To understand this pattern, we examined the effect of perceived scarcity on resource allocations to Black and White American recipients, and tested whether this effect depends on a decision maker's motivation to respond without prejudice. We proposed that scarcity would lead to increased discrimination among those with relatively low internal motivation but not those high in internal motivation. Indeed, we found that when resources were framed as scarce (vs. abundant or a control condition), low-motivation participants allocated less to Black than White recipients, whereas high-motivation participants allocated more to Black than White recipients (Studies 1 and 2). This pattern was strongest when decisions could be made deliberatively (Study 3), and anti-Black allocation bias emerged even in a non-zero-sum context (Studies 4 and 5), suggesting a strategic bias directed against Black recipients rather than in favor of White recipients. These findings indicate that the psychological perception of scarcity can produce racial bias in the distribution of economic resources, depending on the motivations of the decision maker -- an effect that may contribute to the increase in racial disparities observed during economic stress.

T1  - Cultural Differences in the Role of Economic Competitiveness in Prejudice toward Immigrants and Foreign Workers
AN  - 1980069311
AB  - This study investigated cultural differences in the role of economic competitiveness in prejudice toward immigrants and foreign workers between Northern European-heritage and East Asian cultures. Because economic competitiveness and achievement are associated with core cultural values in Northern European-heritage cultures, we hypothesized that economic competitiveness would be associated with prejudice toward immigrants and foreign workers more strongly in Northern European-heritage than in East Asian cultures. Results based on nationally representative samples drawn from the World Values Survey revealed that prejudice toward immigrants and foreign workers was generally higher in East Asian (South Korea and China) than in Northern European-heritage (Norway and the United States) cultures. However, as predicted, a stronger association was found between economic competitiveness and prejudice toward immigrants and foreign workers in Northern European-heritage than East Asian cultures, controlling for sociodemographic backgrounds of participants (gender, age, education, and income), ecological diversity of each country, values of uniqueness and conformity, attitude toward ethnic diversity, and racism. These findings support the hypothesis that the central values of a culture shape the nature of prejudice within it, including prejudice toward immigrants and foreign workers, and highlight the importance of understanding the cultural dynamics of prejudice.

T1  - Prejudice in the pub: How alcohol and ideology loosen the tongue
AN  - 1951600566
AB  - This study (N = 124) tested the main and interactive effects of alcohol consumption, egalitarianism, and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) in relation to prejudice suppression in the natural environment of a British Public House (pub). Employing a quasi-experimental between-subjects design, participants who had consumed alcohol were worse at suppressing their prejudice than participants with no alcohol consumption. Further, the more participants endorsed egalitarian values, the more they were able to suppress their prejudice. This tendency was resistant to the effects of alcohol. By contrast, the stronger participants held RWA beliefs, the less they were able to suppress their prejudice. In addition, this tendency was accentuated by alcohol consumption. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications.

T1  - Restoring Threatened Masculinity: The Appeal of Sexist and Anti-Gay Humor
AN  - 1951231551
AB  - We propose that men scoring higher in precarious manhood beliefs (PMB) express amusement with sexist and anti-gay humor (but not other forms of humor) in response to masculinity threat in order to reaffirm their masculinity. Accordingly, Experiment 1 (166 heterosexual men in the United States recruited through Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk) supported the hypothesis that men higher in PMB express greater amusement with sexist and anti-gay jokes after experiencing a threat to their masculinity but not in the absence of masculinity threat. Also, the significant positive relationship between PMB and amusement following a masculinity threat was unique to the sexist and anti-gay jokes; it did not emerge for anti-Muslim and neutral jokes. Experiment 2 (221 heterosexual men in the United States recruited through Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk) extended the findings of Experiment 1, supporting the hypothesis that, following a masculinity threat, men higher in PMB express amusement with sexist and anti-gay humor because they believe it reaffirms their masculinity. Thus, our findings suggest that sexist and anti-gay humor serve a self-affirming function for men who possess higher PMB in situations that threaten one’s masculinity. By uncovering a novel psychological function of sexist and anti-gay humor in social settings, we hope the present research will lead to better understandings of the kinds of situations that foster its occurrence and ultimately to strategies for preventing it.

T1  - Negative emotions versus target descriptions: Examining perceptions of racial slurs as expressive and descriptive: GPIR
AN  - 1943426016
AB  - There is a debate about whether racial slurs operate primarily as descriptives (of the ethnicity of targets) or expressives (of negative emotions toward targets). In three studies (overall N = 471), we examined whether different racial slurs used in different situations led to slurs being perceived as descriptive versus expressive, and whether this distinction was related to the perceived offensiveness of the slurs. Our results showed the descriptive and expressive natures of racial slurs are directly related to their perceived offensiveness. Specifically, as the perceived offensiveness of slurs increase in intensity, the slurs are perceived as more negatively expressive, more descriptive, less positively expressive, and comparatively less descriptive and more expressive.

T1  - Re-examining Socialization Theory: How Does Democracy Influence the Impact of Education on Anti-Foreigner Sentiment?
AN  - 1938319769
AB  - Socialization theory claims that the ability of education to reduce anti-foreigner sentiment varies cross-nationally because state authorities are not equally committed to accepting ethnic minorities: higher educated persons harbor less anti-foreigner sentiment because they spend longer in educational institutions that impose official democratic values, which forbid negative reactions toward ethnic minorities. Consequently, higher educated persons ought to diverge from the lower educated as democratic institutions progress. Analyses support these claims: the impact of education on reducing anti-foreigner sentiment is strongest in the oldest democracies, moderate among the medium-aged (e.g., South European) democracies and weakest among the youngest (East European) democracies; and higher educated persons are disproportionately influenced by the maturation of democratic institutions. Analyses utilize data from the 28-country 2008 European Social Survey.

T1  - PERCEPTIONS OF STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS TOWARDS SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN MIGRANT WOMEN LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS IN BELGIUM: A QUALITATIVE STUDY
AN  - 1925458504
AB  - Summary 
Stigma and discrimination within health care settings remain a public health challenge across diverse cultural environments and may have deleterious effects on mental and physical health. This study explores the causes, forms and consequences of HIV-related stigma and discrimination among migrant sub-Saharan African women living with HIV in Belgium. A qualitative study was conducted with 44 HIV-positive sub-Saharan African migrant women between April 2013 and December 2014 in health care settings in Belgium. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Twenty-five of the women reported overt stigma and discrimination and fifteen reported witnessing behaviours that they perceived to be stigmatizing and discriminatory in health care settings. The themes that emerged as to the causes of stigma and discrimination were: public perceptions of migrants and HIV, fear of contamination and institutional policies on HIV management. Reported forms of stigma and discrimination included: delayed or denied care, excessive precautions, blame and humiliation. The consequences of stigma and discrimination were: emotional stress, inconsistent health-care-seeking behaviour and non-disclosure to non-HIV treating personnel. Stigma and discrimination in health care settings towards people with HIV, and more specifically towards HIV-positive sub-Saharan African migrant women, impedes sustainable preventive measures. Specialized education and training programmes for non-HIV health care providers require in-depth investigation.

TT  - SECURITIZAÇÃO DAS MUDANÇAS CLIMÁTICAS: O RISCO DO EXAGERO
AN  - 1989645986
AB  - The present contribution focuses on the ‘selling’ of the ‘climate crisis’ to intended key audiences, both in the international domain and at home. We look into the mechanics of crisis framing, the audience, and the resonance that the frame had, as well as development over time in two cases: the UK addressing the UN Security Council and the State Advisory Commission on Deltas (‘Delta Commission’) seeking support in the Netherlands for drastic measures to address sea level rise.Alternate abstract:Esta contribuição tem como foco a “promoção” da “crise climática”, para seus principais públicos, tanto no âmbito internacional como no plano doméstico. O olhar é para os mecanismos de enquadramento dessa crise, seu público e sua repercussão, bem como seu desenvolvimento ao longo do tempo, em dois casos: o do Reino Unido, na sua relação com o Conselho de Segurança da ONU, e o da Comissão Consultiva Estadual do Delta dos Países Baixos (“Comissão Delta”), buscando apoio nos Países Baixos para medidas drásticas para lidar com o aumento do nível do mar. Para isso, aplica-se o quadro conceitual dos estudos críticos de segurança de securitização, com contribuições de estudos de crises e desastres. Ambos os estudos de caso discutidos mostram um dramático movimento de securitização, no qual as mudanças climáticas são apresentadas como motivo de uma grande crise potencial, que vai prejudicar a todos se não tomarmos medidas urgentes - tanto para a mitigação (redução das emissões de gases de efeito estufa) quanto para a adaptação.

T1  - Intellectuals, Civil Society, and Political Power in Cuba
AN  - 1985646302
AB  - [...]the view of the Catholic Church as dominant ignores the fact that religious organizations of African origin-highly discriminated against by most Christian churches-are the most deeply rooted religious institutions in Cuban popular culture.[...]this conception ignores the transformation of Cuban civic culture since the late 1980s, and particularly since the crisis, including how this affected mass cultural consumption-itself including the visual arts (film) and literature.According to sociologists who address inequality and poverty, the Gini coefficient, (which measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of income or wealth in a country) increased from 0.24 in 1986 to 0.40 in 2013 (Espina 2014, 102).Since the Special Period, this dialogue has taken the form of wide-ranging debates in which Fidel Castro himself listened to the opinions of artists and intellectuals on such political and social issues as the persistence of racial prejudice and discrimination, the causes of marginalization and crime, or dogmatic ideological readings about some controversial Cuban films.

T1  - National Identity and Public Attitudes Toward Multiculturalism in Canada: Testing the Indirect Effect via Perceived Collective Threat
AN  - 1931598730
AB  - This article integrates research on national identity and collective threat to examine how these 2 factors jointly contribute to the formation of multicultural ideology in Canada. Specifically, this article argues that ethnic and civic forms of national identity are associated with levels of perceived collective threat, thereby indirectly affecting multicultural attitudes (national identity ¡ collective threat ¡ multicultural attitudes). Results of structural equation modeling analyses indicated that (a) ethnic national identity is positively, and civic national identity is negatively, associated with collective threat; (b) the direct effect of ethnic national identity on multicultural attitudes disappears when collective threat is taken into account; and (c) the relationship between ethnic-civic national identity and multicultural attitudes is significantly mediated by collective threat. These findings imply that a shift from an ethnic to a civic (or ethnoculturally thinner) conception of nationhood reduces levels of outgroup threat and thereby indirectly generates positive multicultural ideology.

T1  - When shared group membership signifies shared subjective experience: I-sharing and the minimal group paradigm
AN  - 1900995644
AB  - Ingroup favoritism is pervasive. It emerges even in the minimal group paradigm, where participants are assigned to novel groups based on seemingly insignificant characteristics. Yet many of the grouping schemes used in minimal group research may imply something significant: namely, that ingroup members will share in-the-moment subjective experience, or I-share. Two studies examine the role of inferred I-sharing in the minimal group paradigm. We found that (1) people inferred that they would I-share with ingroup members more than outgroup members; (2) inferred I-sharing increased ingroup favoritism; and (3) inferred I-sharing accounted for this ingroup favoritism. Moreover, expecting to I-share with the outgroup improved participants' attitudes toward the outgroup. These results converge with other research suggesting that people favor ingroup members, in part, because they expect to I-share with them.

T1  - Testing Theories of Gun Policy Preferences Among Blacks, Latinos, and Whites in America*
AN  - 1910062402
AB  - Objective 
Research examining the factors shaping gun policy attitudes has focused on the general population or whites. Little is known about how self-interest, political values, or racial prejudice shape the gun policy preferences of minorities. We seek to assess the effect of self-interest, political values, and racial prejudice on the gun policy attitudes of whites, Latinos, and blacks. We also introduce a measure of prejudice difference in group violence--which has not been previously used in the literature on gun policy opinion. 
Methods 
We use data from a new survey (2015) and analyze whites, blacks, and Latinos separately. 
Results 
We find that many of the drivers of support for gun control found in the general population apply to minorities as well, but the substantive effects vary across groups. Similar to prior general population findings, we find that for all groups concern about crime is associated with more support for gun control, and that gun ownership, being the victim of a crime, and conservative political values are associated with less support. 
Conclusion 
In contrast, we find that racial prejudice is negatively correlated with support for gun control among whites and Latinos, while one type of racial prejudice--racial resentment--increases support for gun control among blacks.

T1  - Discourse Failures and the NGO Sector: How Campaigning Can Undermine Advocacy
AN  - 1899628270
AB  - Within academic research, more and more scholars reveal the ambivalence of NGOs--the sometimes constructive, sometimes destructive role they play in solving societal problems. In this paper, we present a discourse analysis that illustrates how NGOs' campaigning may undermine their reputation and advocacy function. We conclude that such discourse failures are frequently not merely an accidental by-product, but rather a not-intended consequence of deliberate NGOs' campaigns. By applying ideas from political economy, we make particular note of probable discourse failures when campaigns attempt to deal with complex issues in an environment rife with wide-spread prejudices and where the NGO's work is transparent. We present collectively institutionalized commitments for NGOs and commitment services enforced by political organizations as instruments that are suitable for increasing public accountability of the NGO sector. In conclusion, we argue that further research can benefit from systematically analyzing the interdependencies between discourses and institutions.

T1  - Two axes of subordination: A new model of racial position
AN  - 1928749732
AB  - Theories of race relations have been shaped by the concept of a racial hierarchy along which Whites are the most advantaged and African Americans the most disadvantaged. However, the recent precipitated growth of Latinos and Asian Americans in the United States underscores the need for a framework that integrates more groups. The current work proposes that racial and ethnic minority groups are disadvantaged along 2 distinct dimensions of perceived inferiority and perceived cultural foreignness, such that the 4 largest groups in the United States are located in 4 discrete quadrants: Whites are perceived and treated as superior and American; African Americans as inferior and relatively American compared with Latinos and Asian Americans; Latinos as inferior and foreign; and Asian Americans as foreign and relatively superior compared to African Americans and Latinos. Support for this Racial Position Model is first obtained from targets' perspectives. Different groups experience distinct patterns of racial prejudice that are predicted by their 2-dimensional group positions (Studies 1 and 2). From perceivers' perspectives, these group positions are reflected in the content of racial stereotypes (Study 3), and are well-known and consensually recognized (Study 4). Implications of this new model for studying contemporary race relations (e.g., prejudice, threat, and interminority dynamics) are discussed. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-08699-001]

T1  - The Dichotomy in between Ecocentrism & Anthropocentrism: An Ecocritical Rendering of Two Indian English Poets
AN  - 2188110981
AB  - One of the plebeian environmental moral dilemmas that are noticed in third world nations are the dialectical assimilation in between anthropocentrism and ecocentrism. Owing to some devout and semipolitical prejudices some people are taking the whip hand over nature snubbing the nature, flora and fauna. But concurrently some of the great unwashed gestate in nature centered ecological system and yielding values to all non-human entities unheeding of their usefulness to human civilization. In the third world Asian countries this situation is even more abominable and eminent eco-socialists assay to exhibit this delineated envision in various ways for it becomes necessitate for them. While it is in the case of literary eminent some Indian English poets conjure up their apotheosis and cerebration through their penned composition. Poets from Indiaon one hand depict the anthropocentric attitude of their native people and simultaneously they assume ecocentric attitude. Exalted bookmen like Keki N.Daruwalla and Shiv K.Kumar evince the world with its acculturation, sights and sounds, predilection, disillusionment, bewilderment and discombobulation ensuing from modern way of living and mentation. So from this vantage point their eco-poems arbitrate in between anthropocentrism and ecocentrism. A construe brooding of some of their oeuvre excogitate light on environmental awareness along with the enactment of human and non-human relation which is often laissez faire and patriarchal. Concurrently their perdurable compositions splay socio-ecologic discourse through which readers can ensnarl with the demography, urbanization, modernization and development of environmental activism. Their abiding oeuvre works like a mirror where the congenial understanding between man and nature along with the scope of verdict is contrived. Working within the peripheries of environmentalism their aeonian verse paves a way through which a solution within this third world environmentalism can be made possible.

T1  - Perceived Caste Discrimination, Self Esteem and Self Determination among college students belonging to Scheduled Castes
AN  - 1926526974
AB  - Discrimination is defined as the unjust and prejudicial treatment of different categories of people based on the group, class or category to which that person belongs. Self-esteem refers to a favourable or unfavourable attitude toward the self. Self determination is when individuals experience one of two forms of motivation: autonomous or controlled. Autonomous motivation is when people experience a profound sense of choice. In contrast, when individuals experience controlled motivation, they feel obliged and driven by forces that transcend the self. The present study is a quantitative study with a between groups design to observe if there is a difference between female students and male students belonging to the scheduled castes with respect to perceived caste discrimination, self esteem and self determination and its two dimensions (viz., self-contact and choicefulness). It also adopts a correlational design to study the relationship between perceived caste discrimination, self esteem and self determination and its two dimensions. Through purposive sampling, data was collected from 200 college students belonging to the scheduled castes. Brief Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire-Community Version, Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale and Self Determination Scale were used. Results of independent samples ř-test indicated a significant difference between female and male students, with respect to perceived caste discrimination. Pearson's correlation revealed a significant positive relationship between perceived caste discrimination and self-esteem in female students and a significant negative relationship between perceived caste discrimination and self-contact (dimension of self-determination) in both female and male students. In male students, a significant positive relationship between perceived caste discrimination and choicefulness (dimension of self-determination) was also found. In light of the current tumultuous environment in universities across India with regard to the issue of caste discrimination, the findings of the present study highlights the association of perceived caste discrimination with psychological factors which can be used for various interventions in educational institutions.

T1  - A First Line of Defence? Vigilant Surveillance, Participatory Policing, and the Reporting of "Suspicious" Activity
AN  - 1876036932
AB  - What is at stake when citizens are encouraged to deploy vigilant surveillance and report what they consider to be unusual and "suspicious" activity? This article explores the current role of vigilance in contemporary Western security practices aimed at battling terrorist acts and major crime. It does so by critically analysing official constructions of suspiciousness, the responsibilisation process of participatory policing, and the assignments of prejudiced amateur detectives. It concludes, firstly, that the agency offered by political campaigns such as "If You See Something, Say Something" is highly illusive since the act of reporting simply demarcates where participation ends, and where fear and paranoia are turned into legitimate intelligence, enabling the state to exercise authoritative action and preemptive violence. Secondly, these kinds of vigilance initiatives also nurture a normalisation of suspicion towards strangers since the encouragements to be aware of anything-and-anyone deemed "out of the ordinary", as well as the tools for reporting such suspicions, increasingly creep into the mundane realms of everyday life.

T1  - The Relationship between Weight-Based Prejudice and Attitudes towards Obesity-Reducing Public Policies
AN  - 1852958723
AB  - A variety of public policies have been proposed to counteract obesity. Many factors, such as the desire to promote better health, may affect the support for such policies. However, given the pervasiveness of weight-based prejudice in the United States, it is likely that antifat bias may influence policy attitudes as well. We predicted that higher levels of weight-based prejudice would be positively associated with attitudes towards obesity-reducing policies and would be associated specifically with support for policies that are more punitive in nature. In two separate studies, participants were surveyed about their level of support for various public health polices and their explicit antifat prejudice attitudes, along with other relevant attitudinal and demographic information. Study 1 established that weight-based prejudice was significantly associated with support for more punitive policies even when controlling for other related factors. Study 2 extended this result to show that the link between antifat attitudes and support for punitive policies was foremost about targeting overweight individuals as opposed to targeting unhealthy behavior. These findings highlight the need for thoughtful consideration of how best to separate out the prejudicial motive to punish from the need to promote health when choosing, garnering support for, and implementing obesity-related policies.

T1  - Sexual Orientation in the Labor Market
AN  - 1846272819
AB  - Most analyses of sexual orientation and earnings find that gay men face a wage gap, whereas lesbian women earn higher wages than similar heterosexual women. However, analyses rarely consider bisexual men and women as a unique group separate from other sexual minorities. I argue that such binary views of sexual orientation -- treating sexual minorities as a homogenous non-heterosexual group -- have obscured understandings of the impact of sexual orientation on labor market outcomes. Specifically, I predict that unequal outcomes for gay men and lesbian women are partly due to the influence of family arrangements and their effects on earnings. In contrast, I argue that bisexual men and women should be the most disadvantaged in the labor market, due to particularly disadvantaging stereotypes, perceptions of choice to their sexual orientation, and prejudicial treatment. Using data from the General Social Survey (N = 13,554) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 14,714), I show that family arrangements explain some of the observed earnings differentials for gay men and lesbian women. Bisexual men and women, in contrast, face wage penalties that are not explained by human capital differences or occupational characteristics. Perceptions of prejudicial treatment partially explain the observed wage gaps. [web URL: http://asr.sagepub.com/content/81/6/1132.abstract]

T1  - Competition and intergroup bias: Toward a new construal process framework distinguishing competitive perceptions from competitive motivations: GPIR
AN  - 1830218153
AB  - Research on the effects of intergroup competition has relied on various conceptual approaches and has produced inconsistent findings. Following a review of the intergroup competition literature, we propose a framework which emphasizes that the influence of intergroup competition varies primarily according to participants' construal of potentially competitive events. We assess this via two variables: competitive intergroup perceptions (CIP), the perception that one's ingroup and another group(s) in the current situation are attempting to gain a reward at each other's expense; and competitive intergroup motivations (CIM), the individual desire for one's group to do better or acquire more of a reward than the other group(s). In four studies that presented participants with an ambiguously competitive intergroup setting and administered CIP and CIM scales adapted for the context, both variables were empirically nonredundant (Studies 1-4) and showed unique relations with intergroup outcomes: CIM, rather than CIP, was directly associated with greater intergroup bias (Studies 2-4), discriminatory intentions (Study 3), and discriminatory behavior (Study 4). CIP consistently registered an indirect effect on intergroup bias and behavior through CIM. Our results suggest that in ambiguous group contexts, CIM facilitates the pursuit of goals for the ingroup, which may involve expressing intergroup bias and more antisocial outgroup behavior, and that these tendencies are quite sensitive to corresponding changes in CIP. The current framework offers more precise insights into the influence of competitive group dynamics, and can easily be integrated with other research paradigms to determine how and when intergroup competition produces intergroup bias and discrimination.

T1  - Representations and Discourse about Religion and Chinese Descendants in 2012 Jakarta's Election
AN  - 1847466758
AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze rhetorical rejections from Muslims, a majority group, who refused a non-Muslim Chinese candidate in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election. The study focuses to explore (1) the social representations of the Chinese and how it was used to attack the Chinese candidate and (2) a construction process of a "new" social representation on how a religious teaching was constructed to have nothing to do with negative sentiments or hatred. The field study focused on analyzing the sequential events related to the sermon of a prominent Islamic figure, his denial of the hate contents in his sermon, and the support he received from his Muslim supporters. The results showed that when the Chinese are negatively represented, a Chinese is considered unfit to lead Jakarta as he may disgrace the nation. Moreover, it is found that when a rhetorical rejection toward a non-Muslim is supported by a religious teaching, such rejection is considered not related to negative sentiments.

T1  - 'We have not made anybody homeless': regulation and control of urban life in Zimbabwe
AN  - 1784139206
AB  - In May and June 2005, thousands of Zimbabweans were brutally displaced from urban areas. But 'Operation Murambatsvina' was not simply an unpredictable 'tsunami,' rather it provides a moment in which long-held prejudices and assumptions which shaped the developmental state became visible, reflecting not just the internalisation of the Rhodesian, modernist world-view, but also its imbrication with local understandings of home and home-ness. To see Murambatsvina as simply a politically expedient move is to miss the deep resonance of the political rhetoric, the ways it was embedded in the state, and how it is shaped by norms of citizenship. Contextualised against Harare's urban politics, the clearances reveal a long-standing set of policies designed to regulate and control urban life, forming part of a broader crisis of the post-colonial developmental state.

T1  - What We Talk About Matters: Content Moderates Cognitive Depletion in Interracial Interactions
AN  - 1726788917
AB  - The antecedents and consequences of intergroup interactions have been well studied, but interaction content-what partners actually talk about-has not. In the experiment we report here, interaction content moderated well-documented self-regulation effects (i.e., cognitive depletion) among White participants interacting with a Black partner. Specifically, White individuals participated in a video email interaction with an ostensible Black or White partner who broached topics systematically varying in intimacy. Greater cognitive depletion was evident after interacting with a Black partner relative to a White partner, but only after discussing more intimate topics. When conversation topics aligned with Whites' preferences to avoid intimacy in interracial interactions, depletion effects were reduced. Thus, interaction content, which has been largely ignored in intergroup interaction research, has important implications for intergroup interaction.

T1  - Multiculturalism on Its Head: Unexpected Boundaries and New Migration in Singapore
AN  - 1724872546
AB  - This study investigates how discourses of multiculturalism shape public debates surrounding new migration in Singapore. Singapore's immigration policies led to the influx of Chinese and Indian professionals, many of whom share race and class identities with local Singaporeans. However, Singaporeans of Chinese and Indian backgrounds rejected these presumed similarities, using discourses of multiculturalism to differentiate themselves from co-ethnic migrants. Based on a content analysis of news reports and online forums, this study shows how local actors portrayed new migrants as too prejudiced or bigoted to adapt to Singapore's multiracial society, thereby creating a paradoxical application of multicultural ideals. This example highlights how contemporary immigration is creating diverse forms of inclusion and exclusion within migrant-receiving nations, challenging models, and policies of multiculturalism based solely on ethnicity and race. This paper also demonstrates how individuals can utilize the discourse of multiculturalism in forwarding their own interests and concerns. Scholarly debates have often portrayed multiculturalism as an ideology or policy imposed by state institutions, where local actors are left to either resist or accommodate such ideas. In the Singapore context, individual Singaporeans transform discourses of multiculturalism, creating a counter-discourse that challenges state immigration policies.

T1  - Minding the Gap: Narrative Descriptions about Mental States Attenuate Parochial Empathy
AN  - 1727646748
AB  - In three experiments, we examine parochial empathy (feeling more empathy for in-group than out-group members) across novel group boundaries, and test whether we can mitigate parochial empathy with brief narrative descriptions. In the absence of individuating information, participants consistently report more empathy for members of their own assigned group than a competitive out-group. However, individualized descriptions of in-group and out-group targets significantly reduce parochial empathy by interfering with encoding of targets’ group membership. Finally, the descriptions that most effectively decrease parochial empathy are those that describe targets’ mental states. These results support the role of individuating information in ameliorating parochial empathy, suggest a mechanism for their action, and show that descriptions emphasizing targets’ mental states are particularly effective.

T1  - Bounded openness: The effect of openness to experience on intolerance is moderated by target group conventionality
AN  - 1705198471
AB  - Openness to experience is consistently associated with tolerance. We suggest that tests of the association between openness to experience and tolerance have heretofore been incomplete because they have primarily focused on prejudice toward unconventional target groups. We test (a) the individual difference perspective, which predicts that because people who are high in openness are more open to diverse and dissimilar people and ideas, they will express more tolerance than people who are low in openness and (b) the worldview conflict perspective, which predicts that people high and low in openness will both be intolerant toward those with different worldviews. Four studies, using both conventional and unconventional target groups, find support for an integrative perspective. People high in openness do appear more tolerant of diverse worldviews compared with people low in openness; however, at the same time, people both high and low in openness are more intolerant of groups whose worldviews conflict with their own. These findings highlight the need to consider how individual difference variables and features of the target groups may interact in important ways to influence the expression of prejudice.

T1  - The Effects of Civil Hate Speech Laws: Lessons from Australia
AN  - 1704123551
AB  - This article examines the effects of hate speech laws in Australia. Triangulating data from primary and secondary sources, we examine five hypothesized effects: whether the laws provide a remedy to targets of hate speech, encourage more respectful speech, have an educative or symbolic effect, have a chilling effect, or create "martyrs." We find the laws provide a limited remedy in the complaints mechanisms, provide a framework for direct community advocacy, and that knowledge of the laws exists in public discourse. However, the complaints mechanism imposes a significant enforcement burden on targeted communities, who still regularly experience hate speech. We find a reduction in the expression of prejudice in mediated outlets, but not on the street. We find no evidence of a chilling effect and we find the risk of free speech martyrs to be marginal. We draw out the implications of these findings for other countries.

T1  - State-level personality and presidential vote share in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections
AN  - 1748866250; 201600594
AB  - Recent research has examined how variation across the states in the 'Big Five' personality trait taxonomy helps explain the proportion of votes the presidential candidates receive in the states, concluding that state personality traits had a direct effect on presidential vote share in the 1996, 2000, and 2004 presidential elections. The current study has three goals: First, to examine the influence of personality traits on Barack Obama's vote share in the 2008 and 2012 elections; second to test whether the influence of personality traits on vote share holds under stricter controls for political factors and white racial prejudice; and, third, to test for potential meditating effects of state-level political characteristics and white racial prejudice in linking state-level personality traits with Obama's vote share. The findings indicate that two state personality traits - conscientiousness and openness - had indirect effects on Obama's 2008 and 2012 vote share through their influence on state ideology, partisanship, and white racial prejudice.

T1  - Indigenous people, socio-environmental conflict and post-development in Latin America
AN  - 1727447960
AB  - Anonymous member of a Philippine tribe The notion of development The notion of development was incorporated into social theory in 1945, at the end of the Second World War as a way of responding to the challenges of reconstructing the countries that had been either directly or indirectly affected by the world war.

[...]the allied countries put forward a new world order in which the calamities that afflicted the planet during the first four decades of the 20th century would be purged from the face of the earth: war, totalitarianism, prejudice, racial discrimination, unemployment and poverty.

[...]most of ECLAC's researchers and economists adhered to evolutionist currents of thought which conceived social dynamics as a chain of progressive changes leading to a higher level of material, social and cultural well-being.ii These concepts are closely associated to a fundamental current in the Latin American social thinking: the theory of modernization.

 "Bolivia and Beni need roads to attain economic and social development and these roads must be built through areas which are economically viable and bring greater social benefits."

[...]the Bolivian government project aims to integrate a sector of the territory which, according to the assessment of authorities, has so far been excluded from the progress experienced by the rest of the country.

In recent months this resulted in new clashes involving physical violence between the different conflicting parties (LA JORNADA, 2013).

[...]despite the temporary suspension of the road building project, the tendency is for the conflict to continue and be further aggravated by the fact that the indigenous organization itself is divided into two irreconcilable groups, as reported by human rights organizations and exposed in the Bolivian and international press. 3.2.

T1  - Revolting Peasants: Southern Italy, Ireland, and Cartoons in Comparative Perspective, 1860-1882
AN  - 1665232675
AB  - Abstract              Peasants in general, and rural rebels in particular, were mercilessly ridiculed in the satirical cartoons that proliferated in European cities from the mid-nineteenth century. There was more to these images than the age-old hostility of the townspeople for the peasant, and this article comparatively explores how cartoons of southern Italian brigands and rural Irish agitators helped shape a liberal version of what was modern by identifying what was not: the revolting peasant who engaged in "unmanly" violence, lacked self-reliance, and was in thrall to Catholic clergymen. During periods of unrest, distinctions between brigands, rebels, and the rural populations as a whole were not always clear in cartoons. Comparison suggests that derogatory images of peasants from southern Italy and Ireland held local peculiarities, but they also drew from transnational stereotypes of rural poverty that circulated widely due to the rapidly expanding European publishing industry. While scholarly debates inspired by postcolonial perspectives have previously emphasized processes of othering between the West and East, between the metropole and colony, it is argued here that there is also an internal European context to these relationships based on ingrained class and gendered prejudices, and perceptions of what constituted the centre and the periphery.

T1  - Measuring Negative Attitudes towards Overweight and Obesity in the German Population – Psychometric Properties and Reference Values for the German Short Version of the Fat Phobia Scale (FPS)
AN  - 1630366406
AB  - Objective 
Obesity is one of the leading public health problems worldwide. Obese individuals are often stigmatized and the psychosocial consequences of overweight and obesity are the subject of current research. To detect stigmatizing attitudes towards obese people, the Fat Phobia Scale (FPS) was developed in the USA in the early nineties. In addition, the 14-item short form of the FPS was constructed. The FPS belongs to the most commonly used instruments for measuring negative attitudes towards obese people because of its good psychometric properties. For the recently developed German short form of the FPS, however, the comprehensive investigation of the psychometric properties and the determination of reference values are still pending. Thus, the main objectives of this study were the evaluation of the psychometric quality of the scale as well as the calculation of reference values.
 Methods 
The study was based on a representative survey in the German general population. A sample of 1,657 subjects (18–94 years) was assessed via structured telephone interviews including the 14-item German version of the FPS. Descriptive statistics and inference-statistical analyses were conducted. Reference values in terms of percentage ranks were calculated.
 Results 
Substantial evidence for the reliability and validity of the German short version of the FPS was found. This study, for the first time in Germany, provides age-specific reference values for the German short form of the FPS allowing the interpretation of individual test scores.
 Conclusion 
Facing the far-reaching consequences of experienced stigmatization of obese individuals, these study results provide an important basis for further studies aiming at the investigation of negative attitudes towards overweight and obesity.

T1  - Cross-Racial Interactions during College: A Longitudinal Study of Four Forms of Interracial Interactions among Elite White College Students
AN  - 1545040581
AB  - College and universities present distinct opportunities to interact across racial and ethnic lines that may influence people's prejudice toward different groups. This study examines the influence of four forms of cross-race interaction on traditional and modern forms of racial prejudice among white college students at 28 of the most selective colleges and universities in the US. This study finds that, although white students' level of racial prejudice declines over four years, interracial contact during college does not significantly influence their level of prejudice. Moreover, a race-related form of social identity is the most consistent influence on students' racial prejudice.

T1  - What Makes a Young Assertive Bystander? The Effect of Intergroup Contact, Empathy, Cultural Openness, and In-Group Bias on Assertive Bystander Intervention Intentions
AN  - 1543801794
AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: "empathy," "cultural openness," "in-group bias," and "intergroup anxiety." British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed.              [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Moral Foundations Predict Religious Orientations in New Zealand
AN  - 1466545114
AB  - The interplay between religion, morality, and community-making is a core theme across human experience, yet scholars have only recently begun to quantify these links. Drawing on a sample of 1512 self-identified religious – mainly Christian (86.0%) – New Zealanders, we used structural equation modeling to test hypothesized associations between Religious Orientations (Quest, Intrinsic, Extrinsic Personal, Extrinsic Social) and Moral Foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation). Our results show, for the first time in a comprehensive model, how different ways of valuing communities are associated with different ways of valuing religion.

T1  - Measuring Dimensions of Perceived Discrimination in Five Stigmatized Groups
AN  - 1447470369
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to design and validate a multidimensional scale with the potential to measure perceived discrimination in different stigmatized groups. The study was carried out in Spain with a sample of 1,016 participants belonging to five stigmatized groups: Latin American immigrants, Romanian immigrants, people with HIV, gays and lesbians. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the existence of four dimensions in the scale: blatant group discrimination, subtle group discrimination, blatant individual discrimination, and subtle individual discrimination. In accordance with the literature, the scale presents positive relations with the stigma consciousness scale (Pinel in J Pers Soc Psychol 76:114-128,  1999 ) and negative relations with two measures of psychological well-being, affect balance and self-acceptance. Likewise, the results indicate that the perception of subtle individual discrimination is more negatively associated with participants' psychological well-being.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Can Numbers Lie? Race, Data Collection, and Black and Italian Infant and Maternal Health Care in Early Twentieth Century New York City
AN  - 1462012846
AB  - In 1899, W. E. B. Du Bois warned in The Philadelphia Negro, the first sociological study produced in the United States, that persons creating statistical studies must be aware that, left unchecked, inaccuracies fueled by individual biases may distort their work as much as errors arising from flawed methodologies and observations. Building upon this early caveat and contemporary admonitions from sociologists Tukufu Zuberi and Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, the author examines two 1924 pamphlets, Health Work for Mothers in a Colored Community and Protecting the Mother and Child. Both were compiled and published from data created by the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor which, respectively, covered infant and maternal health demonstrations conducted among two neighborhood groupings of impoverished African American and British West Indian mothers and children, and Southern Italian mothers and children. When these pamphlets are compared against internal unpublished data, inconsistencies arise which may have resulted from then commonly held racially-gendered biases against blacks and Italians. In turn, these biases-coupled with the desire to publish efficacious outcomes-mav have led the AICP to change the initial focus of its health experiment with black mothers and children from respiratory diseases to syphilis; to explain failed morbidity and mortality outcomes among Southern Italian infants by attacking mothers for their cultural preference for midwives; and, in both cases, to publish statistical data more positively than that contained in source materials. In sum, Du Bois' exhortation stands as powerfully today as over a century ago: even well-meaning researchers should check personal biases at the door before creating, conducting, and publishing statistical studies of racialized minority groups. To do otherwise may result in flawed data supporting the very biases that they may aim to overcome. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Between Critical and Uncritical Understandings: A Case Study Analyzing the Claims of Islamophobia Made in the Context of the Proposed 'Super-Mosque' in Dudley, England
AN  - 1540753518
AB  - Research highlights how usage and claims of Islamophobia tend to be simplistic and without nuance. Using a case study approach, this article considers the claims of Islamophobia made in relation to the proposed Dudley 'super-mosque'. Setting out a narrative of the 'super-mosque', this article draws upon primary and secondary research to consider the claims and discourses of the major actors in the Dudley setting: the Dudley Muslim Association, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, the far-right especially the British National Party and the English Defence League, as well as individual political figures. Considering each in detail, this article seeks to evaluate the extent to which each of the actors and the claims of Islamophobia made against them might be valid. As well as exploring claims of Islamophobia within a 'real' environment, this article seeks to critically engage the opposition shown towards the mosque, the way in which the opposition campaigns were mobilized and engineered, and how the ideological meanings of Islamophobia was able to be readily utilized to validate and justify such opposition. In doing so, this article concludes that the claims and usage of Islamophobia was weak and that a more critical and nuanced usage of the term is urgently required.

T1  - Out-group trust, intergroup anxiety, and out-group attitude as mediators of the effect of imagined intergroup contact on intergroup behavioral tendencies
AN  - 1433108353
AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an out-group member would change behavioral tendencies toward the out-group. In Experiment 1, British high school students who imagined talking to an asylum seeker reported a stronger tendency to approach asylum seekers than did participants in a control condition. Path analysis revealed this relationship was mediated by out-group trust and, marginally, by out-group attitude. In Experiment 2, straight undergraduates who imagined an interaction with a gay individual reported a stronger tendency to approach, and a weaker tendency to avoid, gay people. Path analyses showed that these relationships were mediated by out-group trust, out-group attitude, and less intergroup anxiety. These findings highlight the potential practical importance of imagined contact and important mediators of its effects.

T1  - Aspirations for a cooperative community and support for mental health advocacy: a shared orientation through opinion-based group membership
AN  - 1433108238
AB  - This research examines the role of aspirations for cooperative relations between people with mental disorders and other community members in influencing commitment to stigma-reducing practices and promoting positive social change. Two studies demonstrated that a measure of aspirations for a cooperative community is distinct from social and community identification measures and strongly predicts positive beliefs and behavioral intentions. Findings support the proposal that these aspirations reflect a shared ideology for members of an opinion-based group that support mental health advocacy. The findings provide evidence that the aspirations construct adds to knowledge about collective identities and offers a useful tool for designing stigma reduction and social-change strategies for the benefit of people with mental disorders.

T1  - Saving Self-Murderers: Lifesaving Programs and the Treatment of Suicides in Late Eighteenth-Century Europe
AN  - 1417527150; 201331558
AB  - The medicalization of suicide has its history. This article explores one part of this history: the implementation of eighteenth-century lifesaving programs and their ramifications for the treatment of parasuicides and suicides. These programs are contextualized within early modern population politics. It is argued that, according to lifesaving treatises, enlightened societies, and mandatory regulations, states reconfigured suicides as preventable accidents, that is tragic incidents, which could be prevented through emergency intervention. Thus suicide became a public policy issue which required positive action from the whole of society. At the same time both the stigmatization of unanticipated death and the criminalization of suicide still held sway. For these reasons, novel rescue legislation obliged common people to overcome traditional prejudices, fears, and taboos concerning the touching of apparently dead bodies. This article also reveals incentivization practices necessary to encourage people to intervene. In particular lifesaving programs addressed trained physicians. As is argued, emergency medicine discourse, the implementation of "professional" lifesaving practices, as well as the necessary treatment of suicidal individuals promoted physicians to a more important role in the treatment of suicides than ever before. Therefore both nineteenth-century medicalization of suicide and modern suicide prevention programs cannot be understood without considering the rise of the very idea that a suicide is worth being saved. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Coping with HIV Related Stigma and Well-Being
AN  - 1346374342
AB  - The goal of this study was to analyze the relationships to be found among stigma perception, active and avoidant coping strategies, and subjective and psychological well-being in a sample of 133 people with HIV. The results showed that stigma perception and avoidant coping strategies (venting, self-blame, denial, behavioral disengagement and substance use) were positively associated, whereas, both stigma perception and avoidant coping were negatively associated with different measures of well-being (affect balance, self-acceptance and environmental mastery). These negative relationships between stigma perception and the three well-being measures were mediated by the use of avoidant coping strategies. Results suggest that psychosocial intervention programs for people who report psychological distress arising from prejudice must be aimed at developing appropriate ways to deal with this prejudice. Intervention programs should also include strategies to directly increase well-being since from a positive psychology viewpoint certain interventions have been shown to do so, and HIV research has also shown that well-being is associated with lower mortality rates.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Roma People within the Global Process of Change
AN  - 1665202512
AB  - Although there is temptation to judge the Roma community as having a strong cultural constancy and stability in time, as surviving at the periphery of societies, outside the process of modernization, this paper aims to make an analysis of the factors which caused important changes in the socio-economic and cultural state of this community within the context of globalization. The prejudice that the Roma are a community closed within its traditional culture had and still has adverse effects on the perception which the majority population has about the Roma community and on the support policies for the marginalised segments of the Roma population too. In some ways, the Roma population doesn't have a different pattern from all the other populations, minority or majority. All the populations are engaged in a process of social change and reconstruction, of transition from traditional to modern cultural patterns imposed by a dynamic society undergoing fast modernization. It is true though, that modernization is not only an opportunity through the unavoidable commitment of the communities within the global flow of change, but also a process of new social differentiation. The division of work has generated new pressures of internal differentiation for all populations: some people advanced socially, others remained at the margin of the process. The popular history of the Roma, with the myths of any such history, includes also the intellectuals, prestigious politicians and successful people as main patterns of exiting the 'Gypsyhood'. But in spite of this, the paper underline that the concrete social and economic conditions put, in many cases, the Roma population, as ethnic group in a special social and cultural position different from that of other minorities. These papers bring a theoretical starting point for an empirical survey focusing on the successful Roma population. The survey was an exploratory research done by IQLR at the end of 2012, being centred on the Roma elite: intellectuals, political leaders and businessmen. The research has been identified three successful categories among the Roma people, mentioned above, as well as the factors associated to their success. The survey data are yet to be processed completely. However, they will certainly bring another perception/image on the Roma people, different from the one associated to severe poverty, as shown by the sociological research up to now.

T1  - Who are People Willing to Date? Ethnic and Gender Patterns in Online Dating
AN  - 1283141024
AB  - The United States is a rapidly diversifying country with ethnic minorities comprising over a quarter of the US population. By the year 2050, over half of the United States will be ethnic minority, underscoring the importance of better understanding race relations and willingness to date intra- and inter-racially. Data from 2,123 online dating profiles were randomly collected from four racial groups (Asian, Black, Latino, and White). Results indicated that willingness to date intra-racially was generally high and that willingness to date inter-racially was lower and influenced by racial social status. Because men evidenced an overall high willingness to date inter-racially, women's willingness to out-date provided a more accurate depiction of racial social status and exchange. Women of higher racial status groups were less willing than those from lower status groups to outdate. Results are explored and discussed in relation to different theories of interpersonal attraction and dating.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Foreigners and Outsiders: Exclusionist Attitudes towards Labour Migrants in Israel
AN  - 1269599906
AB  - This paper examines theoretical propositions regarding the social mechanisms that produce hostility and discriminatory attitudes towards out-group populations. Specifically, we compare the effect of perceptions of socio-economic and national threats, social contact and prejudice on social distance expressed towards labour migrants. To do so, we examine exclusionary views held by majority and minority groups (Jews and Arabs) towards non-Jewish labour migrants in Israel. Data analysis is based on a survey of the adult Israeli population based on a stratified sample of 1,342 respondents, conducted in Israel in 2007. Altogether, our results show that Israelis (both Jews and Arabs) are resistant to accepting and integrating foreigners into Israeli society. Among Jews, this is because the incorporation of non-Jews challenges the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and poses a threat to the homogeneity of the nation. Among Arabs, this is probably due to threat and competition over resources. The meanings of the findings are discussed within the unique ethno-national context of Israeli society and in light of sociological theories on ethnic exclusionism. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Refugee Policy: A highly charged political issue
AN  - 1629331254; 201441112
AB  - The challenge to humanitarianism posed by the vexed question of refugees and asylum seekers lies at the core of articles in this issue. In Western nations its demise is dramatic. Fanning the flames of xenophobia and racial prejudice to deflect attention from political issues is now a common ploy of governments. The problem is such that in 2012, The Council of Europe passed a resolution concerning the portrayal of refugees during election campaigns. The resolution noted Europe's long history of emigration and its need for immigrants at a time of population ageing and a general public perception that refugees erode European cultural traditions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Berea College-Coeducationally and Racially Integrated: An Unlikely Contingency in the 1850s
AN  - 1419801354
AB  - The anti-slavery ministry of Rev. John G. Fee and the unlikely establishment of Berea College in Kentucky in the 1850s, the first college in the southern United States to be coeducationally and racially integrated, are examined to further understand the conditions surrounding these extraordinary historical events. The Berea case illustrates how early twentieth century legal institutions were suffused with racism and justifications for racial discrimination even to the extent that they neutered the laws intended to provide redress to Black citizens, while the court approved of racial prejudice as a natural protection from what it considered to be an unnatural amalgamation.

T1  - "It Depends How You're Saying It": The Complexities of Everyday Racism
AN  - 1412576801
AB  - While racism is widely recognised as a complex social phenomenon, the basis for defining and identifying everyday racism from a lay perspective is not well understood. This exploration of factors used to frame everyday racism draws on seven cognitive interviews and four focus groups conducted in November 2010 and January 2011 with Australian adults predominantly from Anglo ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The study reveals lay theorising centring on tropes of intentionality, effect of speech, relationality and acceptability. Participants were more likely to think of racism as having negative, overtly offensive and emotional connotations. Racialised speech that was not considered to be blatantly racist was more contested, with participants engaging in complex theorising to determine whether or not such speech constituted racism. The study also highlights the potential of qualitative research to inform survey development as an unobtrusive method for in-depth participant reflection. The ambiguous nature of everyday racism demonstrated in this paper indicates a need to foster more nuanced lay understandings of racism that encompass the subtle, rational and complementary expressions that can be situated within institutions and society.

T1  - How Racist Violence Becomes a Virtue: An Application of Discourse Analysis
AN  - 1412576659
AB  - This discourse analytic study examines how violence can be constructed as an honourable course of action, using the example of a leaflet circulated in the loyalist Donegall Pass area of Belfast urging the removal of the minority Chinese population. Starting from the assumptions that racism is an ideological practice that naturalises social categories and devalues members of some of them so that their subjugation and exclusion is legitimised (Miles and Brown 2003; Billig 2002), and that violence is a human activity imbued with meaning through discourse, we applied guidelines set out by Parker (1992) to consider language as a social practice that achieves specific discursive effects by constructing its objects in a particular way. Two interrelated discourses were identified: a community-focused discourse construed the Chinese immigrants as morally and culturally bereft and negated their worth, while a martial discourse focused on defending the locality against foreign invasion. An examination of themes in loyalist culture revealed ways in which the text reconstructed resonant fears, and we argue that the way the in-group constructs its character defines the racist construction of the other.

T1  - Economic Prosperity as "Narcissistic Filling": A Missing Link Between Political Attitudes and Right-wing Authoritarianism
AN  - 1412576312
AB  - An expanded analysis of the origin of the correlation with economic deprivation found in the authors' representative surveys of right-wing extremist attitudes (such as racism, anti-Semitism, and chauvinism), focusing on the underlying dynamics in Germany and the historical aspect of National Socialism. The growing prosperity of the West German "economic miracle" of the 1950s served a psychosocial "filling function" to block the narcissistic damage caused by confrontation with past crimes and the sense of the nation's loss of greatness. As this prosperity vanishes for many people during the current economic crisis, the filling comes out and the narcissistic wound opens up. What emerges is both what lies underneath and what has been serving as a defense against it, which involve authoritarian dynamics. Initially, the metaphor of "narcissistic filling" will be developed through our analysis of group discussions conducted as part of our qualitative study (of 2008). The developed hypotheses will thereafter be introduced to our following representative survey (of 2010) and confirmed by means of quantitative methods. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Estimating the prevalence of xenophobia and anti-Semitism in Germany: A comparison of randomized response and direct questioning
AN  - 1429630031; 201335310
AB  - An experimental CATI-survey (N = 2041), asking sensitive questions about xenophobia and anti-Semitism in Germany, was conducted to compare the randomized response technique (RRT) and the direct questioning technique. Unlike the vast majority of RRT surveys measuring the prevalence of socially undesirable behaviors, only few studies have explored the effectiveness of the RRT with respect to the disclosure of socially undesirable opinions. Results suggest that the RRT is an effective method eliciting more socially undesirable opinions and yielding more valid prevalence estimates of xenophobia and anti-Semitism than direct questioning ('more-is-better' assumption). Furthermore, the results indicate that with increasing topic sensitivity, the benefits of using the RRT also increase. Finally, adapted logistic regression analyses show that several covariates such as education and generalized trust are related to the likelihood of being prejudiced towards foreigners and Jews.

T1  - Racial Bias in Perceptions of Others’ Pain
AN  - 1339095178
AB  - The present work provides evidence that people assume a priori that Blacks feel less pain than do Whites. It also demonstrates that this bias is rooted in perceptions of status and the privilege (or hardship) status confers, not race per se. Archival data from the National Football League injury reports reveal that, relative to injured White players, injured Black players are deemed more likely to play in a subsequent game, possibly because people assume they feel less pain. Experiments 1–4 show that White and Black Americans–including registered nurses and nursing students–assume that Black people feel less pain than do White people. Finally, Experiments 5 and 6 provide evidence that this bias is rooted in perceptions of status, not race per se. Taken together, these data have important implications for understanding race-related biases and healthcare disparities.

T1  - The Sexual Revolution's Last Frontier: How Silence About Sex Undermines Health, Well-Being, and Safety in Old Age
AN  - 1316580600
AB  - As the 77 million baby boomers who brought people the sexual revolution inexorably age, they will face a striking paradox. The ignorance, prejudice, and silence about sex and sexuality they fought so hard to upend are still alive and well in old age. In May 2011, in a colloquium sponsored by The Harry & Jeanette Weinberg Center for Elder Abuse Prevention, the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College served as an historic backdrop for a daylong discussion about sex and aging, examining the subject across a spectrum -- as a health, human rights, social service, criminal justice, victim assistance, and ethical issue. In the largest ever study on sex and aging, researchers interviewed 3,005 community-dwelling people, ages 57 to 85, about their sexual practices, assessed their health status, and examined the correlation between the two. Overall, the study found that while sexuality declines with age, most older adults remain sexually active and report that sex remains an important part of life.

T1  - NEW AMERICAN RACISM: A MICROCOSM STUDY OF A SMALL TOWN (CLARKSVILLE, TENNESSEE)
AN  - 1346648316
AB  - Racism is a moral issue and a political issue in the United States. Our society is built on the notion that ascertaining equality is shared and that all who desire to acquire the American Dream can have it with hard work. This assumption or notion by European Americans has been a misconception of reality. Some populations are allowed to achieve the American Dream socially, economically, physically, and politically while other disenfranchised population groups suffer from oppression, exploitation, and racial discrimination. This research examines individuals' perceptions of racism working and living in Clarksville, Tennessee. The method used in the study is in-depth interviews with residents who live and work in the local community where they have experienced racial discrimination. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Wisdom of Eve: On Differentiating the Colours of Emotion that May Be Threats to Good Life
AN  - 1017622774
AB  - Emotion's twin roles unite and divide our daily life, thus motivating the good and the worst in human behaviour. The way one feels does influence the way one acts toward others. If this reasoning is correct, then behaviour can never be without motive or motiveless. Given the importance of emotions in human communication and decision making, the context of intergroup relations, with its themes of prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination against culturally dissimilar was touched on selectively. Using the Differential Emotions Scale and building upon Boyle's (Personality 56:747-750, 1984) work, with students, the present study reports a repeated-measure multiple discriminant function analysis for items across raters. The findings further indicate that most of the DES items are sensitive indicators. The correspondence of some of the results with prior research findings makes facial emotions less the holy grail of the social behaviour field. Likely consequences of emotions are considered, and research needs are discussed vis-a-vis uplifting individual happiness, collective identity and sense of connection to others. Perhaps its implications can be extended to the literature, thus revealing how the different lenses through which human emotions are usually viewed are connected by the incipient/concept attitude and self-identification/labelling that run through each of them.

T1  - Race and the Fragility of the Legal Distinction between Juveniles and Adults
AN  - 1325012576
AB  - Legal precedent establishes juvenile offenders as inherently less culpable than adult offenders and thus protects juveniles from the most severe of punishments. But how fragile might these protections be? In the present study, simply bringing to mind a Black (vs. White) juvenile offender led participants to view juveniles in general as significantly more similar to adults in their inherent culpability and to express more support for severe sentencing. Indeed, these differences in participants’ perceptions of this foundational legal precedent distinguishing between juveniles and adults accounted for their greater support for severe punishment. These results highlight the fragility of protections for juveniles when race is in play. Furthermore, we suggest that this fragility may have broad implications for how juveniles are seen and treated in the criminal justice system.

T1  - Intangible Flow Theory
AN  - 993125853
AB  - The intangible flow theory explains that flows of economic material elements (such as physical goods; or cash) are consummated by human related intangible flows (such as work flows; service flows; information flows; or communicational flows) that cannot be precisely appraised at an actual or approximate value, and have properties precluding them from being classified as assets or capitals. Thus, although mathematical/quantitative research methodologies are very relevant for science, they are insufficient to study economy and society. Due to its prejudice against non-mathematical/quantitative scientific reasoning, neoclassical economics could not be technologically prepared to reach the intangible flow dynamics of economic phenomena. Furthermore, the neoclassical solution to call people human capital or assets, besides being ethically very questionable, offers performative non-scientific metaphors that intervene in the production of the reality they claim to represent; and sabotages the study of well delimited research questions by scientific approaches outside the realm of neoclassical economics.

T1  - Experiencing Everyday Discrimination: A Comparison Across Five Immigrant Populations
AN  - 910387457
AB  - Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data, this article explores and compares the subjective experiences of everyday discrimination articulated by immigrants across five different national origin populations. The comparison reveals that discrimination is perceived, encountered, and experienced differently by immigrants from various national origins backgrounds. Further, from the perspective of immigrants themselves, discrimination is not just about phenotypical racial characteristics, but also about language abilities, class position, immigration status, foreignness, and personhood. The article describes some of the contexts or settings within which discrimination is encountered, including a discussion of both mainstream and minority contexts. The latter is rarely addressed in the literature on discrimination. Finally, using some hypothetical scenarios, it examines how immigrants of different national origins say they might react to discriminatory behavior. This exercise not only illuminates some intriguing variations across the five populations but also addresses broader discussion of confrontation as opposed to forbearance in the literature on discrimination.

T1  - Measuring discrimination facing ethnic minority job applicants: an Irish experiment
AN  - 1910529566
AB  - The role of employer discrimination in labour market matching is often acknowledged but challenging to quantify. What part of the 'ethnic penalty' in the labour market is due to recruitment discrimination? This experiment, the first of its kind in Ireland, explicitly measured this by sending out nearly 500 equivalent CVs from Irish and minority candidates in response to advertised vacancies in the greater Dublin area. We find that candidates with Irish names are over twice as likely to be called to interview as are candidates with an African, Asian or German name. This discrimination rate is high by international standards, and does not vary between minority groups. We develop the discussion of the role of prejudice and stereotypes in discrimination in this article, arguing that our findings may be linked to the fact that Ireland is a 'new immigration' country, with no established minority groups and a cohesive national identity.

T1  - Focus groups as a tool in the construction of questionnaires: the case of discriminatory attitudes
AN  - 898217708
AB  - The aim of the present article is twofold First, it tests and demonstrates the supplementary use of focus groups to construct quantitatively oriented survey on anti-minority sentiment. Second, it clarifies two major theoretical concepts-prejudice versus perceived threat-in the research on discriminatory attitudes towards minority populations. More specifically, by using data from focus group discussions on foreign workers in Israel, the study examines the use of such groups for measurement of prejudice and perceived threat within the social and cultural context of Israeli society. The analysis of focus group discussions provides adapted questionnaire scales for measuring prejudice and perceived threat. The findings support the premise that prejudice and perceived threat are two distinct theoretical concepts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Drawing of the Mark of Cain. A Socio-Historical Analysis of the Growth of Anti-Jewish Stereotypes
AN  - 923286680
AB  - In late 2009 his work on the history of anti-Semitism was published, following an extended gestation period and a lifetime of contemplating anti-Jewish stereotypes, the power of prejudices, and the conditions under which they may lead to persecution, violence, and murder.

Van Arkel presents some original concepts, such as "secession friction", as he describes the relationship between Jews and Christians; "terrorizing the discriminant", as he describes the compulsion among bystanders to participate in the discrimination and persecution; and the "genealogy of stereotypes", as he designates the dynamics and flexibility of anti-Jewish stereotyping, which are stronger, more contradictory, more manifold, and more irrational with respect to Jews than to other minorities.

Aside from observing several similarities in their dynamics, Van Arkel identifies a difference between anti-Jewish and anti-black forms of racism, which he attributes to differences in stereotypes and labour-market positions.

T1  - Intergroup Conflict in Russia: Testing the Group Position Model
AN  - 907189427
AB  - The group position model (Blumer 1958; Bobo and Tuan 2006) assumes that attempting to secure a privileged position for the ingroup is a main determinant of perceived intergroup conflict. This assumption is tested with survey data collected in 1999 and 2000 among eight titular groups in autonomous republics of the Russian Federation. The survey included an experiment that was aimed at disentangling the effects of perceived threat and the fear of outgroup encroachment (growing outgroup influence). The findings indicate that more conflict was perceived when the ingroup was larger (corresponding to stronger entitlement claims to privilege), especially among those who felt more threatened. This association was further strengthened among those whose fear of outgroup encroachment was made salient. This study shows the relevance of the group position model in understanding perceived intergroup conflict among national minority groups with a local privileged status. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mapping the Racial Bias of the White Male Capital Juror: Jury Composition and the ''Empathic Divide''
AN  - 874024724
AB  - This article examines the nature of racial bias in the death sentencing process. After reviewing the various general explanations for the continued significance of race in capital cases, we report the results of an empirical study in which some aspects of racially biased death sentencing are examined in depth. Specifically, in a simulated capital penalty-phase trial setting where participants were assigned to small group "juries" and given an opportunity to deliberate, white male jurors were significantly more likely to sentence black defendants to death than were women and nonwhite jurors. This racialized pattern was explained in part by the differential evaluation of the case facts and the perceptions of the defendant that were made by the white male jurors. We discuss these findings in light of social psychological theories of contemporary racism, and we conclude that the demonstrated bias in capital jury settings should be understood as an interaction of several factors, including individual juror characteristics, group-level demographic composition, and group deliberation processes.

T1  - Who Lives and Dies on Death Row? Race, Ethnicity, and Post-Sentence Outcomes in Texas
AN  - 759094602
AB  - A substantial body of research has explored the extent to which the race of offenders and victims influences who receives a death sentence for capital crimes. Little is known about how race and ethnicity might pattern death-row outcomes. Drawing upon evidence from male offenders sentenced to death in Texas during the years 1974 through 2009, we extend recent research by examining whether the race and ethnicity of offenders and victims and a number of offender, victim, and crime attributes influence the likelihood of executions and sentence relief (whereby prisoners leave death row). Cox regression analyses are used in conjunction with a multiple-imputation method for handling a modest amount of missing data. The results show that cases involving minorities--with black or Latino offenders or victims--have lower hazards of execution than cases in which both offenders and victims are white. Victim and offender race and ethnicity have little to no independent effect upon the hazard of sentence relief. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Personality Bases of Ideology: A One-Year Longitudinal Study
AN  - 751976448; 21058579
AB  - The cross-lagged effects of the Big-Five personality dimensions on Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) were examined over 1 year (N = 112). Consistent with the Dual Process Cognitive-Motivational Model, SDO and RWA exhibited markedly different personality bases. Low Agreeableness and unexpectedly high Extraversion predicted change in the motivational goal for group-based dominance and superiority (SDO), whereas Openness to Experience predicted change in the motivational goal for social cohesion and collective security (RWA). Neuroticism and Conscientiousness did not predict change in SDO or RWA over time. These findings extend previous cross-sectional (correlational) research and indicate that key dimensions of personality (primarily Agreeableness and Openness to Experience) are an important temporal antecedent of the group-based motivational goals underlying individual differences in prejudice.

T1  - Capitalism and the Jews
AN  - 733019511
AB  - Here, Muller explains that many anti-Jewish stereotypes can be attributed to a conscious and constant exaggeration of the role of the Jews in economics and trade.

Since lending at interest was generally forbidden for Christians in medieval Europe, while Jews were permitted to charge interest, it was thought that anyone who extracted money from money alone must be "regarded as outside the community of shared values" (p. 15).

According to Friedman, this counteracts the forces of anti-Semitic prejudices.

The socialist and communist project to create a new society which moved people away from capitalist business into productive work in the service of mankind found positive response among those Jews who regarded the Jews' concentration in trade as "economically and physically toxic" (ibid.).

T1  - Pedagogy of Self-Development: The Role the Black Church can have on African American Students
AN  - 884031948
AB  - Historically, the Black Church has been an institutional stronghold in the Black community and has thereby sustained a cultural ethos that has enabled African Americans to combat racial prejudice and hostility for generations. Therefore, this article will unearth Yosso's notion of alternative capital that students of color have at their disposal and the Black church's role in its nourishment. Alas, educators and administrators who are charged with educating African American students have, in many cases, been negligent in their efforts to recognize such contrarian capital. This has been mainly due to the fact that schools are undergirded by precepts of implicit and explicit racial biases. The authors will attempt to add to the notion of pedagogy of self-development as we elucidate that such a cogent standard to traditional capital is doing increasing harm and contributing to the on-going academic decline of many African American students in U. S. schools. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ideological Configurations and Prediction of Attitudes toward Immigrants in Chile and Germany
AN  - 865822587
AB  - The concept of ideological configuration is proposed to refer to a complex of ideological attitudes - Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) - based on a shared core of derogation of outgroups. This concept is used in two surveys, in Chile and in Germany, to predict attitudes toward foreigners. Analyses using structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that a second-order factor involving RWA and SDO predicts hostility toward foreigners in Germany and affection toward Peruvian and Argentinean immigrants in Chile. This prediction was stronger in Germany than in Chile. The difference in strength is discussed in terms of the kind of measurements, different contexts of migration, and characteristics of the immigrants. Further research using the concept of ideological configuration is proposed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

This study examines how perceptions of threat posed by Muslims and Islam and the overall attitude towards Muslims explain support for a ban on headscarves. In addition, cross-national comparisons are made to study how these relations are affected by contextual differences. Analyses are based on the 2005 survey on Islamic extremism by the Pew Research Center. Results show that the countries have a large influence on whether someone supports the ban on headscarves, indicating that contextual differences matter. In addition, having a negative attitude towards Muslims makes it more likely to support a ban on headscarves. In general, perceived threat contributes to stronger support, although there are slight differences in effect between the countries. Finally, perceived threat equally influences support for the ban on headscarves among prejudiced and non-prejudiced people. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Impact of Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression Bias on African American Students
AN  - 884044966
AB  - This article discusses sexual orientation and gender expression bias as they impact the educational experience of African American students. Sexual orientation and gender expression bias have a unique presentation in Black educational settings. The climate in such settings can be metagrobolized by the combination of distorted notions of Black sexuality and of homosexuality. The legacy of internalized racism as it impacts sexuality is examined in this article. Homophobia, heterosexism, and the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning (LGBTQ) students are also discussed. Implications for school safety, academic achievement, and student mental health are elucidated along with recommendations for policy, practice and advocacy-based interventions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - American Indian Women Report on the Community Impact of a Tribal Casino
AN  - 872056359
AB  - This qualitative study of the community impact of a Midwest American Indian casino examined semi-structured interview data (N = 20) from American Indian women. Results indicate that the opening of the tribal casino has provided opportunities for intergroup contact to occur resulting in improved relations between Indians on the reservation and those who are not Indian from surrounding communities. These improved relations are positively affecting the relationships that develop between the members of the communities. The findings highlight the need for social workers to examine the impact of intergroup contact that is naturally occurring in tribal casino communities and develop interventions that can assist in reducing stereotypes and prejudices.
