T1  - Cultural diversity approaches in schools and adolescents’ willingness to support refugee youth
AN  - 2650119728
AB  - BackgroundCulturally diverse schools contribute to adolescents’ intergroup relations. Complex and inclusive social identities are mechanisms that can explain the link between structural school cultural diversity (i.e., proportion of students of immigrant descent and the number of different ethnic groups) and positive intergroup relations. We expected that similar mechanisms might be at play linking cultural diversity approaches in schools with adolescents’ intergroup relations.AimWe examined the link between two sub‐dimensions of cultural diversity approaches (i.e., equal treatment; heritage and intercultural learning) and adolescents’ prosocial intentions and behaviour towards refugee youth. Then, we explored the mediating role of identity inclusiveness (i.e., perceived similarity of the self with others).Sample and methodsWe sampled culturally diverse eighth grade adolescents from 54 classrooms in Berlin (N = 503, Mage = 13.76 years, 50.6% female). Surveys measured perceived cultural diversity norms, adolescents’ perceived identity inclusiveness with refugee youth, prosocial intentions to support refugee youth, and willingness to donate to a project for refugee youth.ResultsMultilevel models revealed that adolescents’ perception of heritage and intercultural learning predicted adolescents’ prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, but not their willingness to donate. Equal treatment was not a significant predictor of adolescents’ prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, or their willingness to donate. Identity inclusiveness did not mediate the relation between cultural diversity approaches and prosocial intentions. However, identity inclusiveness did positively relate adolescents’ prosocial intentions and willingness to donate.ConclusionsWe conclude that culturally diverse schools that engage in heritage and intercultural learning might help to promote positive relations between local and refugee youth in schools and society. Fostering inclusive identities may enhance local adolescent’s prosocial intention and behaviour.

T1  - Psychological predictors of protective behaviours during the Covid‐19 pandemic: Theory of planned behaviour and risk perception
AN  - 2661480078
AB  - The Covid‐19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization in January 2020. As a consequence, several protective measures were urged by national governments in order to limit the spread of the pandemic. Drawing on the literature on health behaviours, in the present study, we investigated the psychological factors (i.e., attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions, and risk perception) that were associated with two highly recommended behaviours: frequent hand washing and social distancing (i.e., staying at home except for essential reasons). The study employed a correlational design with a follow‐up. A questionnaire including measures of psychological predictors was administered via social media to a sample of 403 adults residing in Italy during the lockdown. Self‐reported behaviours were assessed one week later. Findings showed that attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control were significantly related to hand washing and social distancing through intentions. Risk perception was a significant predictor of social distancing but not of hand washing. These findings suggest that intervention and communication strategies aimed at encouraging preventive measures during the Covid‐19 pandemic should be organized taking into account multiple factors which partially differ depending on the type of behaviour considered.

T1  - Why and when do citizens support populist right-wing social movements? Development and test of an integrative theoretical model
AN  - 2658419097
AB  - What are the microlevel mechanisms that explain citizens’ support of populist social movements? We address this question by focusing on the ‘PEGIDA’ (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the Occident) protest groups in Germany, which became particularly prominent by attracting large numbers of attendees in street protests during the years 2015/16. We develop and test an integrative theoretical model that points to the key roles of anti-immigrant attitudes and political dissatisfaction as mediators linking subjective socioeconomic deprivation with citizens’ support of the ‘Pegida’-movement. Equally important, this model holds that citizens’ political dissatisfaction moderates the nexus between anti-immigrant attitudes and support for ‘Pegida’. The results based on data from seven cross-sectional general population surveys provide clear support for these predictions. Combined, these efforts help to advance scholarly understanding of not only why, but also how and under what conditions non-activist citizens support anti-immigrant collective action as exemplified by the ‘Pegida’ movement.

T1  - The Impact of COVID-19 Experiences on Adolescent Internalizing Problems and Substance Use Among a Predominantly Latinx Sample
AN  - 2648320805
AB  - Given the salience of socialization factors on adolescence and their role in vulnerability to disasters and trauma, this study examined whether COVID-19-associated fears and impacted quality of life mediated associations between pandemic-focused family conversations and media exposure and subsequent youth mental health. A primarily Latinx sample of adolescents (N = 167; Mage = 16.2 years, 44.9% female) participated in a longitudinal (summer 2020-winter 2020) COVID-19 study. COVID-19 media exposure predicted engagement in relevant safety behaviors, which negatively impacted quality of life, which in turn predicted increased internalizing problems. COVID-19 family conversations predicted social distancing fears, which negatively impacted quality of life, which then in turn also predicted increased internalizing problems. Targeting key socialization factors may minimize negative consequences following major community trauma among adolescents.

T1  - The “ironic” fair process effect: A perceived fair naturalization procedure spurs anti-immigration attitudes through increased host national identification among naturalized citizens: GPIR
AN  - 2638250826
AB  - A growing body of research has shown that naturalized citizens’ attitudes towards immigration worsen following citizenship acquisition. Accordingly, these socially mobile individuals tend to distance themselves from their former immigrant ingroup. The present contribution explains such self–group distancing coping strategy in terms of an “ironic” procedural fairness effect. Study 1 (N = 566), a survey conducted among naturalized Swiss citizens, showed that fairness perceptions with respect to the naturalization process were indeed associated with stronger anti-immigration attitudes, and that this relationship was mediated by identification with the host nation. Next, two experiments were conducted to demonstrate the causality of the hypothesized mediation model. In Study 2 (Experiment 1; N = 248), fairness of the admission procedure (accurate vs. inaccurate) increased identification with a desirable group. In Study 3 (Experiment 2; N = 141), administration of a national identity prime evoked stronger anti-immigration attitudes. Taken together, our findings highlight a somewhat “dark side” of procedural fairness.

T1  - Political Empowerment of Women and the Mediating Role of Political Awareness: The Case of Oman
AN  - 2627991481
AB  - Despite commitments by the Arabian Gulf countries to promote gender equality and policies of nondiscrimination against women, the underrepresentation of women in the political sphere remains unchanged. Using the case of the Sultanate of Oman, this paper endeavors to analyze the reasons behind the persistent political disempowerment of women in the Middle East and North African region through the lens of public opinion. The findings are based on 288 surveys conducted with two groups of participants - a group of undergraduate and postgraduate students majoring in political science, and a group of Omani citizens with no political education. These findings confirm the impact of both formal (government driven) and informal (socio-cultural) factors resulting in the low level of political empowerment of Omani women. By exploring public opinion formed towards women's political empowerment in the country, it was observed that respondents who majored in political science demonstrated a lower degree of gender bias compared to citizens with no education in political science. Socio-demographic variables such as the age and level of education of both groups did not show any significant impact on either reducing or increasing gender bias. However, a positive correlation between gender and citizens' opinions was observed. While politically educated respondents, regardless of their gender, maintained a positive attitude towards women and their participation in politics, male respondents from the general public group exhibited elevated levels of bias against the need for women's political empowerment. The study shows that gender bias is neutralized when mediated by the variable of political awareness. The findings also suggest that an increase in the level of political awareness among citizens might be considered as a positive intervention needed for changing public opinion in favour of the political empowerment of women.

AB  - Canada and the United States have recently evaluated the decriminalization of drugs as multiple provinces and states put motions forward to consider drug decriminalization legislation. The influence of factors such as demographics, substance use, perceived substance use risk, and personality have not been widely studied in predicting attitudes toward drug decriminalization. A total of 504 participants were drawn from university (n = 269, 53.37%) and community samples (n = 235, 46.63%) through online social media groups and posts (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc). Analyses indicated that male gender, single or non-married relationship status, living outside of Atlantic Canada, higher problematic alcohol use scores, lower Extraversion, higher Open-mindedness, and lower perceived risk of using substances emerged as significant predictors of support for drug decriminalization. These findings have important implications as public attitudes toward a substance influence drug policy.

T1  - Bullying in schools and LGBTQ+ youth mental health: Relations with voting for Trump
AN  - 2614034853
AB  - The current study utilized the 2018 Washington State Healthy Youth Survey to explore the relations among school district political attitudes, bullying experiences, and mental health outcomes, particularly for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) students. Although bullying was associated with greater psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, depression, and suicidality) for all students, LGBTQ+ students experienced more bullying and psychological distress. Bullying experiences mediated the relation between LGBTQ+ identity and psychological distress. However, school district voting record moderated the relation between LGBTQ+ identity and bullying, such that LGBTQ+ students in more conservative districts, or districts with more votes for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, experienced more bullying, which was associated with greater psychological distress. Additionally, increased teacher intervention during instances of bullying was related to less bullying for LGBTQ+ students. Finally, in more conservative‐leaning districts, LGBTQ+ students reported less teacher intervention, which was associated with more bullying and psychological distress. Given that political conservatism was related to higher rates of bullying and poorer mental health outcomes for LGBTQ+ students, we recommend improving school‐based LGBTQ+ bullying policies to prioritize the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth.

T1  - Covid19 and protest repertoires in the United States: an initial description of limited change
AN  - 2607467853
AB  - The Covid19 pandemic did not cause a dramatic change in the dominant protest repertoire in the United States. Street protests and all the associated behaviors such as marching, carrying signs, chanting, and speeches continued to be the major form of activity. Nonetheless, based on media reports and Crowd Counting Consortium data, we observed three important changes. First, protestors’ issues of concern shifted to public health and economic policies. Second, some but not all protestors made tactical adjustments by embracing social distancing or shifting to formats that did not require social distancing such as car caravans. Third, medical facilities much more commonly served as a location for demonstrations. Preliminary analysis also leads us to believe that protestors did not use online tools in dramatically new ways but probably did make use of these tools far more frequently. In short, this was probably more of a quantitative growth than a qualitative shift.

T1  - Representations of disabled children and young people in Irish newspapers
AN  - 2593361413
AB  - Disabled children experience many barriers to inclusion in society. Such barriers include public attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions towards disability. There is a specific gap in the literature examining the representation of disabled children in mass media, especially within an Irish context. Previous research primarily focuses on representations of disabled adults. Eighty-nine Irish broadsheet newspaper articles from a 12-month period were analysed using qualitative content analysis and critical discourse analysis. Although disabled children featured within the discourse, the child’s voice was predominantly absent. Reports regarding the lived experience predominantly came from the third person, providing a non-authentic voice of disability in childhood. Articles highlighted some of the challenges faced by children e.g. difficulty in accessing educational placement. Opportunities for disabled children to share their experiences using their preferred communication means offer valuable insights into their lives. Media professionals should be supported in facilitating children to have their voice heard.Points of interestTwo methods were used to examine how disabled children were represented in three Irish newspapers and what types of words were used to represent themAlthough disabled children are featured within Irish newspaper articles, parents and people who work with disabled children tended to speak on their behalfSometimes disabled children were labelled using impairment first terminologyIrish newspapers highlight some of the challenges faced by disabled children e.g. accessing appropriate schools and social outletsHealthcare professionals have a role in advocating for and supporting disabled children to actively participate and have their voices and stories heard in the mediaHealthcare professionals have a role in educating media professionals to support communication with disabled children so as to deliver a first-person account of living with a disability

T1  - The dark side of the farce: racism in early cinema, 1894–1915
AN  - 2567817159
AB  - In its title sequences, the Keystone Comedy Studio referred to its films as a “farce comedy.” Farces are supposed to evoke laughter. Yet, from the very first images projected, dark racist images were prevalent and these representations contain violent imagery directed toward African American men, women and children. These images represent a time capsule of what I call the dark side of the farce. Because of the popularity and prevalence of certain types of films, it is conceivable that these films reflect consumer tastes unique to the time period in which they were produced. And while books, newspapers and periodicals are valuable resources for reconstructing past opinions, these sources may only have reached a limited audience. On the other hand, at its inception the motion picture was viewed by a diverse audience that included immigrants, the working poor, women and children. Hence, while films are not in any sense commensurate with polling, they are one tool that helps us to understand how people at the turn of the twentieth century perceived issues of race. Millions of Americans attended the movies daily. What they saw were the kinds of movies that were produced and these productions provide one valuable insight regarding public attitudes toward race. In this article, I examine films made between 1894 and 1915 as a reflection of the public attitudes of the time. I focus on comedy films because this was the only genre that existed literally from the projection of the first motion pictures to the middle of the twentieth-century’s second decade. I end the analysis with 1915 because after that year feature films became more dominant in theaters, while virtually all of the films discussed in this article are short subjects, ranging from 30 seconds to approximately 15 minutes.

T1  - Framing immigration: a content analysis of newspapers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States
AN  - 2567817076
AB  - This study examines the media framings of immigration in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Using a content analysis of over 1700 newspaper articles published in 2014 in different cases, my findings show that, regardless of context, the media use a small number of frames to stereotype, generalize and reduce immigration to a singular dimension. My analysis also suggests that the media do not always only have a binary representation of bad or good immigrants. Instead, the media's othering of immigrants is a complex process, suggesting ambivalence despite superficial affirmation. Although my findings also demonstrate that some national differences exist, common patterns can be found across contexts that share similar historical, cultural, social, economic, and political dimensions of immigration. As one of the first cross-regional comparisons of media framings, this research reflects the power dynamics between the elites and immigrants and offers implications for how the media's reinforcement of stereotypes and outsider status of immigrants could potentially shape public opinion and policies regarding immigration.

T1  - Intervening in Anti-Immigrant Sentiments: The Causal Effects of Factual Information on Attitudes toward Immigration
AN  - 2614690404
AB  - If preferences on immigration policy respond to facts, widespread misinformation poses an obstacle to consensus. Does factual information about immigration indeed affect policy preferences? Are beliefs about immigration’s societal impact the mechanism through which factual information affects support for increased immigration? To address these questions, we conducted an original survey experiment, in which we presented a nationally representative sample of 2,049 Americans living in the United States with facts about immigrants’ English acquisition and immigrants’ impact on crime, jobs, and taxes—four domains with common misperceptions. Three of these factual domains (immigration’s impact on crime, jobs, and taxes) raise overall support for increased immigration. These facts also affect beliefs that are directly relevant to that information. Moreover, those beliefs mediate the effect of factual information on support for increased immigration. By contrast, information about English acquisition affects neither policy preferences nor beliefs about immigration’s impact. Facts can leverage social cognitions to change policy preferences.

T1  - Challenges in Conducting Online Videoconferencing Qualitative Interviews with Adolescents on Sensitive Topics
AN  - 2572294911
AB  - In the wake of COVID-19, researchers are seeking innovative data-collection methods. Computer-mediated communication platforms have played a pivotal role among these pursuits. However, conducting online interviews present challenges to both researchers and participants. Online data-collection forces researchers to give up control over the study environment due to the varying location participants partake in interviews. Consequently, researchers can no longer fully guarantee the confidentiality and privacy of the researcherparticipant conversations. Participants may face difficulties if being asked to disclose private information in the presence of family members. These challenges are heightened when conducting online interviews with adolescents on sensitive topics. Thus, attention to the rigour of qualitative research is a fundamental consideration given these limitations in technical and social conventions with the use of online data-collection methods. Despite the host of challenges, online interviewing creates valuable opportunities for researchers to rise to the challenge of social distancing in their data-collection efforts.

This experimental study aimed to concurrently investigate three social psychological bases of attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants in the USA: political ideology, social labels, and social context. Participants were 744 adults, recruited from “New York Community College” (“NYCC”/urban) and “New Jersey Community College” (“NJCC”/suburban), who were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: “illegal” vs. “undocumented.” Participants completed a scale measuring their attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants with the embedded label manipulation, followed by the General System Justification scale, and culminating with demographic items. Results demonstrated that whereas social context and political ideology both contributed significantly to the regression model, the social labels did not. Both high system justification and political conservatism predicted negative attitudes, but the latter effect was stronger for suburban students. Post hoc analyses revealed a significant difference between suburban and urban students in the frequency of the social labels “illegal” and “undocumented” heard and seen among family members, friends, and the media. Implications are discussed with a focus on system justification as an explanatory theory for immigration attitudes, as well as contextual effects for it.

T1  - The new identity theft: Perceptions of cultural appropriation in intergroup contexts
AN  - 2582436021
AB  - Cultural appropriation has been described and discussed within academic and everyday discourse, but little research has examined its role in the psychological context of intergroup relations. We sought to examine whether minority and majority group members (i.e., Black and White Americans) would differentially judge instances of cultural exchange as cultural appropriation. Five experiments (3 were preregistered on OSF) using a variety of potential cases of cultural appropriation demonstrated that Black participants were more likely than White participants to view these incidents as appropriation when they involved White perpetrators appropriating Black culture (vs. scenarios of Black perpetrators appropriating White culture), an effect mediated by distinctiveness threat. Black (vs. White) participants were also more likely to perceive White actors who appropriate Black culture as harmful and as intentional. In Study 4, explicit manipulation of distinctiveness threat eliminated the participant race effect: Perceivers viewed White perpetrators as more appropriative than Black perpetrators. When actors were portrayed as using either an ingroup or outgroup cultural product (Study 5), participants perceived use of an outgroup cultural product as more appropriative. Studies 3–5 were preregistered on OSF. This research illuminates how group-based status interacts with and adds to perpetrator prototypically to influence perceptions of cultural appropriation, distinguishes perception of appropriation from perception of racism, and points to the importance of distinctiveness threat as a contributor to differential race-based perceptions. Implications of perceiving cultural appropriation for intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - Effects of digital use on trust in political institutions among ethnic minority and hegemonic group – A case study
AN  - 2575534529
AB  - The current study was based on data from a nationwide Annual Social Survey to investigate the correlation between types of Internet usage (seeking information, e-government use, e-mail, social media and peer-to-peer Internet telephony) and trust in political institutions in Israel's Jewish majority and Arab minority. Trust in government, parliament, and political parties was found to be significantly higher among Jews than Arabs. Our findings show that first level digital divide reflected in Internet use vs non-use does not correlate with political trust. Among Internet users we found different patterns of association between digital uses and trust in political institutions, which may presumably be explained by different group status. E-government use and social media use were positively correlated with political trust only among Jews. Seeking information and e-mail use were negatively associated with trust in political institutions only among Arabs. Peer-to-peer Internet telephony was negatively correlated with trust in government among both groups. Our important finding is that in spite of the processes of digitization, the effects of digital use on political trust are still relatively marginal. In both groups, the primary predictor of political trust is attitudes toward the functioning of different public institutions.

T1  - YouTube's growth in use among children 0–5 during COVID19: The Occidental European case
AN  - 2575534505
AB  - YouTube has become an educational and entertainment tool among Western European families, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study monitored the main channels for children aged 0–5 years by using the social media analysis (SNA) methodology from March 24, 2020 to August 24, 2020. The software used has been FanpageKarma, which allows the collection and interpretation of data. The results indicate not only a growth in the use of such channels during confinement, but also how their expansion is related to the evolution of the COVID-19, reflecting, in turn, the consequences of the government policies adopted. Social distancing generated a greater consumption of recreational content, but not a greater growth in educational content regardless of the country or culture.

T1  - Mothering with a career during a pandemic; the case of the Ghanaian woman
AN  - 2553407801
AB  - The paper examines the multi‐tasked role of women in caregiving and career during the COVID‐19 partial lockdown in Ghana. One hundred fifty three mothers with careers within the Accra Metropolis participated in the study through purposive and snow balling sampling methods of non‐probability sampling technique. To observe the COVID‐19 protocols of social distancing, the research instrument was designed using Google forms and distributed to respondents via social media platforms (emails and WhatsApp). The results revealed that caregiving mothers generally reported to work late from home than if there were in the office and were less effective and productive working from home but were assured of job security because they mostly worked in the public sector. Hours used for domestic activities rose steadily during the lockdown period and social support from non‐relatives in caregiving increased. The paper’s finding suggests that mothers working from home are faced with difficult and conflicting roles which puts more pressure on women during the pandemic period. Women who are unable to access social support continue to be stressed and burdened in an attempt to combine family, care giving, and career roles which ultimately affect their overall wellbeing.

T1  - Procedural Justice, Posturing and Defiant Action: Exploring Prisoner Reactions to Prison Authority
AN  - 2512968500
AB  - Prison staff are vital for enforcing order in prisons. However, order is not only maintained by what prison staff do, but also relies on prisoners willingly following the directives of prison staff and complying with prison rules and procedures. This article puts forward the idea that how prison staff treat prisoners can affect the social distancing prisoners put between themselves and prison staff, potentially making defiance and non-compliance more difficult to manage. Social distancing is operationalised in this article as motivational posturing. Using survey responses from 177 Australian prisoners, the article shows a strong association between prisoners’ perceptions of procedural justice in prison and their self-reported compliance with prison rules. It also shows for the first time that motivational postures exist in a corrections context, and are associated with both procedural justice perceptions and self-reported compliance behaviour. Postures are also found to mediate the procedural justice/compliance relationship.

T1  - Ties in Tough Times: How Social Capital Helps Lower-Income Jewish Parents Weather the Economic Hardship of COVID-19
AN  - 2579464691
AB  - In this exploratory study, we examined how social ties helped lower-income Jewish parents in the Greater Philadelphia area weather the COVID-19 pandemic. We interviewed 36 parents who self-identified as Jewish, had at least one school-age child, and earned less than the median Jewish household income in the Philadelphia area. We analyzed the data through the lens of social capital, focusing on three forms: bonding, bridging, and linking social capital. Unlike in weather-related disasters, where social capital yields crucial physical help, the social distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic changed how social capital functions. Parents with strong social ties in the Jewish community were able to connect to people and institutions of power, such as rabbis and Jewish organizations, who provided valuable material resources while families sheltered in place. We describe how people develop relational ties by doing something with and for a social group, and discuss how extended periods of social distancing can threaten the flow of social capital.

T1  - ‘A battlefield for public opinion struggle': how does news consumption from different sources on social media influence government satisfaction in China?
AN  - 2502060120
AB  - While the political influence of the Internet, especially social media, on people’s attitude toward their governments has been widely discussed in western democracies, the situation in authoritarian regimes such as China has not yet been adequately addressed. The current Chinese administration considers social media ‘the main battlefield for public opinion struggle’ between the official discourse and those challenging it. To provide clues about who is shaping the public opinion, this study examined how consuming news from competing information sources on social media influences Chinese citizens’ satisfaction with the central and local government. Based on a nationally representative survey of 2,882 Chinese adults, the study found that consuming news from governmental sources on the country’s major social media platforms – Weibo and WeChat – was positively associated with citizens’ satisfaction with the central government, while exposure to alternative news sources on WeChat had a negative impact on both central and local government satisfaction. Additionally, news consumption from mainstream media sources on social media did not significantly influence the public’s government satisfaction. This paper contributes to the current literature by revealing that social media do not provide a unified agenda and by emphasizing the impact of platform affordances on people’s political attitudes.

T1  - Media use, fear of terrorism, and attitudes towards immigrants and refugees: Young people and adults compared: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2491565892
AB  - In Flanders, citizens hold rather negative attitudes towards immigrants and refugees. This could be due to the news media, which depict newcomers in a rather negative way. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether there are separate media worlds at work in Flemish young people and adults and whether this results in different attitudes towards immigrants and refugees. To do so, we questioned 1,759 people aged 13 to 65 by means of an online questionnaire. Results indicate that overall news consumption increases with age, and that young people mainly use social media for their news consumption while adults still rely on traditional media. Interestingly, young adults are the most welcoming group towards immigrants and refugees. Although news media consumption seems to be related to fear of terrorism and attitudes towards newcomers to some extent, socio-demographic factors play an important role in the development of fear and negative attitudes towards newcomers.

T1  - “We Should Stop the Islamisation of Europe!”: Islamophobia and Right-Wing Radicalism of the Russian-Speaking Internet Users in Germany
AN  - 2489521601
AB  - Starting from 2015, the Russian-speaking residents in Germany have expressed their anti-refugee position in the form of rallies and rising voting support for the right-wing populist party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Due to the absence of social cues, unlimited space, immediate responses, and minimal censorship online, platforms for communication have reflected the offline mobilization and became the major platforms for the spreadability of discriminatory discourse. This article sets out to investigate why Russian-speaking internet users residing in Germany justify anti-refugee discourse and how they construct the notion of “others.” Based on the netnographic analysis of the chosen online discussions and conducted interviews with its members, this article argues that, with the appearance of new “others,” Russian-speaking migrants have redefined their symbolic boundaries in order to draw the line between the incoming migrants and themselves—people with a migrant background. In many ways, participants of the analyzed discussions employed the politicized civilizational rhetoric that allowed them to redefine existing categorizations. This research explores, for the first time, the reasons lying behind the online populist activity of the Russian-speaking residents in Germany.

T1  - Nationalist narratives and anti-Immigrant attitudes: exceptionalism and collective victimhood in contemporary Israel
AN  - 2487091540
AB  - While scholars have long studied the relationship between nationalist beliefs and anti-immigrant attitudes, such work has proceeded largely independently from research on collective memory, which explores how nationalist narratives are created, maintained, and contested. In this paper, we bring these literatures together by asking how, at the individual level, receptivity to salient narratives about the nation’s past is associated with dispositions toward immigrants and immigration policy. Specifically, we focus on two narratives common in a number of contemporary democracies that frame the nation as having been perpetually victimised over its history (i.e. the victimhood narrative) and as having been chosen to carry out a special mission in the world (i.e. the exceptionalism narrative). Using original data from Israel, we demonstrate that stronger agreement with these narratives, and particularly with exceptionalism, is associated with greater propensity to hold anti-immigrant views. Our analyses reveal that this relationship is mediated by ethnic conceptions of the nation’s symbolic boundaries and, to a lesser degree, by perceived symbolic and material threats to the nation-state. Building on recent comparative work, we argue that in nations with a history of precarious sovereignty, victimhood and exceptionalism narratives can provide a fertile basis for the exclusionary appeals of radical-right political actors.

T1  - Outgroup prejudice and perceptions of prosocial intergroup behaviors
AN  - 2509211723
AB  - How people perceive outgroup prosocial behaviors is an important but under‐researched aspect of intergroup relations. In three experiments conducted in two cultural contexts (Italy and Kosovo) and with two different populations (adolescents and adults; N = 586), we asked participants to imagine being offered help by an outgroup versus ingroup member. Participants attributed fewer prosocial motives to and were less willing to accept help from the outgroup (vs. ingroup) member. This was particularly true for highly prejudiced participants and when the outgroup was described negatively. Participants' perceptions of the outgroup helper's prosocial motives and expected quality of the interaction with the helper mediated the effect of helper's group membership on willingness to accept the help (Experiment 3). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for intergroup relations.

T1  - Conducting Research Using Online Workshops During COVID-19: Lessons for and Beyond the Pandemic
AN  - 2613290778
AB  - Social distancing rules in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated a move to online research for many social science researchers. In moving data collection online, academic literature on Internet-mediated research has resurfaced and been enriched, providing researchers with a useful resource when planning data collection online. In sharp contrast, there is limited published work for online workshops, indicating new opportunities for developing an evidence base for this increasingly important approach to data generation.

T1  - From Tabletop to Screen: Playing Dungeons and Dragons during COVID-19
AN  - 2612842017
AB  - Media reports suggest that the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons saw its biggest year to date in 2020, with many such reports touting the interactive and social benefits for people facing COVID-19 lockdowns. This paper explores the reported challenges and benefits of playing D&D through teleconferencing hardware and software, and the experience of using virtual tabletops. A thematic analysis of a sample of Reddit threads discussing player experiences of transitioning D&D to remote play during COVID-19 social distancing was undertaken. The findings highlight a variety of player attitudes and preferences towards playing D&D remotely. The data suggest a mostly negative sentiment towards playing D&D online for groups that had transitioned from in-person to remote play. Loss of in-person socialisation was identified as an important contributor to a poor play experience, but groups would persevere with remote play to maintain social relationships, suggesting that, for many players, D&D serves an important social function beyond mere play. Some avenues for future research are identified.

T1  - Radical Self-Representation in a Hostile Setting: Discursive Strategies of the Russian Lesbian Feminist Movement
AN  - 2507921656
AB  - Today, internet provides opportunities for solidarization and collective action to initiative groups of social movements, including those of high degree of radicalism. For radical groups, language continues to be a crucial instrument through which social movements influence public attitudes. In this article, we analyze discursive strategies that the radical social movement (RSM) of Russian lesbian feminism uses to shape its image among the out-group and in-group publics. To identify the strategies of RSM self-representation, we employ semi-structured interviewing, qualitative content analysis, discourse analysis, and semantic network visualization. We find that, in a hostile anti-LGBT legal and discursive environment, self-representation of lesbian feminists is mostly linked to issues of aggression, violence, and systemic social, political, and legal constraints, unlike in the United States; it is also based on separation from the wider society and dehumanization of bearers of patriarchal views.

T1  - Family matters? Exploring media coverage of presidential candidates’ families by gender and race
AN  - 2571102457
AB  - Researchers have only recently begun to explore the role of parenthood and family in politics. While some scholars focus on the political attitudes of parents, others examine the advantages and disadvantages of politicians’ parental status on candidate viability. Building on the concept of politicized motherhood, we argue that focusing on candidates’ parental status alone provides an incomplete picture of the full range and symbolic functioning of family in political discourse. We coin the theory, politicized family, which includes narratives of candidates’ spouses, parents, grandparents, and children, and argue it provides a more useful frame for understanding these processes. We also move the literature forward by assessing how media coverage of families of presidential hopefuls varies along gendered and racialized lines. Using 2,458 articles and opinion pieces from the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal, we conduct a content analysis of candidate coverage from the 2004 and 2008 Democratic presidential primaries to explore how national print media portrays the family narratives of presidential candidates. Our results uncover both gendered and racialized family discourses embedded in media representations of presidential hopefuls. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of such portrayals for establishing candidates’ relatability and electoral viability.

T1  - Another Silver Lining?: Anthropological Perspectives on the Promise and Practice of Relaxed Restrictions for Telemedicine and Medication-Assisted Treatment in the Context of COVID-19
AN  - 2472333670
AB  - As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has temporarily relaxed restrictions to serve people who are opioid dependent during social distancing mandates. Changes include allowing patients to take home more doses of methadone and buprenorphine rather than coming to the clinic every day (for methadone) or weekly (for buprenorphine) and relaxed restrictions on telehealth delivery. Telemedicine Program representatives have described the relaxing of federal regulations as a "silver lining" to the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from medical anthropology approaches to epidemic surveillance and understandings of risk, we critically evaluate media representations of recent changes to telemedicine, prescribing, and opioid treatment delivery. Ethnographic research with providers and stakeholders in Arizona from 2017 to the present add insight to our analysis of media reports on these topics. Our findings demonstrate that media portrayal of access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) as the key to preventing both COVID-19 and overdose among people who are opioid dependent misses important risks and potential inequities. Applied social science questions raised by the new guidelines include: who receives take-home doses of methadone and buprenorphine and why; and how media representations of risk and benefit rationales shape real-world policy and practice.

T1  - Distance education as a response to pandemics: Coronavirus and Arab culture
AN  - 2478257026
AB  - Some countries have replaced face-to-face education with distance education in response to the coronavirus. This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts. Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over-demand for this education. Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox 'distanceship'.

T1  - Effects of Perceived Public Regard on the Well-Being of Military Veterans
AN  - 2453656602
AB  - Many military veterans face considerable challenges reintegrating into civilian life. Evidence suggests the general public holds conflicting attitudes toward veterans. This study examines how perceived public attitudes play a role in veterans’ mental health and well-being. Drawing from and extending interactionist theories of self-concept, stigma, and mental health recovery, we develop and estimate models for the relationships between internalized public attitudes toward veterans (perceived public regard), military identity–related self-worth (private regard), and well-being (depression, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction). Using survey data from the Chicagoland Veterans Study, we found that perceived public regard is negatively related to depression and positively related to self-efficacy and life satisfaction. The relationship between public regard and self-efficacy is fully mediated by private regard, and a significant part of the relationship between perceived public regard and both depression and life satisfaction is mediated by private regard. The study suggests avenues for extending theory and research related to military identity and public understanding of veterans as well as other groups where there may be conflicting public sentiment toward them.

T1  - Human and Global Identities: Different Prototypical Meanings of All‐Inclusive Identities
AN  - 2442358890
AB  - The impact of identities encompassing all human beings (e.g., human and/or global identities) on intergroup relations is complex, with studies showing mostly positive (e.g., less dehumanization), but also negative (e.g., deflected responsibility for harm behavior), effects. However, different labels and measures have been used to examine the effects of these all‐inclusive superordinate identities, without a systematic empirical examination of the extent to which they overlap or differ in their sociopsychological prototypical content. This study examined whether different labels activate the same contents in laypeople's conceptualization. Two hundred and forty‐eight participants openly described one of six labels: “All humans everywhere”; “People all over the world”; “People from different countries around the world”; “Global citizens”; “Citizens of the world”; and “Members of world community.” Results from quantitative content analyses showed that the different labels activated different thematic attributes, representing differences in their core prototypical meaning. We propose that a general distinction should be made between labels that define membership based on human attributes (e.g., biological attributes) and those that evoke attributes characteristic of membership in a global political community (e.g., attitudinal attributes), as their effect on intergroup relations may vary accordingly.

T1  - Psychological sense of community and values: Understanding attitudes towards people seeking asylum and Australia's First Nations People
AN  - 2424816600
AB  - ObjectiveDiscrimination and prejudice have significant implications for individuals and communities and are prevalent throughout the world towards marginalised groups. This study investigated the role of psychological sense of community (PSOC), values of self‐transcendence and openness‐to‐change, and demographic variables, with attitudes towards two different groups in Australia.MethodA convenience sample of adults living in Australia (N = 396) was randomly assigned to complete one of two online surveys; reporting on their attitudes towards Australia's First Nations People (N = 198), or towards people seeking asylum (N = 198). The study assessed the extent to which a PSOC (in reference to local, national, and global communities), self‐transcendence, and openness‐to‐change, predicted attitudes towards the two groups.ResultsSelf‐transcendence and psychological sense of global community consistently predicted attitudes towards both groups, with psychological sense of global community partially mediating the relationship between self‐transcendence and attitudes. Bivariately, those holding a stronger local psychological sense of community reported more positive attitudes towards people seeking asylum, whereas those holding a stronger psychological sense of national community reported more positive attitudes towards Australia's First Nations People. However, in multivariable regression models with self‐transcendence and demographic characteristics, only a higher psychological sense of national community significantly predicted more negative attitudes towards people seeking asylum.ConclusionsThis research suggests that where people have a strong sense they are part of a global community they hold more positive attitudes towards people from various cultures both near and far. The research has implications for social cohesion and social policy.

T1  - Adolescents’ experiences and perceptions of dementia
AN  - 2421211993
AB  - Objectives: There is a lack of understanding about how adolescents perceive dementia, and what their dementia related experiences are. Without such information, it is hard to make a case for the need to raise awareness of dementia in adolescents, and the best strategies to achieve this.Methods: In a cohort of 901 adolescents (aged 13–18) from the South East of England, we explored what the experiences and perceptions of dementia were using a series of questionnaires. Descriptive data of individual items were reported, comparing differences between genders.Results: The adolescents within this study tended to have positive or neutral attitudes towards dementia, though there was evidence that a proportion of adolescents had misconceptions or held negative attitudes (e.g. 28.5% of adolescents disagreed with the statement ‘In general, I have positive attitudes about people with dementia’). We also identified that the adolescents had a range of experiences of dementia including providing some form of care for someone with dementia (23.2%), though most had indirect contact with dementia through TV and movies (77.3%), or adverts (80.2%). Females nearly always had better attitudes towards dementia and had significantly more contact with dementia.Conclusions: Considering that adolescents are already forming negative attitudes and misconceptions of dementia, it is important that we raise awareness about dementia in this age group.

T1  - Right‐wing authoritarianism and majority members’ preferences for minority acculturation
AN  - 2408791361
AB  - The present research examines the role of right‐wing authoritarianism for the formation of majority members’ attitudes towards minority members’ contribution to the acculturation process. Previous research has confirmed the link between right‐wing authoritarianism and majority members’ acculturation preferences. Nonetheless, a test of their longitudinal relationship was still lacking. Using data from a 3‐wave panel study in Germany, we demonstrate that right‐wing authoritarianism among majority members predicts less support for immigrants’ cultural maintenance and less support for the establishment of intergroup relations over time (Study 1, N = 551). Using cross‐sectional survey data, we show that collective threat mediates these relationships (Study 2, N = 817). Data were representative of the German adult population. Our findings indicate that authoritarian majority members oppose integration because they perceive foreigners as threatening. Right‐wing authoritarianism appears to be a meaningful individual difference variable linked to majority members’ attitudes towards immigrants’ maintenance of their heritage culture and the establishment of intergroup relations over time. Our findings complement recent theorizing about acculturation processes.

T1  - Empathy to action: Child and adolescent out‐group attitudes and prosocial behaviors in a setting of intergroup conflict
AN  - 2388833715
AB  - The paper explored how to promote constructive intergroup relations among children and young people in a context of protracted conflict. Across two studies, the Empathy–Attitudes–Action model was examined in middle childhood and adolescence. More specifically, we tested the relations among dispositional empathy, out‐group attitudes, and prosocial behaviors for youth born after the peace agreement in Northern Ireland. In one correlational (Study 1: N = 132; 6–11 years old: M = 8.42 years, SD = 1.23) and one longitudinal design (Study 2: N = 466; 14–15 years old), bootstrapped mediation analyses revealed that empathy was associated with more positive attitudes toward the conflict‐related out‐group, which in turn, was related to higher out‐group prosocial behaviors, both self‐report and concrete actions. Given that out‐group prosocial acts in a setting of intergroup conflict may serve as the antecedents for peacebuilding among children and adolescents, this study has intervention implications.

T1  - The contribution of drinking culture at comprehensive school to heavy episodic drinking from adolescence to midlife
AN  - 2430184364
AB  - Background The school context is associated with adolescent alcohol use, but it is not clear whether this association continues into adulthood. This study examined whether exposure to drunkenness oriented drinking culture in 9th grade school class is associated with individuals’ heavy episodic drinking (HED) from adolescence to midlife. Methods Participants in the ‘Northern Swedish Cohort’ study aged 16 years in 1981 were followed-up when aged 18, 21, 30 and 43 (N = 1080). Individual-level factors were HED, positive attitudes towards drunkenness, early initiation of HED and peer-oriented spare-time. School class-level drinking culture was measured as classmate reported HED, positive attitudes, early initiation of HED and peer-oriented spare time. Multilevel log-binomial regression analyses were adjusted for gender, parental socioeconomic background, family structure and HED at age 16. Results After adjustment for sociodemographic factors several cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were found between class-level indicators of drinking culture and individual HED. After additional adjustment for age 16 HED, most associations attenuated. The risk ratio (95% confidence interval) for engaging in HED at age 43 was 1.58 (1.03–2.42) times higher for those who at age 16 had many classmates reporting positive attitude towards drunkenness. Conclusions These findings suggest that drinking culture in school may have a long-lasting impact on drinking habits in adulthood. The associations with HED at follow-ups are likely mediated by HED in adolescence. Studies on alcohol use would benefit from taking into account both individual and contextual factors in a life course perspective.

T1  - From empathy to action: Can enhancing host‐society children's empathy promote positive attitudes and prosocial behaviour toward refugees?
AN  - 2381930836
AB  - Over half of refugees are school‐aged children. In host communities, children's attitudes and behaviours are important for the integration of refugee children. This study examines the empathy–attitudes–action model in middle childhood (N = 94, 8 to 11 years old). In both the experimental and control conditions, children were introduced to a (fictional) refugee and told that he or she would be moving to their school. The experimental condition also listened to a storybook about the child's refugee experience. Empathy, outgroup attitudes, and prosocial behaviour toward the incoming child, and refugees as a group, were measured. Although mediation was not supported, the storybook condition reported more empathy and helping intentions, and attitudes predicted helping intentions but not giving to refugees. Results highlight how host‐society children can welcome refugees.

T1  - Religious Conservatives and TV News: Are They More Likely to be Religiously Offended?
AN  - 2306796002
AB  - Partisan selectivity of news media and attitudinal polarization are linked, yet the bulk of research focuses on the role of political attitudes while neglecting religious dispositions. We consider the degree to which both network and cable news media offend viewers in terms of both politics and religion. Using data from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey, we find that white evangelicals have higher odds than mainline Protestants of reporting taking offense from the evening news, as well as higher odds than religious non-affiliates of being offended by both types of news. The primary divide, however, was between affiliates and non-affiliates, as biblical literalism and religious exclusivism at least partially mediated differences between white evangelicals and mainliners in taking offense from the evening news. Religious service attendance at least partially mediated differences between affiliates and non-affiliates in taking offense from both types of news, but while political conservatism explained differences in being offended by the evening news, it was not a significant predictor of taking offense from cable news. We suggest that this is due to processes of media differentiation that make cable news an equal-opportunity offender.

AN  - 2338406247
AB  - The aim of this research was to explore gender differences in musical taste and the mediating role of functions of music between gender and musical taste. The research included 740 Croatian and Slovenian students. The results confirmed the existence of gender differences in both musical taste and functions of music. Females preferred the Reflective-Complex musical style, while males showed greater preferences towards Intense-Rebellious style of music. There was no significant gender difference in preferring Traditional and Contemporary Ethno or Energetic and Rhythmic musical style. With regard to the functions of music, there were no significant differences between males and females in identity/culture and background and focus/concentration functions of music. Males assessed political attitudes as a more important function of music than females, while females assessed all other functions of music higher than males did. A complete mediation effect of functions of music was established for gender and Reflective-Complex and Slo-Yugo Pop musical style.Alternate abstract:Cilj istraživanja bio je istražiti spolne razlike u glazbenom ukusu i posredujuću ulogu funkcija glazbe izmeðu spola i glazbenoga ukusa. Istraživanje je provedeno na 740 studenata iz Hrvatske i Slovenije. Rezultati potvrðuju postojanje razlika izmeðu muškaraca i žena i u glazbenom ukusu i u funkcijama glazbe. Žene više preferiraju refleksivno-kompleksni glazbeni stil, a muškarci intenzivno- -buntovni stil. Nije uočena značajna razlika u preferencijama tradicionalno-suvremenog etnostila ni energično-ritmičnoga glazbenog stila. Što se tiče funkcija glazbe, nema značajne razlike izmeðu muškaraca i žena u funkcijama koje se odnose na identitet / kulturu, pozadinsku 585 funkciju glazbe i funkciju glazbe u svrhu usmjeravanja fokusa / koncentracije. Muškarci, za razliku od žena, značajnijom procjenjuju funkciju glazbe za izražavanje političkih stavova, dok žene procjenjuju sve ostale funkcije glazbe značajnijima nego muškarci. Potpuni posredujući efekt funkcija glazbe ustanovljen je za spol i refleksivno-kompleksni te slo-jugo pop glazbeni stil.

T1  - Understanding Public Responses to Emerging Technologies: A Narrative Approach
AN  - 2287818139
AB  - Previous studies aimed at understanding public responses to emerging technologies have given limited attention to the social and cultural processes through which public concerns emerge. When probed, these have tended to be explained either in cognitive social psychological terms, typically in the form of cognitive shortcuts or heuristics or the influence of affective variables, or in social interactionist terms, as a product of the micro dynamics of the social interaction. We argue for an alternative approach that examines how public attitudes are formed in relation to the interplay of wider cultural narratives about science and technology. Using data from recent qualitative research with publics on nanotechnology and other emerging technologies, we develop a typology of five cultural narratives that underpin and structure public talk. The narratives we identify within focus group talk are familiar stories that are deeply embedded in contemporary culture, and which provide cultural resources for navigating the issues posed by emerging technology. Substantively, they inform a 'tragic' mood on the prospects of emerging technology, reflecting the loss of belief in science, when coupled to neo-liberal logics, as guaranteeing social progress. The implications for policy-making are discussed.

T1  - Who controls the city?
AN  - 2329109745
AB  - In August 2011, over four days, rioting spread across several cities in England. Previous accounts of these riots have indicated the roles of police racism, class disadvantage, and spatial affordance. However, what remains unclear is how these structural factors interacted with crowd processes spatially over time to govern the precise patterns of spread. The present paper provides a micro-historical analysis of the patterns and sequences of collective behaviour as the 2011 riots spread across North London, drawing upon multiple data-sets (archive, interview, video, official report, news coverage). The analysis suggests that initial stages of escalation in the broader proliferation were the result of protagonists deliberately converging from areas of relative deprivation in order to create conflict, but that they did so as a meaningful social identity-based expression of power. We show how over time these motivations and patterns of collective action changed within the riot as a function of intergroup interactions and emergent affordances. On this basis, we provide support for the argument that political, social and economic geography were key determining factors involved in the pattern of spread of the 2011 riots. However, we also suggest that an adequate explanation must correspondingly take into account the interplay between social identity, the dynamics of intergroup interaction, and empowerment process that develop during riots themselves.

T1  - Stress and positive attitudes towards violent discipline are associated with school violence by Ugandan teachers
AN  - 2256519400
AB  - Background Globally, the use of violent discipline methods by teachers to manage child behavior is still highly prevalent despite enactment of laws that prohibit school violence. In the case of Uganda there is a dearth of accurate prevalence statistics on school violence and factors associated with the use of violence by teachers. Objectives Therefore, the current study examined the prevalence of and attitudes towards violence. The study also explored the association between teachers' stress, positive attitudes towards violence and the use of violent discipline management methods. Methods A representative sample of 291 teachers and 702 students from 12 public secondary schools in southwestern Uganda responded to anonymous self-administered questionnaires. Data were collected from April to November 2017. Results Findings indicated that 86.5% of the teachers reported having used violent disciplinary methods on students in the past month while 91.5% of the students reported experiencing violence by teachers. Teachers (88.3%, n = 256) endorsed positive attitudes towards violent discipline. Teachers' stress was related to higher levels of violent discipline (β = 0.20). This relation was mediated by positive attitudes towards violence (0.06, SE: 0.01, 95%-CI: 0.035–0.092). Conclusions Our findings indicate that teacher reported stress was associated with their use of violent behavior and positive attitudes and that positive attitudes reduced the association between teachers' stress and violent behavior. Therefore, interventions aiming to reduce violence by teachers may need to integrate effective stress management skills, in addition to nonviolent discipline strategies, and fostering attitudinal change towards the use of violent methods.

T1  - Empathy and social closeness toward refugees from Syria: The mediating role of cultural intelligence
AN  - 2241792013
AB  - The predictors of social closeness toward refugees are rarely examined. In this study (N = 337), higher cultural intelligence (CQ) and higher empathy were defined as predictors of higher social closeness (lower social distance [the Social Distance Scale] and warmer feelings [the Feeling Thermometer]) toward refugees from Syria. This is the target group of prejudice and intensive coverage in the European mass media. The obtained results indicated that other‐oriented empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) and the motivational CQ predicted higher social closeness and warmer feelings toward refugees from Syria. Empathic personal distress predicted lower social closeness and colder feelings toward this group. Motivational CQ consistently served as the mediator of the relationship between empathy dimensions and social closeness toward Syrian refugees. Our findings reveal the previously unexplored correlations between empathy dimensions and cultural intelligence factors, including the mediational effects in predicting social closeness toward Syrian refugees.

T1  - ‘This is (not) Entertainment!’: media constructions of political scandal discourses in the 2016 US presidential election
AN  - 2229921276
AB  - The phenomenon of scandal(ization) has become omnipresent in contemporary political media discourses – at the latest since the 2016 US presidential election. Our article addresses causes and effects of this recent prevalence of scandal narratives. By connecting concepts from social systems theory and media theory, we consider crucial practices and processes of scandal construction in the 2016 US presidential election, focusing on the much-noticed emailgate and trumptape scandals. Both examples serve to illustrate how the emergence of partial public spheres in social media may lead to a fight for sovereignty over scandal discourse, political attitudes, and the negotiation of social norms, morals, and values.

T1  - Public responses to scientific research: Does disciplinary attribution matter?
AN  - 2170270064
AB  - Research has shown that the form and content of science communications can influence individuals’ responses. This study examines whether individuals’ perceptions of scientific research are influenced by the discipline to which the research is attributed. Two vignette experiments find that neither the perceived scientific-ness nor trustworthiness of a study originating from sociology is affected by attributing the study to a different social science or to a natural or medical science. These null findings contrast with surveys showing sizable disciplinary differences in public attitudes. It is possible that disciplinary attribution is a less salient cognitive shortcut when presented in longer communications as compared to survey questions that only provide the name of a discipline. We conclude with suggestions for further research on the role of disciplinary attribution on public perceptions of science.

T1  - Thinking about Cross-Cultural Differences in Qualitative Interviewing: Practices for More Responsive and Trusting Encounters
AN  - 2171117670
AB  - Existing methodological efforts subsume the interview into broad epistemological abstractions, neglecting actual mechanics of the interview as practice, and dismiss linguistic and cultural asymmetry in the interview as a matter of (in)adequate resources. Reflecting on 24 semi-structured interviews exploring social media use among Hong Kong youth, this article develops a culturally sensitive approach that democratically exposes the way cultural norms surface in communication, using strategies which (a) transform the dialogical mechanics of an interview-reflecting back and encouraging; (b) transform the positionality of the researcher-building intersubjectivity and emotional rapport; (c) transform the context of the interview-making shifts in space, language, and presentation. In doing so, a culturally sensitive approach generates practical recommendations for (a) humanizing the researcher to dismantle power imbalances and social distances and (b) naturalizing the interview into a more conversationalform, both of which combine to expose the cultural logics that govern action and interpretation whilst constructing results into intimate narratives of people's life-worlds.

T1  - Tone Matters: Effects of Exposure to Positive and Negative Tone of Television News Stories on Anti-Immigrant Attitudes and Carry-Over Effects to Uninvolved Immigrant Groups
AN  - 2430088030
AB  - The current experimental study (N = 546) compares the effect of exposure to a television news story with a positive and negative tone on anti-immigrant attitudes and carry-over effects to uninvolved immigrant groups. Results reveal that exposure to a “negatively” valenced news story about North African immigrants increased negative attitudes toward that same group. Importantly, however, we find carry-over effects of exposure to a “positively” valenced news story about North African immigrants to attitudes toward uninvolved immigrant groups. Together, these findings show that the effect of exposure to television news tone has more ramifications than previously thought, and that the impact of exposure to a positive or negative news story differs for direct effects vis-à-vis carry-over effects.

T1  - Assessing Civic Participation Around the World: How Evaluations of Journalists’ Performance Leads to News Use and Civic Participation Across 22 Countries: PROD
AN  - 2050222567
AB  - Very little is known about public perceptions of journalists outside Europe and the United States. Even less is known about the role of these attitudes in sustaining civic life around the world. Using individual and country-level survey data, this study explores public attitudes of press performance and their relationship with news consumption and civic participation in 22 countries. The study argues that the nature of civic and local participatory behaviors is often intertwined with notions about what is “good journalism.” Results suggest that public evaluations of press performance influence news use. News consumption is also tightly related to civic participation, even in markedly divergent cultural contexts. Citizens’ assessment of journalism practice is also a positive moderator of these relationships. This study builds on international comparative work related to the effects of press freedom and journalism practice on stimulating public life.

T1  - 'You opened my mind': Latinx immigrant and receiving community interactional dynamics in the United States
AN  - 1999858583
AB  - Communities are continually shaped by immigration. As immigrants join receiving community members as members of the same community, all must co-navigate emergent and evolving relationships. These intergroup relations can range from quite positive, marked by mutual enrichment and engagement, to quite negative, marked by prejudice and discrimination. This study seeks to illuminate immigrant and receiving community member relations by exploring what factors play a role in each group's attitudes and actions toward, and experiences with, one another. Thirty first- and second-generation immigrants from Latin America and 30 third-generation or more U.S.-born respondents participated in semistructured interviews, which were thematically analyzed. Results indicated that while both intergroup contact (Allport, 1954) and the formation of common in-group identities (Gaertner, Dovidio, & Bachman, 1996) helped to create positive intergroup relations, numerous personal characteristics-including values and beliefs, visible features, and relative power-affected experiences and attitudes. Further, in the absence of knowledge based on direct contact, media played a strong role in shaping attitudes toward both groups of community members. These findings show how attitudes and actions of immigrants and receiving community members are each shaped by experiences, or lack thereof, between these groups. Moreover, this pathway is iterative and reciprocal. Therefore, efforts aimed at increasing and improving positive intergroup relations must consider the bidirectional iterative process and experiences of both groups.

T1  - The New Portrayal of Female Child Sexual Offenders in the Print Media: A Qualitative Content Analysis
AN  - 1994285072
AB  - The mass media has the ability to shape public opinion on child sexual offenders. To date, research has found that offenses committed by female child sexual offenders have been portrayed in the media with undertones of sympathy and romanticization. With the apparent shift in gender roles toward gender egalitarianism, the aim of the present study was to obtain an up-to-date understanding of how female child sexual offenders are portrayed in the print media across western countries. The study utilized newspaper articles involving female child sexual offenders, published in English across western countries from 2012 to 2016 (N = 35 articles). A qualitative content analysis revealed two major themes: female child sexual offenders are dangerous and they are accountable for their actions. The findings of the current study are positive and shed light on the potential advancement of the reporting of female child sexual offenders in the print media at an international level.

T1  - 'If everyone says so ...' Press narratives and image change in major event host cities
AN  - 1950807142
AB  - This paper looks into the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) programme as a leading example of culture-led regeneration intervention aimed at renewing or diversifying the economic base and positioning of host cities. One of the key claims associated with the programme is that it can transform the 'image' of a city. These image transformation claims are often supported by evidence of heightened or more positive media coverage in the short term. However, little evidence has generally been gathered to determine long-term, sustained image change. The paper seeks to at least partly address this lacuna by presenting evidence on the media representation of Glasgow and Liverpool over three decades. These two cities are widely perceived to be paradigmatic not only of successful culture-led regeneration but also of the power of the ECoC title to transform city image. The paper looks at the importance of the media narrative arc surrounding major cultural events in solidifying 'image change' processes, regardless of the existence of evidence to suggest a change in perceptions by local communities at the time the event is taking place. The core argument is that if media coverage about a particular place shows a significant change in focus and attitude over time, is voluminous enough and cuts across geographical and journalistic variations, then it effectively becomes a key source of evidence of de facto image change. The key proposition in this paper is that evidenceable and sustained change in media representations of place can be taken as tantamount to image change. This is based on the assumption that widespread and longitudinal trends in media representation have the capacity to both reflect and influence public attitudes and perceptions.

T1  - National Trauma and the Fear of Foreigners: How Past Geopolitical Threat Heightens Anti-Immigration Sentiment Today
AN  - 2430649564
AB  - This paper introduces a historical, macro-political argument into the literature on anti-immigration sentiment, which has mainly considered individual-level predictors such as education or social capital as well as country-level factors such as fluctuations in labor market conditions, changing composition of immigration streams, or the rise of populist parties. We argue that past geopolitical competition and war have shaped how national identities formed and thus also contemporary attitudes toward newcomers: countries that have experienced more violent conflict or lost territory and sovereignty developed ethnic (rather than civic) forms of nationalism and thus show higher levels of anti-immigration sentiment today. We introduce a geopolitical threat scale and score 33 European countries based on their historical experiences. Two anti-immigration measures come from the European Social Survey. Mixed-effects, ordinal logistic regression models reveal strong statistical and substantive significance for the geopolitical threat scale. Furthermore, ethnic forms of national identification do seem to mediate this relationship between geopolitical threat and restrictionist attitudes. The main analysis is robust to a wide variety of model specifications, to the inclusion of all control variables known to affect anti-immigration attitudes, and to a series of alternative codings of the geopolitical threat scale.

T1  - Cognitive and Affective Empathy, Personal Belief in a Just World, and Bullying Among Offenders
AN  - 1952061553
AB  - Bullying extracts a heavy toll on offenders and prison staff alike. Studying what factors may affect bullying is extremely important as this may help to minimize bullying in prison. Although there is research on the relationship between lack of empathy and positive attitude toward bullying, previous research has overlooked that age may influence this relationship. In fact, previous research has shown that there are changes in empathy across the life span. Therefore, we examined whether having a positive attitude toward bullying in offenders was predicted by age, mediated by cognitive/affective empathy. Another important factor in the prediction of positive attitudes toward bullying may be the belief in a just world, as having a weak belief is related to more aggressive outbursts. Given that there is scarce research in the topic, we examined the relationship between having a positive attitude toward bullying and personal belief in a just world. To that aim, 123 sentenced adult male prisoners, selected from a Category C prison in the United Kingdom completed different questionnaires to assess their levels of cognitive and affective empathy, positive attitude toward bullying, and personal belief in a just world. As expected, age predicted a positive attitude toward bullying, mediated by affective empathy. However, we did not find a positive relationship between a positive attitude toward bullying and a personal belief in a just world. The results are discussed in terms of their application in possible intervention programs.

T1  - Development of anti-immigrant attitudes in adolescence: The role of parents, peers, intergroup friendships, and empathy
AN  - 1915759573
AB  - Ethnic and racial intergroup attitudes are assumed to develop due to the influence of socialization contexts. However, there is still little longitudinal evidence supporting this claim. We also know little about the relative importance of socialization contexts, the possible interplay between them as well as about the conditions and mechanisms that might underlie socialization effects. This longitudinal study of adolescents (N = 517) examined the effects of parents and peers' anti-immigrant attitudes as well as intergroup friendships on relative changes in adolescents' anti-immigrant prejudice, controlling for the effects of socioeconomic background. It also examined whether the effects of parents or peers would depend on adolescents' intergroup friendships. In addition, it explored whether the effects of parents, peers, and intergroup friendships would be mediated or moderated by adolescents' empathy. Results showed significant effects of parents, peers, intergroup friendships, and socioeconomic background on changes in youth attitudes, highlighting the role of parental prejudice. They also showed adolescents with immigrant friends to be less affected by parents and peers' prejudice than youth without immigrant friends. In addition, results showed the effects of parents, peers, and intergroup friendships to be mediated by adolescents' empathic concern. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - You're either with us or against us! Moral conviction determines how the politicized distinguish friend from foe: GPIR
AN  - 1928355685
AB  - Three studies investigated how politicized collective identification affects individuals' reactions towards others. We hypothesized that a strong politicized identity tends to be accompanied by a moral conviction about the politicized cause, which in turn determines how the politicized respond to those less committed to their cause. Consistent with this, Study 1 showed that politicized (feminist) identification is associated with lower identification with women who place moderate (vs. high) moral value on gender equality. Study 2 showed that politicized identification was associated with negative emotions towards people who disagree with this cause and this was mediated by the extent to which participants saw supporting the activist goal as morally obligatory. Study 3 showed that politicized identification, to the extent to which it implied holding a moral conviction about the activist cause, is associated with a desire for more social distance to an attitudinally dissimilar other, but not from an attitudinally similar other.

T1  - The long shadows of the difficult past? How young people in Denmark, Finland and Germany remember WWII
AN  - 1856694612
AB  - This paper focuses on the question of how young people today evaluate the Second World War today and how this 'difficult past' determines their political attitudes. Furthermore, the channels through which the current young generation in Europe is informed about the events dating back to the first half of the twentieth century (e.g. parents and grandparents, schools, the media) are examined. The theoretical basis chosen for addressing these questions is the work of Mannheim (1928) on the formation of successive generations, and the theories of collective memories and identities of Eisenstadt and his followers. Our empirical evidence comes from a transnational comparison of young people's memories of this difficult past in Denmark, Finland and Germany. From a historical perspective a comparison of the three countries is particularly interesting as they played different roles during the Second World War. The evidence highlights the different perceptions of history among youth and points to the absence of a common European understanding of what happened between 1939 and 1945. The empirical evidence comes from a research project (2011-2015) funded by the European Commission and covering 14 European countries. Its main focus has been on present-day young people's perceptions of history and politics (MYPLACE = Memory, Youth, Political Legacy and Civic Engagement).

T1  - Getting the mob angry: The satire of Masa Enfurecida as political incorrectness in social networking
AN  - 1920093676
AB  - Since Ancient Greece satirists are feared figures in any group articulation. Often protected by anonymity, authors have defied political and social order with a harsh and unpleasant sense of humour, which pushes the limits of political correction. This form based in breaking news and everyday life has a particularly suitable space in new media. Twitter, by means of its promptness and need for concision, could be considered a perfect ground for this kind of humour. Provocation and censorship of political attitudes are the objectives of many twitter accounts whose followers echo by commenting and retweeting. Interactivity allows the production of a text without closure which interweaves a myriad of positions, different from the voice of the satirist. My case study is the Twitter account Masa Enfurecida, which targeted for five years the Spanish political and social everyday life by quoting and reversing public messages. With close to 124.000 followers, @masaenfurecida, an anonymous account, impacts political debate and influences popular communication as some repeated expressions become part of the talk of the day. The tweets of Masa Enfurecida are brief pieces that can be considered a pure form of satire, which is transformed in the chains of answers and retweets of the followers.

T1  - Reducing the Stigma of Depression Among Asian Students: A Social Norm Approach
AN  - 1906179202
AB  - In North America, Asians reliably report higher levels of stigma toward people with depression than do Europeans. Possible methods of reducing this discrepancy have rarely been explored. Asian undergraduate students (n = 132) were presented with one of four antistigma videos with two actresses: one portraying a student with depression and the other a professor. The videos used the concept of social proof, presenting either positive or negative descriptive norms, to effect change in stigma, measured by social distance. It was hypothesized that the positive descriptive norms intervention would show significantly greater positive change in social distance compared with the negative descriptive norms intervention. All videos were effective in reducing preferred social distance toward people with depression relative to the control condition. The effectiveness of the positive descriptive norm video was mediated through descriptive norms and self-efficacy. The effectiveness of the negative descriptive norm video was mediated through injunctive norms and perceived value of support. The findings can help guide interventions that aim to encourage social engagement with people with depression among Asian student populations. Manipulating social norms and increasing self-efficacy may be especially effective.

T1  - Why do majority members prefer immigrants who adopt the host culture? The role of perceived identification with the host nation
AN  - 1842821373
AB  - Research has shown that members of the national majority group generally consider host culture adoption by immigrants as desirable. However, so far, this positive effect of perceived host culture adoption on attitudes toward immigrants has not been explained. We argue that majority members infer national identification of immigrants from their cultural adoption. Moreover, we predict that this inference should decrease majority members' feeling of ingroup threat, therefore also improving their attitudes toward immigrants. We conducted two experimental studies. In Study 1, majority members who were presented an immigrant group that adopted the host culture held more positive attitudes than those who were presented one that disregarded it. In line with our hypothesis, this effect was fully mediated by perceived identification of the immigrants with the host nation, itself decreasing perception of ingroup threat. Study 2 reproduced the same experimental design, but used descriptions of individual immigrants' acculturation strategies, and the immigrant group's status -- valued vs. devalued origin -- was also manipulated. In addition, Study 2 focused on dimensions of the "Big Two" of social perception. Results replicated the mediational effect of perceived identification on attribution of both warmth and competence traits. The status manipulation had no significant effect and did not interact with cultural adoption. These two studies provide robust evidence that perception of host nation identification explains the effects of perceived cultural adoption on attitudes towards immigrants.

T1  - Defensive representations of an uncomfortable history: The case of Hungary and the Holocaust
AN  - 1842819606
AB  - The current research examines how representations of a traumatic history influence contemporary intergroup attitudes. Specifically, we examine antisemitism in Hungary as a case example of how the need to defend the group's moral image motivates the assumption of a defensive representation of history -- a modification of the group's narrative with regards to its culpability in past atrocities committed against another group. Two studies examined the link between defensive representations of the Holocaust, nationalism, and antisemitism. In the first, correlational study (N = 348), we found that Hungarian nationalism and antisemitism were associated, and that this association was significantly mediated by defensive representations of the Holocaust -- high nationalism was associated with higher endorsement of defensive representations which in turn were associated with more antisemitism. Low nationalism was associated with greater acknowledgement of in-group responsibility for historical crimes which was associated with less antisemitism. These findings were corroborated in an experimental study (N = 165) which indicated that priming defensive representations of the Holocaust increased antisemitism, even when controlling for nationalism. Study 2 further showed, in a 2-step mediation model, that defensive representation primes increased secondary antisemitism, conspiratorial antisemitism, and negative attitudes towards Israel. We discuss the implications of defensive representations of history on contemporary intergroup relations.

T1  - Effects of Competing Narratives on Public Perceptions of Opioid Pain Reliever Addiction during Pregnancy
AN  - 1821759699
AB  - Opioid pain reliever addiction has increased among women of reproductive age over the last fifteen years. News media and public attention have focused on the implications of this trend for infants exposed to opioids prenatally, with state policy responses varying in the extent to which they are punitive or public health oriented. We fielded a six-group randomized experiment among a nationally representative sample of US adults to test the effects of narratives portraying a woman with opioid pain reliever addiction during pregnancy on beliefs about people addicted to opioid pain relievers, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, policy attitudes, and emotional responses. Portraying a high socioeconomic status (SES) woman in the narrative lowered perceptions of individual blame for addiction and reduced public support for punitive policies. Depicting the barriers to treatment faced by a low SES woman lowered support for punitive policies and increased support for expanded insurance coverage for treatment. The extent to which narratives portraying successfully treated addiction affected public attitudes depended on the SES of the woman portrayed. These findings can inform the development of communication strategies to reduce stigma toward this population, reduce support for punitive policies, and increase support for more public health-oriented approaches to addressing this problem.

T1  - French cultural wars: public discourses on multiculturalism in France (1995-2013)
AN  - 1792708388
AB  - Current literature on multiculturalism is often based on the analysis of national legislation and institutions. But to understand the evolution of multiculturalism, we also have to take into account the various public debates over it. In this article, I analyse how the term 'multiculturalism' was used in four French national newspapers from 1995 to 2013. I use critical discourse analysis, which, through the study of vocabulary and the discursive process, allows us to chart the underlying ideologies of the texts. This research modifies the widespread perception that France is an 'assimilationist' country. In fact, the philosophical principles of recognition and non-discrimination have grown widespread in intellectual circles: the term 'multiculturalism' is used in largely positive fashion in three of the four national newspapers analysed. Criticism of 'multiculturalism' must be interpreted as apprehension over the potential consequences of the demographic evolution triggered by post-colonial immigration. The theme of multiculturalism is increasingly present in public debates in France, and has become an entrenched element of the left-right ideological divide. The ideological stances of all the newspapers remained constant over time: we see a sharp dichotomy between two opposing philosophies that reflect different visions of the individual and the larger community.

T1  - Presenting welfare reform: poverty porn, telling sad stories or achieving change?
AN  - 2059564209
AB  - Much is written about the suffering resulting from welfare reform and other cuts for disabled people and others on the receiving end. Usually this is seen as a 'good thing'. But is it as simple as that? It may not be the same as so-called television poverty porn, but what is the point of constantly recycling welfare reform's effects? Judging from last May's general election, doing this does not seem to have had a significant effect on public politics/attitudes. So perhaps we need to look at it more carefully. When might discussion of welfare reform be helpful and when unhelpful? Is not the real task to develop alternatives, rather than hope as the Fabians did, that if we show how awful things are, 'then something will have to be done'?

T1  - Emotional duplex in the nation (de-)branding: a case study of China and Shen Yun Performing Arts
AN  - 1796286718
AB  - The intricate connection between nation branding efforts and the emotions they evoke has been inadequately addressed in existing branding and international relations literature. I propose a heuristic account that theorizes this relationship. By tracing the branding efforts made by China and the de-branding efforts made by Shen Yun Performing Arts (a troupe established by Falun Gong practitioners), I argue that these "authentic" Chinese cultural presentations elicit certain emotions. The emotional works are different for Chinese domestic audiences and for international audiences. I propose a duplex model to account for the emotional processes in these two groups of audiences. Four operating emotions -- pride, guilt, admiration, and anger -- solidify into various political attitudes toward China. Finally, I discuss the contributions of this duplex model and its further complications. [web URL: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15295036.2015.1129547]

T1  - Towards the ASEAN Community: Assessing the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Aspirations of Thai University Students
AN  - 1822121506
AB  - This article assesses the knowledge of, attitudes towards, and aspirations for ASEAN among Thai university students, who are set to enter the ASEAN Community labour market and are among those most in touch with ASEAN issues. It uses data obtained from a countrywide survey and focus group discussions to identify variables that affect knowledge, attitudes, and aspirations and to explore the relationships between knowledge, attitudes, and aspirations. The quantitative analysis conducted here uses students' fields of study, academic performance, and exposure to both ASEAN-related courses and also information and discussions about ASEAN in the mass media and public forums as predictors of their level of knowledge about ASEAN. The paper's results confirm that positive attitudes towards ASEAN lead to positive aspirations for ASEAN. They also reveal that significant knowledge about ASEAN cannot, in isolation, adequately explain students' attitudes towards ASEAN and does not always lead to positive attitudes. These findings and those obtained from the focus group discussions suggest that a high level of knowledge and understanding of fellow ASEAN member countries and their people -- whether attained through formal or informal education or social interaction -- is needed for students to develop positive attitudes and become aspiring members of the ASEAN Community.

T1  - 'Benefits broods': The cultural and political crafting of anti-welfare commonsense
AN  - 1790890964
AB  - In the aftermath of the global banking crises, a political economy of permanent state austerity has emerged, driven by and legitimated through a hardening anti-welfare commonsense. We argue that, while there is an excellent evidence base emerging around solidifying negative public attitudes towards welfare, critical policy studies needs to attend to the cultural as well as the political economies through which an anti-welfare commonsense is formed and legitimated. We adopt a 'cultural political economy' approach to examine the cultural and political crafting of 'benefit brood' families within the wider public sphere, to examine the mechanisms through which anti-welfare sentiments are produced and mediated. Through a case study of Mick Philpott, we demonstrate how 'benefits broods' operate both as technologies of control (through which to manage precariat populations), but also as technologies of consent through which a wider and deeper anti-welfare commonsense is effected.

T1  - Perceptions of social strategies in intercultural relations: The case of Ethiopian immigrants in Israel
AN  - 1762010037
AB  - Social strategies are a central component of intercultural competence, and are vital in understanding, theoretically and practically, the immigration and acculturation process. This study focused on an immigrant group experiencing identity threat, namely young Ethiopians in Israel, and examined their perceptions of social strategies in intergroup relations. Thematic analysis was performed on two types of qualitative data: (1) newspaper articles in which members of the Ethiopian community addressed aspects of their social strategies (31 reports collected from seven newspapers and magazines) and (2) data from two focus groups conducted afterwards with young adult members of the Ethiopian community (five to seven participants in each group). A major pattern emerging from the immigrants' reports is the adoption of the hosts' perspective and attitudes regarding the effective norms of social behavior. In their daily coping, on the other hand, the immigrant youth tended to exhibit a complex and at times ambivalent variety of behavioral patterns in their social interactions with members of the host culture. This spectrum of social strategies suggests dynamic processes of trial and error and reflects the unique complexity of intercultural competence. Findings were analyzed in terms of the immigrants' perception of the threat to their identity and of their ways of coping with those threats.

T1  - How similar, how different? On Dutch media depictions of older and younger people
AN  - 1672697388
AB  - ABSTRACT              By providing information on society at large, the media help to establish and maintain relations between various social groups, such as between younger and older people. They may also disturb the formation or maintenance of such relations, e.g. by stimulating the 'othering' of the out-group members. The aim of the present study was to trace how the different strategies of 'othering' are applied by Dutch news media in their portrayal of older and younger citizens. The analysis showed that the most notable discrepancies in the media coverage of the two age groups appear in (the nature of) their evaluation. While the negative descriptors of older characters relate more frequently to their (alleged) incompetence, the negative depictions of younger actors refer predominantly to their lack of benevolence. In the case of positive evaluations the reverse is true: older characters are more often presented as warm and younger people as competent. The results of the study are interpreted in the light of literature on social distance and (social) practices of 'othering'.

T1  - Majority-minority acculturation preferences concordance as an antecedent of attitudes towards immigrants: The mediating role of perceived symbolic threat and metastereotypes
AN  - 1735657122; 201536997
AB  - Through an experimental design, we investigated the effects of majority-minority acculturation preferences concordance and immigrants' generational status on Italians' attitudes towards Albanian immigrants. The role of perceived threat and metastereotypes in mediating this relationship was examined. Participants (N = 178) were categorized into different levels of culture maintenance and intercultural contact concordance. Findings showed that discrepancies in the contact dimension affected majority members' attitudes towards immigrants. Both perceived threat and metastereotypes were found to mediate the relationship between contact discrepancies and attitudes towards immigrants. Culture maintenance concordance interacted with immigrants' generational status in influencing majority members' attitudes. This research confirmed the importance of taking into account the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between majority and immigrant acculturation preferences, confirming that the most positive attitudes were produced when immigrants were perceived to adopt the same strategy as the majority, especially with respect to intergroup contact.

T1  - Small worlds or worlds apart? Using network theory to understand the research-practice gap
TT  - ¿Mundos pequeños o mundos separados? Usando la teoría de redes para comprender la brecha investigación-práctica
AN  - 2479104329
AB  - The implementation of effective community interventions can be challenging for many reasons, including financial and time costs, lack of infrastructure, local contextual variations, and barriers to fidelity. But, prior to all of these is the challenge of limited information exchange between the researchers developing interventions and the practitioners implementing them, or the so-called research-practice gap. In this paper, we use network theory and review a dozen small world experiments to understand the research practice gap, identifying three key lessons: (1) spatial and social distances are related to the severity of the gap, (2) social boundaries may lead to echo chambers and closed loops, and (3) wider gaps reduce the likelihood of successful information exchange. From these lessons, we recommend that researchers and practitioners should rely on the assistances of information brokers who know people they do not know and who are different from themselves.Alternate abstract:
La implementación de intervenciones comunitarias efectivas es un reto por muchas razones, que vandesde los costes financieros y de tiempo a la falta de infraestructura, la diversidad de contextos localesy los obstáculos a la fidelidad. Pero antes de todo esto se cuenta el intercambio limitado de informaciónentre los investigadores que desarrollan intervenciones y los profesionales que las implementan, quesuele denominarse la "brecha entre la investigación y la práctica". En este artículo utilizamos la teoría deredes y revisamos una docena de experimentos de mundo pequeño para comprender la brecha cienciapráctica,obteniendo tres lecciones fundamentales: (1) las distancias espaciales y sociales se relacionancon la severidad de la brecha, (2) las fronteras sociales pueden traducirse en cámaras de eco y circuitoscerrados, y (3) las brechas más amplias reducen la probabilidad de un intercambio de información conéxito. A partir de estas lecciones se recomienda que los investigadores y los profesionales recurran a laayuda de intermediarios que conocen a personas que ellos no conocen y que son diferentes a ellos.

T1  - Selective exposure and agenda setting: exploring the impact of partisan media exposure on agenda diversity and political participation
AN  - 1660024726; 201506358
AB  - A deliberative democracy calls for citizens who are well informed about a diverse range of public issues and a media system that shapes the public agenda for deliberation and consensus building. However, with the current proliferation of a high-choice media environment, citizens can engage in partisan selective exposure by only consuming news that matches their own political attitudes and dispositions. This study examines two under-researched effects of partisan selective exposure: (1) the reduction in the number of societal issues that individuals consider important (i.e., nominal agenda diversity) and (2) the reduction in the variety of issues (i.e., thematic agenda diversity). A national survey was conducted in Hong Kong, a transitional democracy with a highly partisan media environment. The results showed that although reading more newspapers is positively related to nominal agenda diversity and thematic agenda diversity, citizens who receive their news only from partisan newspapers are less likely to be interested in a range of public issues and are less able to name pressing societal issues. Moreover, both nominal and thematic diversities predicted political participation, though not political discussion. The findings provide supporting evidence that partisan selective exposure can lead to a fragmented public agenda. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Revisiting Media Effects in Authoritarian Societies: Democratic Conceptions, Collectivistic Norms, and Media Access in Urban China
AN  - 1913993485
AB  - We argue that, to effectively understand media effects in authoritarian societies, researchers must assess different types of media strategies adopted by authoritarian leaders. Using survey data from two Chinese cities, we examine the effects of two types of media strategies adopted by the Chinese government, targeting political attitudes and nonpolitical values and norms, respectively. Following a new line of research, we contrast China's domestic-controlled media to foreign free media. After accounting for the selection bias in Chinese urbanites' media access, we do not find sufficient evidence for the effect of the media strategies directly targeting their democratic conceptions. However, sufficient and robust evidence shows that more intensive consumption of diverse media sources, including foreign media, does significantly but indirectly counteract the Chinese government's political campaigns targeting its citizens' democratic conceptions, via thwarting the government's media strategies to cultivate a collectivistic norm in the society.

T1  - Framing interethnic conflict in Malaysia: A comparative analysis of newspapers coverage on the keris polemics
AN  - 1531934010; 201423273
AB  - The keris is a Malay or Indonesia dagger. In 2005, the then United Malays National Organization (UMNO) Youth Chief and Malaysia Education Minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, wielded the keris at the UMNO Youth general assembly, which he claimed to be a means to motivate the Malays. Following that, the UMNO Youth general assembly in 2006 and 2007 was noted for some racist statements made by several delegates in addition to the keris-wielding action repeated by Hishammuddin. The non-Malays perceived the action of wielding the keris as a gesture meant to defend ketuanan Melayu (Malay supremacy) and to threaten those who opposed Malay special rights. After the political tsunami in 2008, the Malaysian Chinese Association and Malaysian People's Movement Party (Gerakan) leaders blamed UMNO for their electoral debacle. Hishammuddin also admitted that his raising of the keris was among the causes of the Barisan Nasional's poor performance in the general election. He apologized to the non-Malays because of the fear to a symbol which was not his intention and to the Malays for not being able to uphold their symbol of heritage. This study aimed to compare the coverage of the keris polemics by mainstream Malay, English and Chinese as well as alternative newspapers. By using framing as the theoretical framework and content analysis as the research methods, it was found that the newspapers framed the issue differently, reflecting the political economic and ideological boundaries within which the journalists work.

T1  - Field Experimental Designs for the Study of Media Effects
AN  - 1531931350; 201424018
AB  - Field experimentation is a promising but seldom used method for studying the effects of media messages on political attitudes and behavior. The practical challenges of conducting media experiments in real-world settings often come down to securing cooperation from research partners, such as political campaigns. To do so, researchers must be prepared to adapt their experimental designs to satisfy the constraints imposed by research partners and the media environment in which they operate. This article provides an overview of some alternative field experimental designs that allow researchers to maintain the advantages of random assignment while addressing practical considerations. Examples are drawn from the growing field experimental literature examining the effects of television, radio, and online communication. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beliefs About the Strauss-Kahn Case in France and Germany: Political Orientation and Sexual Aggression Myths as Local Versus Global Predictors
AN  - 1767327714; 201610759
AB  - In May 2011, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund and a prominent member of the French Socialist Party, was charged with attempted rape. Extensive media coverage led people across the globe to speculate about intentions and responsibilities. While the case was pending, we conducted two parallel Internet surveys, with French and German participants (N = 1,314). We examined how strongly exoneration of the alleged perpetrator depended on acceptance of modern myths about sexual aggression (AMMSA) and identity attributes that are temporarily salient as a function of local context (gender, political left-right orientation, nationality). AMMSA was a global predictor of exonerating the alleged perpetrator across national sub-samples, whereas the predictive power of gender and left-right orientation varied locally: For French respondents, left-wing political attitudes predicted exoneration of the alleged perpetrator, whereas only for German respondents, being male predicted exoneration. We conclude that the interplay of global (sexual aggression myths) and local (social identification) factors affects the lay assessment of ambiguous cases of sexual violence.

T1  - News With an Attitude: Assessing the Mechanisms Underlying the Effects of Opinionated News
AN  - 1718064874; 201531378
AB  - Opinionated news targets communities of like minded viewers, relies on dramaturgical storytelling techniques, and shares characteristics with political satire. Accordingly, opinionated news should be understood as a specific form of political entertainment. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of opinionated news on political attitudes using an experimental design that employed manipulated television news items. Findings confirm that opinionated news positively affects policy attitudes via its presumed influence on others and subsequent perceptions of the opinion climate. However, opinionated news also negatively affects attitudes via hostile media perceptions and evoked anger, especially for people with incongruent political preferences. Due to these opposing processes, we found no total effect of opinionated news on policy attitudes. Conditions are discussed under which either the positive or the negative indirect effect is likely to dominate. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Focusing on Differences? Contextual Conditions and Anti-immigrant attitudes' Effects on Support for Turkey's EU Membership
AN  - 1559005822; 201432577
AB  - A key predictor of support for Turkey's EU membership is citizens' attitudes toward immigrants. How anti-immigrant attitudes relate to support is not obvious and has remained unclear thus far. We argue that the presence of immigrants in a country reduces support for Turkey's membership. Second, the stronger this presence, the stronger the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on support. Third, the more salient immigration issues in a country, the stronger the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on support. Using cross sectional survey data (N = 26,344) from 20 EU member states, we find support for these claims. Our findings provide a prime example of how politicians and media can influence citizens' thinking about specific issues, and, in doing so, can influence public opinion.

T1  - Perpetuating One's Own Disadvantage: Intergroup Contact Enables the Ideological Legitimation of Inequality
AN  - 1494750420; 201400660
AB  - Contact with the dominant group can increase opposition, among the disadvantaged, to social policies that would benefit their group. This effect can be explained in terms of contact promoting support for an ideology of meritocracy, which privileges the distribution of societal resources based on individual merit, rather than group-level disadvantage. We tested this ideological mechanism in a large, nationally representative sample of Maori (a disadvantaged group in New Zealand; N = 1,008). Positive intergroup contact with the dominant group (New Zealand Europeans) predicted increased opposition to a topical reparative policy (Maori ownership of the foreshore), and this was fully mediated by increased support for the ideology of meritocracy. Intergroup contact may enable the ideological legitimation of inequality among members of disadvantaged groups, engendering political attitudes that are detrimental to their group's interests. Contact with ingroup members had the opposite effect, increasing support for reparative policy by reducing subscription to meritocratic ideology.

T1  - How does education have an impact on ethnocentrism? A structural equation analysis of cognitive, occupational status and network mechanisms
AN  - 1559005564; 201432160
AB  - Previous studies have distinguished cognitive, occupational status and network mechanisms in the relation between education and ethnocentrism. Hypotheses on these mediating mechanisms are derived from socialization theory, realistic group threat and contact theory. In the current study we use structural equation modeling to investigate the explanatory power of these three mechanisms simultaneously. The analysis is based on a representative population survey from the Netherlands (NELLS 2009, n = 1910). The results show that more than half of the initial association between education and ethnocentrism can be attributed to cognitive ability and occupational status mechanisms. The remaining part of the overall association, however, still has to be modeled as a direct relationship between education and ethnocentrism. This direct association can be attributed either to social desirability or to a direct liberalizing effect of education on social and political attitudes. Our analysis tentatively suggests that the rise of average education levels in Western societies might lead to less ethnocentric attitudes via the cognitive sophistication mechanism.

T1  - POPULAR OPINION LEADER INTERVENTION FOR HIV STIGMA REDUCTION IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS
AN  - 1512218457; 201410676
AB  - This study used the Popular Opinion Leader (POL) model to reduce stigma among service providers. The authors focused on the dissemination of intervention messages from trained POL providers to their peer providers and the change of intervention outcome over time. The sample included 880 service providers from 20 intervention hospitals. The levels of message diffusion, prejudicial attitude toward people living with HIV (PLH), and avoidance intent to serve PLH were self-reported at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. At 6 months, POL providers showed a significantly higher level of message diffusion and lower levels of prejudicial attitude and avoidance intent than non-POL providers. However, such discrepancies diminished at 12 months. The results support the utility of the POL model in stigma reduction interventions. The observed changes were documented not only in POLs but also in non-POLs after a certain period of time. This finding informed the design and implementation of future stigma reduction efforts and POL intervention programs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Italian public sphere: a case of dramatized polarization
AN  - 1463014931; 201346855
AB  - This contribution is organized along two main interpretive lines. First: the Italian public sphere is very polarized because of well-established historical attitudes, a crowded media market and new technologies that push towards segmentation of the audience. The arrival of Berlusconi has only reinforced the already existing polarization that goes well beyond the borders of partisanship involving the content of news, the structure and professionalism of news outlets and also the recipients that divide themselves along the lines of political attitudes. The second characteristic feature of the Italian public sphere involves the tendency towards dramatization, which is also produced by the sudden commercialization of the entire mass media system that started in 1980. This article's thesis is supported by examples of dramatization and extreme political discourse. The consequences that derive from this situation are discussed in the conclusion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contact between Catholic and Protestant schoolchildren in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1433108256
AB  - This study explored segregation and sectarianism among children in integrated and non-integrated Northern Irish schools. Results revealed a substantial relationship between 2 types of intergroup contact--cross-group friendship and extended contact--and lower levels of prejudice. While cross-group friendships were associated with more positive intergroup relations via the mediating mechanisms of self-disclosure and empathy with the out-group, extended contact worked by eliciting positive perceived peer norms toward the out-group. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for intergroup relations among children in conflict societies.

T1  - Perceptions of Cable News Credibility
AN  - 1667949732; 201510531
AB  - By analyzing variability in credibility assessments of news outlets CNN and FOX, this study extends prior research focusing on perceptions of credibility for a single media source. Using national survey data from 2006 and 2008, we find that demographic and political characteristics help to explain different patterns of perceived credibility. Those detecting larger differences between CNN and FOX are more politically knowledgeable and hold more polarized political attitudes. Some findings coincide with research on overall news media trust. Yet other findings demonstrate the importance of considering different patterns. Liberal Democrats were more likely than conservative Republicans to find neither network particularly credible, for example. We also examine the connection between selective exposure and credibility. We find evidence that credibility perceptions for both networks mediate the relationship between political predispositions and cable news use. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Influence of News Media on Stereotypic Attitudes Toward Immigrants in a Political Campaign
AN  - 1650148007; 201503200
AB  - This study investigates media effects on stereotypic attitudes toward immigrants in a political campaign that dealt with the naturalization of immigrants. By combining a content analysis of the campaign coverage with a 2-wave panel survey, the study found that negative news portrayals of immigrants increased stereotypic attitudes in the public in the course of the campaign. Additionally, the frequent exposure to positive news portrayals of immigrants reduced the activation of negative outgroup attitudes. However, these findings are contingent on people's issue-specific knowledge. Only people with low to moderate knowledge were influenced by negative and positive news stories about immigrants in the campaign.

T1  - Team Arab: al-Jazeera and the flagging of everyday Arabism during the 2008 Beijing Olympics
AN  - 1125217185; 201240480
AB  - The linking of living rooms across state borders by al-Jazeera and other pan-Arab satellite television channels has prompted claims that a 'new Arabism' that undermines state nationalism is emerging. Until now, analysts have mostly focused on the 'hot' Arabism in the news coverage of politicised events such as the Israel-Palestine conflict. This article offers a new dimension by suggesting that as important to satellite television's construction and reproduction of Arab identity is the everyday discourse found in less overtly political programmes such as sport. To demonstrate this, it offers an analysis of al-Jazeera's coverage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics showing how the broadcasts address viewers as a common Arab audience who are simultaneously encouraged to be nationalistic towards their separate nation-states within a given 'Arab arena' of states with whom they should primarily compete. This suggests that new Arabism should in fact be considered a 'supranationalism', not a revived Arab nationalism as it simultaneously promotes Arab and state identities in tandem. Finally, it aims to expand our understanding of 'everyday nationalism' by adapting Michael Billig's theory and methodology of 'banal nationalism' in British newspapers to facilitate the study of sport on supranational Arab identity on satellite television.

T1  - Red State, Blue State, Flu State: Media Self-Selection and Partisan Gaps in Swine Flu Vaccinations
AN  - 1030869531; 201229708
AB  - This study assesses the relationship between political partisanship and attitudes and behavior with respect to the H1N1 virus (swine flu) crisis of 2009 in general, and the U.S. mass vaccination program in particular. I argue that even seemingly nonpartisan political issues like public health are increasingly characterized by partisan polarization in public attitudes and that such polarization is attributable, at least partly, to the breakdown of the information commons that characterized the U.S. mass media from roughly the 1950s until the early 1990s. In its place has arisen an increasingly fragmented and niche-oriented media marketplace in which individuals are better able to limit their information exposure to attitudes and opinions that reinforce, rather than challenge, their preexisting beliefs. I test my argument against a variety of data sources, including opinion surveys and state-level swine flu vaccination rate data. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The role of media in the process of socialization to American politics among international students
AN  - 902083175; 201122707
AB  - Mass media have been considered a powerful agent of political socialization, affecting political attitudes and behaviors of voters and non-voters. This study employed a survey of international students in the US to investigate the effects of print, television and online news on political socialization during the 2008 US presidential race. Results indicated that newspaper and television news use significantly predicted internal political efficacy and intentions to participate in American politics. Media 'nationality', motivation to apply for permanent residence and duration of stay in the US were explored for possible moderation of media effects on political socialization. The findings are discussed within the framework of media effects on political socialization in host and home countries. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary
AN  - 896195493; 201120578
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - CHINESE AMERICAN ATTITUDES TOWARD HOMELAND GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS: A Comparison among Immigrants from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong
AN  - 859435941
AB  - Much of the research attention, nevertheless, has been paid to immigrants from Europe and, only more recently, Latin America.  [...] in the massive voting-behavior literature, precious little has been written on political participation across national borders, especially that across the Pacific.5 A different observation may be made regarding the studying of the Chinese diaspora in the United States, where numerous publications document a long history of involvement in homeland political development and change.6 Still, much of the research on Chinese American transnational politics has been historical in focus and qualitative in methodological orientation and does not engage quantitative social science approaches in systematically analyzing the relationships between divergent origins and the political attitudes and behavior of the majority-immigrant population in contemporary times.7 This literature also pays little attention to the (secondary) migration from Taiwan and Hong Kong in the post-World War II era.

T1  - Articulated antipathies: Political influence on anti-immigrant attitudes
AN  - 1023027683; 201223634
AB  - This article examines how political factors influence anti-immigrant attitudes by focusing on political articulation performed by political parties active at the national level in 26 European countries. Multi-level analysis reveals a significant positive association between general party articulation and anti-immigrant attitudes. In particular, it seems to be when traditional right- or left-wing parties articulate that attitudes towards immigrants turn increasingly negative. Left-leaning individuals are particularly influenced when parties belonging to the political left raise these issues, which indicates that the ideological position of the individual functions as a mediating factor in this regard. The results contribute to a broader understanding of the role of political factors and underscore the importance of their inclusion in cross-national studies of anti-immigrant attitudes.

T1  - Voices of Convergence or Conflict? A Path Analysis Investigation of Selective Exposure to Political Websites
AN  - 1018356600; 201212550
AB  - This research used a path analysis model to explore the degree to which reliance on off-line and online media, off-line and online discussion of political issues, as well as political attitudes predict whether an individual will engage in selective exposure to political websites. The study also looked at selective avoidance of contradictory information on websites. The results indicate that respondents did indeed practice selective exposure when accessing information on political websites, especially among those who are politically active online and those who rely heavily on websites and blogs for political information. However, the results showed that selective avoidance did not occur, with those exhibiting increased political interest and online participation significantly less likely to avoid information that challenges their views.

T1  - An Integrative Model Linking Feedback Environment and Organizational Citizenship Behavior
AN  - 851540415
AB  - Past empirical evidence has suggested that a positive supervisor feedback environment may enhance employees' organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). In this study, we aim to extend previous research by proposing and testing an integrative model that examines the mediating processes underlying the relationship between supervisor feedback environment and employee OCB. Data were collected from 259 subordinate-supervisor dyads across a variety of organizations in Taiwan. We used structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. The results demonstrated that supervisor feedback environment influenced employees' OCB indirectly through (1) both positive affective-cognition and positive attitude (i.e., person-organization fit and organizational commitment), and (2) both negative affective-cognition and negative attitude (i.e., role stressors and job burnout). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - More than Ideology: Conservative-Liberal Identity and Receptivity to Political Cues
AN  - 746585241
AB  - To many commentators and social scientists, Americans' stances on political issues are to an important extent driven by an underlying conservative-liberal ideological dimension. Self-identification as conservative vs. liberal is regarded as a marker of this dimension. However, past research has not thoroughly distinguished between ideological identity (a self-categorization) and ideology (an integrated value system). This research evaluates the thesis that conservative-liberal identity functions as a readiness to adopt beliefs and attitudes about newly politicized issues that one is told are consistent with the socially prescribed meaning of conservatism-liberalism. In Study 1, conservative-liberal identity, measured in 2000, had an independent prospective effect on support for invading Iraq in 2002 and support for the Iraq war in 2004, controlling for substantive ideology, party identity, and demographics. In Study 2, conservative- and liberal-identifiers adopted stances on farm subsidy policy based on randomly varied cues indicating which ideological group supports which stance. This cue-based influence was mediated by adoption of attitude-supportive beliefs. Discussion addresses the joint impact of political discourse and identity-based social influence on the organization of political attitudes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Same Game, Different Rules? Gender Differences in Political Participation
AN  - 743061198; 201045993
AB  - We investigate gender gaps in political participation with 2004 ISSP data for 18 advanced Western democracies (N: 20,359) using linear and logistic regression models. Controlling for socio-economic characteristics and political attitudes reveals that women are more likely than men to have voted and engaged in 'private' activism, while men are more likely to have engaged in direct contact, collective types of actions and be (more active) members of political parties. Our analysis indicates that demographic and attitudinal characteristics influence participation differently among men and among women, as well as across types of participation. These results highlight the need to move toward a view of women engaging in differing types of participation and based on different characteristics. Adapted from the source document.
