T1  - Prosociality during COVID‐19: Globally focussed solidarity brings greater benefits than nationally focussed solidarity
AN  - 2620810531
AB  - Many charities are appealing for donations to address problems caused by the COVID‐19 crisis. Two survey studies (total N = 500) tested predictors of donation intentions of British participants to help those suffering from the crisis in Britain (ingroup donations) and overseas (outgroup donations). Perceptions of international, global common fate in our success in managing and overcoming the crisis was positively associated with prosocial intentions towards both national ingroup and outgroup targets. In contrast, a desire to ‘close ranks’ within the national ingroup in the face of the pandemic threat was associated with more prosocial intentions towards national ingroup targets only, but it was associated with fewer prosocial intentions towards outgroup targets. This suggests that a focus on global solidarity (in the form of global common fate and identification with all humans) has positive effects on helping both within and across group boundaries, whereas a focus on national solidarity (in the form of ‘closing ranks’ in the face of the pandemic threat) has positive effects on helping within the national group but negative effects on prosocial tendencies towards outgroup members. The effect of perceived global common fate on both ingroup and outgroup helping was mediated by identification with all of humanity. Findings are discussed in terms of practical implications for managing the COVID‐19 crisis.

T1  - Exposure to Analogous Harmdoing Increases Acknowledgment of Ingroup Transgressions in Intergroup Conflicts
AN  - 2458384302
AB  - A major barrier to the resolution of intergroup conflicts is the reluctance to acknowledge transgressions committed by one’s ingroup toward the outgroup. Existing research demonstrates that individuals are generally motivated to justify ingroup conduct and avoid experiencing guilt and shame about ingroup harmdoing. The current work explores the use of an analogy-based intervention to attenuate motivated reasoning in evaluations of ingroup harmdoing. Overall, across six studies, we find support for our hypothesis that considering a case of harmdoing in a removed context increases acknowledgment of an analogous case of ingroup harmdoing. We further explore why, and under what conditions, the analogy is effective in leading to increased acknowledgment of an ingroup transgression. We find that the effect of the analogy is mediated by the endorsement of moral principles specific to the domain of the transgression, suggesting that the mechanism involves a cognitive process of analogical reasoning.

T1  - Threat Enhances Aggressive Inclinations Among Devoted Actors Via Increase in Their Relative Physical Formidability
AN  - 2442589264
AB  - Devoted actors—those who share sacred values with a group with which they are fused—are particularly willing to self-sacrifice to defend their group or values when they are threatened. Here, we explore whether they are also prone to aggressive inclinations toward those who endanger their group or convictions. To that end, we examined the effect of threat and the two components of the devoted actor framework—identity fusion and sacred values—on aggressive inclinations. These inclinations were registered with a videogame that allowed participants to destroy ingroup and outgroup symbols. Two experiments indicated that devoted actors reacted to threats to their ingroup and value by increasing aggressive inclinations against the rival group. This effect was apparently mediated by the perceived physical strength of the ingroup versus foes. Results suggest that devoted actors might be more prone to self-sacrifice, but also to attack those who threaten their group or values.

T1  - “We believe, we feel, we act”: Testing the BIAS Map predictions during adolescence
AN  - 2334687032
AB  - The present study examined the relation between adolescents’ beliefs, emotions, and intentional behaviors toward two immigrant groups from the Spanish context: Moroccans and Ecuadorians. For this purpose, we tested the SCM/BIAS Map predictions considering the three‐dimensional perspective of stereotype content, which distinguishes between morality, sociability, and competence. Spanish adolescents (N = 231, Mage = 15.39, SD = 1.09) evaluated either Moroccans (n = 114, 55.3% girls) or Ecuadorians (n = 117, 59% girls) on the SCM/BIAS Map variables. Our results confirmed, for both groups, the validity of the three‐dimensional model of stereotype content and showed that adolescents differentiate between the two subdimensions of warmth and treat them as independent in intergroup evaluations. Furthermore, the mediating role of emotions in the stereotype content‐behavior link was also confirmed but only for the univalent emotions in both groups. Finally, only morality acted as a consistent predictor of adolescents active behavioral intentions. The higher perceived morality of the immigrants increased adolescents’ admiration toward them, which in turn led adolescents to manifest more active facilitation intentions. Likewise, the perceived morality of the immigrants negatively affected adolescents’ contempt toward them, which in turn decreased adolescent's active harm intentions toward Ecuadorians and Moroccans. These findings indicate that the perceived morality of the outgroup is the key aspect in order to simultaneously promote helping behavior and decrease harmful one toward immigrant groups during adolescence.

T1  - Ignorance of History and Perceptions of Racism: Another Look at the Marley Hypothesis
AN  - 2267365437
AB  - Why do White Americans perceive less racism than Black Americans? Two provocative studies on the Marley hypothesis suggest that White Americans are more ignorant of historical instances of racism than Black Americans and that ignorance of history mediates racial differences in perceptions of racism. We conducted two replications of the Marley hypothesis in a different institutional and regional context than prior studies. In contrast with prior findings, the difference between White and Black Americans knowledge of historical racism was not significant in either of our replications and was dramatically smaller than that obtained in prior studies. Thus, the present research failed to replicate the mediation effect found in prior studies. We discuss potential explanations for these discrepant findings (e.g., differences in institution and region) and call for additional research examining whether the Marley hypothesis is moderated by cultural contexts.

T1  - Infrahumanization and Socio-Structural Variables: The Role of Legitimacy, Ingroup Identification, and System Justification Beliefs
AN  - 2158402043
AB  - As there is a robust tendency to support system-legitimizing beliefs by appealing to stereotypes or ideologies, we examined the role played by the perception of the status quo in relation to the infrahumanization bias. We compared this bias in high versus low-status group members and tested the mediating role of system justification beliefs and ingroup identification. The results of a moderated-mediated regression model (N = 238) showed that the perception of legitimacy of one’s own status had differential effects on the infrahumanization bias: The perception of legitimacy was positively associated with the endorsement of system justification beliefs and negatively associated with ingroup identification among low-status group members, whereas the perception of legitimacy was positively associated with ingroup identification among high-status group members. In both groups, ingroup identification was positively correlated with the tendency to infrahumanize the outgroup, while the endorsement of system justification beliefs was linked to the infrahumanization among low-status group members only. The findings highlight that the Social Identity Theory and the System Justification Theory can be fruitfully combined to explain infrahumanization tendencies.

T1  - Beyond the irony of intergroup contact: The effects of contact and threat on political participation and support for political violence in Northern Ireland
AN  - 2002180660
AB  - Research has suggested that intergroup contact can ironically lead to a reduction in commitment to social change and that threat can play an important role in this process. In post-agreement societies, however, characterized more so by symbolic rather than material conflict, the role that intergroup contact and threat play in social action may be particularly complex. This article examines intergroup contact, intergroup threat, support for political violence, and political participation among a student sample (n = 152) of Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. Results show that contact is associated with lower symbolic and realistic threat for both groups and to lower levels of support for political violence but not to political participation. Symbolic threat mediated the association between contact and support for political violence and between contact and political participation for the Protestant majority group only. This suggests that contact may have a positive effect upon group relations but that this is dependent upon status and the social–political context.

T1  - Organised Cultural Encounters: Interculturality and Transformative Practices
AN  - 1961017987
AB  - The article introduces the special issue by presenting the concept of organised cultural encounters that are encounters organised to manage and/or transform problems perceived to originate in or include cultural differences. Inspired by Pratt's conceptualisation of the contact zone, a critical perspective on the particular historical and spatial context of any encounter and how this context frames and mediates what takes place during an encounter is applied. While the articles of the issue present different varieties of organised cultural encounters, it is argued that they are not only of the same kind because of our analytical framework, but also because they share various features. They are scripted events tied to the particular social arena with which the encounter is associated and thus shaped in important ways by the existing norms, discourses, roles and hierarchies that govern these arenas. Furthermore, they also share the idea that the transformative potential of the encounter is inherently risky, since their potentiality is tied in with unpredictability, while risk cannot be left out because it at the same time is a precondition for transformation. The articles of the issue illustrate how script and risk come up in a different way.

T1  - Shmaglena: Ethnic framework for problem mediating
AN  - 1928796140
AB  - The article describes traditional mediators (in Amharic, shmaglotz meaning "elders"; shmagaleh in the singular) who fill a range of roles within the community of Ethiopian immigrants in Israel, as well as a mediation process (shmaglena in Amharic). The present research is a constructivist-qualitative study. Thirteen respondents participated in the study, all of whom were exposed to the shmaglena process. The data were collected through semi-structured content interviews. The research elicited that the shmaglena function has undergone transformation and adaptation to the target nation's culture. It was also found that the shmaglotz constitute an informal authority whose roles resemble those of conflict resolvers in other cultures.

T1  - "The Madness of the Carnival": Representations of Latin America and the Caribbean in the U.S. Homophile Press
AN  - 1891114426
AB  - This essay examines representations of Latin America and the Caribbean in U.S. homophile periodicals from 1953 to 1964. The 120 items in ONE, Mattachine Review, and The Ladder that referenced this region depicted Latin America and the Caribbean as different from the United States in a number of ways, in particular as more sexually repressive or more sexually liberal. These representations typically conformed to the general homophile movement tendency to challenge U.S. anti-homosexual campaigns during the "Lavender Scare," while arguing for acceptance based on rights claims. The representations also were based on Cold War, colonial, racist, nationalist, and imperialist frameworks. The essay argues that although the magazines generally affirmed the dominant homophile discourses of respectability and domesticity, they also challenged these discourses by presenting Latin American and Caribbean cultures as gender-nonconforming and sexually promiscuous.

T1  - Identity, causality and social cohesion
AN  - 1884516109
AB  - According to the Identity Thesis, sharing an identity tends to promote social cohesion. The article focuses on two aspects of social cohesion, namely trust and solidarity. It distinguishes between different versions of the Identity Thesis that differ regarding the causal efficacy attributed to specific values and the sharing of values, and with respect to the value sets that may be fed into the thesis (relying on work in political theory on nationalism, liberalism and multiculturalism). Having established the existence of different versions of the thesis, four different accounts of why shared identities could be expected to promote social cohesion are considered and assessed.

T1  - Examining the Sources of Racial Bias in Potentially Capital Cases
AN  - 1851016631
AB  - While prior research has uncovered racial disparities in the administration of death sentences, little attention has been devoted to earlier stages in the capital punishment processes. To understand the locus of racial bias within death penalty institutions, this study examines the entry of homicide cases into Los Angeles County's criminal justice system during a 5-year period. This two-part analysis seeks to answer the following research questions: (1) Does victim/defendant race influence homicide clearance and death penalty charging decisions? and (2) if so, does the likelihood of clearance mediate the effect of victim race on death penalty charges? Logistic regressions indicate that cases involving Latino victims are less likely to be cleared. Moreover, cases with Black and Latino victims are less likely to be prosecuted with a death penalty-eligible charge. Racial disparities accumulate across these stages, with clearance patterns influencing subsequent death penalty charging decisions. Results underscore the cumulative nature of racial within criminal justice institutions. By linking police and prosecution outcomes, these findings also highlight the interrelationship between criminal justice agencies.

T1  - Scottish clan identities in America: symbolic or real?
AN  - 1827657796
AB  - This paper explores Herbert Gans's notion of symbolic ethnicity and his recent assertions that it is effectively at an end and little more than a label. We use research into Scottish-American clan associations to question this assertion and we seek to demonstrate that symbolic ethnicity appears to be alive and well within such diaspora organizations. The paper reports on a series of interviews conducted in 2014 with office bearers and members of clan associations and we use our findings to argue, along with other writers such as Steinberg that, when considering hyphenated ethnicity, it is important not to underestimate the power of the hyphen.

T1  - Hate Crimes in Post-9/11 Pennsylvania
AN  - 1817691665
AB  - Extant research suggests that police involvement with hate crimes and bias incidents may be affected by case- and community-level characteristics. Triggering events, such as the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 (9/11), or the recent heated debates concerning illegal immigration, may also mediate this relationship. The present study builds on prior research by replicating the work of Wilson and Ruback (2003), which explored whether historical events, case characteristics, and community demographics are significantly associated with police involvement and response to bias-motivated offenses. The goals of this study were twofold: (1) to determine if the level of police response to bias-motivated incidents changed significantly post-9/11 and (2) to determine the extent to which case- and community-level factors are associated with police involvement. The findings illustrate that a significant increase in police response to hate crimes and bias incidents occurred post-9/11, and that both case- and community-level characteristics affect police involvement.

T1  - Ethnicity and immunization coverage among schools in Israel
AN  - 1800231529
AB  - Objective. Recent years have seen a global trend of declining immunization rates of recommended vaccines that is more pronounced among school-age children. Ethnic disparities in child immunization rates have been reported in several countries. We investigated an effect of ethnicity on the vaccination rates of immunizations routinely administered within schools in Israel.
Design. Data were collected from the Ministry of Health database regarding immunization coverage for all registered Israeli schools (3736) in the years 2009-2011. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the association between school ethnicity and immunization coverage while controlling for school characteristics.
Results. The lowest immunization coverage was found in Bedouin schools (median values of 75.1%, 81.5% and 0% for the first, second and eighth grades, respectively) in 2011. During this year, vaccination coverage in the first and second grades in Jewish schools was 1.51 and 1.35 times higher, respectively, compared to Bedouin schools. In the years 2009 and 2010, no significant increase in risk for lower vaccination rate was observed in Bedouin schools, and children in Arab and Druze schools were more likely to have been vaccinated.
Conclusion. The lower vaccination refusal rate found in Bedouin schools supports the hypothesis that difficulties related to accessibility constitute the main problem rather than noncompliance with the recommended vaccination protocol for school-age children, featuring higher socio-economic status groups. Our study emphasizes the importance of identifying, beyond the national-level data, subpopulation groups at risk for non-vaccination. This knowledge is essential to administrative-level policy-makers for the allocation of resources and the planning of intervention programs.

T1  - Unpacking gender and racial/ethnic biases in the federal sentencing of drug offenders: A causal mediation approach
AN  - 1814123849
AB  - Recently scholars have noted a limitation with current sentencing research is that the distinct contributions of prosecutorial and judicial discretion to sentence length have not been quantified. The current study seeks to calculate the proportion of sentence length disparities across gender and race/ethnicity that can be attributed to prosecutorial-initiated departures and sentencing decisions. Using data on federal narcotics offenders, the current study employs recently developed causal mediation analytic methods to decompose the direct and indirect influences of gender and race/ethnicity on sentence length. Results indicate the decisions of judges and prosecutors contribute both to gender and racial/ethnic disparity in outcomes; however, judicial decisions are mainly responsible for gender disparities in sentence length whereas prosecutorial and judicial discretion contribute more equally to racial/ethnic disparities. Reducing extra-legal disparity requires evaluating decisions of actors at different decision points. Abatement of gender disparities necessitates a primary focus on judges, but some attention to prosecutorial decisions is still warranted. Addressing race/ethnic differences in sentence length requires focus on both the decisions prosecutors make in granting departures and the ultimate sentence that judges decide to levy against the defendant.

T1  - Race, ethnicity and German identity: a media analysis of the 2010 world cup men's national soccer team
AN  - 1807590907
AB  - Enjoying a surge of national pride, the German media celebrated the 2010 German World Cup team's success in South Africa. A dominant theme in this coverage was the 'immigration background' of 11 of the 23 players on the team and their claim to German identity despite their ethnic diversity. Amid debate over the changing nature of German citizenship, the national team's 'multicultural kickers' became the focal point for those who wished to re-frame German identity. This article examines German newspaper and magazine coverage of the national soccer team emphasizing the role that media played in constructing competing definitions of the German citizen and nation.

T1  - Kirkuk conflict in its ethnic/political media: the Turkmen newspaper Alqal'a as a model
AN  - 1798374801
AB  - This article explores the Kirkuk conflict through the Turkmens' newspaper Alqal'a. Using agenda-setting and framing/priming for theoretical background and qualitative content analysis as a method, two macro-themes, related to the conflict, are found to be fundamental therein. These two main themes are: (1) exclusion and (2) self-confirmation. The two macro-themes overarch several micro- or sub-themes and are closely related to each other. They are set to inform the readers about what to think and how to think about the conflict. While 'exclusion' constitutes the cause, 'self-confirmation' is the latter's effect.

T1  - Nationalist parties and immigration in Flanders: from Volksunie to Spirit and N-VA
AN  - 1792708674
AB  - This article contributes to the literature on the sub-state nationalist and regionalist parties (SNRPs) by investigating the policy positions in the immigration ambit taken by the Flemish nationalist party Volksunie, and by its successors after the party fell apart in 2001. We do so by analysing the party manifestos for all elections between 1978 and 2014. Beyond providing a detailed case study, the article has broader ambitions. The paper bridges the gap between the party literature and the literature on immigration and integration policies. It does so in two ways. First, it relies on a more nuanced categorisation of policy positions proposed by the immigration policy literature, which is absent in the party literature. Second, it draws explicit attention to the nation-building strategy of SNRPs as an intervening explanatory variable, mediating the influence of party competition and ideology.

T1  - Social integration of Australian Muslims: A dramaturgical perspective
AN  - 1798776750
AB  - This article presents a dramaturgical view of the social integration of minorities. Based on 30 interviews with prominent Australian Muslim leaders, we argue that they explain and approach the problem of social integration largely in presentational terms. As a corollary, their chief collective and political strategy towards social integration is to put forward alternative discourses to counter the dominant anti-Islam discourses. We use Goffman's (1959, 1963) dramaturgical model to analyse their strategies. In a striking difference from dominant narratives that situate Islamic values and western values as incompatible, the analysis we provide shows that Muslim leaders do not see Islamic teachings or texts as a problem for social integration; rather they view the problem as negative media representations and the solution as putting forward alternative images.

T1  - Brownface Minstrelsy: "José Jiménez," the Civil Rights Movement, and the legacy of racist comedy
AN  - 1790887647
AB  - This study examines US comedian Bill Dana, of Hungarian-Jewish descent, and his Latino minstrel character, "José Jiménez," during the civil rights period. By situating Dana and Jiménez within the social and political context of Latinos in the US during the 1960s, I argue Dana's comedy continued the tradition of racial ridicule at a time when blackface minstrelsy was increasingly unpopular: a result of contestation by African American civil rights groups. Analyzing primary sources (oral histories, news articles, and audio/visual media), I examine the initial popularity of José Jiménez in the early 1960s, the mechanisms used to ridicule Latinos, the role of media in constructing narratives of non-racism and acceptance by Latinos, and the resulting contestation of the character by Chicano/Latino media activists and civil rights organizations. I conclude that public racial ridicule of Latinos has not been constrained as some have suggested, but that it has changed since the civil rights era.

T1  - "I Dig You, Chocolate City": Ebony and Sepia Magazines' Coverage of Black Political Progress, 1971-1977
AN  - 1929868700
AB  - The 1960s ended in sorrow with the deaths of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, two champions for civil rights. Yet, African Americans had reason to enter the new decade with hope. African American political achievement brought attention to the triumph of the Civil Rights Movement and the power of the black vote. The present study explores African American media coverage of black political progress from 1971 to 1977. Though Ebony featured more political coverage than Sepia, both magazines reflected the magnitude of political change in the USA during the 1970s. Perhaps as a result of mass black mobilization during the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans formed a united front that enabled them to place blacks in political seats. Though black politicians faced many obstacles, media coverage showed that, as they approached the 1980s, blacks sat poised for steady progression, equipped to overcome any challenge they faced.

T1  - 'I second that emotion': a case for using imaginative sources in writing civil rights history
AN  - 1784144972
AB  - Imaginative sources are a rich archival store. Facts may be as slippery as the sources in which they are contained, but to limit the sources we use in building a civil rights historiography is to risk curtailing the reach and interdisciplinary scope of historical scholarship. We need to read imaginative and subjective sources as objects for the study, analysis and explanation of the Civil Rights Movement. In civil rights, as in other historical subjects, there is a privileging of an 'objective', detached approach to historiography in which 'the knower' is made distinct from what is known, and fact distinct from its imaginative representation. Monteith's essay argues that much can be gained by examining those sources in which the feeling of the movement is explored sensitively and intellectually-or even exploited. Organizers in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Freedom Summer volunteers chose to represent the movement in fiction, poetry and creative non-fiction, and found themselves represented in fiction films. Monteith argues that imagination and emotion should be more closely incorporated into civil rights history writing but attention needs to be paid to genre and style if generically unstable sources are not to be misread as unadorned fact.

T1  - Diffracted Diasporas: Trinidad's East Indians, Religio-Nationalism, and India's Independence
AN  - 1753038735
AB  - In August 1947, the euphoria generated by the creation of newly independent India and Pakistan was celebrated by peoples far removed from the Subcontinent, including among the descendants of Indian indentured laborers in the British island colony of Trinidad. Trinidad's East Indians reveled in the newfound freedom of their now-divided, overseas, ethnic compatriots. The masses of East Indians felt a surge of pride in the overthrow of colonial rule, evidenced by their attendance at parades, talks, and celebrations. In the months and weeks leading up to independence, East Indians debated the merits and disadvantages of partition. Some advocated firmly the idea of a unified ethnic "Indian" community in Trinidad, whereas others constructed clear boundaries between proponents of Pakistan versus India, thus fortifying tenuous and contingent divisions between Trinidad's Hindus and Muslims. This essay demonstrates that the culmination of Indian independence and partition exacerbated the diverging identities of Hindu and Muslim Trinidadians. I argue that Indian independence and the creation of Pakistan had global ramifications for the meaning of "Indian-ness" in the British colonies including Trinidad and elsewhere. East Indians' appeal to nationalism interrogates the construction of national and cultural identity spatially and temporally distant from the source, ultimately affirming the salience of a religio-national identity. Furthermore, the networks of communication established between Indians in places such as Trinidad, England, and the United States produced "diffracted" diasporic identities that were mediated through these interactions.

T1  - An Interdependence Approach to Relationship Maintenance in Interracial Marriage
AN  - 1748050437
AB  - This study investigated the extent to which positive and negative maintenance communication predicted marital satisfaction and commitment in a sample of 90 individuals in an interracial marriage. An interdependence theory approach was used. Participants completed an online survey using SurveyMonkey's audience request. Results of a regression equation indicate that four maintenance activities predicted 52% of the variance in satisfaction, with two being negative predictors (infidelity and avoidance) and two being positive predictors (conflict management and social networks). Three maintenance behaviors predicted commitment, with infidelity and giving advice being negative predictors and the use of social networks being a positive predictor. Finally, consistent with interdependence theory, marital satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between maintenance activity and commitment.

T1  - Acceptability of Sexually Explicit Images in HIV Prevention Messages Targeting Men Who Have Sex With Men
AN  - 1703589178
AB  - Sexually explicit media (SEM) have been used in HIV-prevention advertisements to engage men who have sex with men (MSM) and to communicate content. These advertisements exist within larger discourses, including a dominant heteronormative culture and a growing homonormative culture. Cognizant of these hegemonic cultures, this analysis examined the acceptable level of sexual explicitness in prevention advertisements. Seventy-nine MSM participated in 13 online focus groups, which were part of a larger study of SEM. Three macro themes-audience, location, and community representation-emerged from the analysis, as did the influence of homonormativity on the acceptability of SEM in HIV-prevention messages.

T1  - Clinicians' Perspective of the Relational Processes for Family and Individual Development During the Mediation of Religious and Sexual Identity Disclosure
AN  - 1667948747; 201509490
AB  - Although the psychological literature regarding gay men from religious families is continually expanding, it is also limited in that few studies focus on the use of therapy in the negotiation of the interrelated systems of religion, sexuality, and family. Utilizing a cultural historical activity theory-based process of analysis, this study focuses on the narratives of 12 clinicians discussing 230 conflicts and how those conflicts are mediated in both productive (e.g., seeking secular support) and unproductive ways (e.g., bringing one's son to an exorcist) by gay men and their religious families independent of and at the advice of their therapists.

T1  - Opposing Paths to Ideology: Group-Based Relative Deprivation Predicts Conservatism Through Warmth Toward Ingroup and Outgroup Members
AN  - 1700673432; 201525988
AB  - Group-based relative deprivation (GRD) is a critical predictor of support for social change. Because resistance to change and acceptance of inequality are core features of a conservative ideology, we predicted that GRD would negatively correlate with conservatism. Moreover, given the central role affect plays in bridging the association between experiences with inequality and group-based responses, we expected that this hypothesized relationship would be mediated by intergroup emotions. We tested these hypotheses in a large national sample of Maori (N = 685)-the indigenous peoples of New Zealand. As predicted, GRD was indirectly associated with conservatism through participants' warmth toward the majority outgroup (i.e., New Zealand Europeans) and the minority ingroup (i.e., Maori): whereas GRD was negatively correlated with warmth toward outgroup members, GRD was positively correlated with warmth toward the ingroup. In turn, warmth toward the (a) outgroup and (b) ingroup was positively and negatively associated with conservatism, respectively. Similar results were obtained when replacing conservatism with participants' (a) satisfaction with the government and (b) support for New Zealand's main center-right political party. Our findings demonstrate the complex relationship between GRD and political beliefs, while also highlighting the crucial role of emotions in connecting GRD with group-based attitudes.

T1  - Senegalese immigrant families' 'regroupement' in France and the im/possibility of reconstituting family across multiple temporalities and spatialities
AN  - 1722763406
AB  - This paper interrogates the structural conditions, macropolitics and governmentality of family 'regroupement' in France in an era of shifting immigration policies in Europe and the imaginative possibilities that Senegalese immigrants exercise to maintain family and kinship ties with those left behind. It argues that while the need to maintain ties from diasporic locations is mediated by policies, material and emotive transnational practices, the materiality of displacement as well as the state's politics of immigration render more elusive possibilities of maintaining family in situ. What tensions and creative strategies emerge? How is 'home', the primordial site of family structure, reimagined and reconstituted? Taking into account state's politics and immigrants' entrapment within multiple spheres of power and their active agency as determinants, this paper uncovers how displacement gives rise to multiple ruptures while simultaneously motivating a search for active agency to reconstruct and reimagine kinship, family and conjugality across multiple temporalities and spatialities.

T1  - Transnational families and the subjective well-being of migrant parents: Angolan and Nigerian parents in the Netherlands
AN  - 1722763372
AB  - Studies on transnational families argue that the subjective well-being of migrant parents is negatively affected by living separated from their children. Most studies employ qualitative methods without a control group and hence are not able to distinguish whether the effects found are associated with separation only or with other factors. This paper investigates the association between parental subjective well-being and parent-child separation by comparing migrant parents who have at least one child in their country of origin with those who live with all their children in the Netherlands. The paper further investigates whether the same associations are found between migrant groups from Angola and Nigeria. Results indicate that transnational parents indeed report lower subjective well-being, as measured by happiness, life satisfaction and mental health for both groups and additionally, self-assessed health for Angolans. However, legal status, socio-economic status and the quality of the parent-child relationship are found to be important mediators.

T1  - The Role of the Media in the Disparate Response to Gun Violence in America
AN  - 1700676307; 201525282
AB  - In December 2012, 20 elementary school children fell victim to gun violence. Shortly after the killings occurred, national media outlets instantaneously and simultaneously began covering the tragedy with 'calls to action' explicitly voiced by public officials and members of the general citizenry. Gun violence in African American communities has also left an indelible mark on the quality and quantity of life among the youngest members as well. Statistics released by federal law enforcement officials reveal that, collectively, more children of color die each year to gun violence. However, gun-related crimes involving low-income persons and racial and ethnic minorities are framed by the media as a convergence of cultural, environmental, and individual shortcomings and immorality. Consequently, structural and/or policy resolutions to address such crimes involving low-income persons and racial and ethnic minorities are overlooked or even omitted from the national and, more importantly, political discourse.

T1  - Cultural Racism-Related Stress in Black Caribbean Immigrants: Examining the Predictive Roles of Length of Residence and Racial Identity
AN  - 1718067854; 201530679
AB  - Scholars maintain that with greater length of residence, the U.S. context adversely affects Black immigrants (e.g., via racism-related stress). Yet, the psychological mechanisms that account for increases in racism-related stress over time are unclear. Racial identity scholarship provides reason to suspect Black immigrants' racial identities may partially explain these increases. In this study, Black Americans and Black Caribbean immigrants (N = 171) responded to measures of cultural racism-related stress and the 'identity' (importance of racial group membership to the self-concept) component of racial identity. We expected identity importance to (a) positively predict cultural racism-related stress for both populations and (b) mediate the association between length of residence and cultural racism-related stress in Black Caribbean immigrants. Although no significant mean difference in identity importance existed between groups, identity predicted cultural racism-related stress only in Black Americans. In Black Caribbean immigrants, identity was not a mediator, but length of residence positively predicted cultural racism-related stress. Differences in results across the two populations may indicate important distinctions in racial identity function between Black Caribbean immigrants and Black Americans.

T1  - The 'Immigrant Paradox' Phenomenon: Assessing Problem Behaviors and Risk Factors Among Immigrant and Native Adolescents
AN  - 1680154443; 201513914
AB  - We investigated the 'immigrant paradox' phenomenon by examining differences in problem behavior engagement and exposure to risk factors across four adolescent groups: 1,157 first-generation, 1,498 second-generation, and 3,316 White and minority third or higher generations. Latent mean differences in problem behavior engagement (i.e., academic failure, aggression, and substance use) and risk factors (i.e., low socioeconomic status, poor family relationship, and low sense of school belonging) were associated with significant differences across adolescent groups. Results supported the generational status effect by demonstrating sequentially greater adolescent problem behavior engagement. However, the difference in exposure to risk factors across adolescent groups only partially supported the immigrant paradox. Further, the multiple group analysis of the relationships between risk factors and engagement in problem behaviors showed increased susceptibility among second generation immigrants for substance use, White natives for academic failure and substance use, and minority natives for physical aggression. Study findings have implications for understanding how the immigrant paradox leads to different adjustment patterns and problem behavior manifestations among immigrant and native adolescents.

T1  - 'That's When the Neighborhood Went South': How Middle Class Blacks and Whites Police Racial Boundaries of Stigmatized Blackness
AN  - 1660021009; 201505570
AB  - Drawing on evidence from a case study of a racially transitioning suburb of Chicago, we argue that both blacks and whites discursively form, maintain, protect, and navigate contradictory class and racial identities. The interactions between race and class are complex, but how do these complexities manifest themselves? We contend that racial groups utilize discursive storytelling to maintain boundaries, and that this is one of the ways in which racial and class inequalities are created and preserved. Furthermore, we explore the interworking of race and class, focusing on how class location helps mediate self-proclaimed middle class blacks' and whites' discourse on stigmatized forms of blackness. We conclude with a discussion of the sociological implications of this boundary maintenance, focusing on the ways in which whites and blacks in the middle class utilize various forms of capital to preserve status and power.

T1  - Foreigners or multicultural citizens? Press media's construction of immigrants in South Korea
AN  - 1660024484; 201505747
AB  - This paper examines the ways in which new immigrants to South Korea are portrayed and constructed in press media. The influx of labour and marriage migrants from Southeast Asia and China to South Korea since the early 1990s has been significant enough to cause national concerns about diversity and the country's future as a multiethnic society. Mainstream newspapers in South Korea have been a major shaper of the public opinion of diverse groups of immigrants whose presence is becoming increasingly visible in this country with a strong self-image as a mono-ethnic nation. The ways in which these new immigrants, typically lower class, are constructed in public discourses expose the nexus of citizenship, class and ethnicity. Using articles from two major South Korean newspapers between 1990 and 2008 as data, the analysis highlights the economic and historical contexts in which public discourses on new immigrants have been formed and transformed.

T1  - Combatting antisemitism in the school playground: an Australian case study
AN  - 1660023721; 201505641
AB  - The aim of Gross and Rutland's paper is to analyse the problem of antisemitic bullying in contemporary Australian state schools by investigating the case of Jewish children in those schools. The study is interdisciplinary, drawing on historical data and educational methodology, and employs a qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews conducted in Sydney and Melbourne with all the major actors: students (55), teachers (10), principals (4), parents (13) and Jewish communal leaders (10). Gross and Rutland argue that classical anti-Jewish stereotypes are perpetuated in the school playground, transmitted by children from one generation to the next. This finding provides an additional perspective to the general literature, which argues that racial prejudice and stereotypes are acquired primarily through home socialization, religious institutions and the media, and neglects the role of the school playground.

T1  - On the Affective Force of 'Nasty Love'
AN  - 1551000689; 201429112
AB  - Tackling the mimetic logic of sex-gender that limits the transsexual subject's sexuality into seeming a poor representation, the author argues that trans pornography and autoethnographic accounts from trans scholars emphasize the affective dimension of trans sex, a material remainder absent from mimetic theories of sexuality. Developing concepts from Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, in tandem with Morty Diamond's film Trans Entities: The Nasty Love of Papi and Wil (2007) and a selection of trans theorists, this article elaborates on the horizon of affective potential opened by transgender, brown, kinky, and pornographic 'nastiness.' The event of 'nasty love' solicits a differential becoming, growing the edge of self. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When do victim group members feel a moral obligation to help suffering others?
AN  - 1551002265; 201428866
AB  - In four experiments, we assessed when the salience of ingroup historical victimization will encourage a sense of moral obligation to reduce the suffering of others. Historically victimized groups (Jews and women; Experiments 1 and 3) who considered the lessons of the past for their ingroup felt heightened moral obligation to help other non-adversary victimized groups. However, when the suffering outgroup was an adversary, Jews (Experiment 2) and women (Experiment 4) who focused on the lesson of historical victimization for their ingroup reported lower moral obligation to reduce others' suffering. The lesson focus effect on moral obligation was mediated by benefit finding as well as perceived similarity to the outgroup. Means to facilitate moral obligation, as well as limiting factors, among victimized group members are discussed. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Fans, Racism and British Football in the Twenty-First Century: The Existence of a 'Colour-Blind' Ideology
AN  - 1531931192; 201423254
AB  - This article draws on 2500 responses from association football (soccer) fans to an anonymous online survey examining the extent of racism in British football. The overall findings are that half of all fans are still witnessing or experiencing some form of racism. Despite the creation of anti-racist initiatives, such as Kick It Out, and a reduction in overt chanting, there exists a 'colour-blind' ideology amongst the game's governing bodies and anti-racist organisations, as the extent of the problem is largely being ignored. Fans call for a long-term focus on anti-racism based on engagement and education within a greater range of social settings and, short-term, the implementation of more severe punishments by the game's governing bodies to eliminate racist behaviour amongst fans, players and clubs. For current and ex-players who continue to receive racial abuse through social media sites like Twitter, fans urge them to report it and place these matters in the hands of the police.

T1  - Playing Violent Video Games Increases Intergroup Bias
AN  - 1934527390
AB  - Previous research has shown how, why, and for whom violent video game play is related to aggression and aggression-related variables. In contrast, less is known about whether some individuals are more likely than others to be the target of increased aggression after violent video game play. The present research examined the idea that the effects of violent video game play are stronger when the target is a member of an outgroup rather than an ingroup. In fact, a correlational study revealed that violent video game exposure was positively related to ethnocentrism. This relation remained significant when controlling for trait aggression. Providing causal evidence, an experimental study showed that playing a violent video game increased aggressive behavior, and that this effect was more pronounced when the target was an outgroup rather than an ingroup member. Possible mediating mechanisms are discussed.

T1  - Biases in News Media as Reflected by Personal Pronouns in Evaluative Contexts
AN  - 1650147445; 201502084
AB  - This paper examines whether pronouns in news media occurred in evaluative contexts reflecting psychological biases. Contexts of pronouns were measured by computerized semantic analysis. Results showed that self-inclusive personal pronouns (We, I) occurred in more positive contexts than self-exclusive pronouns (He/She, They), reflecting self- and group-serving biases. Contexts of collective versus individual pronouns varied; We occurred in more positive contexts than I, and He/She in more positive contexts than They. The enhancement of collective relative to individual self-inclusive pronouns may reflect that media news is a public rather than private domain. The reversed pattern among self-exclusive pronouns corroborates suggestions that outgroup derogation is most pronounced at the category level. Implications for research on language and social psychology are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Regulating Inclusion: Spatial Form, Social Process, and the Normalization of Cycling Practice in the USA
AN  - 1520341423; 201413502
AB  - In recent years, bicycle infrastructure has been emerged as a valued part of urban development policy in many American cities, and a process that depends on the normalization of cycling practice in three respects. First, the various 'less confrontational' mutations of Critical Mass have redefined the politics of cycling in cultural and consumerist terms. Second, this 'bike culture' is mediated through Internet networks that generate concepts of proper cycling practice. Third, both spatial models and standards of 'correct' ridership circulate through these networks, linking 'bike culture' to institutional networks of implementation. While positive from the standpoint of increased ridership, this may reinscribe the exclusions that are constitutive of the contemporary American city and may limit cycling's egalitarian potential.

T1  - The Attachments of New York City Caribbean Indian Immigrants to Indian Culture, Indian Immigrants and India
AN  - 1512219162; 201408854
AB  - The primary objective of this paper is to examine Caribbean Indian immigrants' cultural, social and psychological attachments to Indian immigrants in New York City and to India through the perspective of the 'proximal host'. The major findings, based on the results of census and survey data, show that respondents have almost completely lost the Indian language, but have moderately preserved Indian popular culture such as music, Hindu religious practices and English-language Indian media. Moreover, few maintain close ties with Indian or other South Asian immigrants, preserving strong ties mainly with other Caribbean Indian immigrants. In addition, the findings indicate that they have little psychological attachment to India or Indian immigrants. A majority identify with their Caribbean country of origin, with fewer than 20 per cent identifying as Caribbean Indian. Moreover, the vast majority would cheer for their Caribbean national-origin team rather than the Indian team in a hypothetical cricket match between the two. The secondary objective-to analyse the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of Caribbean Indian immigrants in New York City-makes an important contribution to the literature by providing solid statistical data on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics and ethnic attachment. It also significantly contributes to studies of 'twice-migrant' groups' attachments to their proximal hosts-a very important but neglected topic-by showing how to measure three components of ethnic attachment using multiple indicators.

T1  - 'Shame on you': The language, practice and consequences of shame and shaming in asylum seeker advocacy
AN  - 1504423683; 201406692
AB  - The struggle to change negative responses to asylum seekers is becoming more difficult due to global economic insecurity and increasing numbers of people seeking asylum. Effective and persuasive advocacy and activism to shift these opinions and create better outcomes for asylum seekers are critical. As for all social movements, how advocates engage the wider public, particularly those opposed to asylum seeking, is key to gaining support for this project. In this article, I use discourse analysis as a method for identifying both current activist discourses and rhetorical strategies, and how these shape the responses of the opposition. Using letters to the editor, online comments and media articles from a 2010-2011 Australian debate on the relocation of asylum seekers to a small South Australian town, I explore a particular strategy for change used in asylum seeker advocacy: eliciting shame. I identify two ways that shaming is 'done' -- through expressions of contempt and disgust, and through a comparison of privilege and oppression. However, the analysis of the responses to this shaming demonstrates that, rather than provoking the hoped-for change, shaming actually elicits its opposite: flight or fight responses of denial, avoidance and escalating conflict.

AB  - Existing studies on media representation of elections in Nigeria do not pay adequate attention to a critical linguistic perspective on language used in reporting electoral matters. Given the fact that ideologies are crucial in elections, this study investigates the ways that cover stories in two Nigerian news magazines, TELL and The News, express the ideological pursuits of social actors in the 2003 and 2007 general elections in Nigeria. The discourse patterns that expressed ideological pursuits in the reports were generally non-neutral. The discourse of the stories indicated an attempt to shape the perspective of readers in elections; the magazines held the view that they are responsible for the social orientation of the electorates. Ideologies are expressed, acquired, confirmed, changed and perpetuated through discourse. They are generally reproduced in the social practices of their members. Both TELL and The News magazines put to use the ideological polarization between the ideological structures of ingroups and outgroups, such that ingroups typically emphasize their own good deeds while they de-emphasise their bad deeds; on the other hand, outgroups de-emphasise or even totally deny their own bad deeds while they emphasise their good ones.

T1  - 'Honk Against Homophobia': Rethinking Relations Between Media and Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1504423546; 201405549
AB  - The theory of 'symbolic annihilation' or 'symbolic violence' has been used in academic literature to describe the way in which sexual minorities have been ignored, trivialized, or condemned by the media. This article aims to de-center research from issues of media representation to consider the capacity for minority groups to proactively use new media and its various avenues for interactivity, social networking, and feedback to fight social exclusion. This work suggests that new media has become a space in which the nominally marginal in society may acquire 'social artillery'-a term used to describe how sexual minorities utilize their expanding and more readily accessible social connections in digital space to combat instances of homophobia. The research draws on the results of an inquiry into the relation between media and a regional youth social justice group in Australia tackling homophobia. The research demonstrates that the group is becoming increasingly adept and comfortable with using a cross-section of media platforms to fulfill their own objectives, rather than seeing themselves as passive subjects of media representation. This article argues that this sets an example for other socially excluded groups looking to renegotiate their relation with the media in regional areas. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Doing the right thing': transracial adoption in the USA
AN  - 1463011956; 201345751
AB  - Racial/cultural identity and parental cultural competence in transracial adoption (TRA) are subjects of fierce debate and discussion in contemporary western societies. The ongoing practice of TRA has led to a polarization that either supports or berates the suitability of the environment provided in such homes. The external scrutiny invariably creates doubt among white adoptive parents as to whether they are 'doing the right thing'. By drawing upon extant literature and original qualitative research carried out in New York, this paper explores adoptive mothers' conceptualization and understanding of racial/ethnic socialisation (RES). The paper puts forward three discursive approaches. It is argued that the ways in which white adoptive mothers understand and experience diversity influences their approach to RES, which in turn is mediated through family and community networks and societal discourses on race, power and hierarchy.

T1  - When white people report racial discrimination: The role of region, religion, and politics
AN  - 1429630075; 201335789
AB  - Scholarly interest in the correlates and consequences of perceived discrimination has grown exponentially in recent years, yet, despite increased legal and media attention to claims of 'anti-white bias,' empirical studies predicting reports of racial discrimination by white Americans remain limited. Using data from the 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, we find that evangelical Protestantism increases the odds that whites will report experiencing racial discrimination, even after controlling for racial context and an array of social and psychological characteristics. However, this effect is limited to the South. Outside the South, political affiliation trumps religion, yielding distinct regional profiles of discrimination reporters. These findings suggest that institutions may function as regional 'carriers' for whites inclined to report racial discrimination. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - A Longitudinal Study of Predictors of Suicide Attempts Among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth
AN  - 1438557884; 201340254
AB  - This short-term prospective study examined general and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-specific risk and protective factors for suicide attempts in an ethnically diverse sample of LGBT youth (N = 237, 47.7 % male). A structured psychiatric interview assessed clinical depression and conduct disorder symptoms, as well as past and prospective suicide attempts over a 1-year follow-up period (91 % retention). Participants completed questionnaires measuring general risk factors for suicide attempts, including hopelessness, impulsiveness, and perceived social support. They also completed measures of LGBT-specific suicide risk factors, including gender nonconformity, age of first same-sex attraction, and LGBT victimization. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine the relations between predictors and suicide attempt, and to identify mediators. Of nine variables examined, seven were related to lifetime history of attempted suicide: hopelessness, depression symptoms, conduct disorder symptoms, impulsivity, victimization, age of first same-sex attraction, and low family support. Depressive symptoms and hopelessness mediated the relation between multiple risk and resilience factors and suicide attempts. Suicide attempt history was the strongest predictor of prospective suicide attempts. Participants who previously attempted suicide (31.6 % of the sample) had more than 10 times greater odds of making another attempt in the 1-year follow-up period than were those who had made no previous attempt. These results highlight the need for suicide prevention programs for LGBT youth and suggest the importance of addressing depression and hopelessness as proximal determinants and family support and victimization, which have more distal effects.

T1  - Yellow peril consumerism: China, North America, and an era of global trade
AN  - 1364704718; 201323422
AB  - This paper explores a parallel between the 'yellow peril' imagery of pollution and danger used to characterize China historically and that found in contemporary media accounts representing Chinese-made consumer goods in the USA. A survey of newspaper reporting on two key events involving Chinese imports (pet food and toys) reveals that in both eras, cases of 'yellow peril' involve narratives of domesticity threatened by potentially contaminating contact with an essentialized China. The paper demonstrates how the global movement of goods serves as a powerful bearer of racializing categories in the terrain of American consumerism and domesticity. Media narratives about consumer welfare and the threatened American consumer provide the moral anchor for a larger story about US national interest and 'proper' capitalism in the context of China's 'rise'.

T1  - Internal media, conceptual metaphors and minority cultural identities
AN  - 1448998063; 201342970
AB  - In recent times we have witnessed a growth in the number of groups who are calling for cultural recognition on the basis of a putative discrete ethnicity. In this article we examine one such group, the 'Ulster-Scots' in Northern Ireland. We examine how this group metaphorically conceptualize their identity within their internal press media output, specifically the monthly publication The Ulster-Scot. Drawing on the conceptual metaphor approach of Lakoff and Johnson, which argues that metaphors are central to how we define and understand our everyday world, we examine the discursive construction of an Ulster-Scots collective identity and history through an analysis of the metaphors employed. We argue that a focus on the use of conceptual metaphors within discourses of ethnicity provides a valuable insight into ethnic self-understanding at a given point in time, and that, consequently, this approach is a valuable addition to the analytic repertoire for researchers concerned with issues of emergent ethnicity and the construction ethnic identities in general.

T1  - British Muslims, British soldiers: Cultural citizenship in the new imperialism
AN  - 1448996502; 201342917
AB  - The discursive positioning of Muslims as a 'security threat' or 'enemy within', in government policies and the media, has cast young Muslim men in particular as criminalized anti-citizens. Meanwhile, since the inception of the Afghanistan campaign, the soldier has become increasingly prominent as a figure of militarized citizenship in the public sphere. This article juxtaposes accounts from Pakistani Muslim youth in the West Midlands with those of soldiers and family members involved with the Hero Net online community, attending to the notion of cultural citizenship -- namely, the everyday subjective experience of national belonging beyond its legal-political aspects. Our research suggests that, for both groups, mindful critique or dissent are central to the process through which individuals are brought into being in relation to the nation-state. However, we demonstrate that formations of cultural citizenship in Britain continue to be informed by the logics of race and orientalism. The article offers insights into how gendered and racialized formations of citizenship conjoin with imperialism and militarization.

T1  - Rebordering France and Denmark Narratives and Practices of Border-Construction in Two European Countries
AN  - 1417520438; 201332057
AB  - This article examines the continued significance of borders and boundary constructions in the allegedly 'borderless Europe'. It analyses the events in 2011 that led to the temporary closure of borders in France and in Denmark, and aims to show how some European nation-states attempted to reclaim their power of border control by tweaking the Schengen agreement. We argue that these events are not only examples of how countries manage the inflow and outflow of people. By closing or restricting their physical borders, both countries were also trying to reinstate narrative identity boundaries around the French and the Danish people. We advocate that physical borders find legitimacy in boundaries, i.e. narratives that conceptually separate groups and territories, and illustrate this through an analysis of local media in the countries involved.

Responses to the 2009 Tamil diaspora protests in Canada provide a unique case study to examine a contemporary moment of resistance, when race thinking and spatiality intersected within and beyond national borders. Using critical theories of representation, I conceptualize Canadian print media coverage of the protests as representations of a 'strange encounter' with the other. I explore the media's production of the other and its conflation of the Tamil protester-terrorist through constructions of space. I also examine how scale operates through underlying national values to conceptualize a precarious structure of belonging. Through these discursive moves, I demonstrate how the resulting figure of the 'other,' the 'outlaw,' and the 'outsider' came to represent and delegitimize the racialized/ spatialized Tamil protest(er).

T1  - GENDERED VIOLENCE, CULTURAL OTHERNESS, AND HONOUR CRIMES IN CANADIAN NATIONAL LOGICS
AN  - 1748864979; 201600267
AB  - Honour-based violence, and the honour crime in particular, have assumed a central place in Canadian national discourse and consciousness. Understood within mainstream Canadian discourses as a uniquely dangerous form of violence, the honour crime has been linked to recent waves of migration and culturally specific notions of honour. Imagined as a foreign and imported phenomenon brought to Canada by immigrants who fail to assimilate to national and 'western' ideals of gender equality, the crime is also viewed as an extreme form of violence that must be managed and ultimately expelled. Discourses surrounding file honour crime now inform various key social, racial, and cultural debates across national and transnational scales. By analyzing the discursive strategies used to construct and disseminate dominant discourses on honour killings, this article maps the heightened official state and public media interest in honour-based violence and crimes.

AN  - 1531932626; 201423221
AB  - The Jewish question occupied an important place among the problems that faced the Soviet Government in its early years. The need to resolve it was all the more pressing because of the social and economic plight of the Jewish population by the time of the end of the Civil War in the areas they inhabited. The party and Soviet leadership were also seriously concerned about the widespread popular perception of Soviet power as Jewish power. All the propaganda media, including speeches of state leaders from the highest rostrums, were pressed into service to dispel these sentiments. Finally, a successful solution of the eternal Jewish question was to demonstrate to the whole world the advantage of the Soviet system. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Securitization of Migration in Greece: Process, Motives, and Implications
AN  - 1315600968; 201307600
AB  - The field of security is largely controlled by elites who, by virtue of their authority, are able to create an image of an enemy which is largely independent of the objective significance of a threat. However, a narrow focus on speech acts and discourse analysis to study such processes of securitization is inherently inadequate. This article provides a panoramic account of Greek migration politics during the 1990s. It shows that securitization can be discursive or nondiscursive, pre-mediated or subconscious, and beneficial or detrimental for securitizing actors. Elite interviews and an in-depth analysis of contextual factors help make sense of these dynamics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Violence and trauma as constitutive elements in Korean American racial identity formation: the 1992 L.A. riots/insurrection/saigu
AN  - 1373428357; 201328642
AB  - This paper proposes a new understanding of race as an artifact constructed from racist violence and the trauma it engenders. The paper applies Jeffrey Alexander's concept of 'cultural trauma', i.e. when 'members of a collectivity feel they have been subjected to a horrendous event that leaves indelible marks on their group consciousness', to the case of Korean immigrant merchants who were victims of violence during the 1992 L.A. riots/insurrection/saigu in Los Angeles, California, following the acquittal of four white police officers charged with violently assaulting a black motorist. Though the violence was contained to distinct neighbourhoods, the larger society experienced the terror because of the mass media. Over time this media-event led to the construction of a new identity rooted in violence and trauma. Through an examination of various texts, this paper argues that the Korean-American collective consciousness shifted discursively from an identity rooted in nationality to one incorporating race.

T1  - Migration and Diaspora in the Age of Information and Communication Technologies
AN  - 1347781007; 201318851
AB  - 'Migration and the Internet: Social Networking and Diasporas' is an interdisciplinary collection that explores new emerging media and technological networks-developed by individual and family migrants-which help to construct transnational and diasporic communities. Despite the fact that there is an increasing interest in 'migration' and in 'information and communication technology' studies, this Special Issue of JEMS goes beyond mere description of the use and impact of the technology on human mobility. It provides an in-depth analysis of a wide range of dispersed populations-including Albanians, Arabs, Basques, Croatians, Han, Hindus, Kurds, Romanians, Turks, Salvadorans, Serbians and Sikhs-and their interactions with globe-spanning instruments of information and communication. The issue brings together some of the leading specialists at the crossroads of migration and emerging technologies. The collection presents empirical and theoretical essays from the social, political and behavioural sciences, while discussing the latest Internet-based research methodologies applied to migration studies.

T1  - Browning the Dark Princess: Asian Indian Embodiment of "New Negro Womanhood"
AN  - 1266143914; 201300379
AB  - Situating its analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois' Dark Princess within the era's complex renegotiation of ideas surrounding raced, classed, and gendered identities, this study is directly concerned with the role of color or complexion in mediating familiar and unfamiliar constructions of raced womanhood in 1920s America. It considers the meanings of brownness by studying its particular role in complicating Harlem Renaissance representations of New Negro Womanhood. In assessing the dark princess's embodiment of characteristics commonly emblematic of New Negro Womanhood, this study explores the ways that, in writing his character as a brown woman, Du Bois simultaneously reinscribed and, at times, challenged rigid class and color-based parameters that helped define the era's gendered notions of race womanhood.

T1  - The Framing of Islam and Muslims in the Tenth Anniversary Coverage of 9/11: Implications for Reconciliation and Moving On
AN  - 1550998909; 201429084
AB  - This article analyses Australian television news programmes' framing of the tenth anniversary of the events of 9/11. Our findings build on and reaffirm the earlier work we did in this area-showing that television news programmes in Australia have moved away from conflating terrorism with Muslims and Islam. We found that the tenth anniversary coverage was presented with the frames of 'reconciliation' and 'moving on' from 9/11. The dominant frame used by Australian television news was based on the US-Australia relations, including a shared worldview, common experiences of lives lost in the attacks and a unified response in the context of the 'war on terror'. Notably absent from the coverage was the attribution of references to bridge-building with Muslim minority communities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Over There"
AN  - 1322726294; 201310843
AB  - In Vietnam, international remittances from the diaspora are a significant input into the national economy. Yet beyond capital transfer, remittance economies are also key social nodes offering insight into the extension of imaginations, expectations, and desires that accompany them. This article examines the role of gifting remittances in reestablishing, maintaining, and straining kinship networks disrupted by refugee exile, and catalyzing shifting aspirations and mobile horizons. Drawing on fieldwork from Vietnam's southern and central coast regions, this essay interrogates the anthropological question of the mediatory role of gifts in social exchange relations. It argues that the long-distance nature of remittance exchanges in the contemporary global political economy juxtaposes the mobility and exchangeable value of money and its senders against the experiences of local bodies confined within the nation state. This contradiction reveals a liminal space for emergent social imaginaries in which the characteristics of the gifting medium itself come to partially affect and embody the relationships between and identities among givers and receivers. Such imaginaries draw awareness to spatial and ontological margins, borders, and horizons associated with migratory and financial flows and opportunities and are displaced into diverse sociocultural forms reflecting phenomenological degrees of aspiration, realization, and frustration. .

T1  - It Is Not Always Black and White: An Examination of Black and Latino Intergroup Violence
AN  - 1266143470; 201300340
AB  - Criminological research has consistently found evidence that residential instability leads to increases in violent crime, but little research assesses whether a specific type of residential turnover-racial and ethnic succession-impacts who is involved in the violent crime event. The purpose of this study is to investigate the consequences of Black to Latino transition in a disadvantaged area of Los Angeles and, importantly, to examine the impact of racial change on intragroup and intergroup youth violence. The author utilizes structural equation modeling to estimate a series of four simultaneous equations testing the rates of Black on Black, Black on Latino, Latino on Latino, and Latino on Black-aggravated assaults and robberies between 2000 and 2006. Since many theories of intergroup violence cite the economic differential between groups as a motivating factor, the author incorporates the ratio of Black to Latino median household income as a predicative factor. The author finds some evidence that racial/ethnic change leads to increased violence, but only for within-group robberies, and that racial/ethnic change is not a significant predictor of intergroup violence. Contrary to theoretical expectation, income inequality is not a significant predictor of changes in intergroup violence. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The role of personal values and basic traits in perceptions of the consequences of immigration: A three-nation study
AN  - 1125225122; 201240525
AB  - Using data from Italy, Spain, and Germany (N= 1,569), this study investigated the role of basic values (universalism and security) and basic traits (openness and agreeableness) in predicting perceptions of the consequences of immigration. In line with Schwartz's (1992) theory, we conceptualized security as having two distinct components, one concerned with safety of the self (personal security) and the other with harmony and stability of larger groups and of society (group security). Structural equation modelling revealed that universalism values underlie perceptions that immigration has positive consequences and group security values underlie perceptions that it has negative consequences. Personal security makes no unique, additional contribution. Multi-group analyses revealed that these associations are invariant across the three countries except for a stronger link between universalism and perceptions of the consequences of immigration in Spain. To examine whether values mediate relations of traits to perceptions of immigration, we used the five-factor model. Findings supported a full mediation model. Individuals' traits of openness and agreeableness explained significant variance in security and universalism values. Basic values, in turn, explained perceptions of the consequences of immigration.

T1  - Bitter Reproach or Sweet Revenge: Cultural Differences in Response to Racism
AN  - 1037878966; 201231113
AB  - Culture has been shown to influence response styles. The authors conducted two studies to test the notion that African Americans would be more likely to respond to racism directly, whereas Asian Americans would be more likely to respond indirectly and therefore more subtly. Study 1 showed that Black women subjected to a racist comment from a confederate during an online interaction were more likely than Asian women to verbally reproach the perpetrator. These group differences were not present when the outcome measure was indirect responding-administration of good/bad jellybeans. Study 2 used an online format to demonstrate that Asian women were more likely than Black women to say they would not respond directly to a racist comment. This group difference in unwillingness to confront was significantly mediated by a goal of maintaining peace with their interaction partner. Implications of these findings for the study of discrimination, coping, and well-being are discussed.

T1  - Ethnic concentration in the neighbourhood and majority and minority language: A study of first and second-generation immigrants
AN  - 1429630099; 201335858
AB  - Ethnic residential concentration is often found to hamper immigrants' majority language proficiency. However, there are still several gaps in our understanding of the relationship between ethnic concentration and ethnic minorities' language practices. This study examines the extent to which ethnic concentration also constrains immigrants' majority language use, whether contact with natives and co-ethnics mediates these relationships, and whether ethnic concentration relates to second-generation minorities' minority language proficiency. Structural equation models on data for people of Turkish and Moroccan origin living in the Netherlands (N = 2163) showed that ethnic concentration is indirectly related to weaker majority language proficiency and less majority language use through contact with natives and co-ethnics. For second-generation minorities, ethnic concentration is related to better minority language proficiency. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - "We are Purified by Fire": The Complexification of Motherhood in the Context of Migration
AN  - 1364700401; 201323496
AB  - The paper examines the relationship between migration, the reconstruction of motherhood as identity and the transnational mothering role. The complexification of the mothering role in a transnational context is unpacked within a phenomenological approach. An in-depth thematic case study analysis of selected Zimbabwean women who had migrated to Port Elizabeth, South Africa, found that migration has implications for the ongoing identity development and relationship dynamics within the transnational family structure and further impacts on the women's perceptions of their social identity. This identity is mediated by a 'double-othering' as a consequence of the rejection of both the host community and her fellow Zimbabwean migrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Neighborhood Factors and Language Outcomes of First Nations Preschoolers Living Off Reserve: Findings from the Aboriginal Children's Survey
AN  - 1347784568; 201318730
AB  - Language skills in the preschool period are an important indicator of early development and school readiness for children. However, little is known about the association between aspects of the neighborhood and language outcomes for First Nations children. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of neighborhood structural and organization features, as well as the mediation of these effects, on the language outcomes of First Nations children aged 2-5 living off reserve. Data from the Aboriginal Children's Survey was examined. Both neighborhood structure and neighborhood organization were important for language outcomes. In addition, mediation effects were shown, suggesting that family-level as well as neighborhood structural variables are particularly important for the language outcomes of young First Nation children living off reserve.

T1  - Housed Gypsies and Travellers in the UK: work, exclusion and adaptation
AN  - 1010632193; 201210604
AB  - Gypsies and Travellers are one of the most excluded black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in the UK across numerous domains. Despite the increased policy focus on levels of unemployment and economic inactivity among BME groups in recent years, little attention has been paid to the economic position of Gypsies and Travellers, not least because there is a lack of systematic data on the employment status and working patterns of these communities. Few of the programmes set up to tackle unemployment specifically target this population and, anecdotally, a mismatch exists in relation to mainstream back-to-work programmes and community needs. This article considers a series of related studies that explore the accommodation histories and adaptive strategies utilised by housed Gypsies and Travellers across four locations in southern England. One strand of these studies is concerned with employment opportunities and practices following the transition into housing. We draw on these findings to discuss the role of cultural adaptations in mediating the wider socioeconomic context and how recourse to collective responses helps to shape economic and labour market outcomes for members of this group.

T1  - Can African Americans Win High-Profile Statewide Offices in the South? A Study in Southern Inhospitality
AN  - 1364700124; 201323442
AB  - Using quantitative methods, this article seeks to explore the electoral fortunes of black high-profile statewide candidates in the South. In doing so, we examine both the correlation between vote support for black candidates across counties, as well as the relationship between voter support and the influence of candidate characteristics, such as political apprenticeship, party support, money, incumbency, and media endorsement on electoral support. Although we find that there is a core of white voters who will vote against a black gubernatorial or US Senatorial candidate no matter the circumstance, several unexpected and interesting developments emerge that have profound consequences for the election of future Southern black high-profile statewide hopefuls.

T1  - The Yellow Press: Asian American Radicalism and Conflict in Gidra
AN  - 907925527; 201124722
AB  - This article analyzes the highly politicized Asian American newspaper Gidra as a way of expanding our conception of ethnic media beyond mainstream publications to include radical ethnic media. In contrast to the notion that ethnic communities might shy from exposing the internal conflicts that jeopardize their own community's stability, Gidra demonstrates three different kinds of conflict: external conflict, internal conflict, and conflict that is produced by the paper itself. Through this exploration, the different ways that Asian American identities were created and discussed during the late 1960s and early 1970s are also assessed, as the radical contingent of the Asian American Movement used print publications to redefine what it meant to be Asian in America.

T1  - Pretending to Be "Postracial": The Spectacularization of Race in Reality TV's Survivor
AN  - 907924300; 201124659
AB  - While race is usually an implicit discourse in reality television, making it an explicit discourse seems to have little effect on challenging the prevailing representations of race in prime-time television. This research demonstrates how Survivor's "race wars" season attempted to reinforce a "postracial" narrative that race no longer matters in contemporary U.S. society while simultaneously perpetuating the familiar representations that reproduce racial ideology. Using data derived from a systematic content analysis, the author argues that Survivor spectacularized race by (1) using racial logic to explain the success and failure of teams as well as the failure of individuals to survive within their teams, (2) essentializing people of color's racial identity as biologically and culturally bound while simultaneously making whiteness invisible and normal, and (3) promoting color-blind and postracial assertions that contradicted the clear salience of race in shaping contestants' "survival." The author considers what this explicit racialization of the program reveals about the potential for-and pitfalls of-addressing race in reality television.

T1  - Maid-in-Singapore: representing and consuming foreign domestic workers in Singapore cinema
AN  - 1531934061; 201423281
AB  - The Maid, a Singapore-made horror film featuring a foreign domestic worker as its protagonist, was released in 2005 to very favourable reviews in the local press. The critical audience generally used the film to praise the development of the local film industry while ignoring the social commentary of the foreign domestic worker experience in Singapore. This paper aims to address this lack of commentary on the issues and circumstances surrounding foreign domestic service in The Maid. Doing so reveals a multilayered representation of order in Singapore based firmly on ethnicity and class, where the images of foreign maids are dramatised, reconstructed and consumed in various discursive forms by various social agents.

T1  - "There Has Been No Phase in My Life When I Wasn't Somehow Bisexual": Comparing the Experiences of Finnish Bisexuals in 1999 and 2010
AN  - 907925196; 201124701
AB  - In 1999 the author interviewed 40 Finnish self-identified bisexual people for her master's thesis. The interviews focused on experiences of living as a bisexual in Finland in the late 20th century. Most of the interviewees were active in sexual minority subcultures and politics and found it imperative to increase the visibility of bisexuality. Now, after 10 years, the author has interviewed some of these informants again. What do their experiences and thoughts reveal about the change in Finnish sexual culture during the past 10 years? The visibility and equality of sexual minorities has improved considerably since 1999. The law for registered partnership for same-sex couples passed in 2001, it became possible to adopt the child of a same-sex partner in 2009, and there have been various national projects on sexual equality at work and in education. Furthermore, the media often explores sexual minority issues-one could almost say that bisexuality has become a product to be consumed by different audiences. What does this increase in visibility of bisexuality mean for people who identify as bisexual? What kind of contradictions do bisexuals meet when tackling with everyday life? What kind of meaning does the concept of bisexuality have in their lives? Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority Stress and College Persistence Attitudes Among African American, Asian American, and Latino Students: Perception of University Environment as a Mediator
AN  - 887499272; 201118216
AB  - We examined whether perception of university environment mediated the association between minority status stress and college persistence attitudes after controlling for perceived general stress. Participants were 160 Asian American, African American, and Latino students who attended a predominantly White university. Results of a path model analysis showed that university environment was a significant mediator for the association between minority status stress and college persistence attitudes. Additionally, minority status stress was distinct from perceived general stress. Finally, the results from a multiple-group comparison indicated that the magnitude of the mediation effect was invariant across Asian American, African American, and Latino college students, thus supporting the generalizability of the mediation model.

AB  - This paper analyses the use of ethnicity in quantitative models, focusing on Roma/Gypsy ethnic affiliation. Three research models are identified, together with characteristic measurement and model specification issues. A path model is estimated as a methodological example in order to explore the association of Roma/Gypsy ethnic affiliation with church attendance in Romania, using data from two surveys with national and Roma samples. Direct, mediated and moderated relationships involving ethnic affiliation are highlighted and discussed in relation to the processes of ethnic differentiation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When extended contact opens the door to future contact: Testing the effects of extended contact on attitudes and intergroup expectancies in majority and minority groups
AN  - 902083830; 201122124
AB  - The present research tests whether extended contact can predict positive intergroup expectancies, as well as positive intergroup attitudes, among majority and minority group members. Our results replicate and extend prior work by showing that extended contact predicts both positive intergroup attitudes and intergroup expectancies among both majority (Spanish) and minority (immigrant) participants, even when controlling for direct friendship and the quantity and quality of prior intergroup contact. These effects are partially mediated by intergroup anxiety, perceived ingroup norms, and perceived outgroup norms, and the positive effects of extended contact on intergroup attitudes were also partially mediated by the inclusion of ingroup in the self. Additionally, the mediating role of outgroup norms was stronger among immigrant participants than among Spanish participants. Implications of these findings and the value of extended contact for promoting positive intergroup expectancies and preparing people for future contact are discussed.

T1  - A Contested Identity: Resisting the Category Muslim-Australian
AN  - 870433426; 201114275
AB  - The role of the media in contributing to the construction of identity based groups is both overt and subtle. The term Muslim-Australians has come into prominence in recent media reports, yet an umbrella term which lumps all Australian followers of Islam into a single subset of all Australians ignores the complex diversity of Muslims in Australia. This article reports on a new research project which has recently been undertaken with Australians of Turkish background, in order to untangle some of the complexity involved when a Muslim community which comes from a relatively liberal, secular country finds its Islamic identity being foregrounded by the mainstream media. The research has focused on the ways that Turkish Australians are using traditional and new forms of media and information technology to negotiate a place in a multicultural society which is increasingly perceiving Muslims as 'the other'.

T1  - Conviviality and Conflict: Pluralism, Resilience and Hope in Inner-City Birmingham
AN  - 870433244; 201114280
AB  - This paper examines the lived realities of ethnic pluralism, social marginalisation and activism in the Alum Rock area of Birmingham, UK, which external media representations have tended to depict as lacking 'community cohesion' and fostering 'parallel lives'. Drawing on qualitative interviews with local residents and entrepreneurs conducted over a three-year period, we challenge such representations and a defining characteristic of currently dominant integration discourses: their tendency to ascribe 'community cohesion' or its absence as absolute properties to localities. Contrary to such reifying classifications, our interview data reveal considerably more complex social realities defined by a series of ambivalences. The first ambivalence is between undeniable local conflicts and, simultaneously, the everyday 'conviviality' of boundary-crossings and inter-ethnic solidarities. Second, the local economy is shown to enable both cohesion and ethnic exclusion. Finally, local politics and religious practice also display contradictory tendencies towards boundary maintenance on the one hand, and new inclusive alliances on the other. The emerging picture of Alum Rock not only challenges rigid taxonomies implied by 'community cohesion' discourses but also poses important questions about inter- and intra-ethnic networks, religiously underpinned social capital, the locally 'embedded' market, perceptions of social change, and an ideologically heterogeneous local civil society.

T1  - Conflict in Yemen: Simple People, Complicated Circumstances
AN  - 902082394; 201122342
AB  - An understanding of the recent violence in Yemen's northern province of Saada has proven elusive, even to those with a solid grasp of the complex circumstances underlying events in the region. A full media blackout and heavy propaganda from both sides make it difficult to separate fact from fiction. The official narrative of the conflict may be roughly summarized as follows. A small group of religious extremists in Saada, initially inspired by former member of parliament Husayn al-Huthi, took up arms against the Yemeni government in an attempt to seize by force a share of power greater than that which democratic means would yield. The group turned for help to sympathetic foreign Shia parties, specifically Iran and Hezbollah, and engaged in illegal measures and destructive guerrilla tactics against the armed forces in its attempt to restore the Yemeni imamate that was overthrown in 1962. The counternarrative provided by the Huthis and their sympathizers highlights government repression of their traditional religious practices and explains the rebellion as an attempt to preserve these rights and defend against the state's military heavy-handedness. Given the complexities of the conflict in Saada, efforts to properly summarize it are often lacking in important details. What follows is an attempt to provide a concise picture that highlights some of the conflict's main issues. It begins with a brief overview of the conflict and some background on Saada province, Zaydism in Yemen, and the al-Huthi family. The paper then turns to the historical factors that led to the initial clashes in 2004, emphasizing the rise of the Zaydi revivalist movement that became "the Huthis." The longest section is devoted to examining the official narrative of the conflict and providing additional factors that may help explain the persistence and growth of violence in its most recent iteration.

T1  - Sense of Belonging and Depressive Symptoms Among GLB Adolescents
AN  - 862595445; 201109681
AB  - Research has indicated that gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) adolescents are at an increased risk of mental health problems. Research has also indicated that experiencing a sense of belonging is important for one's mental health. This study investigated sense of belonging to the general community and sense of belonging to a GLB specific youth group (Minus18) as predictors of depressive symptoms among self-identified GLB adolescents (N = 99). Participants completed the Sense of Belonging Instrument and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results showed that although sense of belonging to the general community and sense of belonging to the Minus18 community were both directly related to depression, only sense of belonging to the general community contributed significantly to the prediction of depression when they were entered simultaneously in a regression analysis. Results also showed that sense of belonging to the general community mediated the relation between sense of belonging to the Minus18 community and depression. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at increasing sense of belonging to a GLB-specific community are likely to be of indirect benefit to the mental health of GLB adolescents, whereas interventions aimed at increasing sense of belonging to the general community are likely to be of direct benefit to the mental health of GLB adolescents.

T1  - Scientific Transparency and the Gulf Oil Spill: Which Constituencies is the Obama Administration Serving?
AN  - 1125217199; 201240487
AB  - During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama promised to end the Bush administration's approach to science which he characterized as one "where ideology trumps scientific inquiry and politics replaces expert opinion." Obama made a commitment to implement measures ensuring that, as applicable, decisions would rely on the best available scientific evidence. Government scientists could speak openly with the public and the media, providing transparency, presumably even where interpretation might be subject to debate. Implicit was that the Obama administration would seriously consider the science behind issues important to human and environmental health, issues ranging from environmental contamination to climate change to cleaner energy. While some more protective regulations have been introduced, many events suggest that standards set by Obama as a candidate have been overlooked since he became president. A tragic example of government failure to be open and transparent and to make decisions about human and environmental health based on the best scientific evidence is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon and the impact of the oil spill that followed. This paper will consider how the oil spill might have been prevented, consider why preventive measures were not in place, examine the government's response, and consider how this has adversely affected communities most vulnerable to effects of the oil spill. It will also attempt to identify other ways that communities, scientists, and regulators could work to better serve the needs of all constituencies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Greek American Ethnic Identity, Cultural Experience and the "Embodied Language" of Dance: Implications for Counseling
AN  - 1081866062; 201235257
AB  - This ethnographic study aims to contribute to better counseling services for the Greek American population in the U.S. by providing cultural knowledge and insight into one of the smaller ethnic groups that has been overlooked in the literature. More specifically, it explores the role of the "embodied language" of dance in the formation of Greek American ethnic identity and the transmission of sociocultural knowledge and practices. The findings suggest that ethnic dances constitute a significant medium of transmission of cultural knowledge, and socialization into the life of the Greek American community through role modeling and intergenerational contact, as well as opportunity for fellowship and interaction with people who share common practices and traditions. All of the above contribute to a strong identification with the particular community and the development of ethnic identity. Implications for research and theory development in counseling, taking into account the embodied construction of ethnic identity, are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Together but Unequal: Race and Education in Our Gang
AN  - 1023024945; 201223998
AB  - Weaver examines the Our Gang media franchise, which is most commonly associated with the series of short films that ran from 1922 to 1944 but also encompasses various media spin-offs and product tie-ins. Focusing on mass-cultural images drawn from the Our Gang franchise that depict white and black children together in the context of schooling (and playing hooky from school), Weaver argues that "Hal Roach Studios exploited comedic images of racially integrated students to underscore rather than understate the existing divide between whites and blacks." She contends that Our Gang rendered the races in a together-but-unequal way in a complementary mirror image of a separate-but-equal society. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Conflict and the Media: An Experimental Study of Greek Students after the 2008 Riots
AN  - 1010631928; 201212344
AB  - We report a laboratory experiment in the context of the December 2008 riots in Greece, after the killing of a 15-year-old student by a policeman. Our sample comprised 266 students from the University of Thessaloniki. We tested whether media reports can affect people's willingness to harm those in opposing groups by examining the way students allocated money between themselves and others of various professions, including police, in modified dictator games. Exposure to media reports decreased giving to police, but only when choices were private. Laboratory behaviour was correlated with self-reported participation in demonstrations, supporting the external validity of our measure. Media exposure appears to have affected behaviour by different pathways than those proposed in the existing literature, including "spiral of silence" and "frame alignment" theories.

T1  - The Sun Dance and the Gustafsen Lake Standoff: Healing Through Resistance and the Danger of Dismissing Religion
AN  - 1010630775; 201210600
AB  - The revitalization and renewal of traditional indigenous spiritual practices have produced new forms of indigenous religiosity rooted in experience, contact and combination. This paper examines the contemporary Sun Dance, a traditional healing ritual that seeks to address pain and sickness in indigenous communities through religious practice. For some Sun Dancers in both the United States and Canada who seek freedom for indigenous peoples through radical political activism, the Sun Dance has provided courage, validity and deeper meaning in their endeavours. However, when a highly politicized form of the ritual emerged in the non-traditional region of the British Columbia interior at Gustafsen Lake, it led the media, the state, and local elected First Nations leadership to dismiss the ritual as fraudulent. As demonstrated below, a failure to protect sacred sites and ceremonies and to understand the embodied spiritualities that accompany them can lead to violence between religious communities and the state.

T1  - Nixon and the Jews
AN  - 835111641; 201100575
AB  - In public the 37th President of the United States did not express hostility or disparagement, or show any signs of religious prejudice towards Jews. But inside the White House, Richard M. Nixon's remarks were often scurrilous. His antisemitism was not casual; it was close to compulsive. And it could be coupled with other seething grievances, for example, towards liberals, radicals, the media, Blacks and Italian-Americans. Yet Nixon controlled his antisemitism. It had no adverse effect on Jewish life, either at home or abroad. The malice that he nurtured remained unmobilized. Apart from a few limited personnel instances (mostly but not completely ignored by Nixon's underlings), it is impossible to connect private resentment to public policy, probably because the barriers to the expression of antisemitism in the United States have been so high. The ugliness of his utterances in the Oval Office revealed his character, but did not extend outward to shape the processes of governance. A disconnect can therefore be discerned between what he felt and how he acted. Most American Jews voted for Nixon's Democratic opponents in 1968 and 1972. But even Jews who voted against him, even those who loathed him, have often acknowledged that Nixon's policies fortified the security of Israel; and he was proud of his support for the Jewish state during the Yom Kippur War. What betrayed Nixon, and what forced him to resign the presidency, was his decision to instal a secret taping system in the Oval Office. When the tapes were played in 1974, he showed himself to be conspiring to obstruct justice. In subsequent years, further exposure of the tapes revealed the extent and intensity of Nixon's antipathy to Jews. The expletives that had to be deleted did much to besmirch the dignity of the office. But such was the stigma the political culture attached to antisemitism that, had his bigotry become public before 1968, Nixon's career would have been over. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Hollywood, Black Animation, and the Problem of Representation in Little Ol' Bosko and The Princess and the Frog
AN  - 758125070; 201056865
AB  - This article focuses on the dialogues within and between Disney's The Princess and The Frog and a 1930s animated series about a young Black boy-Little Ol' Bosko. Both films feature Black characters who navigate a fairy tale world set in the swamps of southern Jim Crow era America in which they grapple with fears about reductive and demeaning black film stereotypes. Although they are in some ways trapped within the white gaze of the film's meaning, I argue that in their fantasies, both Bosko and Tiana outmaneuver the regime of representation that underlies racial stereotyping, opening a space for trans-coding and revision of its meanings. In addition, a comparison of the films demonstrates a clear improvement from the 1930s in terms of an increased differentiation in the representation of Black Americans, acknowledging, if not embodying, the fact that "Black America" is a diverse and complex reality.

T1  - Interracial public-police contact: Relationships with police officers' racial and work-related attitudes and behavior
AN  - 822521967; 201072821
AB  - In a sample of Flemish police officers (n = 172), we examined whether interracial public-police contact is associated with police officers' racial and work-related attitudes and self-reported behavior. Complementing previous studies, it was revealed that interracial contact (both positive and negative) is related to prejudiced behavior toward immigrants via the mediating role of racial attitudes. Moreover, intergroup contact was also shown to be related to police officers' organizational citizenship behavior toward colleagues and superiors via their perceptions of organizational fairness. We elaborate on the severe impact of negative contact as well as the applied consequences of our findings within police organizations. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Exploring the Link Between Racial Discrimination and Substance Use: What Mediates? What Buffers?
AN  - 822521689; 201075093
AB  - The relation between perceived racial discrimination and substance use was examined in 2 studies that were based on the prototype-willingness model (Gibbons, Gerrard, & Lane, 2003). Study 1, using structural equation modeling, revealed prospective relations between discrimination and use 5 years later in a panel of African American adolescents (M age 10.5 years at Time 1 [T1]) and their parents. For both groups, the relation was mediated by anger and/or hostility. For the adolescents, it was also mediated by behavioral willingness, and it was moderated by supportive parenting. Study 2 was a lab experiment in which a subset of the Study 1 adolescents (M age = 18.5 years) was asked to imagine a discriminatory experience, and then their affect and drug willingness were assessed. As in the survey study, discrimination was associated with more drug willingness, and that relation was again mediated by anger and moderated by supportive parenting. Implications of the results for research and interventions involving reactions to racial discrimination are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - UK: the veil and the politics of racism
AN  - 822521782; 201072736
AB  - The veil has become an image of otherness, of a refusal to integrate and an example of the 'failings' of multiculturalism. As such, it has become an important symbol in the homogenisation and demonisation of Muslims in Britain. It is important to situate this 'debate' about the veil in the broader context of racism, immigration and imperialism, and neoliberal economic and political transformations. In the post-9/11 and 7/7 climate, public discussions of Muslims in Britain have centred on the twin issues of 'integration' and 'terrorism', at a time when racism is on the rise and poverty has increased for immigrant communities. How the veil is understood in this 'debate' is shaped by this wider context and, above all, by a history of colonialism and imperialism. This article examines the debate on the veil, showing that many garments and practices surrounding veiling are reduced in the British media to a threatening set of symbols of difference and otherness. It is argued that to detach gender issues and Islam from their wider social context leads to regressive, intolerant and overtly racist assumptions.

T1  - Muslim Women and Foreign Prostitutes: Victim Discourse, Subjectivity, and Governance
AN  - 764427105; 201064758
AB  - In this article, we juxtapose the ways Muslim women and foreign prostitutes are commonly constituted as victims in media and politics. We analyze the functions of these two prototypical female victims in terms of the role they play in epitomizing the problems of globalization and in reinforcing the existing social and political structures. Victim discourse, when tied to the transnational proliferation of the sex industry and of (radical) Islam, has depoliticizing effects because it places nonindividual causes of victimization outside of our polity and society and casts the state as protector and neutral arbiter of national and global inequalities, marginalization, and social conflict.

T1  - Justice through consensus: Shared identity and the preference for a restorative notion of justice
AN  - 758124099; 201056841
AB  - We propose a concept of restorative justice as a sense of justice deriving from consensus about, and the reaffirmation of, values violated by an offence (in contrast to punishment-based retributive justice). Victims should be more likely to seek restorative justice (and less likely retributive justice) when they perceive to share a relevant identity with the offender. In Study 1, when the relevant identity (university affiliation) shared with the offender was made salient (vs. not), participants found a consensus-based response more justice-restoring. In Study 2, when the group (company) shared with the offender was cohesive (vs. not), participants more strongly endorsed a restorative justice philosophy and, mediated by this, responded in consensus-restoring ways. In Study 3, when the offender was an ingroup (vs. outgroup) member, participants more strongly endorsed a restorative justice philosophy, fully mediated by sadness emotions.

T1  - Sensuous Multiculturalism: Emotional Landscapes of Inter-Ethnic Living in Australian Suburbia
AN  - 754038256; 201049827
AB  - Every day, people from different backgrounds mix together, whether by design or necessity, in our multicultural neighbourhoods and cities. This article explores how senses, sensibilities, habitus and affects influence quotidian intercultural encounters in culturally diverse cities. The article is based upon ethnographic research in an Australian suburb which has seen large-scale Chinese migration to the area in recent years and experienced the associated rapid changes to the shops along the local high street. Focusing on a range of sites or 'contact zones' along the suburban high street, the paper explores the notion of cross-cultural habitus, in particular the sensuous and affective dimensions of what I term the 'haptic habitus'. It then examines the sensuous and embodied modes of being that mediate intercultural interactions between long-term Anglo-Celtic elderly residents in the area and newly arrived Chinese immigrants and their associated urban spaces. Ranging through the senses, from sight, smell, sound and the haptic system, the article reflects upon how the senses, affect, habitus, nostalgia and memory articulate with localised experiences of diversity. I develop the notion of 'sensuous multiculturism'--which foregrounds embodied experience in this scenario of cultural difference--and go on to argue that the dis-synchronisation of senses, embodied place-memory and habitus contribute to some forms of intercultural anxiety and everyday racism.

T1  - The Household Registration System and Migrant Labor in China: Notes on a Debate
AN  - 754040877; 201049687
AB  - The household registration (hukou) system in China, classifying each person as a rural or an urban resident, is a major means of controlling population mobility and determining eligibility for state-provided services and welfare. Established in the late 1950s, it was initially used to bar rural-to-urban migration. After the late 1970s reforms, an inflow of rural migrant workers was allowed into the cities to meet labor demands in the burgeoning export industries and urban services without, however, changing the migrants' registered status, thus precluding their access to subsidized housing and other benefits available to those with urban registration. While there have been many calls for reforming this system, progress has been limited. Proposed reforms have attracted increasing academic and media attention. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Leavers and stayers discuss returning home: Internet discourses on migration in the context of the post-communist transformation
AN  - 754041808; 201053319
AB  - There is a significant difference between previous waves of Polish migrants and the massive outflow of people from Poland after the EU expansion. Information technologies enable post-accession migrants to participate actively in an ongoing dialogue with those who stayed in the home country about, among others, various social issues related to the process of the post-communist transformation. This paper discusses an electronic newspaper forum as an example of transnational space of participation in a recreated civil society. Recently there has been an on-going debate in the Polish media about a possible return of the post-04 migrants. Newspapers and magazines emphasise the economic (very strong Polish currency) as well as the political arguments (change of a government for the more liberal one) in order to explain that a mass return might happen. Both migrants and 'non-migrants' make comments on the issues and they post their views on Internet fora of a number of e-papers. Anchoring the study in narrative and discourse analyses, I shall describe topics and linguistic forms of the participants' entries to the fora. I shall also comment on the interactional function of the selected data. In doing so I hope to shed light on the role of such Internet sites as translocal platforms of a new form of involvement in the public sphere. The data come from approximately 500 entries on an Internet forum triggered by newspaper reports and articles in the electronic version of the Gazeta Wyborcza between January and March 2008.

T1  - Transgender as Ingroup or Outgroup? Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Viewers Respond to a Transgender Character in Daytime Television
AN  - 743047640; 201031745
AB  - From November 2006 to April 2007, the daytime drama All My Children featured Zoe, the first transitioning transgender character on broadcast television. Acknowledging historical tension within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) community over transgender acceptance, this study examines how lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) viewers of All My Children reacted to this character. LGB viewers were more likely to dislike the character than non-LGB viewers, yet were also more trans-supportive than non-LGB viewers. Further evaluation suggests LGB viewers' negative response to Zoe was tied not to the transgender status of the character but specifically to unhappiness with a plot development seen to threaten the identity of the lesbian character, Bianca. Applications of social identity theory and implications for community politics are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Who Says We Are Bad People? The Impact of Criticism Source and Attributional Content on Responses to Group-Based Criticism
AN  - 1928317327
AB  - We investigated the interplay between the source of criticism and the attributional content of their message on behavioral responses to group-based criticism. Studies 1 and 2 revealed that outgroup critics were more effective when their criticism included internal attributions (to the ingroup's character) rather than external attributions (the ingroup's circumstances), whereas there was no effect of attributional content for ingroup critics (a significant Source × Content interaction). Study 3 explored the role of audiences in responses to outgroup criticism. The results indicated that the positive effects of internal versus external attributions were only evident when an outgroup audience was witness to participants' responses. Furthermore, these effects were mediated through concerns about the ingroup's image. Together, these patterns suggest that responses to criticism depend not just on the identity of the critic but also on what the critic says and who is watching. People may be surprisingly responsive to outgroup criticism--particularly when inaction might lead others to perceive them as "bad people."

T1  - Branding blackness on US cable television
AN  - 743052235; 201026532
AB  - In the late 1990s, while broadcasting networks were criticized for the lack of racial diversity on prime-time television, cable was praised for its breadth of black representations. This praise suggested that diversity on cable was a result of cable's innovativeness & desire to take risks. A closer look reveals that blackness has been part the discourse of "risk' that cable channels have used to create brand identities. In a repeat of the strategies broadcasters used in the late 1980s, cable channels have tried to draw black viewers, a (white) 'quality' audience, & a multiracial youth market by using blackness to signify 'quality' or 'edginess'.
