T1  - Conflict Changes How People View God
AN  - 2376930415
AB  - Religion shapes the nature of intergroup conflict, but conflict may also shape religion. Here, we report four multimethod studies that reveal the impact of conflict on religious belief: The threat of warfare and intergroup tensions increase the psychological need for order and obedience to rules, which leads people to view God as more punitive. Studies 1 (N = 372) and 2 (N = 911) showed that people’s concern about conflict correlates with belief in a punitive God. Study 3 (N = 1,065) found that experimentally increasing the salience of conflict increases people’s perceptions of the importance of a punitive God, and this effect is mediated by people’s support for a tightly regulated society. Study 4 showed that the severity of warfare predicted and preceded worldwide fluctuations in punitive-God belief between 1800 CE and 2000 CE. Our findings illustrate how conflict can change the nature of religious belief and add to a growing literature showing how cultural ecologies shape psychology.

T1  - A normative perspective on the linguistic intergroup bias: How intragroup approval of ingroup members who use the linguistic intergroup bias perpetuates explicit intergroup bias
AN  - 2341202096
AB  - The present research examined from a normative perspective how intragroup normative processes regulate the consequences of the linguistic intergroup bias (LIB). Results of three studies supported our hypothesis that intragroup approval of an ingroup member who uses the LIB plays a key role in perpetuating pro‐ingroup bias. In Study 1, ingroup members who used pro‐ingroup (vs. pro‐outgroup) LIB elicited more intragroup approval and this effect was mediated by the perception of the speaker as being biased in favor of the ingroup. In Studies 2 and 3, intragroup approval (vs. disapproval) of an ingroup member who used the LIB enhanced the expression of pro‐ingroup bias. By providing the first demonstration of how the LIB relates to intragroup normative processes, our studies highlight a new path by which the LIB helps perpetuate intergroup bias.

T1  - Does Contact Matter?: The Relative Importance of Contact in Predicting Anti-Gay Prejudice in Jamaica
AN  - 2352303962
AB  - Jamaica has been called one of the world's most anti-gay countries. However, little empirical research has investigated methods of reducing this prejudice. Intergroup contact-(positive) interaction with someone from a different social group-is one of the most widely tested and strongly favored methods of reducing prejudice. However, the role of contact in this specific context is not clear, particularly the relative importance of contact compared to other variables that predict (less) prejudice. This current cross-sectional research investigated that question using a large, representative sample of Jamaican participants (N = 942). As in prior research, contact predicted less anti-gay prejudice, and the (negative) relationship between contact and anti-gay behaviors was mediated by intergroup anxiety and attitudes, even when other important predictors were taken into account. However, contact was a less important predictor than gender, education, or religiosity. Implications for intergroup contact and prejudice-reduction strategies in Jamaica are discussed.

T1  - When prejudice against you hurts others and me: The case of ageism at work
AN  - 2312955844
AB  - Ageism in the workplace has documented detrimental consequences for its victims, but its effects on those who hold ageist views are rarely investigated. A cross‐sectional study and a longitudinal study examined ageism toward both younger and older workers and its relation to intergroup contact, work behaviors, organizational identification, and the well‐being of prejudiced individuals. It was hypothesized that ageism would predict prejudiced individuals’ behaviors toward co‐workers, identification with their organization, and vitality at work, indirectly through intergroup anxiety and quality of intergroup contact. Overall, 647 employees aged 24–62 years provided data on the variables of interest. Both studies suggested that ageist views worsened the quality of intergroup contact, which in turn increased counterproductive behaviors toward co‐workers and decreased identification with the organization. Moreover, ageism marginally predicted vitality at work longitudinally through the mediation of quality of intergroup contact. No support emerged for the mediational role of intergroup anxiety. Theoretical explanations for these findings and their practical implications are discussed.

TT  - Assistenti sociali e mediatori interculturali: sfide nella collaborazione e consapevolezza interculturale
AN  - 2295838817
AB  - Social work in Europe is facing numerous challenges in terms of promoting the participation of migrants and their descendants in super-diverse societies. This study investigates collaboration between social workers and intercultural mediators based on international debate and fieldwork in Italy. Does social work require collaboration with other professions specialised in intercultural relations? What are the characteristics of intercultural professionals? What are the pros and cons of collaboration between social workers and intercultural mediators? This study shows that local social services need to work with intercultural mediators, allowing local social services to implement various strategies for tackling cultural and linguistic barriers with their clients and rely on professionals inside or outside their own. Furthermore, intercultural mediators tend to have weak and heterogeneous training backgrounds and working conditions. This article aims to contribute to the debate on the welfare reform process to support migrants and their descendants' equal rights and participation in society, highlighting the need for collaboration between interculturally aware social workers and intercultural mediators to tackle institutional structural weaknesses in such professions as part of an organisational innovation process in social-welfare institutions.

T1  - The fight against sexual violence
AN  - 2215486771
AB  - Seared into my memory'. This was one of the phrases animating the cover of Time magazine on 15 October 2018. It was taken from Dr Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to the US Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, quotes from which were arranged into a striking cover image (see opposite). It also reflects how I and many other survivors felt about Dr Ford's testimony of sexual assault by Justice Kavanaugh, especially when juxtaposed with his statements. In an image circulated widely on social media, Kavanaugh was shown shouting into a microphone during a speech in which he called the process a national disgrace and a grotesque and coordinated character assassination', fuelled by 'anger about President Trump and revenge on behalf of the Clintons. The 2016 Brexit referendum in the UK captured growing (or perhaps increasingly explicit) anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as a backlash against experts, elites and social justice movements (which were often positioned as one and the same).

T1  - Different forms of intergroup contact with former adversary are linked to distinct reconciliatory acts through symbolic and realistic threat
AN  - 2178496160
AB  - In a society burdened with the most severe type of intergroup conflict, we examined the association between willingness to reconcile with former adversary, intergroup contact with, and perceived threat from former adversary. We focused on three reconciliatory acts—forgiveness to the outgroup, support for ingroup apology and support for financial compensation to the outgroup. We included different forms of positive and negative intergroup contact—direct and indirect (extended and mass‐mediated). In the link between contact and reconciliation, we tested the mediating role of two types of intergroup threat—realistic and symbolic. The sample comprised Bosniaks (N = 267) and Croats (N = 278) from Bosnia and Herzegovina. In both samples, reconciliation associated with indirect forms of intergroup contact even when controlling for its link with direct contact. This indicates the potential of indirect contact to promote reconciliation in the lack of direct contact, characteristic for segregated post‐conflict societies. Symbolic threat mediated the relationship between intergroup contact and symbolic forms of reconciliation—forgiveness and support for ingroup apology. Realistic threat mediated the link between intergroup contact and a more tangible form of reconciliation—support for financial compensation. This highlights the importance of considering different types intergroup threat when targeting distinct reconciliatory acts. Our results suggest that practitioners promoting reconciliation in post‐conflict societies need to implement different means when tailoring interventions that should enhance different sides of peace‐making process.

AN  - 2108877889
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of family communication environments on children's intergroup socialization. Adult children (n = 200) reported on their parents' conformity and conversation orientations and their own racial attitudes and intergroup orientations. Results evidenced ingroup bias, social dominance, and identification with parent as mediators of the positive relationship between conformity orientation and racial prejudice and the negative relationship between conformity orientation and racial tolerance. Results also revealed that children from consensual and protective families harbor the most racial prejudice and least racial tolerance. Future directions related to intergroup contact interventions, racially diverse families, and qualitative assessments of parent-child interactions are discussed.

T1  - Imagine Me and You, I Do: Effects of imagined intergroup contact on anti-fat bias in the context of job interviews
AN  - 2002127680
AB  - Imagined intergroup contact (IIC) has been demonstrated to alleviate prejudice toward social groups as a whole, but the extent to which it prevents biases in ratings of individual job candidates has not yet been examined. This study uses a simulated employment interview where a female candidate either higher or lower in body fat is rated by participants who have undergone an IIC or a control manipulation. IIC successfully alleviated discrimination in ratings of interviewee competence but had no significant effect on ratings of warmth. Competence ratings fully mediated the effect of the two-way interaction of IIC and interviewee body fat on a dichotomous hiring recommendation provided 1 week later. IIC may be an effective and inexpensive intervention for reducing bias in job interview contexts.

T1  - Wounded Detachments: Cronulla, Social Memory and the Injuries of Racism
AN  - 1923057379
AB  - More than a decade since the Cronulla Riots, it could be argued that we are none the wiser about what they meant. Frequently evoked in public discourse, 'Cronulla' has become a benchmark for the worst of Australian society (whether that is seen as racism or multiculturalism). This paper reflects upon the representation of the Riots to explore three key ideas. First, we need to think about Cronulla through an exploration of the situated processes of social memory. There is no single 'meaning' of the Riots. In fact, the symbolic place of 'Cronulla' in public discourse is a contested space in which competing interests, processes and perspectives are at stake. Second, social memory is a complex and dispersed architecture of remembering and forgetting, but analysis typically focuses on the institutional and collective dimensions of social memory at the expense of other domains. Third, and drawing on some of the theoretical literature, we explore a different kind of memory that is forgotten in political and media representations of Cronulla - the embodied memory resulting from the injuries of racism experienced by those of Middle Eastern background. We see Cronulla entailing a violent and existential threat which detaches them from full belonging in Australia.

T1  - Racial ideology as elite discourse: Nordicism and the visual in an age of mass culture
AN  - 1885030003
AB  - Nordicism promoted a particular racial-bodily aesthetic, that of the tall, blond, blue-eyed individual, and promoted the view that the Nordic race was responsible for all the major achievements of humanity. However, modern "scientific" race theory recognized that there were no pure races, and few racially pure individuals. This complicated the presentation of racial ideas in the public sphere. In inter-war Germany and during the Nazi period, racial imagery played a crucial role in mediating between academic race theory and popular racial propaganda, between racial elitism and political populism. At the macro-historical level, this ideal human aesthetic appears in post-Second World War advertising and in Hollywood movies, and in the imagery associated with social-democratic Scandinavia. Nordic iconography today indexes racist elitism, idealized figures in the social imaginary, and egalitarianism.

T1  - Oppositional consciousness, cultural preservation, and everyday resistance on the Uyghur Internet
AN  - 1883583548
AB  - The Internet has potential as a tool for propagation of minority cultures and identities. As China is a multi-ethnic, multilingual society, people of varying cultural backgrounds and across the Chinese diaspora may be found participating in Chinese language sites. However, little attention has been paid to the separate online activity among any of China's 55 officially recognized ethnic minority groups, such as the Uyghurs, especially in their native languages. In this paper, we consider in what ways digital media such as interactive online community forums (UY: munbar) may be used by one ethnic group, Uyghurs, as a means of mobilizing their community to preserve their culture and support their community. As the majority ethnic group within a region of China noted as among China's most politically sensitive, Uyghur use of computer-mediated communication provides a rich source of study.

T1  - Understanding ethnic visibility through language use: the case of Taiwan Hakka
AN  - 1883583249
AB  - This study investigates how the ethnic visibility of Taiwan Hakka is improved through language use. The usage of a unique Hakka symbolic code <nganggiang stiff neck> is focused on. Based on data from the four Taiwan major newspapers, an analysis with text techniques shows that the code emerges along with social-political developments in Taiwan, with its meaning turning from negative to positive connotation. Its frequency is highly correlated with major political events in Taiwan, with peaks during the two or three years before presidential elections. It illustrates semiotic innovation, extending from Hakka to Hakka non-human, to non-Hakka, and to non-Hakka non-human frames. The salient image it creates increases Hakka ethnic visibility and enhances their ethnic identity. A significant implication is that minority ethnic groups can employ a unique symbolic code, empowering it with positive connotation. Through extensive language use, its representation can raise their ethnic visibility and enhance their ethnic identity.

T1  - Deaths at the borders database: evidence of deceased migrants' bodies found along the southern external borders of the European Union
AN  - 1875839444
AB  - Irregular migrants and asylum seekers have died and continue to die attempting to cross the external borders of the EU without authorisation, seeking to enter the territories of its Member States. Yet, remarkably little is known about these 'border deaths'. In 2015, the Human Costs of Border Control project published the Deaths at the Borders Database for the Southern EU, an open-source 'evidence base' of individualised information about people who have died border deaths between 1990 and 2013, sourced from the death management systems of Spain, Gibraltar, Italy, Malta and Greece. It is the first database on border deaths in the EU to be based on official sources as opposed to the news media. The project involved searching 563 state-run death registry archives and deductively selecting the death certificates of persons who died border deaths. This paper describes, in detail, the making of the Deaths at the Borders Database: from the systematic, multi-sited, quantitative data collection and qualitative case studies, to the construction and final results of the Database itself.

T1  - Stereotyping the Shire: Assigning White Privilege to Place and Identity
AN  - 1922921454
AB  - Through a focus on the media's role in constructing and maintaining stereotypes of white privilege and racism, this paper investigates the stereotyping of the Sutherland Shire, Sydney, Australia, and its residents. Print media plays a significant role in constructing social identities, shaping public opinion and typecasting public perception. Using a media content analysis and surveys with residents and non-residents of the Sutherland Shire we (de)construct the area's positioning in media discourse as white, insular and privileged. Pivotal to this investigation was the 2005 Cronulla riots and their influence on assertions of white privilege and racism, in the media and by non-Sutherland Shire residents. While not vindicating some resident's roles in the riots, we reason that such typecasting provides an avenue for the predominately white media, and white Sydney to deflect responsibility for their own whiteness by attributing and spatializing racist sentiment to elsewhere in Sydney.

T1  - Petitioning for Social Change: Letters to Religious Leaders From Gay Men and Their Family Allies
AN  - 1854785344
AB  - Coming out is often described as challenging, especially for individuals from conservative religious communities (Etengoff, 2013). In an effort to explore how these sociocultural conflicts are mediated, gay men (n = 16) and their family allies (n = 9) from Christian and Jewish communities wrote letters to religious leaders regarding current sexual minority policies and whether they should change or remain the same. Petitioning tasks were selected as letters can shift author-audience relations to allow for non-normative and unscripted expressions (Daiute & Lightfoot, 2004). Sixteen of the 25 participants addressed their letters to a specific religious figure, illustrating the sociorelational applicability of the task. Ninety-three problems and 75 solutions were discussed, supporting prior discussions of petitioning tasks as a form of living history and conflict mediation (Daiute, 2010). Moreover, 20 of the 25 participants wrote about humanization needs (e.g., "We are not freaks at a freak show"), providing new conceptual structures for participatory research efforts, policy initiatives, and clinical applications.

T1  - Identifying With a Stereotype: The Divergent Effects of Exposure to Homosexual Television Characters
AN  - 1904238337
AB  - Scholars examining homosexual television characters have typically come to one of two conclusions: either exposure to homosexual characters can lead to increased acceptance, or homosexual characters serve to reaffirm negative stereotypes. We seek to bridge these two bodies of research by introducing the concept of stereotyped identification-the idea that cognitively and emotionally identifying with fictional characters can increase acceptance of minorities, while reinforcing implicit stereotypes about how they look, act, and talk. Results from our national survey (N = 972) offer support for this hypothesis.

T1  - Bridging language barriers, bonding against immigrants: A visual case study of transnational network publics created by far-right activists in Europe
AN  - 1856412243
AB  - With the growing importance of digital and social media, visual images represent an increasingly attractive medium for far-right political entrepreneurs to mobilize supporters and mainstream voters in the context of increasing polarization and widespread fears of immigrants and refugees. This article investigates how far-right activists use cartoon images poking fun at immigrants to construct a shared ethno-nationalist bond of solidarity across multilingual and transnational networks and publics. Focusing on right-wing activists as political entrepreneurs, I will explore the visual and discursive translation of nationalist symbols and cartoons within different national political contexts and across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Combining the discourse historical approach (DHA) with multimodal analysis, I will trace the cross-cultural translation and sharing of an anti-immigrant poster created by the Swiss People's Party (SVP), a right-wing political party in Switzerland, in its controversial 'black sheep' campaign. Second, I will show how far-right sympathizers in Italy and Germany, inspired by the SVP, created their own 'black sheep' cartoons in which they imagine a racist bond of transnational solidarity through the use of images depicting immigrants as Europe's other . This article contributes to the study of transnational network publics by showing the relevance of non-verbal and visual translation strategies used by radical right-wing political entrepreneurs to forge stronger alliances cross-nationally and cross-linguistically.

T1  - Disasters, Queer Narratives, and the News: How Are LGBTI Disaster Experiences Reported by the Mainstream and LGBTI Media?
AN  - 1845258913
AB  - The media plays a significant role in constructing the public meanings of disasters and influencing disaster management policy. In this article, we investigate how the mainstream and LGBTI media reported-or failed to report-the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) populations during disasters in Brisbane, Australia and Christchurch, New Zealand. The implications of our work lie within recent disasters research suggesting that marginalized populations-including LGBTI peoples-may experience a range of specific vulnerabilities during disasters on the basis of their social marginality. In this article, we argue that LGBTI experiences were largely absent from mainstream media reporting of the Brisbane floods and Christchurch earthquake of 2011. Media produced by and about the LGBTI community did take steps to redress this imbalance, although with uneven results in terms of inclusivity across that community. We conclude by raising the possibility that the exclusion or absence of queer disaster narratives may contribute to marginality through the media's construction of disasters as experienced exclusively by heterosexual family groups.

T1  - Homogeneity and Inequality: School Discipline Inequality and the Role of Racial Composition
AN  - 1819909361
AB  - Research consistently demonstrates that black students are disproportionately subject to behavioral sanctions, yet little is known about contextual variation. This paper explores the relationship between school racial composition and racial inequality in discipline. Prior work suggests that demographic composition predicts harsh punishment of minorities. Accordingly, a threat framework suggests that increases in black student enrollment correspond to increases in punitive school policies. Results from this paper find some support for this hypothesis, finding that the percent of black students in a school is related to increased odds of suspension/expulsion, and differential effects of behavior partially mediate these relationships. However, I also find that a traditional threat narrative may be insufficient. Black students may be most likely to experience unequal sanctions on their behavior in racially homogeneous contexts -- whether homogeneously black or white. These results suggest that more research is needed to understand how the social organization of schools contributes to discipline inequality.

T1  - Pretending to be a normal human being: Peep Show, sitcom, and the momentary invocation of disability
AN  - 1807160501
AB  - This interdisciplinary article presents research about the place of disability in the British sitcom Peep Show, whose 54 episodes span more than a decade in their transmission (2003-2015). The methodology of critical discourse analysis is employed to probe the relationship between casual word choice and broader themes such as normalcy, humour, and social attitudes. This analysis is informed by classic and new work in cultural disability studies, as well as by work in literary studies and television studies. The conclusion is that, despite its apparent irrelevance to disability studies, Peep Show reveals much about conversational invocations of disability.

T1  - Cheats, charity cases and inspirations: disrupting the circulation of disability-based memes online
AN  - 1805276641
AB  - With the increasing part online self-performance plays in day-to-day life in the twenty-first century, it is not surprising that critiques of the way the daily social drama of disability plays out in online spaces and places have begun to gain prominence. In this article, I consider memes as a highly specific style or strategy for representing disability via social media sites. I identify three commonly circulating categories of meme - the charity case, inspiration and cheat memes - all of which offer representations that people with disabilities find highly problematic. I then investigate the ways in which disabled people have begun to resist the representation and circulation of these commonly circulating categories of memes, via the production of counter or parodic memes. I focus, in particular, on the subversive potential of these counter memes, within disability communities online and within broader communities online.

T1  - Migrant cities: place, power, and voice in the era of super diversity
AN  - 1784152112
AB  - Immigration scholars have long considered cities to be important environments that mediate how immigrants are incorporated into receiving countries. While most scholars recognise that cities have some importance, they continue to prioritise national-level institutions, organisations, networks, and cultural dynamics. This paper introduces the special issue on 'Migrant Cities'. The special issue asserts that cities are not simply backdrops where national-level processes and mechanisms unfold. The contributing scholars reveal how cities are distinctive environments with unique constraints and opportunities. Following a basic introduction, the paper examines how to apply these general assumptions about cities to understanding the political formation of immigrants. The paper does this by urbanising Nancy Fraser's concept of 'counterpublic'. We suggest that cities possess certain qualities that enable the formation of immigrant counterpublics, which in turn become critical spaces of politicisation.

T1  - The networked grassroots. How radicals outflanked reformists in the United States' immigrant rights movement
AN  - 1784150780
AB  - This paper accounts for important shifts in the debate on immigration reform by considering the geographies of protest. Our findings point to the importance of urban hubs of activists and organisations that have worked with one another over extended periods of time. While these urban hubs constitute distinctive activist worlds, they have also connected to one another and coordinated nation-wide actions through a variety of networks (social media, interpersonal, and inter-organisational). Using interviews, network analysis, and data on funding, we show how this decentralised network evolved and eventually outflanked nationally centred and reformist advocacy organisations in recent anti-deportation campaigns.

T1  - "I Am Chelsea Manning": Comparison of Gendered Representation of Private Manning in U.S. and International News Media
AN  - 1773060150
AB  - On August 22, 2013, Bradley Manning released a statement requesting to be referred to as female. In the following days, the news media discussed whether language should shift toward a female representation. Using quantitative content analysis and qualitative contextual analysis, this study analyzed whether U.S. and international newspapers (N = 197) acknowledged Manning's request to be referred to as "Chelsea" in the two weeks after the statement. Results suggest that the mainstream press was hesitant in shifting toward a female representation. A comparison of international and U.S. newspapers suggests that the U.S. press lagged behind international coverage using a female depiction.

Here, the author examines Volume 1, Issue 1 of the Journal of Homosexuality and asks whether the journal's first contributors might reveal a historically problematic relationship whereby the categories of front-line LGBT health advocates in the 1970s might be incommensurate with the post-AIDS, queer politics that would follow in decades to come.

T1  - Bad Sex, Good Love: Homonormativity in the Swedish Gay Press, 1969-86: Gay Lesbian Quarterly
AN  - 1824292364
AB  - We discuss "love" as a rhetorical strategy in the Swedish gay press, 1969-86, in relation to shifting meanings of sex and love. During this period, meanings of homosexual subjectivity were rapidly changing at several societal levels. New ideals of openness and monogamous love became more dominant and tended to exclude expressions of sexual practices based primarily on pleasure. Using the analytical terms unconditionedversus conditioned, we discern a shifting relative strength between discursive constructions of unconditioned sex/sex conditioned on love, and love for love's sake/love conditioned on coupledom.

T1  - Introduction: The Civil Rights Movement, a retrospective
AN  - 1784145699
AB  - The vitality of the historiography of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States is obvious in the pieces featured in this issue of Patterns of Prejudice. 2015 is of course the fiftieth anniversary of the Martin Luther King-led Selma to Montgomery march in April 1965, followed by the signing into law of the Voting Rights Act in August by President Lyndon B. Johnson. We now also have a feature film about this whole process, Ava DuVernay's Selma, not to mention the televised visit by Congressman John Lewis and President Barack Obama to Selma on 7 April 2015 to commemorate Bloody Sunday fifty years earlier, 7 April 1965. It was on that day that civil rights marchers were set upon by Alabama state troopers on Edward Pettus Bridge and forcibly driven back into the black section of Selma. Furthermore, 9 April 2015 also marked the 150th anniversary of the end of the American Civil War, the bloodiest conflict of the nineteenth century in Europe or the Western Hemisphere. Thus, we are at a juncture where we might look backwards at just what the trends in writing about civil rights in the United States have been.

T1  - Health problems, complex life, and consanguinity among ethnic minority Muslim women in Nepal
AN  - 1784139204
AB  - Background. Marriage between blood relatives is common among Muslim ethnic minority population in Nepal. Albeit, the adverse effects of such a consanguineous marriage on health are controversial.
Objective. To determine the prevalence, characteristics and health outcomes related to consanguineous marriage.
Design. A cross-sectional survey was carried out using a cluster sampling technique to select the respondents. A total of 400 women aged 15-49 years were interviewed from September 2011 to February 2012. A structured questionnaire was administered through face-to-face meetings. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were estimated by a stepwise likelihood ratio method with binary logistic regression.
Results. The overall prevalence of consanguinity was 36.7%. The median age at marriage and age at first childbirth was 15 and 18 years, respectively. The association of being in a consanguineous marriage among women whose husband's education level were secondary or higher was 3.35 (95% CI 1.56, 7.12) times greater than among those whose husbands were unable to read and write.
Woman who have consanguineous marriage were less likely to have (AOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26, 0.82) used contraceptive than those who have non-consanguineous marriage. Women who have consanguineous marriage were more (AOR 1.80; 95% CI 0.90, 3.61) likely to have birth defect in their children than those who have non-consanguineous marriage. The association of having a history of death after live birth among women who experienced emotional violence was 2.60 (95% CI 1.36, 5.00) and physical violence 2.15 (95% CI 1.16, 3.93) times greater than among those who did not experience violence.
Conclusions. Several factors like husband's education and dowry practices are associated with consanguineous marriage. Further, these factors including consanguineous marriage and marital violence are also accountable for negative health consequences. Thus, multicomponent interventions are needed in order to improve the health condition of Nepalese Muslim community in rural area.

T1  - Labeling albinism: language and discourse surrounding people with albinism in Tanzania
AN  - 1788498344
AB  - This article is based on a qualitative study that set out to analyze the labels and terms attached to 28 people affected by albinism in villages in Kilolo district, Tanzania. Even though national and international attention to killings of people with albinism has attempted to improve general knowledge of albinism and reduce discrimination, most of the community members within the study had little knowledge of the (bio)medical explanations for albinism and tended to marginalize people with albinism. Framed within a wider moral discourse on illness, disability and socially appropriate behavior, albinism is mostly considered to be God's will or the consequence of past misdeeds within the family, and many of the existing labels for people with albinism express such ideas.

T1  - The discursive construction of dyslexia by students in higher education as a moral and intellectual good
AN  - 1788497692
AB  - Interest in dyslexia as a topic of discussion in education, and in the media, runs through peaks and troughs. Dyslexic students in higher education must navigate their way through the possible meanings attached to the label, appropriating some and rejecting others, yet needing the label as a means to access support. The aim of this article is to explore the ways in which dyslexic university students constructed dyslexia and being dyslexic as moral issues during two focus group conversations. These conversations were discursively analysed with reference to Gee and Willig. Three key themes emerged following analysis: the interaction between the power of the grade as a marker of worth and the status of the dyslexia label; the tensions between acknowledging difficulties with writing and the construction of high literacy as morally aspirational; and the uncertain, yet persistent, construction of dyslexia as a valuable label and a moral good.

T1  - Representing harmony and diversity: media representations of multiculturalism and ethnicity in Singapore
AN  - 1784139648
AB  - This article investigates multiculturalism and ethnicity in Singapore. The study conducted a qualitative content analysis of articles appearing in the Straits Times newspaper over a three month period in 2010. It was found that multicultural harmony tended to be represented as unnatural, fragile, and requiring government intervention. There also tended to be a focus on distinct and fixed ethnic identities, reflecting an essentialist understanding of ethnicity. These beliefs about the nature of multiculturalism and ethnic identity were reflected in the coverage of three major social issues. These were the perceived needs to maintain the ethnic composition of Singapore's population, efforts to prevent cultural corruption or neglect, and concerns about the impact of immigration on multicultural harmony.

T1  - When bias binds: Effect of implicit outgroup bias on ingroup affiliation
AN  - 1767327297; 201605543
AB  - We tested a novel process we term implicit homophily in which perceivers' implicit outgroup bias shapes their affiliative responses toward ingroup targets with outgroup friends as a function of perceived similarity. Across 4 studies, we tested implicit homophily in the context of racial groups. We found that White participants with higher implicit anti-Black bias reported less affiliative responses toward White targets with Black friends compared with White targets with White friends, and this effect persisted above and beyond the effects of implicit pro-White bias and explicit racial bias (Studies 1-3). We further found evidence that this relationship between implicit anti-Black bias and affiliation exists because participants infer how comfortable targets are around outgroup members (Preliminary Study) and use this information to infer similarity on this dimension (Studies 1-3). Our findings also suggested that stigma transference and expectancy violation were not viable alternative mediators (Preliminary Study and Study 1). Finally, women's implicit anti-Black bias predicted their likelihood of having Facebook friends with Black friends, providing ecological and behavioral evidence of implicit homophily (Study 4). Implications for research on stigma by association, extended contact, affiliation, and network formation are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Understanding the Selection Bias: Social Network Processes and the Effect of Prejudice on the Avoidance of Outgroup Friends
AN  - 1767328597; 201605714
AB  - Research has found that prejudiced people avoid friendships with members of ethnic outgroups. Results of this study suggest that this effect is mediated by a social network process. Longitudinal network analysis of a three-wave panel study of 12- to 13-year-olds (N = 453) found that more prejudiced majority group members formed fewer intergroup friendships than less prejudiced majority group members. This was caused indirectly by the preference to become friends of one's friends' friends (triadic closure). More prejudiced majority members did not have a preference for actively avoiding minority group members. Rather, they had the tendency to avoid friends who already had minority group friends and thus could not be introduced to potential minority group friends. Instead they became friends with the majority group friends of their friends. This research shows how a social networks perspective can further our understanding of the processes underlying intergroup contact. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Age at Immigration and the Incomes of Older Immigrants, 1994-2010
AN  - 1728662226; 201534200
AB  - Objectives. Seniors comprise a growing proportion of new U.S. immigrants. We investigate whether late-age immigrants are disadvantaged in older age relative to those arriving earlier in life, based on income, reliance on public benefits, and access to public medical insurance. We test whether the 1996 welfare reform law altered the relationships between age at immigration and these outcomes. Method. Immigrants aged 65 and older in the 1994-2010 Current Population Surveys were classified by age at immigration. Median and logistic regressions are used to estimate the association between age at immigration and several outcomes and to test whether these associations differ for arrivals before and after welfare reform. Results. Late-age immigration is strongly associated with lower personal income, lower rates of Medicare and Social Security receipt, and higher participation in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid. Arrival after 1996 is associated with lower rates of SSI, Medicaid, and Medicare receipt. The association between late-age immigration and income is stronger for post-1996 arrivals relative to earlier arrivals, whereas that between late-age immigration and Medicaid is weaker, suggesting that the penalty conferred by late-age immigration grew after reform. Discussion. Late-age immigrants face formidable economic disadvantages exacerbated by exclusion from public benefits, with implications for immigration, health care, and welfare policy.

AB  - Like Sarah Neal, I find it hard to imagine the Birmingham of the mid-1960s. Where once there were acres of rubble lying under demolition haze there are now broad roads, modern flats and mosques. Even the configuration of the streets around Sparkbrook seems strange, although most of the core remains. The local newspapers and national television show that Birmingham now has has black and Asian people in prominent positions in the politics and administration of the city.

T1  - The 'Bhojpuriya' Mumbaikar: Straddling two worlds
AN  - 1738477297; 201538501
AB  - Using Cultural Studies as the framework, this study investigates how north Indian migrants living in Kandivali east, Mumbai, exercise agency and appropriate Bhojpuri media texts to maintain their regional identity. Bhojpuri, a dialect of Hindi, has emerged as the lingua franca of these migrants hailing from the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Beleaguered by the identity politics of the host city, the migrants turn to the Bhojpuri media to sustain the shared cultural beliefs that permeate their social relations. Familiar images in the media texts ensure continuity with tradition, feeding the resurgent pride of the community. The migrants' aggressive defence of all things Bhojpuri, as well as their desire to sanitise Bhojpuri media of its bawdiness, is a manifestation of their embattled identities seeking validation. This article examines how the Bhojpuri media are intertwined with the migrants' everyday realities. The media reinforce gender roles, alleviate anxieties and gratify desires vicariously. Media representations meld cultural memory with the migrants' newly acquired understanding of the metropolis. In the process, hybrid identities are being fashioned by people on different points of the socio-economic axis. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - A National Construction of Transnational Mobility in the 'Overseas Working Holiday Phenomenon' in Korea
AN  - 1680155170; 201514107
AB  - This study examines the 'overseas working holiday phenomenon' in Korea, drawing on a content analysis of policy and media discourses and qualitative interviews with Korean working holidaymakers in Canada. The study reveals a significant disjuncture between popular representations of transnational mobility and the participants' actual experiences of it. The process of repackaging youth as a potentially 'global generation' in the recent discourse of the working holiday phenomenon in Korea implies that transnational mobility can be a discursive construct that may conceal the immobility of a particular group of people, such as youth. The study argues that transnational mobility should be reconsidered as a symbolic and lived process in which national issues are negotiated and contested. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Producing and reconstructing knowledge on China in Singapore: perspectives from the academics and mass media
AN  - 1680153208; 201514103
AB  - In Singapore, intellectuals, especially those in media and education, are considered as the driving force of formatting public opinion over the social imagination of China and Chineseness. This article, largely based on oral histories of some Singaporean scholars and media professionals and memoirs of related figures, analyzes the choice and acquisition of their knowledge on China. Through the analysis and comparison of their construction of knowledge on China, this article also discusses the accuracy of their understanding of China and how such understandings were formed along with their personal experiences from domestic socialization, education, and professional accumulation. The authors consequently map out the process of how public intellectuals from mass media and academia transform their knowledge imagination of China into the professional opinions that help to reconstruct and shift Singaporean's impression and understandings of China.

T1  - Predictors of intergroup bias in Turkish Cypriots
AN  - 1735656998; 201536984
AB  - We investigated the role of certain individual and group processes on intergroup bias in the context of Cyprus, an island that has endured over 40 years of interethnic tension. One hundred and fifty Turkish Cypriots were asked to complete a survey which assessed intergroup contact and intergroup bias toward Greek Cypriots. Political affiliation, ingroup favoritism and intergroup contact played a role in predicting prejudice toward Greek Cypriots. Path analysis showed the relationship between ingroup favoritism and outgroup prejudice was partially mediated by low intergroup contact. The findings highlight the theoretical and practical implications for prejudice reduction techniques in Cyprus. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The imperialism of race: class, rights and patronage in the Philippine city
AN  - 1692289830; 201521398
AB  - Decisions by the US Supreme Court at the end of the Spanish American War facilitated US colonial expansionism by laying the foundations for a two-tiered system of rights in the Philippines. In tandem with establishing the legal boundaries of citizenship, politicians and media extended a race-based system of governance through speeches and graphic caricatures that racialised Filipinos as underdeveloped and threatening. Both the law and a patron-client system served to create a new Filipino elite that collaborated with the colonial authorities and entrenched cultural imperialism; the racial patterning of white American/Filipino relations was then transduced into class relations among Filipinos that continue to stratify Philippine society, with the Filipino elite replacing the colonial administrators in this two-tiered system of rights. Today, this racial categorisation and organisation of people continues to appear in popular imagery; and the replacement of race by class in a rights-based bifurcation of Philippine society shapes the ways in which penal law in metropolitan Manila is practised and administered so that the poor (some 40 to 50 per cent of the population) experience a diminished, second-class form of citizenship.

T1  - Othering Obama: Racial Attitudes and Dubious Beliefs about the Nation's First Black President
AN  - 1700675574; 201525330
AB  - The literature on descriptive representation indicates that the election of black political leaders may prompt white enmity. We assess this claim by examining the relationship between whites' racial attitudes and their likelihood of othering Barack Obama by labeling him as a Muslim and/or a noncitizen interloper. The findings reveal that both symbolic racial resentment and traditional racial attitudes are associated with othering Obama. In addition, the results reveal that the relationship between racial resentment and othering is substantially mediated by the use of seemingly nonracist frames based on emotional reactions and negative expectations about an Obama presidency. Conversely, much of the effect of belief in traditional antiblack stereotypes was transmitted directly to othering Obama without the use of justificatory frames. Despite claims of racial progress, our findings suggest that racial sentiments -- both overt and symbolic -- continue to play a major role in politics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Visibility and Coping with Minority Stress: A Gender-Specific Analysis Among Lesbians, Gay Men, and Bisexuals in Flanders
AN  - 1680154457; 201513928
AB  - The role of visibility management strategies, as an extended measure of outness related to sexual orientation, has been rarely studied with the aim of explaining the experience of external stressors (i.e., experiences of everyday discrimination and perceived sanctioning of cross-gender behavior) and internal stressors (i.e., internalized homonegativity and general mental distress). In this study, we examined gender differences within these relationships. A non-representative sample of 2,378 lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals was recruited. We found that lesbian and bisexual women scored significantly higher on perceived cross-gender sanctioning and general mental distress compared to gay and bisexual men. Multivariate analysis showed that visibility management was significantly related to the experience of internalized homonegativity in both men and women. Visibility management mediated the relationship between experiences of every day discrimination on the one hand and internalized homonegativity and general mental distress on the other. Finally, we found that compared to gay and bisexual men, lesbian and bisexual women who maintained relatively closed visibility management strategies, reported lower scores on internalized homonegativity but higher scores on general mental distress. We found fewer gender differences related to visibility management than expected and those that we did find were relatively small. Flemish lesbian and bisexual women and gay and bisexual men appear to more alike than different. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Association Football and the Representation of Homosexuality by the Print Media: A Case Study of Anton Hysen
AN  - 1660024740; 201505583
AB  - In March 2011, Anton Hysen (a semiprofessional footballer currently playing in the Swedish fourth division) became only the second association football (soccer) player of any professional disposition to publicly declare his homosexuality while still playing the game. This article provides a textual analysis of the print media's reaction to Hysen coming out and examines whether, in 2011, they portray more inclusive notions toward homosexuality than they did in 1990 when British footballer Justin Fashanu came out. The results advance inclusive masculinity theory as a number of print media sources (mostly British) interview Hysen in the weeks immediately after he came out and publish articles that challenge homophobia. Highlighting a change since 1990, a significant number of articles stress the need for the key stakeholders in football (players, fans, clubs, agents, the authorities, and the media) to accept gay players.

T1  - Representing the Arab Spring in the Iranian press: Islamic awakening or foreign-sponsored terror?
AN  - 2571041495
AB  - The Islamic Republic of Iran, the largest non-Arab country in the region, has sought to play an influential role in regional politics since its establishment in 1979, and the Arab Spring protests have provided the prime opportunity for doing so. The Iranian government has vocally supported the revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya, but has also remained defiantly supportive of the Syrian president despite popular opposition to his government. The Iranian media have been pivotal in communicating the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Using qualitative thematic analysis and Social Representations Theory, this article examines emerging media representations of the Arab Spring in two major English-language Iranian newspapers, The Tehran Times and Press TV. The following two themes are discussed: (1) “Islamic Awakening”: Islamicizing the Arab Spring, and (2) “Bashar Al-Assad is not Muammar Al-Gaddafi”: Compartmentalizing the Syrian Ally. Islamic identity and ingroup–outgroup dynamics are mobilized in order to increase the political influence of Iran and to undermine that of its foes. It is argued that there is a systematic “instrumentalization” of the Arab Spring in the Iranian press – it is employed to validate and accentuate tenets of the Islamic Republic of Iran's revolutionary ideology and to support its political interests in the region.

T1  - The Threat of Terrorism and the Changing Public Discourse on Immigration after September 11
AN  - 1660019642; 201505836
AB  - This article uses articles from the opinion-leading press to investigate how the news media's repertoire of negative portrayals changed after the September 11 terrorist attacks. It is based on a systematic random sample of 360 articles from two, opinion-leading newspapers-one known for its liberal slant (New York Times) and one known for its conservative slant (Wall Street Journal). The sample is drawn from a large population of articles published over a six-year period (1998-2004). The findings show that the percentage of negative frames involving not only terrorism but also other non-terrorist threats increased significantly after September 11. The elevated frequency of negative frames was found in both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but the increase was significantly greater in the conservative periodical. Immigrants from non-European countries were also significantly more likely to be associated with negative frames than European immigrants. These three variables-national origin, news source, and September 11-were strong predictors of negative frames, even when controlling for other correlates. Suggesting an authoritarian turn in American political discourse, the study highlights cultural factors, as opposed to the conventional psychological explanations, as key determinants of the changing public discussion of immigration after September 11.

T1  - Inequality from the top down and bottom up: towards a revised Wacquant
AN  - 1660021113; 201505766
AB  - In this response I focus on two major themes in Wacquant's trilogy: (1) punishment and the state; and (2) territorial stigmatization. I discuss evidence that supports elements of Wacquant's argument, while at the same time demonstrating the need for an account that brings mediating institutional processes of the state, violence, the civil sphere and neighbourhood mechanisms more fully into the larger theoretical picture. I conclude that 'bottom-up' processes of inequality must be integrated with 'top-down' forces of the state to advance our theoretical understanding of penality and spatial marginality in federated and unitary governments alike.

T1  - Consolidating Inter-Media Agenda-Setting Research in Ghana: A Study of Associational Relationships Among Wire, Online, and Print News Media
AN  - 1700676596; 201525310
AB  - Inter-media agenda setting has assumed growing relevance in the field of media and communication studies. However, there is still a paucity of research regarding how the concept operates within the African media landscape. This research attempts to extend the inter-media agenda-setting concept to sub-Saharan Africa by examining relationships between a wire service (Ghana News Agency [GNA]-ghananewsagency.com) and the online versions of three other news organizations in Ghana (dailyguide.com, dailygraphic.com, and Ghanaweb.com). Results indicate that GNA's agenda at Time 1 influenced the issue agendas of Daily Guide, Daily Graphic, and Ghanaweb at Time 2. There were no reciprocal relationships between the three other news media and GNA. While few previous studies have researched this subject, the present study argues that subjecting inter-media agenda-setting dynamics in Ghana to further tests enables us to better understand the theory's utility in an emerging African media terrain.

T1  - 'The Burden of Our Times': Antecedents of Group-Based Guilt and Shame
AN  - 1692289741; 201522291
AB  - The present research examined different mediation effects of perception of ingroup responsibility as a predictor of group-based guilt and shame. Two studies (n1 = 174; n2 = 145), conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina with Serbian participants, showed that perception of ingroup responsibility for atrocities perpetrated against an outgroup led to greater feelings of guilt directly, and also indirectly through personal acceptance of ingroup responsibility. In contrast, it led to greater feelings of shame directly and also indirectly through a perception of threatened group image. In addition, Study 2 showed that perceived legitimacy of personal acceptance of ingroup responsibility moderated the relationship between perception and acceptance of ingroup responsibility.

T1  - What causes prejudice? How may we solve it? Lay beliefs and their relations with classical and modern prejudice and social dominance orientation
AN  - 1559007579; 201432163
AB  - This research aimed to examine lay beliefs about the causes of and solutions to ethnic prejudice towards immigrant populations in the Italian context. The research had two main goals: (a) to explore in Italy what non-experts think causes ethnic prejudice against immigrants, and how they suggest we combat it; (b) to assess whether lay perceptions of causes of ethnic prejudice mediate the relationship between SDO and ethnic prejudice, and whether such mediational effects would depend on the form of ethnic prejudice considered (classical vs. modern). In particular, we hypothesized that lay beliefs about the causes of (but not lay beliefs about solutions to) prejudice towards immigrants may mediate the relation between SDO and prejudice towards immigrants. 520 Italian high school students participated in the study and completed a set of questionnaires regarding these issues. Results showed that Italian respondents were especially likely to attribute the causes of ethnic prejudice towards immigrants to ignorance and close-mindedness, and to recommend as main solutions open-mindedness and tolerance of others' values. Moreover, as predicted, beliefs about causes of ethnic prejudice significantly mediated the relation between SDO and modern (but not classical) prejudice. Implications of our findings for social dominance theory were discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - 'The Normative Idea of Queer is a White Person': Understanding Perceptions of White Privilege Among Lesbian, Bisexual, and Queer Women of Color in Toronto, Canada
AN  - 1641424556; 201500273
AB  - White privilege constructs whiteness as normative and central to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) identities and is reproduced through social norms, media representations, and daily interactions. We aimed to enhance understanding of the processes by which white privilege was experienced among lesbian, bisexual, and queer (LBQ) women of color in Toronto, Canada. We conducted two focus groups with LBQ women of color, one with participants who self-identified as masculine of center (n = 8) and the second with participants who identified as feminine of center (n = 8). Findings indicate that LBQ women of color experience intersectional stigma (e.g., homophobia, racism, sexism) on a daily basis. Participant narratives revealed that white privilege shaped the representations of women of color in a particular way that promoted their exclusion from white LBQ spaces and broader society. By representing queerness as white, LBQ women of color were rendered invisible in both queer and racialized communities. LBQ women of color were further marginalized by constructions of 'real' women as passive, feminine and white, and conversely perceptions of women of color as aggressive, emotional, and hypersexualized. These representations inform spatialized practices and social interactions through constructing racialized communities as discriminatory and 'backwards' while maintaining the invisibility of white privilege and racism in LBQ spaces.

T1  - Passionately Losing Oneself
AN  - 1750223885
AB  - This essay reflects on two of Isabel Coixet's films and the topic of "relationality." It analyzes the strategies often used in her movies to create characters in transition. In this case, their thawing from impossible and imposed patriarchal isolationist and apparently self-sufficient positions will allow them to move towards an embracing of vulnerability. This porosity will allow eventually for affects and, if we move from the personal to the political, to potential community. Deleuze, Butler, Cavarero, Esposito and Nancy among others have reflected on the possibilities/impossibilities of a living-in-common. Isabel Coixet seems to be equally intrigued, and coincides with them in her interest in passages and transitions as the main characters of The Secret Life of Words and Elegy move from ideas to corporeality and to humanity.

T1  - Who Cares What She Thinks, What Does He Say? Links between Masculinity, In-Group Bonding and Gender Harassment
AN  - 1520341113; 201420687
AB  - Previous research has linked threats to masculinity and gender harassment, the most pervasive form of sexual harassment. Using a computer harassment paradigm, an ingroup bonding explanation of this link was directly examined. The study was conducted with heterosexual male undergraduate students from an inner city Australian university. Participants received a threat to masculinity before being exposed to an ostensible gender ingroup member whose reaction to sexist jokes was manipulated. Data from 74 participants revealed that men high on conformity to masculine norms altered their behavior to correspond with feedback from the gender ingroup member after a masculinity threat, whereas men low on conformity to masculine norms rejected gender ingroup feedback after a masculinity threat. A variable examining reported liking of the gender ingroup member produced a similar pattern, while no changes were observed in reported liking of a gender outgroup member These results suggest that the perceived response of other members of the gender ingroup, but not members of the gender outgroup, influence men's proclivity to enact gender harassing behaviors.

T1  - Genocide and constructions of Hutu and Tutsi in radio propaganda
AN  - 1512219130; 201408754
AB  - Radio propaganda clearly played a role in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 in which over a million people, mainly Tutsi, were killed. Foreign media and many commentators saw the propaganda as based on ethnic difference. Through an analysis of eighty-six Radio Rwanda and Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines broadcasts, the author shows how reliance on one explanation -- be it of ethnicity, politics, 'race' or occupation -- falls short and oversimplifies. She argues that in fact the broadcasts 'othered' the target group by simultaneously drawing on multiple constructions of Hutu and Tutsi identities from many periods in Rwanda's history.

T1  - RACIALIZING POVERTY AND POOR RELIEF
AN  - 1520342951; 201413116
AB  - Here is a dazzling book, one that offers a rich genealogy for reflection about our current preoccupations. Open up any newspaper. Switch on any television news program. What you will read and hear is a cacophony of voices, many of them discordant, on how to fix, fund, and perhaps shrink the federal government's spending on those insurance programs first created in the 1930s by the New Deal welfare state. Equally factious are the debates on immigration policy that some hope will resolve how the republic will meet its future labor needs and how it will placate its rising Latino voting public. Will we deport eleven million workers? Will we construct electrified fences to protect our southern border from 'illegal' invasion? Will we offer unauthorized immigrants a path to citizenship? Stay tuned. And while racial politics are clearly at the covert center of these polemics, the discussion of race is rarely overt probably because some now pronounce us a post-racial society.

T1  - Urban Conflicts and Immigrants' Engagement. A Comparative Pragmatic Analysis of Two Northern Italian Cities
AN  - 1504424252; 201405530
AB  - At the beginning of the 1990s, urban safety entered political and media debates in Italy. Since then, an anti-social behaviour discourse has diverted attention towards newcomers who have repeatedly appeared as the main cause of urban safety conflicts. Italian scholars have often described these actors as the passive target of safety policies. The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate that in fact some residents of immigrant origins have engaged in the game of urban conflicts. A comparative analysis will be carried out to discuss contentious dynamics in two Italian cities, by building on ethnographical data collected between 2009 and 2010. The two cities which are the object of the analysis are Verona and Modena. They are situated in the so-called Third Italy, in the north of the country, and are characterised by diverging political subcultures. A consistent part of studies on immigrants' collective action has drawn from the structural perspective and has insisted on political opportunities as a crucial explanatory variable. This contribution will show the added value of complementing this interpretation with a pragmatic sensitive one. Residents of immigrant origins will be observed while undertaking their thorny path of engagement characterised by the capacity to adapt, construct more or less lasting agreements with institutional and non-institutional actors and propose alternative solutions to influence a given context. Ultimately, this will also provide an example of how a pragmatic sensitive stance can help study politics in a continuum with policies, a preoccupation which lies at the core of urban theory.

T1  - 'Unjust, inhumane and highly inaccurate': the impact of changes to disability benefits and services -- social media as a tool in research and activism
AN  - 1494749770; 201400210
AB  - This article details research carried out as part of an MA in Social Research at the University of Leeds (UK). The research was concerned with two key issues: documenting the impact of recent cuts in benefits and services on disabled people; and the role of disabled people's organisations in responding to this impact. It also explored the use of social media in recruiting research participants. Working with Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability, the experiences of 95 disabled people were gathered using focus groups and an online questionnaire distributed via social media. The use of social media to gather participants is something I felt was particularly interesting in relation to disabled people, especially in light of social media's role in current disability rights campaigns, and a method I feel should be explored further.

T1  - How do men with paraplegia choose activities in the light of striving for optimal participation? A qualitative study, based on a phenomenological-hermeneutical method
AN  - 1492601816; 201400225
AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of men with paraplegia with regard to how they choose activities. The study involved a qualitative research design, based on a phenomenological-hermeneutical method. The findings revealed that the activities participants were choosing could be on a continuum between the individual's self and the influence from their environment. On this continuum, the choice to perform activities was influenced by two mediating factors: the individual's activities performed during their life-history, and their activity challenges for the future. We conclude that choosing activities is an individually constructed internal process of negotiation. Feelings of resignation and revolt appear in combination with feelings of justice and injustice when balance is not found. This knowledge provides a better understanding of the impact of spinal cord injury, sheds light on the development of distress after spinal cord injury and sheds new light on individuals' feelings of participation.

T1  - Intermarriage Attitudes Among Minority and Majority Groups in Western Europe: The Role of Attachment to the Religious In-Group
AN  - 1417524882; 201331856
AB  - The key question of this paper is whether social integration, both for minority (migrants) and majority groups (natives) in Western Europe, varies across contexts of exit (ethnic origins) and contexts of reception (Western European countries); and if so, how does religious identity and practice serve to mediate these contextual differences? To investigate this question I draw on the international comparative dataset EURISLAM which includes comparisons between Muslim migrants of ex-Yugoslav, Turkish, Moroccan and Pakistani origin with majority group members of Belgium, Britain, Germany and Switzerland. Social integration is measured through attitudes towards intermarriage across Muslim/non-Muslim lines. As results show, ethnic groups differ in their probabilities to approve of intermarriage. Especially migrants from the former Yugoslavia encounter a significantly lower approval of intermarriage by natives. However, approval of intermarriage is closely tied to religiosity. Once religiosity is controlled for, all migrant groups become significantly more positive about intermarriage than natives. Following theories on in-group favouritism and the homophily principle, we find that religious identity among migrants and practice among both natives and migrants are associated with reluctance to intermarry. Policy makers are advised to take note that contextual differences in perceived social integration of immigrant groups could be confounding other factors, including how differences in religiosity affect social integration. Migrants' significantly higher approval of intermarriage after controlling religiosity implies that policy makers may conceivably have to shift attention from migrants to natives and undertake some action in order to enable a greater intercultural understanding.

T1  - Mass Media and Rural Out-Migration in the Context of Social Change: Evidence from Nepal
AN  - 1417521287; 201332032
AB  - This work examines the influence of mass media on rural out-migration using historical and contemporary data from a setting experiencing massive social and economic development in the last half-century. Data come from the Chitwan Valley Family Study, an ongoing study of an agrarian region in rural Nepal. Media are hypothesized to affect migration by inducing attitudinal and behavioural changes similar to those of other determinants of migration. As their influence differs from other determinants in important ways, media represent a unique form of influence that should be taken into account. I find that movie and television exposure are significant determinants of out-migration in historical contexts, although television exposure was important in more contemporary contexts. Differences in these effects probably indicate the timing of the spread of each type of media and changing preferences among media consumers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Discursive Production of a Mexican Refugee Crisis in Canadian Media and Policy
AN  - 1364702597; 201323407
AB  - This article examines the discursive continuity between newsprint representations of Mexican refugee claimants in 2007 and the subsequent visa policy imposed on Mexicans by the Canadian government. It argues that the production of a Mexican refugee 'crisis' in local media rested on three dominant discourses: the encoding of Mexicans as illegal, criminal and fraudulent Others; the perceived exorbitant costs of refugee claims; and the necessity to control 'illegitimate' claimants to prevent them from exploiting the deficiencies of the Canadian refugee system. Such discourses reveal overt and inferential forms of racism and challenges to the self-proclaimed tolerance of multicultural Canada. The paper is based on a review of newsprint articles and readers' opinions published in Windsor in 2007 and 2008. Three rhetorical devices were predominantly used in media discourses-lexicons, the numbers game, and expert/authority legitimation-to elevate the refugee influx to a level of 'crisis' and to perpetuate a positional superiority over refugee claimants.

T1  - Strength of Social Cues in Online Impression Formation: Expanding SIDE Research
AN  - 1463015114; 201346923
AB  - The social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) predicts individuals in depersonalized settings associate with those with whom they share a salient social identity and disassociate from others. We challenge the strict ingroup/outgroup bifurcation used in prior research and posit that ingroup perceptions differ across distinct (i.e., moderate and extreme) outgroups. A 2 (high cues vs. low cues) * 3 (ingroup, moderate outgroup, extreme outgroup affiliation) experiment utilized 128 subjects to examine how members of an ingroup view individuals belonging to various outgroups. Findings expand SIDE research by addressing the interaction between the valence of social cues to a social group and the strength of those cues. The interaction demonstrates that ingroup members with stronger social cues are more socially identifiable than ingroup members who provided few cues to their ingroup membership, while extreme outgroup members who minimize cues to their identity are more socially identifiable to ingroup members than outgroup members who provide numerous cues.

T1  - Telling the Collective Story? Moroccan-Dutch Young Adults' Negotiation of a Collective Identity through Storytelling
AN  - 1448994727; 201342914
AB  - Researchers taking a social constructionist perspective on identity agree that identities are constructed and negotiated in interaction. However, empirical studies in this field are often based on interviewer-interviewee interaction or focus on interactions with members of a socially dominant out-group. How identities are negotiated in interaction with in-group members remains understudied. In this article we use a narrative approach to study identity negotiation among Moroccan-Dutch young adults, who constitute both an ethnic and a religious (Muslim) minority in the Netherlands. Our analysis focuses on the topics that appear in focus group participants' stories and on participants' responses to each other's stories. We find that Moroccan-Dutch young adults collectively narrate their experiences in Dutch society in terms of discrimination and injustice. Firmly grounded in media discourse and popular wisdom, a collective narrative of a disadvantaged minority identity emerges. However, we also find that this identity is not uncontested. We use the concept of second stories to explain how participants negotiate their collective identity by alternating stories in which the collective experience of deprivation is reaffirmed with stories in which challenging or new evaluations of the collective experience are offered. In particular, participants narrate their personal experiences to challenge recurring evaluations of discrimination and injustice. A new collective narrative emerges from this work of joint storytelling. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Marley Hypothesis: Denial of Racism Reflects Ignorance of History
AN  - 1448996614; 201342901
AB  - This study used a signal detection paradigm to explore the Marley hypothesis -- that group differences in perception of racism reflect dominant-group denial of and ignorance about the extent of past racism. White American students from a midwestern university and Black American students from two historically Black universities completed surveys about their historical knowledge and perception of racism. Relative to Black participants, White participants perceived less racism in both isolated incidents and systemic manifestations of racism. They also performed worse on a measure of historical knowledge (i.e., they did not discriminate historical fact from fiction), and this group difference in historical knowledge mediated the differences in perception of racism. Racial identity relevance moderated group differences in perception of systemic manifestations of racism (but not isolated incidents), such that group differences were stronger among participants who scored higher on a measure of racial identity relevance. The results help illuminate the importance of epistemologies of ignorance: cultural-psychological tools that afford denial of and inaction about injustice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Portrayals of Global Health Worker Migration in Canadian Print News Media: Domestic Concerns vs. Global Awareness
AN  - 1322728105; 201310821
AB  - The global migration of physicians and nurses has implications for health human resources in both source and recipient countries. Of particular concern to academics and policy experts is the "brain drain" of health professionals from under-resourced nations to developed countries, which promote immigration of physicians and nurses to solve their own health worker shortages. How does the general public in these destination countries understand and respond to concerns over migration and immigration of health professionals? This understanding is likely to be influenced in large part by how the issues are portrayed in the news media. News media treatment of this issue was explored by surveying news articles; newspaper columns/editorials; and op-ed pieces; and letters to the editor published in four prominent Canadian newspapers between May 2004 and January 2009, a time frame that included two federal elections in which physician immigration was highlighted as a political issue. Despite the prominence among academics of concern over the brain drain of physicians and nurses from developing countries to Canada and other Western nations, this issue received little attention in print news media discussions, which focused on domestic physician shortages and the role of international medical graduates in filling Canadian needs. While recent federal elections brought concerns about immigrant physicians into the political spotlight in Canada, they did so by focusing on Canadians' health care provision needs to the exclusion of promoting a broader, global awareness that the immigration of health professionals to developed nations such as Canada exacerbates global health disparities.

T1  - A PARADIGM SHIFT IN POLITICAL TOLERANCE SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED
AN  - 1512220984; 201408852
AB  - Since President Obama was first inaugurated, the rhetoric, overt opposition of political ideology, racial overtones, lack of bipartisanship, and reckless disrespect for the Oval Office have been overwhelming. Specifically, the negative reactions towards Obama and his actions culminated into an extreme ideology that far exceeds the past definition of the conservative movement, making it almost unrecognizable. Further, sensitive issues that the media conveniently left out during coverage of the Bush administration suddenly came to the forefront in frighteningly unfair ways. The two huge bailouts that were commissioned under the Obama administration were a culmination of a number of poor policies that were in place well before his time. Additionally, America entered a war that shifted the national budget from a surplus to a grueling deficit; the war consumed lives of many of our young men and women in uniform, and inflicted a seeming never ending series of traumas and injuries on many more of our veterans while not providing an exit strategy. In alignment with his campaign promises, President Obama eliminated unjust military practices and implemented safety nets to aid service men and women who returned home with debilitating financial and mental health circumstances. Despite the several positive steps that the Obama Administration undertook to restore the nation's image in the world through the balanced use of diplomacy and force, the Tea Party Conservatives and their surrogates felt the need for a grass root appeal to reconstruct the political process in America. This article examines the paradigm shifts in President Obama's policy initiatives during the last three and half years, and the situations that led to the Wall-Street movement.

T1  - Which Americans Are More Equal And Why: The Linguistic Construction Of Inequality In America
AN  - 1429630763; 201335806
AB  - Neoliberal economics holds that the unfettered operation of markets is most efficient and produces the best results. Neoliberals have argued, moreover, that American labor is overpriced compared to that of workers worldwide. In this way, their arguments justify increasing inequality in the US and policies that exacerbate this inequality. Using select print media, particularly newspapers and reports from conservative "think tanks," this paper examines the linguistic construction and reproduction of a hegemony that inscribes an increasingly divisive ideology of social inequality, which devalues some marginally located Americans, while placing extraordinary value on others. The paper ultimately offers a measured response to Bourdieu's entreaty to "challenge the production of ... these reactionary think tanks which support and broadcast views of experts appointed by the powerful.".

T1  - Mobile Intimacies In The USA Among Refugee And Recent Immigrant Teens And Their Parents
AN  - 1417526465; 201334084
AB  - Drawing upon semi-structured interviews and open-ended surveys with adolescents who have moved to the USA in the past twelve years, this article explores the nuanced ways in which expectations of authority and autonomy structure mobile phone use in migrant and refugee families. It finds that contrary to reports of US parents who fear that mobile phone rules and restrictions undermine intimacy, refugee families may view restriction as an expression of intimacy because it is related to cultural expectations. Moreover, the article points out that whereas mobile communication almost always provides access to autonomy among white middle class families, these media only sometimes provide access to autonomy among refugee families.

T1  - Transnational Families and Social Technologies: Reassessing Immigration Psychology
AN  - 1347781084; 201318655
AB  - Social technologies-mobile phones, the wide availability of international phone calls, and the mainstreaming of Internet connectivity and social media-are becoming a cornerstone of the immigrant family experience. Information communication technologies (ICTs) are supporting the transformation of family networks into transnational ones, with potentially significant consequences in the psychology of immigration and family mental health. Social technologies may be influencing and mainstreaming the transnational experiences while families are finding resilient ways to confront the difficulties posed by immigration. Computer-mediated communications among transnational families are a source of compelling opportunities and a challenge for clinicians to adopt an ecosystemic perspective and address these new circumstances.

T1  - 'Shameful work': A psychosocial approach to father-son relations, young male unemployment and femininity in an ex-steel community
AN  - 1283640334; 201303358
AB  - Using a psychosocial approach, this paper explores young unemployed men's resistance to work they describe as 'embarrassing' and 'feminine'. The context is the closure of a steelworks in a town in the South Wales valleys, in which their resistance is mediated by father-son relationships that dictate what counts as proper manly work. In this study, young men, as well as their mothers and (where possible) their fathers, were interviewed. The interviews reveal a community suffering the effects of intergenerational trauma and riven with complex feelings about masculinity and femininity. These feelings are projected onto the young men, who feel bullied and shamed by their families, peers and others in the community because they are unable to find gender-appropriate work. The implications of these findings for understandings of youth male unemployment are considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Enregisterment, Communities, and Authenticity: Watching Indonesian Teledramas
AN  - 1315601742; 201307560
AB  - This paper explores how ideas relating to enregisterment and authenticity might contribute to discussions of community. I point out how participation in processes of enregisterment enables people to position themselves as belonging to at least three types of communities: those who can recognize and evaluate enregistered signs, those who are situationally given the authority to perform them, and those who cross. My empirical focus is audio-video recorded interaction from organized teledrama viewing sessions and post-viewing interviews that involved Indonesians studying in Japan. I show how these Indonesians situationally index their membership in one or more of these communities through their authentication and denaturalization of representations of ethnic social types.

T1  - Reconstruing Intolerance: Abstract Thinking Reduces Conservatives' Prejudice Against Nonnormative Groups
AN  - 1322720645; 201310793
AB  - Myrdal (1944) described the "American dilemma" as the conflict between abstract national values ("liberty and justice for all") and more concrete, everyday prejudices. We leveraged construal-level theory to empirically test Myrdal's proposition that construal level (abstract vs. concrete) can influence prejudice. We measured individual differences in construal level (Study I) and manipulated construal level (Studies 2 and 3); across these three studies, we found that adopting an abstract mind-set heightened conservatives' tolerance for groups that are perceived as deviating from judeo-Christian values (gay men, lesbians, Muslims, and atheists). Among participants who adopted a concrete mind-set, conservatives were less tolerant of these nonnormative groups than liberals were, but political orientation did not have a reliable effect on tolerance among participants who adopted an abstract mind-set. Attitudes toward racial out-groups and dominant groups (e.g., Whites, Christians) were unaffected by construal level. In Study 3, we found that the effect of abstract thinking on prejudice was mediated by an increase in concerns about fairness. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1266143394; 201301496
AB  - This article explores the ways in which Mexican transmigrants in the USA discursively construct national identities in relation to the mediated message of a television advertisement for an English-language self-study program marketed to Spanish speakers, called Ingles Sin Barreras. Using narrative analysis of the advertisement and critical discourse analysis of a focus group, the author considers the ways in which identities and ideologies of language and language learning come to be intertwined and circulate across national boundaries.

T1  - Using Computer-Mediated Communication as a Tool for Exploring the Impact of Cultural Identity Clarity on Psychological Well-Being
AN  - 1650147550; 201502294
AB  - Recent theory and research have pointed to the importance of cultural identity clarity for psychological well-being (e.g., Taylor, 2002; Usborne & Taylor, 2010). The present research is an initial attempt to manipulate cultural identity clarity in a laboratory setting and examine its impact on state psychological well-being. In a laboratory experiment, participants were led to experience a clear or an unclear cultural identity during a computer-mediated interaction. For participants who highly identified with their cultural group, negotiating a computer-mediated social interaction with a clear cultural identity led to the highest levels of well-being compared to negotiating this interaction with an unclear cultural identity. Feelings of personal uncertainty were explored as a mechanism explaining the relationship between cultural identity clarity and well-being. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Nationalist competition on the internet: Uyghur diaspora versus the Chinese state media
AN  - 1315600403; 201307529
AB  - This article explores the evolving relationship between nationalism and identity formation as it is now facilitated on the internet. Particularly, it examines the implications of nationalist competition between the Uyghur diaspora online community and Chinese state media. Since the onset of the Information Age, each party has sought to influence international perception of the Uyghur people and their traditional homeland Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) by promoting English language representations of Uyghurs and Xinjiang on the internet. Further, this study looks at the question of how each party's engagement in this online nationalist competition affects either positively or negatively its own agenda. The question is investigated through comparative textual analysis of Uyghur diaspora and Chinese state media websites and an interview with a Uyghur diaspora website administrator.

T1  - Viewing Videos: Class Differences, Black Women, And Interpretations Of Black Femininity
AN  - 1347781308; 201318962
AB  - In the wake of several high profile media incidents and an ongoing dialogue about hip hop culture, representations of Black women in rap videos have become the subject of much media controversy and debate. In academic circles, feminist researchers have long argued that images of Black women in hip hop (and in mainstream media at large) reinforce gendered racist ideals. Yet there is little study of how Black women interpret media images of women, and the research that does exist typically emphasizes Black women's critiques of media glorification of white femininity and their ability to reject these particular images as unrealistic. In this study, we shift the focus to examine how young Black women interpret images of Black femininity, particularly when those images are widely labeled oppressive and objectifying. Using an intersectional framework, we assess the ways class differences among Black women shape the different meanings they attach to the images in rap videos. This work thus contributes to the research that explores women's perceptions of media images, and offers a broader context in which to situate public debates about race, gender, sexuality, and hip hop culture.

T1  - An 'Integrating Enclave': The Case of Al-Hayat, Germany's First Islamic Fitness Center for Women in Cologne
AN  - 1283640027; 201303456
AB  - Muslim minorities in Europe are often portrayed in Western discourses as either secularized and 'integrated' or religiously devout and 'segregated'. The article challenges this common dichotomization. It argues that some Muslim minorities manifest their Islamic identity by concurrently promoting certain aspects of European integration agendas while rejecting others. These individuals endorse active and constructive Muslim participation in majority non-Muslim societies, yet justify any such interactions using ideological or physical constructs that both reaffirm Islam as a binding religious-legal system regulating all aspects of life and fortify identities that are distinct from Western ones. The article examines various models for this duality in the field of sports and focuses on the case of Germany's first Islamic fitness center for women, Al-Hayat in Cologne, which opened in April 2007. Through a field study, the article explores how the gym, which the German media depicts as an example of Muslim segregation but which its owner and members believe to be a force for integration, simultaneously advances aspects of both integration and segregation.

T1  - Recalling a Difficult Past: Whites' Memories of Birmingham
AN  - 1018359198; 201212852
AB  - This article examines the intersection between collective memory and autobiographical memory through in-depth interviews with twenty whites who came of age in the midst of key events in the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham, Alabama. Most interviewees report few autobiographical memories of the events of the Civil Rights Movement and the racial conflict surrounding these events. Instead, many center their recollections on the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. The forgetting of autobiographical memories has been aided by a coalition of silence among whites about the era of integration and by reiterated media images that shaped recollections of the past. These white southerners have been able to renarrativize their pasts to forget memories that link them with the ideology of segregation and to reconstruct the self to be usable in the present. The article demonstrates ways that autobiographical memory is a social construction rather than an act of retrieval. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Financial Strain, Negative Interaction, Coping Styles, and Mental Health Among Low-Income Latinos
AN  - 1081863913; 201235173
AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial strain and depressive symptoms in later life, and potential psychosocial mediators of this relationship. Drawing on a sample of 214 low-income Latino older adults, we used structural equation modeling to test the direct effect of chronic financial strain on depressive symptomatology, and the indirect effects via social support, negative interaction, and coping styles. Findings indicated that financial strain increased the level of depressive symptoms among this sample. Avoidance and approach-related coping styles emerged as independent determinants of depressive symptoms albeit in opposite directions; higher levels of avoidance coping was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Contrary to previous findings on the general population, findings from the current study indicate that social support and negative interaction were not directly associated with depressive symptoms. Financial strain mediated the effect of sociocultural (nativity status, years of U.S. residence) and social status factors (age, education) on depressive symptoms. This study highlights the differential impact of financial strain and coping styles on psychological well-being, and the potential psychosocial targets of interventions for older adults with chronic health care conditions.

T1  - Prevalence and Correlates of Delegitimization Among Jewish Israeli Adolescents
AN  - 907924949; 201124680
AB  - Intractable political conflicts are characterized by a sociopsychological infrastructure (Bar-Tal, 2007) in which individuals are subject to a cognitive and emotional repertoire that legitimizes the use of violence. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of delegitimization, one psychological component theorized as central to the maintenance and reproduction of intractable conflict. Jewish Israeli adolescents completed a survey assessing delegitimization (a process by which members of the outgroup are morally derogated and considered of less existential value than ingroup members), demographic variables, political violence exposure and participation, and attitudes toward policies related to conflict resolution with the Palestinians. Higher levels of delegitimization were associated with being male and with higher reported levels of religiosity, political violence participation, and endorsement of non-compromising attitudes associated with conflict resolution. Analyses supported a conceptual model of delegitimization as a mediator of the relation among a number of demographic predictors and both political violence participation and attitudes toward conflict resolution policies. Implications for conceptual models of delegitimization as a key component of the sociopsychological infrastructure of conflict are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Bosna izvan sebe': Memory, integration, and identity among Bosnians in London
AN  - 896229973; 201120200
AB  - This article explores memory, integration and identity among people of Bosnian origin living in London. I consider how multiculturalism both encourages integration into British society, and identification as Bosnian, and how people of Bosnian origin situate themselves within the broad matrix of multicultural society. In these processes of negotiation and identification, I regard memory as the crucial mediating variable. I first use two texts written by Bosnians in London to derive a theoretical framework for discussing the issue of identity in exile; I then present my ethnographic data, based on unstructured interviews. My findings suggest that integration is a more problematic concept than it often appears: it may on occasion encourage the narration of difficult memories, and, by doing so, heighten the symbolic boundaries it ostensibly transcends.

T1  - Attacks on Indian students: the commerce of denial in Australia
AN  - 896165630; 201120130
AB  - The issue of racist violence appeared in the Australian media and politics in mid-2009 following a spate of attacks on international students in Melbourne and Sydney. The racist aspect of these attacks was downplayed, authorities describing them as 'opportunistic' and a 'regrettable fact of urban life'. The denial of racism is a familiar hallmark of contemporary racism; for some scholars, it is a defining criterion of what has been called the 'new racism'. But the denial of racism around the attacks on Indian international students also had an economic imperative. Negative media coverage within India posed a substantial threat to the AUS $18.6 billion international education export market, with potential students and sponsors becoming concerned about their security should they elect to study in Australia. Data from the Challenging Racism project provide compelling evidence on the racist context of the attacks. The Indian media and politicians maintained an outraged position on the attacks, affecting student interest in Australia. And as the substantial economic costs became clearer, Australian governments came to more openly acknowledge a racist element to the attacks, also hinting at structural issues regarding community relations and attitudes which required policy attention.

T1  - Racial/ethnic residential segregation: Framing the context of health risk and health disparities
AN  - 881468852; 201116487
AB  - An increasing body of public health literature links patterns of racial/ethnic residential segregation to health status and health disparities. Despite substantial new empirical work, meaningful understanding of the pathways through which segregation operates to influence health remains elusive. The literature on segregation and health was appraised with an emphasis on select conceptual, methodological, and analytical issues. Recommendations for advancing the next generation of racial/ethnic residential segregation and health research will require closer attention to sharpening the methodology of measuring segregation, testing mediating pathways and effect modification, incorporating stronger test of causality, exploring factors of resilience in segregated areas, applying a life-course perspective, broadening the scope of the investigation of segregation to include nativity status in blacks and other racial/ethnic groups, and linking segregation measures with biological data.

T1  - Transnationalism in the Aftermath of the Haiti Earthquake: Reinforcing Ties and Second-Generation Identity
AN  - 875715878; 201115302
AB  - This article examines, first, the response of the Haitian Diaspora to the earthquake of January 12, 2010. This research operates within the theoretical framework of transnationalism, and Haitians living outside their country of origin are shown to make use of political, economic, and communication ties to assist loved ones back home and to begin the process of rebuilding their nation. Transnational ties facilitated by corporate entities, the state, and individuals are viewed as essential elements in forging what is often referred to as long-distance nationalism. Second, the article investigates the impact of the earthquake on the identity of members of the second generation -- a group susceptible to the vicissitudes of the public portrayal of Haiti in the popular media and the historical context of Haitian immigrant reception. Results indicate that Haitian identity among the second generation is resilient and, indeed, the earthquake did not diminish identification with Haiti but rather increased it.

T1  - Toward a Model of Social Influence That Explains Minority Student Integration into the Scientific Community
AN  - 896196494; 201120914
AB  - Students from several ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in the sciences, indicating that minority students more frequently drop out of the scientific career path than nonminority students. Viewed from a perspective of social influence, this pattern suggests that minority students do not integrate into the scientific community at the same rate as nonminority students. Kelman (1958, 2006) described a tripartite integration model of social influence by which a person orients to a social system. To test whether this model predicts integration into the scientific community, we conducted analyses of data from a national panel of minority science students. A structural equation model framework showed that self-efficacy (operationalized to be consistent with Kelman's rule orientation) predicted student intentions to pursue a scientific career. However, when identification as a scientist and internalization of values were added to the model, self-efficacy became a poorer predictor of intention. Additional mediation analyses supported the conclusion that while having scientific self-efficacy is important, identifying with and endorsing the values of the social system reflect a deeper integration and more durable motivation to persist as a scientist.

T1  - 'It's Not Just Them, It's Whites as Well': Whiteness, Class and BNP Support
AN  - 875714277; 201115316
AB  - The emergence of the British National Party (BNP), primarily at the local level, has led to a proliferation of political, media and academic accounts seeking to explain its rise. These accounts have focused on a homogeneous, fixed construction of 'the white working class'. This article, written during early 2010, seeks to challenge these assumptions by offering a more nuanced account of the nature of BNP support. It will be suggested that the data available on BNP supporters demonstrates that a focus on such simplistic conceptions of the 'white working class', ignores the heterogeneity that exists within this group, while simultaneously downplaying how BNP voters construct boundaries, drawing on both 'racial' and class distinctions. The article then draws on qualitative interviews conducted with BNP voters in Burley between 2004 and 2005, exploring how notions of entitlement rest on particular, differentiated claims to whiteness -- claims mediated by class and articulated through assertions of 'respectability' and 'responsibility'.

T1  - Law and Identity: Transnational Arranged Marriages and the Boundaries of Danishness
AN  - 852900538; 201103383
AB  - In Denmark, the practice of transnational arranged marriages among immigrants has stirred debate on several levels of society. One effect of the debate is a tightened regulation of family formation migration, seen as an effective means both of limiting the number of immigrants and of furthering processes of social integration. Within media-based and political debates, transnational marriages are frequently described as practices destructive both to individual freedom and to Danish national identity. Nonetheless, it is a practice in which both minority and majority citizens engage, one that frames both their family lives and their lives as citizens. This article analyses the dynamic relationship between public discourse and practices of transnational marriage. The first part describes how political and legislative perceptions of transnational (arranged) marriages are situated within a discussion of 'Danishness'. The second part describes how second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Pakistan, all of whom have married someone from their country of origin, articulate how public discourse on transnationally arranged marriages affects their lives. This part particularly focuses on the informants' expressions of autonomy and choice and their adaptations of such concepts to understandings of social belonging, inclusion and identity formation vis-a-vis the Danish nation-state.

T1  - The Influence of Exemplar Versus Prototype-Based Media Primes on Racial/Ethnic Evaluations
AN  - 907928728; 201124734
AB  - This study examined the individual and combined effects of exposure to positive Latino exemplars and prototypes in the media on White audience members' attitudes about and judgments regarding Latinos in society. Although it was expected that exposure to these favorable models would promote positive evaluations of Latinos among White consumers, the extent to which one mode of presentation could be privileged in the production of more beneficial outcomes was uncertain based on existing research. These results cautiously indicate that while prototypes may offer some advantages in terms of reducing stereotyping, both exemplar- and prototype-based characterizations of positive race-related media content (alone and in combination) can positively influence consumers' perceptions of target racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - Prologue: the riddle of race
AN  - 902082820; 201122214
AB  - Bernard explores the myth of racelessness as it is currently circulating in American social discourse. The election of the first black American president has unleashed the term across the cultural landscape, from the mainstream media to the classrooms in which she teaches African American literature. Students use the term as a twenty-first-century incarnation of the civil rights-era concept of colour blindness. But racelessness does not represent an aspiration for equality as much as it represents an ambition to turn away from the realities of difference. It is code for a common ambition to avoid the realities of institutional racial inequalities, as well as personal experiences of cultural difference. The myth of racelessness intersects uncomfortably with current academic discourse that promotes the view of race as a social construction. Scientifically proven and irrefutably true, this discourse does not allow any room for the social experience of race and racial difference as it is lived by everyone every day, whether we like it or not. The election of President Barack Obama is a portal on to this current confusion about the concept of race, specifically, and blackness, in particular. Many pundits have speculated that Obama would not have been electable if he had had dark skin, if he were irrefutably black, in colour and culture. The fact that he himself has elected to call himself 'black' serves as the platform of Bernard's essay on the case of race in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Language Rights in Relations with Public Administration: European Perspectives
AN  - 870433164; 201114320
AB  - The preservation of linguistic diversity has recently become a major concern to many researchers, politicians and leaders of linguistic communities in Europe. The issue of linguistic minorities has taken on a particular urgency because of the increasing recognition of the threat of extinction faced by many minority languages. The need for immediate action has become obvious. Europe has slowly but steadily started to come up with responses to how to keep the most vulnerable languages from extinction and guarantee rights to speakers of such languages at the same time. Today we can talk about the emergence of a European minimum standard of protection of language rights as it has developed since the 1990s in the European conventions and their monitoring activities. There is general understanding that three areas of the use of languages -- education, administrative affairs and the media -- are determinant for the survival of minority languages. The present article focuses on one of such areas, which has revealed to be particularly contentious and a source of ever-increasing concern. It investigates the guarantees provided in the Council of Europe's instruments pertaining to the use of minority languages before public authorities, the practical difficulties and ways of their overcoming in the implementation of the rights enshrined in European treaties.

T1  - Dispelling stereotypes: promoting disability equality through film
AN  - 835111555; 201100551
AB  - All too often individuals with disabilities in the popular media are portrayed as people to be pitied or super humans to be admired. Film is one important resource that helps form the public's beliefs and dispositions about people with disabilities. With that in mind a film festival was designed to provide authentic representation of people with disabilities living normal lives so as to help viewers see individuals with disabilities as people first. Part of the effort was to develop a more realistic understanding and appreciation for the lives of individuals with disabilities. Various programs were developed across disciplines to present a wide range of perspectives. Following each viewing filmmakers and faculty led in-depth discussions about the films. A participant survey indicated the use of film as an effective pedagogical methodology that provided an entertaining and meaningful way to generate discussion and change attitudes about disabilities.

T1  - The culture of China's mediation in regional and international affairs
AN  - 818801406; 201072422
AB  - Currently there seems to be an increasing interest in and demand for China's mediation in resolving conflict. To a certain extent, such a phenomenon is associated with China's re-emerging power. But more importantly, it is probably the style and skills of China's mediation that matters, which represents the emerging of a unique mediation culture, with China being its messenger. The paper examines key elements of such a mediation culture, using examples of China's mediation in regional and international affairs. The shaping of such a culture offers good lessons for mediators around the world who strive for effective conflict resolution. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Liberated and Inclusive? An Analysis of Self-Representation in a Popular Lesbian Magazine
AN  - 818800543; 201071897
AB  - Comparisons of a popular lesbian lifestyle magazine to a popular heterosexual women's magazine show that lesbian-controlled media do indeed expand representation when it comes to weight, age, and degree of femininity/masculinity, but not in terms of racial representation. An examination of the textual material and visual images also shows that the lesbian publication gives women a more active role, while the heterosexual magazine depicts females as more passive. However, the evidence also shows that the lesbian and heterosexual magazines have similar rates of objectification, but substantively, the lesbian magazine is less severe in degree of objectification.

T1  - Queering Mariel: Mediating Cold War Foreign Policy And U.S. Citizenship Among Cuba's Homosexual Exile Community, 1978-1994
AN  - 754041442; 201053289
AB  - Draws on various secondary sources to examine how anti-Communism & homophobia in the late-Cold War US impacted Cuban & US immigration policies. The gay press's relationship to the larger narrative of the 1980 Mariel boatlift is explored, asserting that the gay press & the US homosexual community helped mobilize queer resistance & support for the Marielitos. In considering the experiences of these Cuban exiles, light is shed on the relationships among immigration, nationality, & sexuality. In particular, the effect of the Refugee Act of 1980 on the Marielitos is discussed in terms of the "state's gaze" on homosexuality. It is contended that the US shifted its homophobic stance on immigration & citizenship in support of those fleeing Cuban Communism. D. Edelman

T1  - Care Work Migration in Germany: Semi-Compliance and Complicity
AN  - 754038787; 201049748
AB  - In this article, we deal with contradictions and paradoxes of the German policies on migration and domestic care work. Although the demand for care workers in private homes is increasing, the German government has turned a blind eye to the topic of migrant care workers. As a result of the mismatch between demand and restrictive policies, a large sector of undeclared care work has come into being. This veritable 'twilight zone' can be coined an 'open secret' as it is the topic of extensive discussions among the populace and in the media. We will address various discrepancies in the debate on migrant domestic work in Germany by providing a view from multiple actors' perspectives. Examining the intersections of gendered migration and care regimes, we assert that undeclared care migration is an integral part of German welfare state policies, which can be characterised as compliance and complicity.

T1  - The Hindi Film's Romance and Tibetan Notions of Harmony: Emotional Attachments and Personal Identity in the Tibetan Diaspora in India
AN  - 754037177; 201049742
AB  - In this article, Tibetans in the diaspora in India are shown to be engaged in emotional processes that connect very different themes of their lives. Their attachment to both Tibetan moral notions and Indian popular cultural representations is theorised with reference to emotional attachment as appropriation into the sense of what belongs with oneself. Both normative Tibetan moral notions and aspirational Indian popular-cultural representations are appropriated by Tibetans born and raised in India. On the one hand, Tibetan moral notions of harmonious relationships present generally salient norms for Tibetans, and are connected to polyandry and idealised representations of Tibet in older people's discourse. On the other hand, Indian popular film and television are ubiquitous in Tibetan everyday life. The ethnography presented demonstrates that Indian popular culture has helped to shape Tibetan diasporic aesthetics and historicity and provides an idiom for ideas and practices of love, romance and marriage for younger Tibetans in India.

T1  - A Paradox of Integration? Interracial Contact, Prejudice Reduction, and Perceptions of Racial Discrimination
AN  - 743066950; 201043232
AB  - A random digit dialing survey (N = 596) investigated the relationship between quantity and quality of interracial contact and Black South Africans' perceptions of racial discrimination in postapartheid society. Results showed that harmonious contact was associated with lower levels of perceived collective discrimination, an effect that was mediated by racial attitudes and personal experiences of racial discrimination. The implications of the survey's findings are discussed in relation to two models of social change in social psychology (cf. Wright & Lubensky, 2008): a model of change grounded in the rehabilitation of the prejudiced individual and a model of social change grounded in collective awareness of, and resistance to, systemic inequality.

T1  - 'Reciprocal recognitions': race, class and subjectivity in Tony Harrison's The Loiners
AN  - 754044660; 201053369
AB  - Over the last four decades, the work of Tony Harrison has won him the status of England's alternative poet laureate, some of it reaching a mass audience through the medium of film and television. At its heart lies a radical republicanism often expressing itself through an impassioned dialectic between race, class and culture. Yet, despite the honours and critical acclaim that have punctuated his career, this aspect of his work has been less explored. Here, Nicholson examines the seminal influence on Harrison s poetry of his time in Nigeria, with particularly reference to his early collection The Loiners, and relates it to the analysis of colonialism developed by Frantz Fanon.

T1  - Adolescent Same-Sex Attraction and Mental Health: The Role of Stress and Support
AN  - 743051694; 201026676
AB  - This study draws on the social stress model from the sociology of mental health to examine the impact of same-sex attraction on depressed mood and suicidal tendencies. Specifically, we hypothesize that across multiple contexts, adolescents with same-sex attractions are likely to experience more social stress and less social support than heterosexual adolescents. In turn, these experiences increase the likelihood of negative mental health outcomes. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 11,911), we find that adolescents with same-sex attraction are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to report depressed mood and suicidal tendencies. Moreover, stress and social support were found to mediate a substantial part of the relationship between same-sex attraction and depressed mood. In addition, stress and social support mediated about one third of the relationship between same-sex attraction and suicidal tendencies. These findings give strong support for the social stress model. We conclude with a discussion of the role that alienation plays in same-sex-attracted adolescent mental health.
