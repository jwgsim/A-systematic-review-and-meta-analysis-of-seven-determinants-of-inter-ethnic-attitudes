AB  - This exploratory study investigates how consumer knowledge influences willingness to buy (WTB) insect food products. A comparative approach between Northern and Central Europe is adopted to explore whether consumer knowledge has different effects on WTB across cultural areas in Europe. The study analyses consumer survey data collected in Finland, Sweden, Germany, and the Czech Republic (N = 887) with structural equation modelling and multi-group models. The results suggest that the effects of distinct types of knowledge and food neophobia on WTB are mainly indirect and mediated by general attitudes, with these effects differing significantly between Northern and Central Europe. In Northern Europe, the consumers' objective and subjective knowledge of insect food predict WTB as much as previous product-related experiences and food neophobia. In Central Europe, product-related experiences and food neophobia are superior predictors to subjective and objective knowledge. Moreover, consumers in Northern Europe generally have a more positive attitude towards insect food than consumers in Central Europe. Possible explanations for the regional differences are discussed, and implications are suggested on how the region-specific features should be regarded when developing consumer education and promotion strategies for insect food.

AB  - Nursing and care robots (NCR) have become an important technological innovation in various areas in the medical discipline. Previous studies have found that implementation of robots in healthcare is both associated with positive and negative attitudes. This study aims to improve the understanding of the general public's communication about nursing and care robots through analyzing the content of posts in social media. An advanced social intelligence platform was used to mine Twitter content. From the platform, data were collected historically. An archival and cross-sectional observational study was conducted online. The data set comprising of 5954 tweets were thematically analyzed. Tweets under the theme of absorbability show that nursing and care robots are considered to be a part of users' lives, either now or sometime in the future for Twitter users, and the topic is tackled as a fact but with humor, skepticism and enthusiasm. Tweets falling under applicability show that potential nursing and care robots usage covers a range of arenas in everyday life. Results thematized as availability show sincere concern about how the accessibility of nursing and care robots in everyday life will affect costs and other economic aspects, both on a global and an individual level as well as on micro and macro levels of economies. Twitter offers a window into attitudes and ideas as well as fundamental beliefs and practices. Thus, monitoring Twitter discussions on social media can provide valuable insights into current attitudes as well as forecasting coming trends. The data includes information about Twitter users' anxious relationships with nursing and care robots. We raise important questions about the nature of nursing and care robots and their implementations, both in health care but also in everyday living.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes in workplace practices as social distancing requirements meant that people were asked to work from home where possible to avoid unnecessary contact. Concerns have been raised about the effects of the pandemic on mental health and, in particular, the effects of social distancing on employed women's mental health. In this study, we explore the experiences of working women during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and explore the factors that may be associated with women experiencing the symptoms of depression. Findings from a cross-sectional survey of European working women (across five countries: France, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK) conducted between March and July 2020 are reported. The data are analyzed using linear regression and mediation analysis. For women, working from home was associated with higher prevalence of the symptoms of depression compared to traveling to a workplace. The study also considers the mechanisms that may explain a relationship between working from home and depressive symptoms. Maintaining contact with people face-to-face and participating in exercise were both significant protective factors against experiencing symptoms of depression during a period of social distancing.

AB  - Despite the prevalence of both chronic and transient loneliness and the detrimental consequences associated with them, as a negatively valenced response to social exclusion, loneliness has received surprisingly little attention in the marketing literature. Drawing on research showing that lonely people often lack meaning in their life, the authors propose that ritualistic behavior that involves consumer products may reduce loneliness by increasing meaning in life. Specifically, a series of studies finds that engaging in even minimal, unfamiliar rituals reduces loneliness among lonely consumers. The results support the important role of meaningfulness. The authors find that the effect of rituals on loneliness is mediated by meaning in life via perceived product meaningfulness. They also find that ritualistic behavior no longer affects loneliness when the experience of meaningfulness can be derived incidentally.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to examine the attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccine and its affecting factors in adults from Turkey.
   Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in February 2021 with a total of 645 adult individuals. The Introductory Information Form, The Scale of Vaccine Hesitancy, and The Attitudes Towards the COVID-19 Vaccine Scale were used to collect the research data. The data were collected online via the snowball sampling method through social media.
   Results: In the study, 33.8% of the participants stated that they will not get vaccinated for Coronavirus. The concerns of the participants about getting the COVID-19 vaccine were, the fact that the vaccine was produced in a very short time (19.8%), fear of the side effects of the vaccine (18.9%), and not finding the contents of vaccines safe (16.2%).
   Conclusions: The factors affecting the positive attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine are, in turn, thinking about getting COVID-19 Vaccine, finding it useful to wear a mask, thinking that the source of COVID-19 is natural, being a healthcare professional and not refusing the vaccine in the past.

AB  - In many countries, such as the US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, governments are dealing with a great shortage of organ donors. Even though people generally show positive attitudes towards organ donation, they often do not actually register as organ donors themselves. This study's objective was to explore prevailing viewpoints among the Dutch population on deceased organ donation and the relation between aspects of the viewpoints potentially influencing the decision to register as an organ donor. Although substantive research about attitudes on organ donation has been conducted, this is the first study investigating people's viewpoints focusing on the relation between beliefs, tastes, preferences, motives, goals and other constituents underlying people's viewpoints on organ donation, such as the role of the media and public policies. This Q-methodology study revealed four viewpoints: "not donating your organs is a waste", "it does not go with my religion", "my family should decide"; and "it's a good deed, but I'm doubtful". These viewpoints convey information on potential reasons for the gap between people's favourable attitudes towards organ donation and the low number of actual registrations, and opportunities for policy makers to address certain target groups more adequately.

AB  - This study utilizes self-consistency motivational theory to investigate the association between employees' experience of co-worker ostracism and their promotive voice, while also examining the mediating role of organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) and the moderating effect of emotional stability. We collected three-wave data from personnel in North American organizations and found that social exclusion by co-workers hinders employees' expression of constructive views about work-related matters as it dampens their OBSE. We observed that this mediating role of OBSE is mitigated to the extent to which employees have emotional stability, a dispositional feature that helps them control emotions, discipline impulses, and handle challenges. Overall, our study identifies a key mechanism, employees' belief about their self-esteem and proficiency as an organizational member, through which co-worker exclusion hampers promotive voice, and it reveals how their emotional stability might contain this process.

AB  - As social distancing and lockdown orders grew more pervasive, individuals increasingly turned to social media for support, entertainment, and connection to others. We posit that global health emergencies - specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic - change how and what individuals self-disclose on social media. We argue that IS research needs to consider how privacy (self-focused) and social (other-focused) calculus have moved some issues outside in (caused by a shift in what is considered socially appropriate) and others inside out (caused by a shift in what information should be shared for the public good). We identify a series of directions for future research that hold potential for furthering our understanding of online self-disclosure and its factors during health emergencies.

AB  - The association of adolescents' appraisals of the antimarijuana TV ads used in the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign with future marijuana use was investigated. The 12- to 18-year-old respondents (N = 2,993) were first classified as users, resolute nonusers, or vulnerable nonusers (Crano, Siegel, Alvaro, Lac, & Hemovich, 2008). Usage status and the covariates of gender, age, and attitudes toward marijuana were used to predict attitudes toward the ads (Aad) in the first phase of a multilevel linear analysis. All covariates were significantly associated with Aad, as was usage status: Resolute nonusers evaluated the ads significantly more positively than vulnerable nonusers and users (all ps <.001), who did not differ. In the second phase, the covariates along with Aad and respondents' usage status predicted intentions and actual usage 1 year after initial measurement. The lagged analysis disclosed negative associations between Aad and usage intentions and between Aad and actual marijuana use (both ps <.05); however, this association held only for users (p <.01), not vulnerable or resolute nonusers. Users who reported more positive attitudes toward the ads were less likely to report intention to use marijuana and to continue marijuana use at 1-year follow-up. These findings may inform designers of persuasion-based prevention campaigns, guiding preimplementation efforts in the design of ads that targeted groups find appealing and thus, influential.

AB  - Objective: Italy was the first European nation to undergo a general lockdown as a means of containing the COVID-19 pandemic. In that period, a significant reduction in pediatric accesses to emergency rooms (ERs) was reported. In this study, we evaluated whether, in addition to the fear of infection, the reduced ER visits were also an indirect indicator of reduced incidence of common seasonal viruses. Methods: Sales data for pediatric formulations of antipyretics and probiotics from 27 pharmacies were evaluated, during March-May 2020, and compared to sales during the same period in 2019. Pediatric accesses in the emergency department (ED) also were evaluated. Results: The median number of antipyretics and probiotics sold per pharmacy was respectively 152 (IQR = 144) and 55 (IQR = 52) in 2019; during the same period of 2020 it was 77.5 (IQR = 60) (p < .001) and 27 (IQR = 44) (p < .05). In the March-May period of 2019, the number of pediatric accesses was 1004, whereas in the same period of 2020 it was 143, a reduction of 85.76% (p < .001). Conclusions: We found a statistically significant reduction in pediatric admissions to the ED during the lockdown, but that this reduction could largely be due to a reduction in seasonal viral disease as an effect of social distancing, mask use, and frequent hand-washing, as mandated by healthcare dispositions.

AB  - Background: Checklists have been used extensively as a cognitive aid in aviation; now, they are being introduced in many areas of medicine. Although few would dispute the positive effects of checklists, little is known about the process of introducing this tool into the health care environment. In 2008, a pre-induction checklist was implemented in our anaesthetic department; in this study, we explored the nurses' and physicians' acceptance and experiences with this checklist.
   Method: Focus group interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of checklist users (nurses and physicians) from the Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care in a tertiary teaching hospital. The interviews were analysed qualitatively using systematic text condensation.
   Results: Users reported that checklist use could divert attention away from the patient and that it influenced workflow and doctor-nurse cooperation. They described senior consultants as both sceptical and supportive; a head physician with a positive attitude was considered crucial for successful implementation. The checklist improved confidence in unfamiliar contexts and was used in some situations for which it was not intended. It also revealed insufficient equipment standardisation.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest several issues and actions that may be important to consider during checklist use and implementation.

AB  - This study examined whether victimization is associated with negatively distorted social cognition (bias), or with a specific increased sensitivity to social negative cues, by assessing the perception of social exclusion and the consequences for psychological wellbeing (moods and fundamental needs). Both self-reported and peer-reported victimization of 564 participants (M-age = 9.9 years, SD = 1.04; 49.1% girls) were measured, and social exclusion was manipulated through inclusion versus exclusion in a virtual ball tossing game (Cyberball). Children's perceptions and psychological well-being were in general more negative after exclusion than after inclusion. Moreover, self-reported but not peer-reported victimi zation was associated with the perception of being excluded more and receiving the ball less, as well as more negative moods and less fulfillment of fundamental needs, regardless of being excluded or included during the Cyberball game. In contrast, peer-reported victimization was associated with more negative mood and lower need fulfillment in the exclusion condition only. Together, these results suggest that children who themselves indicate being victimized have negatively distorted social cognition, whereas children who are being victimized according to their peers experience increased sensitivity to negative social situations. The results stress the importance of distinguishing between self-reported and peer-reported victimization and have implications for interventions aimed at victimized children's social cognition.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous strategies have been proposed to allow for continued resident education while following social distancing guidelines. Diagnostic radiology is largely electronic work, allowing for relatively easy transition to telehealth. Our institution deployed home workstations to interested upper level radiology residents and fellows in order to maintain high volume workload and education, while complying with CDC soda) distancing and quarantine guidelines.
   Materials and Methods: We deployed 28 home workstations with integrated PACS, electronic health record, and reporting system, supporting workflow that matched our on-site processes and allowing residents to work from home while on diagnostic rotations. Two months into the pilot, surveys were sent to trainees and faculty to assess satisfaction related to education, productivity, and wellness. A retrospective study count was performed for a sample of residents in order to assess productivity.
   Results: Residents perceived their remote productivity as unchanged or better than at the hospital, while faculty were more likely to perceive it as decreased, however, objective results showed no difference. Education was largely considered worse or unchanged with very few regarding it as improved. Those utilizing shared-screen signout platforms rated education better than those utilizing voice/telephone communications only. Trainees expressed improvement in wellness and quality of life.
   Conclusion: Home workstations for trainees represent a feasible solution for implementing social distancing or even quarantine while maintaining operational productivity. There is the added benefit of scheduling flexibility, option to overcome space constraints, and improved quality of life.

AB  - Individual differences in explicit prejudice have long been a central concern in intergroup relations, yet no study has investigated the latent structure of prejudice. Whereas some media reports, lay classifications, and historical notions of prejudice focus on a prejudiced type of person, more recent conceptualizations of prejudice explain it as a dimension with any given individual falling along a continuum from low to high. In the first taxometric research to assess attitudes, two studies used taxometric methods to explore whether explicit prejudice is best considered dimensional (i.e., differing in degree) or taxonic (i.e., differing in kind). In Study 1, 130 undergraduates (M age = 19.2 years, ranging from 18 to 26) completed measures of explicit prejudice toward Muslims. These results largely supported a dimensional latent structure. In Study 2, 448 non-Hispanic participants (M age = 46.2 years, ranging from 18 to 86) completed three measures of explicit prejudice toward Hispanics (modern racism, social distance, and negative traits) via the internet. Results were consistent with a dimensional latent structure. Implications for promoting intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - Background While research has focused on understanding teachers' attitudes towards the inclusion of children with special educational needs into general education classrooms, there are lacunae that have yet to be addressed. This study examined the association between perceived self-efficacy and attitudes towards inclusion among elementary school teachers. The study also examined the role of teachers' self-efficacy as a mediating variable between knowledge of inclusion policy, perception of school support and teachers' attitudes towards inclusion.
   Methods Teachers (N = 352) working in general or special education schools completed questionnaires assessing attitudes towards inclusion, sense of self-efficacy, knowledge of current policy, and perception of support for inclusive practices.
   Results Higher perceived knowledge of inclusion policy and higher perceived school support of inclusion were both related to higher self-efficacy regarding inclusion, which, in turn, was related to more positive attitudes about inclusion.
   Conclusion Our results suggest that point to being knowledgeable regarding local and national policy is important in order to increase feelings of self-efficacy regarding the implementation of effective educational practice. To enhance inclusion, local and national policy must be clearly communicated to teachers. Furthermore, leadership and a supportive school environment are conducive to successful inclusive education.

AB  - BackgroundThere is increasing evidence that subjective age is an important predictor of beneficial health outcomes besides chronological age. However, little is known about the factors associated with younger subjective age. This study aimed to identify which factors are predictive of feeling younger in old age. In this context, feeling younger was defined as an individual's perception of being younger than their current chronological age. MethodsData from 4,665 community-dwelling older people were drawn from wave 7 (2020) of the German Aging Survey (DEAS), a nationally representative study in Germany. Network, mediation, and binomial logistic regression analyses were performed to reveal the associations between feeling younger and biopsychosocial factors. ResultsA total of 4,039 participants reported feeling younger, while 626 did not. Older chronological age, engaging in sports more frequently, a better standard of living, a better state of health, higher satisfaction with life, more positive attitudes toward one's aging, and fewer depressive symptoms are associated with feeling younger in older people. ConclusionThe present study provides novel and consistent evidence regarding the association between feeling younger and biopsychosocial factors. Further research is needed to confirm these factors and identify how they can be adapted in potential intervention studies to generate the life and health circumstances that allow older people the benefit of feeling younger.

AB  - The present research endeavours to comprehend the young S&T graduates' intention toward pursuing an entrepreneurial career in a developing nation i.e., India. Using a modified version of Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as our conceptual model, we attempted to integrate three additional constructs (perceived career option, entrepreneurial knowledge and entrepreneurial personality traits) to explain the relationship between a list of antecedents and entrepreneurial intention (EI). Structural equation modelling (SEM) technique has been implemented while analysing the data, collected through a self-administered questionnaire survey of five premier technology institutes in India. Findings, using a sample size of 476 young Science & Technology graduates at Indian Institute of Technology (IITs), suggest that a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship when reinforced by required entrepreneurial knowledge and the existence of viable entrepreneurial career option significantly influence EI. We found a positive but relatively weak influence of subjective norms on intention formation. Further, our findings recognise that the relationship between entrepreneurial personality traits and EI is fully mediated by perceived self-efficacy. Moderating effect suggests that student's perceived self-efficacy boosts the entrepreneurial personality traits to EI relationship. The results also reinforced the appropriateness of incorporating auxiliary constructs in base TPB, as our conceptual model provides additional predictive power and a better understanding of how entrepreneurial intent develops.

AB  - In a time when freedom of movement is being challenged by an increasing number of European Union member states, and where immigration has been dominating public debate for years, this study investigates the effects (i.e. frame salience and frame sentiment) of migration news on individuals' attitudes about free movement. We are taking into account respondents individual media diet by linking a two-wave online survey in five European countries (n = 7,794) with an automated content analysis of online news coverage in these countries (n = 26,696). Findings indicate that overall the salience of specific frames (i.e. labour market and security), as well as sentiment, positively influence free movement attitudes among citizens. However, there are country-specific differences for both salience and sentiment effects. These findings have implications for our understanding of media effects on immigration attitudes and policy preferences as well as for comparative media effects research in general.

AB  - The spillover of racism towards welfare opinions has previously been studied in several countries. This paper analyses how racism and welfare are formed intertwined in Austria. This remains an important topic, as the welfare state not only distributes material resources but is also seen as a site of socialization - at least within the German-speaking literature. Besides identifying a potential spillover effect within survey data for Austria, the article also discusses how the topics of the racialized, especially in the form of the migrant "other" and welfare state and support, are rhetorically linked within newspaper articles. Four rhetorical strategies are distinguished within the empirical material using the notion of the undeserving "other" to argue, among others, for general welfare state cutbacks. These strategies also introduce arguments for extreme cases of social exclusion within the welfare state that affect existing views on, and possibly also, society and social life itself.

AB  - Numerous studies have found that perspective-taking reduces stereotyping and prejudice, but they have only involved negative stereotypes. Because target negativity has been empirically confounded with reduced stereotyping, the general effects of perspective-taking on stereotyping and prejudice are unclear. By including both positively and negatively stereotyped targets, this research offers the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses: The positivity hypothesis predicts that perspective-taking produces a positivity bias, with less stereotyping of negative targets but more stereotyping of positive targets. In contrast, the stereotype-reduction hypothesis predicts that perspective-taking reduces stereotyping, regardless of target valence. Three studies support the stereotype-reduction hypothesis. Perspective-taking also produced less positive attitudes toward positive targets, with reduced stereotyping mediating this effect. A final study demonstrated that perspective-taking reduced all stereotyping because it increased self-other overlap. These findings help answer fundamental questions about perspective-taking's effects and processes, and provide evidence that perspective-taking does not improve attitudes invariantly.

AB  - Background and objectives: The treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia is a major challenge for mental health care. One randomized controlled trial found that cognitive therapy for low-functioning patients reduced avolition and improved functioning, using an average of 50.5 treatment sessions over the course of 18 months. The aim of our current pilot study was to evaluate whether 20 sessions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for negative symptoms (CBT-n) would reduce negative symptoms within 6 months. Also, we wanted to test the cognitive model of negative symptoms by analyzing whether a reduction in dysfunctional beliefs mediated the effects on negative symptoms.
   Method: In an open trial 21 adult outpatients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder with negative symptoms received an average of 17.5 sessions of CBT-n. At baseline and end-of-treatment, we assessed negative symptoms (PANSS) and dysfunctional beliefs about cognitive abilities, performance, emotional experience, and social exclusion. Bootstrap analysis tested mediation.
   Results: The dropout rate was 14% (three participants). Intention-to-treat analyses showed a within group effect size of 1.26 on negative symptoms (t = 6.16, vertical bar Sig = 0.000). Bootstrap analysis showed that dysfunctional beliefs partially mediated the change.
   Limitations: The uncontrolled design induced efficacy biases. Also, the sample was relatively small, and there were no follow-up assessments.
   Conclusions: CBT-n may be effective in reducing negative symptoms. Also, patients reported fewer dysfunctional beliefs about their cognitive abilities, performance, emotional experience, and social exclusion, and this reduction partially mediated the change in negative symptoms. The reductions were clinically important. However, larger and controlled trials are needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Children rely on their understanding of others' mental states to help them navigate complex social contexts involving moral judgments and group membership. This study examined the relationship between mental state understanding, group membership, and moral judgments. Children (4-10 years old, N = 120, MAge = 6.87 years, SDAge = 1.81), were interviewed and told about hypothetical peers who created advantages for their team that varied in the moral status of their intentions. Analyses revealed that morally-relevant Theory of Mind competence mediated the relations between group membership, attribution of intentions, and social exclusion when an advantage had both moral and intentional motives, but not when an advantage was a straightforward moral transgression. Morally-relevant Theory of Mind was predictive of person judgments and varied based on ingroup/outgroup status of the target. Future work should consider how children's mental state understanding interacts with ingroup biases to affect outcomes in other contexts.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated disease (COVID-19) outbreak seriously challenges globally all health care systems and professionals. Expert projections es- timate that despite social distancing and lockdown being practiced, we have yet to feel the full impact of COVID-19. In this manuscript we provide guidance to prepare for the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer patients and advise on how to triage, prioritize and organize diagnostic procedures, sur- gical, radiation and medical treatments.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to extend prior research on the influence of consumer-cause identification on the intention to purchase products from the companies supporting the cause and re-evaluates the role of attitude toward the cause as a mediator of the relationship between identification and intention to purchase. Design/methodology/approach Using a questionnaire, a sample of 156 Portuguese consumers evaluated their personal identification and attitude to one of four causes. Partial least squares path modeling was used to evaluate the proposed conceptual model. Findings The results reveal that more than identification, a positive attitude is vital to be able to predict the intention to purchase. Together, consumer-cause identification and attitude explain 35.1 percent of the variance in purchase intention. The findings show also that attitude acts as a mediator in the relationship between the identification with the cause and intention to purchase. Several differences regarding gender and age are also revealed. Originality/value While the majority of studies were single cause evaluations, the current results are based on the assessment of multiple causes. Consequently, the findings are more comprehensive and robust, providing important insights to researchers. The conclusions confirm within a wider context the role of attitude as a mediator of the identification and intention to purchase and can further assist companies in designing better targeted cause-related marketing campaigns.

AB  - The present paper adopts and substantiates a superiority-inferiority hypothesis on disparagement humor generation and appreciation. Two between-subjects (identification with a character acting as victimizer or victim) experiments address disparaging humorous advertising effectiveness, providing a novel perspective on very old questions. Perceived superiority and inferiority autonomously mediate the relationship between a disparaging advertisement and perceived humorousness. Individuals with high superiority motivation (i.e., high-katagelasticists) experience increased humorousness and an improved attitude toward the brand when they identify with a character acting as victimizer in the disparaging ad. People with a motivation to avoid inferiority (i.e., high-gelotophobes) experience reduced humorousness and lower positive attitudes toward the brand when they identify with a character who is victimized in the disparaging ad. Gelotophiles are not driven by feelings of superiority or inferiority and experience increased humorousness as well as more positive brand attitudes irrespective of the ad's victimization focus.

AB  - When the novel coronavirus entered the US, most US states implemented lockdown measures. In April-May 2020, state governments started political discussions about whether it would be worth the risk to reduce protective measures. In a highly politicized environment, risk perceptions and preferences for risk mitigation may vary by political inclinations. In April-May 2020, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 5517 members of the University of Southern California's Understanding America Study. Of those, 37% identified as Democrats, 32% as Republican, and 31% as Third Party/Independent. Overall, Democrats perceived more risk associated with COVID-19 than Republicans, including for getting infected, being hospitalized and dying if infected, as well as running out of money as a result of the pandemic. Democrats were also more likely than Republicans to express concerns that states would lift economic restrictions too quickly, and to report mask use and social distancing. Generally, participants who identified as Third Party/Independent fell in between. Democrats were more likely to report watching MSNBC or CNN (vs. not), while Republicans were more likely to report watching Fox News (vs. not), and Third Party/Independents tended to watch neither. However, political inclinations predicted reported policy preferences, mask use, and social distancing, in analyses that accounted for differences in use of media sources, risk perceptions, and demographic background. In these analyses, participants' reported media use added to the partisan divide in preferences for the timing of lifting economic restrictions and reported protective behaviors. Implications for risk communication are discussed.

AB  - The branding literature repeatedly emphasizes the role brands play in shaping consumer identities. In this context, the rise of global consumer groups gives global brands a prominent role as potential tools for consumer identification. Specifically, consumer segments that idealize global communities and/or hold positive attitudes toward various aspects of globalization are particularly prone to using global brands in order to strengthen their identification with the global world. Against this background, this paper empirically investigates the mediating roles of (a) consumer attitudes toward globality and (b) identification with global brands on the relationship between consumer orientations toward globality and global brand ownership. Findings from a study with 300 French consumers provide evidence of full mediation in line with the theoretically derived causal structure linking consumer orientations to brand ownership through consumer attitudes and brand identification. The paper discusses implications of the findings for theory, practice and future research directions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable consumption obtains ever-increasing importance due to pressing social, environmental and economic issues. Extensive research has proposed the use of social norm communication as an effective means to encourage various kinds of pro-environmental behaviour, as well as sustainable consumption. However, although crucial to the development of effective social norm campaigns, tangible evidence for specific processes and conditions through which social norms foster sustainable consumption remains scarce. Thus, we aim to illuminate the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions of social normative influences and clarify how to effectively communicate social norms. Study 1 examines personal norms as a mediator of social normative influences on consumers' purchase intention for an unsustainable product, including the interacting role of personal traits (i.e., self-efficacy and self-concept). The results reveal that personal norms fully mediate the effect of perceived social norms on purchase intentions. For participants expressing high generalized self-efficacy, an additional direct effect of perceived social norms on purchase intentions arises. The same pattern appears for a strong collective but not for a strong relational self-concept. Study 2 investigates sender-specific (i.e., social distance) and recipient-specific (i.e., gender and pro-sustainability world view) factors impacting the relative influence of social normative message frames (i.e., injunctive vs. descriptive) on purchase intentions towards a sustainable product. The results reveal an interaction effect for social distance and for gender, but not for pro-sustainability world view. This research proposes implications for researchers, as well as marketers, and emphasizes auspicious aspects as a springboard for future research.

AB  - Background
   Equitable access to basic public health services is a priority in China. However, primary healthcare workers' competence to deliver public health services is relatively poor because they lack professional training. Since the availability of web-based training has increased in China, the current study explored stakeholders' perceptions of a web-based training program on basic public health services to understand their thoughts, experiences, and attitudes about it.
   Methods
   Six focus group discussions with primary healthcare workers and three with directors of township hospitals, county-level Health Bureaus, and county-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were conducted in Yichang City during 2013. Semi-structured topic guides were used to facilitate qualitative data collection. Audio recordings of the sessions were transcribed verbatim and theme analysis was performed.
   Results
   Most of the study's participants, especially the village doctors, had insufficient knowledge of basic public health services. The existing training program for primary healthcare workers consisted of ineffective traditional face-to-face sessions and often posed accessibility problems for the trainees. Most of the study's participants had a positive attitude about web-based learning and expressed a strong desire to receive this novel training approach because of its flexibility and convenience. The perceived barriers to utilizing the web-based training method included poor computer literacy, lack of personal interaction, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of time and motivation. The facilitators of this approach included the training content applicability, the user-friendly and interactive learning format, and policy support.
   Conclusions
   Web-based training on basic public health services is a promising option in rural China. The findings of the study will contribute knowledge to implementation of web-based training in similar settings.

AB  - Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has been a subject of heated debate. The external perception is that algorithms and machines cannot offer better diagnosis than radiologists. Reluctance to implement AI maybe due to the opacity in how AI applications work and the challenging and lengthy validation process. In this study, Saudi radiology personnel's familiarity with AI applications and its usefulness in clinical practice were investigated.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia among radiology personnel from March to April 2021. Radiology personnel nationwide were surveyed electronically using Google form. The questionnaire included 12-questions related to AI usefulness in clinical practice and participants' knowledge about AI and their acceptance level to learn and implement this technology into clinical practice. Participants' trust level was also measured; Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences between groups.
   Results: A total of 224 respondents from various radiology-related occupations participated in the survey. The lowest trust level in AI applications was shown by radiologists (p = 0.033). Eighty-two percent of participants (n = 184) had never used AI in their departments. Most respondents (n = 160, 71.4%) reported lack of formal education regarding AI-based applications. Most participants (n = 214, 95.5%) showed strong interest in AI education and are willing to incorporate it into the clinical practice of radiology. Almost half of radiography students (22/46, 47.8%) believe that their job might be at risk due to AI application (p = 0.038).
   Conclusion: Radiology personnel's knowledge of AI has a significant impact on their willingness to learn, use and adapt this technology in clinical practice. Participants demonstrated a positive attitude towards AI, showed a reasonable understanding and are highly motivated to learn and incorporate it into clinical practice. Some participants felt that their jobs were threatened by AI adaptation, but this belief might change with good training and education programmes.

AB  - Purpose This study examines whether the relationship between ambivalence in leader-member exchange (LMX) and career commitment is influenced by organizational embeddedness as a mediating variable. There is also an investigation of when and to what extent job strain influences the conditional indirect effect between LMX ambivalence on career commitment via the mediator. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 1,134 accountants working in various disciplines. The PROCESS macro and a bootstrapping procedure were used to test and analyze the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results revealed that the direct relationship between LMX ambivalence and career commitment was partially mediated by organizational embeddedness. In addition, high levels of job strain through organizational embeddedness conditionally make the effects of ambivalence on career commitment stronger. Practical implications Organizations should motivate employees to tolerate uncertain situations at work and practice ways of maintaining a positive attitude. Training programs for employees to appreciate ambivalence and for leaders to be more behaviorally consistent and more effective in team communication should be considered. Originality/value This research is among the initial attempts to extend relevant knowledge in the fields of LMX quality and organizational embeddedness by identifying an important moderator that amplifies the structural relationship.

AB  - This research investigates the impact of external environment, cognitive factors, and behavioral dimensions in the context of implementing supply chain agility. It applies social cognitive theory to establish a link between various environments including business uncertainty and supply chain disruption risk, cognitive factors such as supply chain agility self-efficacy, trust, and supply chain cooperation, coordination, and communication attitude, and actions such as implementing supply chain agility as well as behavior to explain the decision-making process in implementation. Based on the survey data collected from 254 supply and purchasing managers in the Korean manufacturing industry, AMOS software with structural equation method was used for data analysis Our results support the concept that business uncertainty reduces self-efficacy in supply chain agility although both business uncertainty and supply chain disruption risk boosted trust in the supply chain as well as buyers' positive attitude toward supply chain cooperation, coordination, and communication. The concept of supply chain agility, self-efficacy, trust, and supply chain cooperation, coordination, and communication attitude have a positive impact on firm performance. Supply chain agility, selfefficacy, and trust in suppliers positively affects implementation of supply chain agility as well as firms' financial, operational, and supply chain performance. This research provides meaningful insights for considering external environments and cognitive factors while making decisions in implementing supply chain agility.

AB  - The spread of COVID-19 and its subsequent social distancing policies have profoundly impacted the lives of parents and children. Prolonged exposure to parenting-related responsibilities and heightened levels of family conflict under stay-at-home orders coupled with reduced access to support systems and resources have rendered parents and children more prone to stress and mental health difficulties. Drawing on a transactional model of parent-child interactions, the present study applied an actor-partner interdependence model approach to examine the transactional relationship between COVID-19-related stress and mental well-being among parents and children. Data from 109 Chinese parent-child dyads in Hong Kong were included in the study. Parents and their 8- to 10-year-old children completed a questionnaire on COVID-19-related stress, parent-child relationships, and mental well-being. The results showed that 53.2% and 30.3% of the parents and children, respectively, showed poor mental well-being, indicating possible emotional problems. Both actor and partner effects of parent COVID-19-related stress were found. Parent COVID-19-related stress was indirectly related to lower levels of parent and child mental well-being, through the mediation of parent-child conflict. To facilitate psychological adjustment following the COVID-19 outbreak, effective family-based mental health and parenting interventions are needed to promote family cohesion and alleviate stress-induced psychological symptoms. Even in the time of social distancing, telepsychotherapy and other online non-psychotherapeutic interventions can serve as a valid alternative for parents and children who experience excessive distress. Implications for psychological services, family-friendly policies, and social protection measures are also discussed.

AB  - Background: The use of social media by university students is recognized worldwide. Student nurses are no exception, yet no studies have been reported to investigate the nurse students' use and views of social media in Jordan. The current study aims to assess the validity and reliability of an Arabic version of the modified Students Nurses' Use and Views of Social Media survey.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted on 395 student nurses aged 19-39 enrolled at two universities (one public and one private) in north Jordan, information on their use and attitude to social media was obtained using the Arabic version of the Students Nurses' Use and Views of Social Media survey. Exploratory factor analysis and correlation matrices were conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the tool.
   Results: The Arabic version of the tool had a 0.84 alpha of internal consistency indicating a high level of reliability. The scale showed multi-dimensionality with items loading on two factors.
   Conclusion: The Arabic version of the Students Nurses' Use and Views of Social Media questionnaire demonstrated initial reliability and validity. This study reports positive attitudes of Jordanian student nurses towards professional and academic use of social media.

AB  - Introduction: The current study addresses how sexualizing online media practices, i.e., exposure to sexually explicit Internet material and receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, relate to the acceptance of sexist attitudes among adolescents. Specifically, it extends previous research on the acceptance of rape myths by exploring a construct related to these beliefs, i.e., resistance towards the metoo-movement.
   Methods: The study is based on a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey among 568 Flemish adolescents (15-18 years old, Mage = 16.4, SD = .98, 58.3% girls) that measured adolescents' sexualizing online media use, sexist attitudes and objectification processes.
   Results: The results showed that exposure to sexually explicit internet material, but not receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, was related to more resistance towards the metoo-movement and the acceptance of rape myths through notions of women as sex objects. Self-objectification did not function as a valid mediator in the examined relations. Gender and self-esteem did not moderate the proposed relations.
   Conclusions: The findings underline the role of media use in how adolescents develop sexist beliefs and, more precisely, beliefs about contemporary actions to combat sexism, i.e., the metoo-movement. The present study showed that sexual objectification fueled by sexually explicit internet material may result in less positive attitudes and, thus, more resistance towards this movement.

AB  - Background: Social media has become an integrated part of nursing profession, requiring nursing students to develop confidentiality and professional fitness to practice. The aim of this study was to investigate nursing students' usage, professionalism and attitudes toward social media. Methods: A cross-section study was conducted online among undergraduate nursing students (n = 654). Questionnaires of self-directed learning, self-efficacy and usage and views toward social media were administered. Ethical considerations: Ethical approval was obtained from the Hubei University of Chinese Medicine. Results: All participants were social media users. QQ (93.2%) was the most frequently used. 74.5% respondents spent 2-6 h on social media daily. The majority held positive attitudes toward social media. Year group and gender had influence on perceptions and attitudes toward social media. Furthermore, 81.5% students believed that social media positively influenced self-directed learning. Self-directed learning and learning motivation acted as predictors of the attitudes toward social media. Meanwhile, 67.3% students had posted personal photos and videos online, and 82.4% of them did not have privacy setting on social media. In addition,13.8% students attacked others or posted improper photos online. 22.9% participants witnessed improper posts from schoolmates or teachers, such as complaints about schoolmates or teachers (22.2%), foul language (11.1%), violence (3.9%), sexually suggestive photos (2.6%) and patient confidentiality (0.7%). In all, 15.0% respondents accepted "friend request" from patients. A total of 58.2% students were not aware of professional standards of behavior online for health care providers. In addition, 52.3% participants insisted that it is essential to develop social media and professionalism course for nursing students. Conclusion: Nursing students use social media extensively. Some students are at risk of carrying out unprofessional behavior which have detrimental effects on students' future opportunities. This suggests that best practices and training in nurse education should be implemented to help students to be informed of professionalism.

AB  - Purpose Capital controls restrict cash withdrawals and international transfers, among other restrictions. The purpose of the study is to explore how capital controls have influenced m-banking usage and disclose the underlying factors that explain m-banking usage intentions. Design/methodology/approach Grounded on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study assumes that usage behavior may be different from intentions to adopt. In-depth interviews (study 1) were employed with both consumers and bank employees to explore the factors of m-banking adoption under capital controls, followed by an online survey (study 2) pertaining to examine the relationships between underlying factors. Findings Study 1 reveals that the growth of m-banking usage is strongly associated with capital controls that perceived ease of use, usefulness, risk, technology anxiety and decision comfort are significant attributes in influencing usage intention. Study 2 verifies that most underlying factors are important predictors of m-banking usage intention, except technology anxiety does not impact m-banking usage. Research limitations/implications The respective effects on usage intentions may be different in the absence of capital controls. A similar study could examine the importance of the respective constructs in conditions of no forced use. The case of forcing consumers to adopt a technological innovation could be further explored. Practical implications Retail banking consumers have changed their banking and financing behaviors because of capital controls. Forced usage may cause customers to cultivate positive attitudes towards the technology and consider it for continuous usage. Originality/value Capital controls were found to impact positively customer behavior towards m-banking. It is revealed that capital controls have forced bank customers to adopt and use m-banking for their financial needs.

AB  - Thirty-six participants were given three social discounting surveys, and each survey was preceded by one of three contrived hypothetical scenarios. In each scenario, the participant was asked to consider situations in which either the participant (SELF), a hypothetical other (OTHER), or both the participant and the hypothetical other (BOTH) were experiencing economic hardship (i.e., needed money to avoid a negative outcome). Results replicate previous research suggesting that the probability of participants foregoing the money decreased across social distance in the BOTH and OTHER conditions; however, no discounting was observed for median responses in the SELF condition. In addition, the highest area under the curve and lowest s values were associated with the OTHER condition, and the inverse results were observed for the SELF condition. Taken together, these results suggest that relative economic hardship may act as a motivating operation affecting social discounting with the potential for further translational utility.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressure has significantly increased in the last decades, often enhancing conflicts at the human-wildlife interface. Therefore, understanding peoples' value orientations, attitudes and behavioural intentions towards wildlife is a crucial endeavour to reduce the occurrence of conflicts between humans and wildlife. Previous research in the USA has shown a consistent link between modernization and increased anthropomorphism (i.e., the tendency to attribute human mental or physical characteristics to other entities), leading to positive changes in value orientations, attitudes, and behavioural intentions towards wildlife. In this paper, we aimed to address whether this link is also present in other cultures, by testing participants (N = 741) in five different countries (Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Spain). Our study shows that while the positive link between anthropomorphism, positive attitudes and behavioural intentions towards wildlife is universal, the link between modernization and anthropomorphism is culturally mediated. In some countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Spain), modernization increased anthropomorphism, while in others modernization predicted no differences (Brazil) or even a decrease in anthropomorphism (Mexico), ultimately deteriorating individuals' attitude and behavioural intentions towards wildlife. These results call for caution when generalizing findings from western industrialized countries to inform conservation policies worldwide.

AB  - Phubbing is a social exclusion, which indicates a person being phubbed can feel neglected during a face-to-face conversation. The present study examined how parental phubbing is related to adolescent Internet gaming disorder (IGD), and the role of self-esteem and maladaptive cognition. We recruited 813 Chinese adolescents to participate in the current study. Participants completed measures of parental phubbing, self-esteem, maladaptive cognitions, and IGD. Results indicated that maladaptive cognition mediated the relationship between parental phubbing and IGD. Our studies also found out the sequential mediation effect of self-esteem and maladaptive cognition on the relationship between parental phubbing and IGD. Surprisingly, unlike what was predicted, our findings didn't support the moderator role of self-esteem. This unanticipated orientation and other results are discussed. The findings contributed to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of adolescent IGD and its possible association with parental phubbing.

AB  - Y With the growth in political, ethnic, and religious conflicts across the globe, intolerance is manifested across different societies especially in the context of (forced) migration and refugees. The purpose of this study is to examine intolerance as a complex social problem. Specifically, this research seeks to explore the perceptions and conceptions of (in)tolerance between refugees from Syria and host communities in Lebanon identifying the degree and the different forms in which tolerance and intolerance materialize. This will allow different agents such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policymakers, and relevant authorities to develop adequate interventions to tackle this phenomenon through a social marketing approach and improve (refugee) crisis response plans. The situation has emerged following the Syrian conflict (2011-present) and the arrival of 1.5 million refugees into Lebanon. This number thus constitutes a challenge to both the hosts and the refugees in Lebanon, a small country. A qualitative study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews to investigate the perceptions and conceptions of the target audiences, citizens, refugees, leaders, and NGO staff/volunteers. Results show the existence of a phenomenon of intolerance; its relevant aspects, namely discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes, racism, and scapegoating; and the rise of violence-tension and fear as emerging themes of intolerance manifestations in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon.

AB  - Purpose - Online gaming offers avenue to connect with others producing social capital especially for individuals lacking in-real-life (IRL) social support; however, there is concerns related to mental health and depressive symptoms (DS). Virtually mediated social connections are particularly important during times of social distancing. This paper aims to investigate discussant networks established through an online gaming site and their possible association with DS and social support.
   Design/methodology/approach - Participants (n = 40) recruited from an online gaming site reported DS, online and IRL social support, and site members with whom they discussed important life matters. Participants also reported topics of conversation discussed and reason for communication. Quadratic assignment procedure multiple regression was used to determined significant associations between network structure, DS and social support.
   Findings - DS were significantly associated with online (beta = 0.39) and IRL social support (beta = -0.44). Online social support was significantly associated with network structural factors. Topics reported by members most often were bridging capital topics while topics reported by members in most recent conversation were bonding capital topics. Members mentioned bonding social capital concepts as motivation for conversation.
   Social implications - Building online relationships to provide bonding social capital could supply buffering effects for those feeling socially isolated during social distancing.
   Originality/value - This paper is among the first to approach online gaming communication through social network analysis and qualitative analysis mixed method approach.

AB  - Background: Despite the advanced development of evidence-based psychological treatment services, help-seeking persons with mental health problems often fail to receive appropriate professional help. Internet-delivered psychotherapy has thus been suggested as an efficient strategy to overcome barriers to access mental health care on a large scale. However, previous research indicated poor public acceptability as an issue for the dissemination of Internet-delivered therapies. Currently, little is known about the expectations and attitudes toward Internet-delivered therapies in the general population. This is especially the case for countries such as Germany where electronic mental health (e-mental health) treatment services are planned to be implemented in routine care.
   Objective: This pilot study aimed to determine the expectations and attitudes toward Internet-based psychotherapy in the general population in Germany. Furthermore, it aimed to explore the associations between attitudes toward Internet-based therapies and perceived stress.
   Methods: To assess public attitudes toward Internet-based psychotherapy, we conducted both Web-based and paper-and-pencil surveys using a self-developed 14-item questionnaire (Cronbach alpha=.89). Psychological distress was measured by employing a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the 20-item German version of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). In addition, we conducted explorative factor analysis (principal axis factor analysis with promax rotation). Spearman's rank correlations were used to determine the associations between attitudes toward Internet-based therapies and perceived stress.
   Results: Descriptive analyses revealed that most respondents (N=1558; female: 78.95%, 1230/1558) indicated being not aware of the existence of Internet-delivered therapies (83.46%, 1141/1367). The average age was 32 years (standard deviation, SD 10.9; range 16-76). Through exploratory factor analysis, we identified 3 dimensions of public attitudes toward Internet-based therapies, which we labeled "usefulness or helpfulness," "relative advantage or comparability," and "accessibility or access to health care." Analyses revealed negative views about Internet-based therapies on most domains, such as perceived helpfulness. The study findings further indicated ambivalent attitudes: Although most respondents agreed to statements on expected improvements in health care (eg, expanded access), we observed low intentions to future use of Internet-delivered therapies in case of mental health problems.
   Conclusions: This pilot study showed deficient "e-awareness" and rather negative or ambivalent attitudes toward Internet-delivered therapies in the German-speaking general population. However, research targeting determinants of the large-scale adoption of Internet-based psychotherapy is still in its infancy. Thus, further research is required to explore the "black box" of public attitudes toward Internet-delivered therapies with representative samples, validated measures, and longitudinal survey designs.

AB  - Spiritual bypass denotes a process by which an individual avoids painful psychological experiences by using spirituality as a defense. Although spiritual bypass is often detected within psychological treatment, it has only recently been studied empirically. In the current study, we extend the study of spiritual bypass by testing (a) its associations with religious commitment, spirituality, attitudes toward God, and psychological as well as medical help-seeking attitudes and (b) direct and indirect relationships using bias-corrected, boot-strapped confidence intervals using a model recommended by Hayes (2018). In Study 1, we surveyed 265 community-based adults recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Religious commitment and spirituality were directly related to attitudes toward psychological help-seeking. However, these relationships were indirectly associated with spiritual bypass. In Study 2, we surveyed 199 undergraduate students and found that attitudes toward God (i.e., positive attitudes toward or disappointment and anger with God) were related to medical help-seeking attitudes. Likewise, these relationships were indirectly associated with spiritual bypass. The implications were that (a) religious and spiritual variables relate to help-seeking attitudes; (b) religious and spiritual associations with help-seeking are both directly and indirect associated with spiritual bypass, and additional research is needed to uncover precise conditions under which spiritual bypass might or might not causally affect these relationships (i.e., investigate potential moderators and mediational effects); and (c) in practice, spiritual bypass can be an important patient quality to consider in relation to an individual's attitudes toward and perhaps benefit from psychological help.

AB  - Demonization has been used as tool for the maintenance of ruling regimes throughout history. Institutionalized, it becomes regime policy, exemplified in the extreme by the German Nazi regime's demonization of Jews. Dehumanized imagery is used to distinguish 'others', i.e. social, cultural, political, and/or economic out-groups, from 'normal' members of society and to support the power and control ambitions of those who hold or seek to hold dominant societal positions. Demonization is institutionalized through interaction among a variety of cultural carriers including religion, news media, and popular culture. It is used as an excuse for social exclusion and violence. It is most dangerous when it receives tacit acceptance or active support by central societal institutions, including government. The current article considers the processes and products of demonization in Thailand as it has appeared in national politics. Demonization has proven to be a strategic tool deployed by Thailand's 'social cage' to harm those who have sought political change and threaten its established institutional interests.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) is an important emerging technology that is increasingly being introduced in health centers as a rehabilitation intervention. Quantitative research is needed to identify the factors influencing therapists' adoption of VR for brain injury rehabilitation, including barriers and facilitators to VR use, in order to inform successful implementation strategies. A measure based on the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB) was developed and administered to 42 therapists; early psychometric properties are reported. Mean or median composite scores and correlations were calculated for each DTPB construct. Overall, therapists had positive attitudes toward VR, perceived it as being useful, and had positive intentions to use it more in the future. The self-efficacy composite yielded the lowest scores. The most significant barrier to adoption was time, while social influences and knowledge were the primary facilitators. Future research will explore the impact of knowledge translation interventions on these mediators of VR adoption.

AB  - This paper presents the results of STRATONAV experiment to test the precision of the VOR (VHF Omni Range) aircraft navigation system in stratosphere. The experiment has been conducted by the S5Lab research group at Sapienza University of Rome in the framework of the REXUS/BEXUS Programme. STRATONAV has been successfully launched on-board the BEXUS 22 stratospheric balloon from Esrange Space Center in Kiruna, Sweden, in 2016. The main payload was composed by two typologies of VOR receivers, a commercial portable receiver and a Software Defined Radio (SDR), alongside the bus and positioning, attitude and temperature sensors. STRATONAV succeeded in collecting VOR radials for the whole duration of the balloon flight. The results prove that VOR can be used as back-up navigation system for stratospheric platforms, ensuring a reliability improvement, while being applied to smaller payloads as primary system for a cost and complexity reduction of experiment developments. The paper analyzes the collected VOR data during the balloon flight. Accuracy and performance plots with respect to distance from the VOR stations and altitude are presented and discussed. The mean errors and standard deviations from all stations for both the receivers are shown with an analysis over the recorded errors. Finally, future perspectives, analyses and applicability of the research are exposed.

FX  - STRATONAV project was part of the REXUS/BEXUS Programme. The REXUS/BEXUS programme is realized under a bilateral Agency Agreement between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA). The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to students from other European countries through the collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM and ESA provide technical support to the student teams throughout the project. EuroLaunch, the cooperation between the Esrange Space Center of SSC and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. The authors wish to acknowledge the technical and financial sponsors of the experiment, namely Eggcelerate, Mediasoft, MEGATRON Sensors and Italian Amateur Radio Association (ARI) -Rome chapter for their appreciated and helpful support provided throughout the experiment development.

AB  - This study explores the role of intragroup dynamics in intergroup conflict. In a computer-mediated negotiation experiment (N = 107), we investigated how a group representative's standing in the group, group norm, and the representative's need to belong influence behavior in intergroup negotiations. We hypothesized that the extent to which peripheral representatives adhere to group norms is contingent on their need to belong, whereas prototypical representatives behave in norm-congruent ways regardless of their need to belong. In support of this idea, results showed that prototypicals behaved more cooperatively when the group norm prescribed cooperation rather than competition. By contrast, peripherals only adhered to the group norm when they had a high need to belong. These findings suggest that peripherals only represent the interests of their group when doing so furthers their self-interest. We discuss implications for theorizing about prototypicality, social exclusion, and conformity to group norms.

AB  - As part of the social distancing measures for preventing the spread of COVID-19, many university courses were moved online. There is an assumption that online teaching limits opportunities for fostering interpersonal relationships and students' satisfaction of the basic need for relatedness - reflected by experiencing meaningful interpersonal connections and belonging - which are considered important prerequisites for student motivation and vitality. In educational settings, an important factor affecting students' relatedness satisfaction is the teachers' behavior. Although research suggests that relatedness satisfaction may be impaired in online education settings, to date no study has assessed how university lecturers' relatedness support might be associated with student relatedness satisfaction and therefore, student motivation and vitality. This study tested this mediating relationship using data collected during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also investigated whether the relations were moderated by a high affiliation motive which reflects a dispositional wish for positive and warm relationships. The possible importance of the communication channel selected by the lecturers (video chat yes/no) and the format of a class (lecture/seminar) were also investigated. In a sample of N = 337 students, we tested our hypotheses using structural equation model (SEM). Results confirmed mediation, but not moderation. The use of video chat (video call) seems to facilitate the provision of relatedness support but our data did not show that the format of a class was associated with relatedness. Our findings indicate that both teaching behavior and the technical format used to deliver lectures play important roles in student experiences with online classes. The results are discussed in light of other research conducted during the pandemic.

AB  - Objective. To assess the knowledge, practice, attitude, and preparedness of dental professionals in prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Methodology. A prevalidated voluntary web-based questionnaire was generated as a link through Google Drive and was sent to 117 dental professionals in North India using Whatsapp, Messenger, and Instagram social media platforms. A total of 94 responses were received and out of which 76 responses were analyzed (18 forms were excluded due to incomplete or duplicate responses). Frequency analysis was done using SPSS software version 21. Result. The participation rate was found to be 80.3%. More than half of the study population were familiar with the term NRT (77.6%) and its uses (67.1%), but approximately less than half of the total study subjects knew the duration (32.9%), cost (27.6%), dosage (25%), and contraindications (36.8%) of the NRT. Approximately 56.6% of the study participants showed a positive attitude towards helping patients to quit smoking through tobacco cessation counseling. Nearly one-fourth of the study population, i.e., 27.6%, were confident in explaining the negative impacts of tobacco, while 22.4% knew about the tobacco cessation protocol. Among the participants, only 27.6% reported that they practice NRT and out of which approximately less than 20% of the study participants were prescribing correct dose of NRT. Conclusion. Though study subjects had an ample knowledge regarding NRT use in tobacco cessation, it does not reflect their current attitude and preparedness. Thus, there is a need for continuing education to further train dental professionals for prescribing NRT.

AB  - Introduction WhatsApp is an instant multimedia messaging and social media software which can be used for multiple purposes such as data, text, photographs and document transfer. Due to its versatility and multiple utilities, WhatsApp has been used within the educational setting in medicine and dentistry, proving a positive attitude of students towards its use. Aim To compare the reception time and the response time of WhatsApp with the traditional electronic email within the dental educational environment. Method A two-group comparative study was designed. Four multiple choice questions were sent via WhatsApp (group WA) and via electronic mail (group eM) to dental students. Data collected focused on the reception time and response time of students. Specifications of WhatsApp were used to collect data whilst an email tracker was used for the eM group. Excel software and Stata/IC version 15.1 software were used for data analysis. Results Seventy-four dental students from the University x (anonymised for reviewing purposes) dental school agreed to take part in this experience. However, 59 provided their responses (80%). Forty-four were females, and 15 were males. Twenty-seven participants were randomly allocated to the WA group and 32 to the eM group. The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between groups: Reception time, P: .0286 value and response time, P: .0448 value indicating that the WA group was significantly faster in terms of reception and response time. Conclusion This pilot study suggests that WhatsApp is more efficient in terms of reception and response time than electronic emails.

AB  - Background and Aims: Anaphylaxis is a common emergency and life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction defined as a rapid generalized allergic reaction. Prior international studies have shown that school personnel is often not familiar with the signs of hypersensitivity or with appropriate management strategies that should be initiated at school for children with an anaphylactic reaction. Moreover, no studies have evaluated the awareness of anaphylaxis by school teachers in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study was to determine teachers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward anaphylaxis in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a public school in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia via a validated fourteen items questionnaire aimed to survey teacher knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward anaphylaxis. The questionnaires were disseminated using a multistage random sampling technique to Saudi national's teachers from different regions in Al-Qassim. Results: Most teachers had a low level of knowledge (85.3%) of anaphylaxis and positive attitudes (72.9%), and the level of practice was reported as low (48.9%) to moderate (47.5%). The most common sources of information regarding anaphylaxis were the internet and social media. When considering significant factors associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), we found that sex, years of experience in teaching and witnessing students suffering from anaphylaxis were all positively associated with KAP. Conclusion: The overall knowledge and practices of teachers regarding anaphylactic reactions were poor, although teachers' attitudes toward learning this information were positive. Thus, teachers need further education regarding the management of allergic reaction.

AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of patients attended dental clinics at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) regarding cross infections and infection control in dentistry. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 patients who attended the dental clinics of KAUH, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 2014. A standardized, confidential, anonymous, interviewing questionnaire was used. Knowledge about dental infections was assessed by 12 MCQs. The attitudes were assessed through answering seven statements on a three- point Likert scale. Patients' self reported practices were also evaluated. Descriptive and inferential statistics were done.
   Results of the study revealed that 39.5%, 38.7% and 21.8% of the participants obtained poor, fair and satisfactory level of knowledge about infections and infection control in dentistry, respectively. Social media was the commonest source of information about dental infection. Participant's educational level was significantly associated with the level of knowledge about dental infection. Patients had positive attitudes towards infection control in dentistry. Regarding self-reported practice, only few participants would ask dentists about sterilization of dental instruments (9.3%), wearing face mask (13.3%) and gloves (16.4%) if they don't do so. In conclusion, our participants had good attitudes towards infection control in dentistry. However, their knowledge and practice need improvements. Conduction of educational programs is needed through social media, mass media, schools and public places. These programs involve both patients and providers.

AB  - Background
   The extent to which people implement government-issued protective measures is critical in preventing further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to describe the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures, and to identify communication channels used to acquire information on COVID-19 in European countries during the early stage of the pandemic.
   Methods and findings
   An online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated starting on March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we assessed enacted community containment measures by stage of stringency (I-IV). In total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). To explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified, we also included 1,365 responses submitted during the following week. Participants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands less frequently considered a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents applied enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%) and self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents reported being sufficiently informed about the outbreak and behaviors to avoid infection (range: 90.2%-91.1%). Information channels most commonly reported included television newspapers, official health websites, and social media. One week later, we observed no major differences in submitted responses.
   Conclusions
   During the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, belief in the effectiveness of protective measures among survey respondents from three European countries was high and participants reported feeling sufficiently informed. In March 2020, implementation of measures differed between countries and were highest among respondents from Italy, who were subjected to the most stringent lockdown measures and greatest COVID-19 burden in Europe during this period.

AB  - Although previous research has highlighted the association between emotional intelligence (EI) and job satisfaction, the underlying mechanisms remain relatively unexplored. To address this gap, this study examined employee engagement as a potential mediator of the association. A multi-occupational sample of 405 Spanish professionals completed the Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and an Overall Job Satisfaction Scale as well as providing socio-demographic data. As expected, employees' EI was positively related to engagement dimensions (vigour, dedication and absorption) as well as overall job satisfaction. Bootstrap estimates from multiple mediation analysis confirmed that employees' perceived EI was indirectly associated with job satisfaction via vigour and dedication scores, even when controlling for the effects of socio-demographic variables. Similarly, the same pattern was found when multiple mediation was conducted for each EI dimension. Our study contributes to understanding of the processes involved in maintaining and enhancing positive attitudes at work, providing the first, encouraging evidence that work engagement play a role in the EI-job satisfaction link. Our results extend the EI literature by elucidating the pathways through which EI is linked to positive employee attitudes and suggests that intervention programs designed to bolster EI might prove effective at increasing job satisfaction.

AB  - Access to transport is an important determinant of health, and concessionary fares for public transport are one way to reduce the 'transport exclusion' that can limit access. This paper draws on qualitative data from two groups typically at risk of transport exclusion; young people (12-18 years of age, n = 118) and older citizens (60+ years of age, n = 46). The data were collected in London, UK, where young people and older citizens are currently entitled to concessionary bus travel. We focus on how this entitlement is understood and enacted, and how different sources of entitlement mediate the relationship between transport and wellbeing. Both groups felt that their formal entitlement to travel for free reflected their social worth and was, particularly for older citizens, relatively unproblematic. The provision of a concessionary transport entitlement also helped to combat feelings of social exclusion by enhancing recipients' sense of belonging to the city and to a 'community'. However, informal entitlements to particular spaces on the bus reflected less valued social attributes such as need or frailty. Thus in the course of travelling by bus the enactment of entitlements to space and seats entailed the negotiation of social differences and personal vulnerabilities, and this carried with it potential threats to wellbeing. We conclude that the process, as well as the substance, of entitlement can mediate wellbeing; and that where the basis for providing a given entitlement is widely understood and accepted, the risks to wellbeing associated with enacting that entitlement will be reduced.

AB  - In times of severe crises, citizens are frequently found to rally-'round-the-flag - i.e. to increase trust in their government. Drawing on an original survey experiment with real-world information at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, we portray the saliency of rally-relevant issues of the crisis. Contrary to our expectation, this priming effect lowers governmental trust. Mediation analyses show that respondents are more trusting towards their in-group, but simultaneously display less pride in institutions and less positive attitudes towards the political elite, which leads to a reduction in governmental trust. Our study shows that crises do not always lead to a rally-'round-the-flag effect - it crucially depends on whether people consider their democratic institutions capable of coping with the crisis. Moreover, our findings demonstrate the need to unravel the black box of the rally-effect to get a more accurate picture of the driving forces behind governmental trust during crises.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of reading learning strategies (RLS) mediated by smartphone features and applications on the learners' psychological autonomy in English as a foreign language (EFL) reading context among undergraduates in Saudi Arabia. A total of 70 male students in two intact reading classes participated in this study. A questionnaire was used to collect the quantitative data from the participants prior to and after an interventional programme. The findings of the study revealed that employment of RLS mediated by smartphone features and applications promoted the learners' psychologically autonomous features of motivation, self-efficacy, agency, positive attitudes, desire to seek information, need for achievement in EFL reading context. It is recommended that a training programme on strategy use through the technology of smartphones should be highly considered in curricula design, teaching and learning methods, training programmes in order to empower learners to take charge of their own learning of EFL reading skills.

AB  - As a result of globalization, multicultural societies around the world are increasingly affected by popular trends, immigration, and mass media. Because people from different cultures correspondingly influence the education in a region, teachers should be prepared to address the subject. Instructors at Turkish language teaching centers deal with an especially wide variety of students, demanding competence in multicultural education as well as a positive attitude. This research investigates the perceptions of instructors working in Turkish language teaching centers with regards to multicultural awareness, ability, and knowledge while also considering their gender, career longevity, and education levels. A total of 61 instructors (40 female and 21 male) from 18 universities participated in this research. Data was gathered with the Multicultural Competence Perception Scale, and the instructors' multicultural competence was found to be sufficient. While no meaningful difference was found with regard to multicultural competence between education levels and career longevity, the female instructors did demonstrate greater multicultural competence than the males.

AB  - Practicing teachers often engage in continuous professional learning with certain career considerations. Based on achievement goal theory, this study explored the effects of career goals on teacher's learning using a sample of practicing teachers in Hong Kong. Two forms of career goals were assessed using a questionnaire. Professional learning goals orient teachers to learn for improving professional competence by acquiring professional knowledge and understanding, and extrinsic career goals focus teachers on learning for tangible benefits such as career promotion and higher professional qualification. Results derived from regression analyses confirmed that professional learning goals were the most significant goals in predicting adaptive use of learning strategies, regulatory strategies, and positive attitudes towards learning. Extrinsic career goals predicted the use of surface strategies. This study also found that self-efficacy mediated the effects of different goals on learning. Cluster analyses provided additional findings confirming the importance of professional learning goals in teachers' goal profiles.

AB  - In the current work, we experimentally examined the effect of exposure to a narrative of nonviolent resistance on third-party attitudes toward and support for a disempowered group involved in asymmetric conflict. Across three experiments, we found that Americans exposed to a brief video about Palestinian nonviolent resistance consistently registered more favorable attitudes toward Palestinians than people who watched a film trailer either unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or a trailer to a Palestinian-made film about sympathetic Palestinians violently opposing Israelis. Americans' attitudes toward Palestinians and behavior supporting Palestinian collective action persisted weeks after exposure to nonviolent resistance and were mediated by decreased perceptions that Palestinians are inherently violent. Importantly, positive attitudes toward Palestinians did not result in increased negativity toward Israelis. These data show that exposure to nonviolent resistance can have lasting effects on third-party attitudes and behavior toward an underdog/disempowered group, without driving partisanship.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of social media (SM) is unlocking infinite opportunities for healthcare disciplines and is fast becoming the preferred medium of communication. This underlines the importance of meeting the challenges of this new era. The aim of this study was to assess the readiness of Saudi family medicine physicians to the use of SM in health promotion and to explore their prospective attitudes toward its use professionally.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The two largest hospital-based primary care centers in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia were used for the quantitative analysis. All known physician bloggers in Saudi Arabia from seven different cities were invited to participate in the qualitative aspect of this study. The quantitative component of this study was conducted in the Eastern Province at two main hospitals. A 37-item questionnaire was distributed to all family physicians practising at these hospitals. The qualitative component of this study covered all of Saudi Arabia, and 11 in-depth interviews were held with family physician bloggers, followed by verbatim transcription, content analysis, and coding of the results. Chi-squared and independent t-tests were used. All physicians at the two largest hospitals in the Eastern Province were invited to participate in the quantitative aspect of the study. The response rate was 86.2% (n = 159).RESULTS: Study included 136 primary care physicians; majority were <50 years old (96.3%) with 58.8% females. About 60% were residents and 27.2 % consultants, and 76.5% were were family medicine physicians. Ninety-six percent physicians had SM accounts, the mean use of 3 h per day, 46.3% of the family physicians had good knowledge of SM ethics, and 69.9% used SM professionally for medical issues. Most of the responses showed a strong positive attitude; more than 60% of the participants responded as "agree" or "strongly agree" to the positive statements.CONCLUSION: Organizations urgently need to design their own bioethical guidelines and rules on the safe use of SM by healthcare professionals.

AB  - The first generation of Turkish and Northwest African immigrants in Belgium are ageing and at risk for developing cancer. Relatives play an important role and provide both emotional and practical care, including mental support and acting as a contact person and/or a translator for improving access to healthcare, as most patients and their spouses have only a limited command of the language. Although access to professional interpreters has shown to be the best guarantee for qualitative healthcare, oncology health providers working with relatives as interpreters is much more common than professional interpreters. The aim of this study was to provide insight into the process wherein relatives balance truth-telling in translating for an older family member diagnosed with cancer. This was a qualitative research study, with elements of constructivist grounded theory. Twenty-eight loosely structured interviews were conducted. Most relatives consider it their responsibility to contribute to a positive attitude of the patient. Relatives decided to what extent they inform the patient, based on several motives and embedded in their assessment of the patient's emotional strength, understanding and need to be informed. What they decide influences the way they act as a translator and/or a contact person between the patient and health professional(s). Some considered it best to omit medical information while others considered it best to inform the patient fully. The results emphasise the importance for healthcare providers to take into account the complexity and unpredictable character of the process of balancing truth-telling when family members translate for their ill older relative.

AB  - The world is currently suffering through a pandemic outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises medical facilities to "reschedule non-urgent outpatient visits as necessary". The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Kingdom National Health Service and several other international agencies covering Asia, North America and most regions of the world have recommended similar "social distancing" measures. The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) offers guidance for cardiac CT (CCT) practitioners to help implement these international recommendations in order to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission in their facilities while deciding on the timing of outpatient and inpatient CCT exams. This document also emphasizes SCCT's commitment to the health and well-being of CCT technologists, imagers, trainees, and research community, as well as the patients served by CCT.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of mediated contact between ethnic Koreans and migrant workers in South Korea. Positive contact generated more positive perception of and affect toward the migrant workers but did not change South Koreans' social distance from migrant workers. The effects of negative contact, on the other hand, were consistently significant across all three attitude measures. When the effect sizes of positive and negative mediated contact were compared, positive contact generated a stronger effect, albeit only marginally significant, than negative contact on the perception of migrant workers. In the affect and social distance measures, no significant difference was found. Furthermore, negative mediated contact increased power values through its influence on the attitudes toward migrant workers; parallel indirect effects of positive contact on universalism values were not found. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, followed by suggestions for future studies.

AB  - This study juxtaposes brand engagement and behaviors of substantive interest in the context of eservices and utilizes Bayesian networks for an exploratory, data-driven approach. Enlisting a behavioral focus, it investigates the item-to-item relationships between brand engagement, attitudes, and conspicuous behaviors both online and offline. Two Bayesian networks were constructed from samples of city website users (N = 1089) and nonusers (N = 475). Results confirm that the five groups of nodes included in our constructed Bayesian networks were well distinguished as separate constructs and interrelated, centered on two nodes of brand engagement. Results also indicate that two nodes of brand engagement, "sense of belonging" and "participating in activities", induced positive attitudes and were associated with conspicuous behaviors. Overall, this study demonstrates the dynamic, item-to-item relationships between engagement and behaviors of substantive interest. For managers, it is important in practice to discover the particular variables that play central roles among associated variables.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore factors influencing middle school students' academic achievement. In this regard, the study investigated the impact of demographic factors and students' attitudes towards STEM on their achievement. The research sample was drawn from a city located in southeastern Turkey. Multiple regression analysis was carried out to predict how much each subscale of the STEM survey, along with some other predictors as control variables, can be used to estimate achievement. In this present work, the variable of parental education was found significant. Moreover, it was found that the number of siblings, the status of being seasonal agricultural workers, and preschool education are significant predictors, but gender and the possession of a computer at home are not significant predictors. It was further determined that the "learning of science and engineering and the relationship to STEM" sub-dimension of STEM significantly predicted achievement, but the "personal and social implications of STEM", "learning of mathematics and the relationship to STEM", and the " learning and use of technology" sub-dimensions are not significant predictors. The findings suggest that academic achievement and STEM outcomes are somewhat mutually related. Students' positive attitudes toward STEM are promising and indicate the importance of higher achievement.

AB  - We present the results of an exploratory study framed within a large film literacy project carried out simultaneously in five European Union countries (Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). The study looks at students' responses to an educational project on cinema designed to be implemented regionally for five months in high schools to increase film literacy and to favour more positive attitudes towards European cinema. The results show that students' film preferences remain stable after the programme and vary only slightly. Major changes occur in their knowledge about film production and expression. The aspects that change the least are their conceptions about cinema and their preferences. Moreover, the student attitudes towards national and European cinema are more positive. However, the results also show that the implementation of a film literacy programme at a cross-cultural level can affect different aspects depending on the cultural context (country) in which it occurs. Indeed, they provide data about the specific impact of the programme in each country. The information offered by this study could enhance film literacy programmes, inform theory, and nurture the debates about the common European identity and the particular traits of the diverse cultures of the European Union.

AB  - Partisan identities do not only shape people's political attitudes, but also their perceptions of real-world developments. This is evident from the partisan economic perception gap: Government supporters have more positive economic perceptions than opposition supporters, especially when the economic situation is ambiguous. Recent research has shown that the size of this partisan gap varies across different contexts and that the state of the economy and working of political institutions are important moderators. Still, little is known about the influence of another important contextual variable: the degree of partisanship in the media system. Based on a theoretical discussion of partisan-motivated rationalization and the information environment, the paper tests the hypothesis that, due to selective exposure and exposure to more partisan content, people in partisan media systems have more polarized economic perceptions. A multilevel analysis of representative surveys in twenty-six European countries in 2014 shows that the partisan perception gap is, indeed, larger in countries with more polarized media systems, after controlling for other relevant country characteristics. People with the highest level of media consumption are most affected by media-party parallelism. The findings are relevant for worldwide discussions about posttruth politics, as they show that the media environment influences gaps in people's perceptions of real-world developments.

AB  - YouTube (YT) is the largest online video digital channel with more than 2 billion users, and over a billion hours of YT videos are viewed every day, particularly among young consumers. YT has become a massive marketing communication platform, which serves as a medium to target the lucrative Generation Z cohort (first born in the late 1990s), and influence this generation's infamously unpredictable purchase decision process. The main aim of this paper was to consider the effect of YouTube marketing communication (YMC) on the traditional and non-traditional attitudinal associations of response hierarchy models. A multi-stage sample technique was used and 3750 high school and college learners (aged 13-18 years old) were surveyed via self-administered questionnaires in South Africa. Structural equation modelling was utilised to consider the hypothesised attitudinal associations. The research determined that YMC had a positive influence on the hypothesised attitudinal associations, and young consumers who used YT for fewer years, logged on more frequently, spent shorter time periods on the platform, viewed higher numbers of commercials, aged 13-14 years old, and from the White population group exhibited the most positive attitudinal responses. Hence, organisations should review their strategies in order to develop more sustainable YMC owing to the heterogeneity evident among young African consumers.

AB  - Several previous studies have explored air travellers' willingness to compensate for their aviation carbon emissions or their willingness to pay for voluntary carbon offsetting programs. These studies have concluded that it is important to educate air travellers about the negative impacts of aviation on the environment. This study proposes two types of communication media and measures their effects on passengers' knowledge about the environmental impacts of aviation. Then, travellers' attitudes toward carbon offsetting and their willingness to offset their flights or change their travel behaviour are measured. Finally, a path model is estimated to analyse the effects of the various sources of knowledge on travellers' knowledge about aviation and the environment, their attitudes toward the environmental impacts of aviation and their willingness to mitigate these impacts. The outcomes suggest that appropriate media could be adopted to enhance passengers' knowledge of aviation impacts and the benefits of carbon offset programs, which could help passengers develop positive attitudes toward carbon offsetting and be more willing to offset their flights and change their travel behaviour. Not only does this study verify the relationships among knowledge, attitude, and behaviour (intention), it also has implications beyond academic research: it demonstrates that environmental education for air travellers should be prioritized.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explain how hotel guests form attitudes toward facial recognition technology in Singapore by integrating technology acceptance model (TAM), privacy calculus theory and personal innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach A self-administered online questionnaire was developed with measurements adopted from past research. Guests who stayed in four- or five-star hotels in Singapore were recruited via systematic random sampling. Structural equation modeling was conducted to examine the proposed integrated models. Findings Results showed that hotel guests performed calculative cognitive processes, weighing the benefits and risks of using facial recognition check-in system. Contradictory to the past research which suggested that trust activates both perceived risk and benefits, this study demonstrated that trust independently directed consumer attention on the benefits gained while risk perception was triggered by privacy concern. Furthermore, the current study revealed that the ease of use of facial recognition check-in system could possibly backfire. Practical implications The research indicates that the effort to adopt new technology in the hotel industry is promising in view of the growing millennials and Generation Z population who are digital natives. Furthermore, the current study highlights ways to elevate institutional trust and divert consumers' attention from risk perception to enhance their positive attitude and behavior toward accepting facial recognition check-in system. Originality/value This study integrated TAM with privacy calculus theory and personal innovativeness in examining the acceptance of facial recognition check-in system in the hotel industry in Singapore. This study is also the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge, to investigate the relationships among privacy concern, perceived risk, institutional trust and perceived benefits, as well as their effects on consumers' attitudes and behavior toward the biometric system.

AB  - One of the ways to overcome the sheer devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic is to get vaccinated. However, vaccine hesitancy could be a significant barrier. The main purposes of the current study are to examine the impact of four types of theory-driven messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention and to understand the moderating role of partisan media use and vaccination attitudes. The study used a between-subject randomized online experiment with four conditions. The manipulation messages were presented as screenshots from the CDC's Facebook page. The total number of participants were 387 (female 43%, mean age 37 years). The participants were from the U.S. and older than 18 years. The findings show that loss vs. gain message frames did not have any impact on COVID-19 vaccine intention. The moderating effects of conservative media and attitudes show that in general, those who consumed lower conservative media and held positive attitudes were higher on vaccine intention, and individual vs. collective frames did not have a strong impact. However, among those participants who scored high on conservative media use, and held negative vaccination attitudes, the individual frame had a higher impact on vaccine intention. The current study experimentally tested the intertwined relationships among message frames, partisan media use, and attitudes on vaccine intention. These relationships are critical considering the political nature of the pandemic.

AB  - Purpose Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for stroke. However, to encourage physical activity after stroke, it is important to know what motivates the patients. We aimed to explore possible motivators and barriers for physical activity in patients discharged after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods A qualitative study including 35 patients (21 men) with minor stroke or TIA (median age; 69 years, range 47-90) in semi-structured focus group interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed to text verbatim and analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Results Six interviews of 60 min. revealed five categories; the patients had a positive attitude towards physical activity, and they preferred to exercise locally under supervision of health professionals. Physical activity with others was motivating and obligating, and if possible as a weekly habit. Some experienced physical- and mental sequelae, which kept them from exercising. Conclusion This study provides valuable knowledge of what motivates and prevents patients with minor stroke or TIA to be physically active after hospital discharge, and what to consider when designing future exercise studies. Consequently, it is recommended that patients with minor stroke or TIA are offered supervised physical activity to prevent worsening of cardiovascular disease and recurrent cardiovascular event.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the factors influencing low birth rate among married women using the National Survey data in Korea. We compared the different influences on women's first and subsequent childbirths. This study was a secondary analysis using the "National Survey on Fertility and Family Health and Welfare", which was a nationally representative survey conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. We analyzed the data of 3,482 married women (aged between 19 and 39 years) using SPSS 20.0 program for descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way ANOVA, and binary and ordinal logistic regression models. The factors influencing women's first childbirth included perceptions about the value of marriage and children and their education level. The factors influencing their subsequent childbirths included multifaceted variables of maternal age during the first childbirth, residential area, religion, monthly household income, perceptions about the value of marriage and children, and social media. It is necessary to improve women's awareness and positive perceptions about marriage and children in order to increase the birth rate in Korea. Moreover, consistently providing financial and political support for maternal and childcare concerns and using social media to foster more positive attitudes toward having children may enhance birth rates in the future.

AB  - People's response to the decline of biodiversity and their support for conservation measures depends on their knowledge of biodiversity and their attitudes to local species. This study is one of the first to investigate public knowledge of, and attitudes to, frogs in South America. We chose two study regions, the semi-urban region of Pensilvania and the rural region of Florencia. In spring 2011, 565 individuals completed a written questionnaire and a subsequent picture test. Overall, the public's attitudes to, and knowledge of frogs, were rather poor. Direct experiences and community elders were the major source of knowledge of frogs for participants in Florencia, whereas electronic media was the main source of knowledge in Pensilvania. Most participants felt that frogs are of high conservation value and important for medical and ecological purposes. The more strongly participants agreed that frogs are useful, of medicinal value, and beautiful, the more strongly they agreed that they should be conserved. Our results indicate that conservation education activities in schools and elsewhere are needed to improve people's knowledge of, and attitudes to, frogs. More positive attitudes toward local amphibian species might lead to an appreciation of their value and willingness to conserve them.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the knowledge of and attitudes toward voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) among undergraduates of a law faculty in tertiary institutions in Anambra State in southeast Nigeria.
   STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey conducted among law undergraduates in Anambra State using a multistage, random sampling method. The respondents were all full-time law students and were aged from 15-42 years with a mean of 21.06 +/- 3.0 years and a modal age of 20-24 years. In all, 210 (71.4%) of the students were aware of VCT for HIV/AIDS, while 84 (28.6%) of the respondents had no knowledge of it. The most common sources of information about VCT for HIV/AIDS were electronic media (114 [38.8%]) followed by churches (67 [22.8%]) and print media (44 [15.0%]). Although a majority of respondents had a positive attitude toward VCT for HIV/AIDS, 20% of them disapproved of VCT, and this is quite high considering their educational status.
   CONCLUSION: Public health education, awareness programs and VCT centers dedicated to young people should be established. (J Reprod Med 2013;58:55-60)

AB  - Fitbits may be useful in tracking changes in physical activity during chemotherapy. Sixty-five patients with breast cancer were given Fitbits at the start of chemotherapy, but adherence to wearing the Fitbit was low, with mean number of valid days across the 9-month study period of 44.5%. Interventions to increase wear are likely necessary in the active treatment setting.
   Background: Many patients' activity levels decrease during chemotherapy. Wearable devices, such as Fitbits, track activity patterns and may encourage behavior change. This study aimed to determine the utility of using Fitbits to measure physical activity and sleep throughout chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: Patients with early stage breast cancer were enrolled prior to starting chemotherapy. Patients received a Fitbit Charge HR and were instructed to wear it and sync at least weekly throughout chemotherapy and up to 6 months post therapy. Patients completed baseline surveys, and treatment information was collected from their medical records. Fitbit data was downloaded from the Fitabase data management platform. To assess utility, we evaluated how many days patients wore their Fitbit for at least 10 hours. Results: Adherence to wearing the Fitbit was low, with 16.9% of patients never syncing their device. For those who did sync, the mean number of valid days (> 10 hours of use) across the 9-month study period was 44.5% (SD, 36.9%), and the median was 39.6%, with a range of 0% to 100% of the total study days. Adherence was higher among participants receiving adjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (51.9% vs. 29.6% valid days, respectively [P = .037]). Baseline questions indicating positive attitudes toward technology were significantly correlated with higher adherence. Conclusions: Fitbit use during breast cancer chemotherapy was poor in the absence of prompts to encourage wear. Interventions including phone calls, texts, or other reminders to maintain adherence are likely necessary to increase wear in active treatment settings.

AB  - Purpose - Grounded in Transformative Service Research, the purpose of this paper is to explore the mechanisms by which bank information transparency influences consumer's financial well-being (FWB). The authors propose that customer attitudes toward the brand and the subjectively perceived ability of individuals to deal with the financial challenges explain the enhancement of FWB driven by bank information transparency.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. In total, 400 bank customers of five commercial banks in Colombia were approached and asked to fill out a pen and paper questionnaire. Serial mediation analysis was applied to test the hypotheses.
   Findings - This research shows that bank information transparency can uplift the FWB of customers. Furthermore, the positive effect of bank information transparency on the FWB occurs because the shared information improves the positive attitudes toward banks and the perceived financial self-efficacy of customers.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper heeds the call of current literature for improved explanations of the relationship between attempts to inform consumers about financial services and their FWB.
   Practical implications - This research shows that managers who embrace the challenging task of improving the FWB of their customers should design strategies for more transparent information sharing with their customers. However, these strategies should be designed not only to deliver information to customers but also to increase the perceived disclosure, accuracy and clarity of shared information.
   Originality/value - This pioneering study aims to explain the effects of bank information transparency on the FWB of consumers by drawing on interdisciplinary literature. This research is important as many banks aim to increase their information transparency without a clear understanding of the effects of these actions on consumers and therefore in many instances their efforts fail. A key contribution of this study is identifying concrete mechanisms (i.e. brand attitudes and self-efficacy) that help managers to improve customers' FWB via information transparency. Accordingly, the authors offer suggestions for better information transparency strategy implementation.

AB  - Social media influencers promote not only products and brands but also their opinions on serious topics like party politics or climate change. These so-called digital opinion leaders may exert a powerful impact on their followers' political attitudes. Accordingly, we explore new directions to explain how influencers' communication is related to political outcomes by proposing the concept of perceived simplification of politics (PSP). We argue that PSP may fuel political cynicism but also stimulate youth's interest in politics. We also explore important boundary conditions of these associations. We use data from three studies, a two-wave panel survey of adolescents (N-T2 = 294), a cross-sectional survey of young adults (N = 632), and a two-wave panel survey of young adults (N-T2 = 496) in Germany between 2019 and 2020. Findings of all three studies show that the frequency of exposure to social media influencers' content increases PSP. In Studies 1 and 2, PSP is related to higher political cynicism, while in Study 3, this relationship is restricted to influencers' communication about environmental topics and gender equality. Furthermore, Studies 2 and 3 suggest that PSP also increases political interest-yet this association requires a certain level of parasocial interaction (PSI) with the influencer and is contingent on specific political topics.

AB  - Citizen's income is an idea that is currently gaining ground in many parts of the world. The prospect of disappearing jobs and social exclusion that the globalized world faces has given the idea of guaranteed income a new urgency. This article is a pilot sociological study of the citizen's income discussion in post-socialist Estonia. The article is based on qualitative research: interviews with experts from different fields and an analysis of print media. Four systematic approaches to citizen's income are differentiated in the paper. We analyze the views on the idea in order to explore their significance for the Estonian economic status quo and welfare state.

AB  - Religion can determine how people perceive socio-political reality, especially in a cultural context in which religious affiliation is an important part of national identity. This has a special significance in the Polish cultural context, in which Catholicism is considered the national religion, and its institutional dimension plays an important role in the Polish socio-political domain. The purpose of this study is to analyse how religion affects the socio-political attitudes of Poles abroad. This analysis focuses directly on evaluating the influence of the spiritual leaders of Polish community organisations in the UK on the knowledge and opinions of Brexit among Polish post-accession emigrants to the UK. The study was conducted on a sample of 620 Poles living in the UK (62.6% male) using a group-administered questionnaire. The study found that the Polish Catholic clergy did not play an important role in opinion-forming, i.e., in shaping what Polish emigrants to the UK know and think about Brexit. What proved to be the most powerful factor in terms of opinion-making was the British mass media. The influence of the Catholic clergy on the knowledge of-and opinions on-Brexit among Polish emigrants was only evident among elderly people who did not know English very well, and who regularly participated in religious activities.

AB  - The Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice states that 'dangerous world' and 'competitive jungle' beliefs shape Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), respectively. We investigated whether the associations of the HEXACO personality traits with SDO and RWA were mediated by these beliefs. Study 1 (297 Italian participants) investigated mediation at the general factor level. Study 2 (344 US participants) focused on the components of Honesty and Humility and of Openness-culture and Openness-curiosity. Personality associations with SDO were mostly mediated by Competitive Jungle beliefs, whilst personality associations with RWA were mostly unmediated. At the level of narrow trait components, different effects for Honesty and Humility and for Openness-culture and Openness-curiosity were revealed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores technostress and its dimensions, assessing the relationship with possible negative effects in the individual, social and professional sphere. The study uses a self-reported approach of undergraduate students in Spain (n = 337), forced to follow their academic life by using technology comprehensively because of social distancing, as a public health action necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The analysis, based on the exploration of a system of archetypes of the use of social networks, presents insights into contemporary technostress management as a new approach that can suppose opportunities for the optimization of prevention plans. Pearson's correlation coefficients and structural equation modeling based on partial least squares (SEM-PLS) were the methods used for achieving the goals. The results reveal valid and reliable measures where technostress has a high impact on the individual sphere of students and there is a significant relationship between the type of user and techno-anxiety. The conclusions point to the imperative for developing a deeper understanding of technostress by archetypes, in both a higher education context (as antecedent) and the world of work, in an irreversible move towards a digital economy.

AB  - Telecollaboration is an area of CALL research and practice which has developed considerably in the last twenty years. Many research studies have been carried out and important findings have been made, but there has not yet been a large scale survey to try and 'map' the state of the art in telecollaboration practice. Most studies focus on single telecollaboration projects and look at the project design, learning outcomes and difficulties teachers and researchers have encountered in that particular project. This paper reports on a survey which sought to explore current practices and attitudes towards telecollaboration across European universities and to identify barriers that practitioners encounter. The survey was completed in full by a total of 210 university language teachers in 23 different European countries and 131 students. The picture we found presents a broad spectrum of practices. Despite an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards telecollaboration, findings also provide large-scale confirmation of some of the problems identified in small-scale studies, such as organizational difficulties, lack of time, limited technical support and great uncertainty regarding issues students should address in their exchanges. The paper concludes with some recommendations as to how to meet these challenges and how telecollaboration practice could become mainstreamed in higher education.

AB  - (1) Background: Several opportunities have appeared for the dissemination of culture and heritage thanks in part to the widespread use of information and communications technologies. Virtual museums have appeared as innovative technological products but often lack an evaluation of the impact that they have and their success in achieving their purpose. In this sense, this work seeks to evaluate the impact of a virtual museum on users' attitudes toward cultural heritage. (2) Methods: We used a factorial design of 2 (direction of thoughts: positive vs. negative) x 2 (presence level: high vs. low) x 2 (virtual museum vs. interactive website). (3) Results: Attitudes toward heritage can change as a function of a multimedia experience, thought favorability, and presence. In a virtual museum, when general attitudes are evaluated, a sense of high psychological presence reduces the effect that thoughts (especially when negative) have on attitudes. However, in the case of visiting an interactive website, the effect of the direction of thoughts on attitudes occurred regardless of conditions of high or low presence. Similar tendencies are observed for specific attitudinal objects. (4) Conclusion: A virtual museum can have different effects depending on the interaction of important variables from the virtual reality literature and not only the classic main effects. Recommendations for interventions and future practical and theoretical work are presented.

AB  - Background: Personal health records (PHRs) are eHealth tools designed to support patient engagement, patient empowerment, and patient-and person-centered care. Endorsement of a PHR by health care providers (HCPs) facilitates patient acceptance. As health care organizations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia begin to adopt PHRs, understanding the perspectives of HCPs is important because it can influence patient adoption. However, no studies evaluated HCPs' acceptance of PHRs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify predictors of HCPs' acceptance of PHRs using behavioral intention to recommend as a proxy for adoption.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among HCPs (physicians, pharmacists, nurses, technicians, others) utilizing a survey based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. The main theory constructs of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and positive attitude were considered independent variables. Behavioral intention was the dependent variable. Age, years of experience, and professional role were tested as moderators between the main theory constructs and behavioral intention using partial least squares structural equation modeling.
   Results: Of the 291 participants, 246 were included in the final analysis. Behavioral intention to support PHR use among patients was significantly influenced by performance expectancy (beta=.17, P=.03) and attitude (beta=.61, P<.01). No moderating effects were present.
   Conclusions: This study identified performance expectancy and attitude as predictors of HCPs' behavioral intention to recommend PHR to patients. To encourage HCPs to endorse PHRs, health care organizations should involve HCPs in the implementation and provide training on the features available as well as expected benefits. Future studies should be conducted in other contexts and include other potential predictors.

AB  - Education has undergone the greatest revolution since the 19th century. The pandemic has massively launched teaching towards the use of ICTs and online education. The main objective of this research is to study the relationship between the adaptation of university faculty to the massive use of ICTs and educational digitization, and the promotion of SDG 4, which establishes Target 4.3, ensuring access to quality university education. To achieve this, a descriptive study methodology is used, in which the results of a validated survey, on a sample of 245 teachers from 32 public and private Spanish universities, were analyzed. The main results consist of the different emotional reactions among professors, finding that, on the one hand, ICTs allow for the development of new skills, the introduction of new methodological proposals, and the development of a positive attitude towards the use of digital tools in order to reach all of their students. However, on the other hand, the results also show that the use of ICTs caused an increase in anxiety, workloads, and the need for ongoing training. There is a need to continue improving the digital competencies of faculty professors in order to favor access to ICTs by university students and, thus, promote quality education worldwide.

AB  - A disaster-resilient city should address social inequity in all its forms. Complete, accurate, and up-to-the-minute situational awareness (SA) can help disaster relief organizations stabilize the dangers and prevent further losses in poor and ethnic minority neighborhoods. However, the lapse of months or years of survey data could lead to biases since retrospective studies are affected by the emotional status at the time of the survey. To address this, we aim to examine the effects of neighborhood equity on SA in a hurricane event using geotagged Twitter data. We adopted the sentiment analysis, convolutional neural network (CNN) model and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to reflect SA in Hurricane Florence. The multinomial logit regression model reveals that the tweet originated from a poor neighborhood has a higher probability of being more negative, compared to being neutral. Also, we surprisingly found that the sentiment of a tweet in a black neighborhood could be less likely to be negative. Another novel finding is that black neighborhoods could discuss the hurricane with a positive attitude while poor neighborhoods are more concerned about the work during the hurricane. This study shows that, by incorporating with aggregated sociodemographic data, geotagged Twitter data can also be used to understand disaster SA from the perspective of social equity.

AB  - Although the last decade has seen critical design growing as an area of research, studies have rarely focused on how to teach it. Some design schools have established graduate programs and others have developed individual undergraduate courses on critical design. However, to date there has been no study that investigated student reactions to the learning of critical design. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a new studio-based course at the graduate level aimed at providing students with a medium for critical discussion and creative reflection on contemporary social issues. Lectures, seminars and class discussions were used to instruct theoretical concepts pertaining to critical design, while a 10-week design studio project was used to concretize these concepts. The students' initial reactions to this teaching methodology was gathered through semi-structured interviews conducted at the end of the course. The interview results indicate that students had a very positive attitude towards critical design and the course. Furthermore, although understanding critical design was a major challenge for them, the teaching methods used in the course (i.e. lectures, critical design assignment and reflection paper) helped them overcome this challenge. Finally, this paper offers suggestions for design educators for constructing critical design courses that meet design students' expectations.

AB  - Despite the popularity of gamification among academics due to its propensity to promote student motivation, engagement, and behavioral change, its use in formal education is still limited. We reached out to educators at all levels to examine their experience, attitude, familiarity with gamified teaching, and their personality, to see if teachers' personal characteristics are related to the intention of implementing gamified teaching. 118 in-service and 102 pre-service teachers completed the BFI-S and the questionnaire developed for the study. Teachers predominantly assumed that gamification represents game-based learning, and more than half reported using some game elements in at least one of their lectures. While in general participants were welcoming towards gamified teaching, experienced teachers had a more positive attitude toward gamification compared to pre-service teachers. Attitude was a mediator between the intention to use and a presumption that gamification means using educational games, experience with gamification, and openness. In addition, past use significantly predicted intention to use even when accounting for attitude. Both in-service and pre-service teachers expressed a wish to learn more about gamification. The study identified another gap between theory and practice, showing a need for teachers to be informed more regularly about the latest pedagogical strategies and approaches.

AB  - Background Increasingly, pupils on the autism spectrum are educated in inclusive mainstream classrooms. However, they often experience social isolation and bullying, and raising the awareness of autism in peers has been suggested as a remedy.
   Methods In order to assess autism awareness in peers, autism-related questions were included in two large-scale surveys: the Kids Life and Times survey for 11-year olds and the Young Life and Times survey for 16-year olds; a total of n=3353 children and young people completed the surveys.
   Results Autism awareness was higher for the teenagers (80%) than for the younger children (50%). Many of the children knew someone with autism (50%) and generally reported positive and supportive attitudes. Self-reported prevalence of autism was 3.1% for teenagers and 2.7% for the younger children. Peers recognised bullying as a problem and were willing to help.
   Conclusions Children and young people have good levels of awareness and knowledge about autism and reported positive attitudes towards peers with autism and are willing to help those who are bullied. A higher than expected number of children and young people self-reported being on the autism spectrum. These findings bode well for peer-mediated support strategies for inclusive education.

AB  - There are some indices in which legalization of medical cannabis in the Republic of Serbia might be considered. The purpose of this research was to assess knowledge and attitudes towards medical cannabis in an urban adult population. This cross-sectional study was conducted in December 2015 and January 2016. A convenience sample of study participants comprised users of the Community Health Center. A total of 360 adults were invited to participate. Data were collected through an anonymous questionnaire. Most participants (77.1%) answered correctly that cancer was indicative of medical cannabis treatment, while the remaining conditions were less frequently recognized. A total of 42% answered correctly that adverse effects of cannabis were hallucinations and dizziness. Persons who previously used cannabis were more knowledgeable on conditions for medical cannabis treatment (p = 0.155; p = 0.006). Study respondents expressed positive attitude towards legalization of medical cannabis (median 5 out of 5) and negative towards legalization of recreational cannabis (median 2 out of 5). In conclusion, the adult population in Belgrade had some knowledge of medical cannabis. The overall attitude of our population regarding legalization of medical cannabis was positive, while the attitude towards legalization of cannabis for recreational purposes was negative.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between happiness at work (HAW), organisational learning capability (OLC) and organisational citizenship behaviour.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through structural equation models, a sample of 167 allergists of public health services was analysed.
   Findings - Results suggest that the relationship between HAW and organisational citizenship behaviour is fully mediated by OLC. Hence, OLC has a critical role to describe how HAW improves organisational citizenship behaviour. Basically, HAW promotes motivation for learning, and a better quality of the interactions between employees, which results in pro-social behaviours.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample is focussed in a knowledge-intensive context. Future research might consider other service sectors, such as a private business sector. In addition it would be interesting to examine a longitudinal perspective of the model.
   Practical implications - The results confirm the direct and positive effect of HAW on organisational citizenship behaviour. Nevertheless, showing positive attitudes as HAW does not assure to achieve perceived service quality. It is needed to take into account certain conditions that promote learning.
   Originality/value - Current attitudinal theories do not contemplate environments that promote learning to explain pro-social attitudes. The research offers a theoretical model and provides evidence that the attitudes-behaviours relationship needs to be explained bearing in mind OLC.

AB  - A recent wave of research suggests that teachers overrate the performance of girls relative to boys and hold more positive attitudes toward girls' mathematics abilities. However, these prior estimates of teachers' supposed female bias are potentially misleading because these estimates (and teachers themselves) confound achievement with teachers' perceptions of behavior and effort. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), Study 1 demonstrates that teachers actually rate boys' mathematics proficiency higher than that of girls when conditioning on both teachers' ratings of behavior and approaches to learning as well as past and current test scores. In other words, on average girls are only perceived to be as mathematically competent as similarly achieving boys when the girls are also seen as working harder, behaving better, and being more eager to learn. Study 2 uses mediation analysis with an instrumental-variables approach, as well as a matching strategy, to explore the extent to which this conditional underrating of girls may explain the widening gender gap in mathematics in early elementary school. We find robust evidence suggesting that underrating girls' mathematics proficiency accounts for a substantial portion of the development of the mathematics achievement gap between similarly performing and behaving boys and girls in the early grades.

Adoption of the HBM seeks to improve the level of response of Kuwaiti people towards governmental messages regarding social distancing, staying at home, and self-protection. To fulfil the study's aim, a quantitative research design was adopted in which data were collected from 746 respondents in Kuwait to examine the effect of perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, health motivation, and cues to action, based on each individual's behaviour. Data were analysed through AMOS 22.0 and the findings showed that governmental messages on social media should consider the above-mentioned aspects in order to positively impact the behaviour of Kuwaiti individuals.

AB  - Children are vulnerable to adverse effects of food advertising. Food commercials are known to increase hedonic, taste-oriented, and unhealthy food decisions. The current study examined how promoting resilience to food commercials impacted susceptibility to unhealthy food decision-making in children. To promote resilience to food commercials, we utilized the food advertising literacy intervention intended to enhance cognitive skepticism and critical thinking, and decrease positive attitudes toward commercials. Thirty-six children aged 8-12 years were randomly assigned to the food advertising literacy intervention or the control condition. Eighteen children received four brief intervention sessions via video over 1 week period. In each session, children watched six food commercials with interspersed embedded intervention narratives. While watching food commercials and narratives, children were encouraged to speak their thoughts out loud spontaneously ("think-aloud"), which provided children's attitudes toward commercials. Eighteen children in the control condition had four control sessions over 1 week, and watched the same food commercials without intervention narratives while thinking aloud. The first and last sessions were held in the laboratory, and the second and third sessions were held at the children's homes. Susceptibility to unhealthy food decision-making was indicated by the decision weights of taste attributes, taste perception, food choices, ad libitum snacking, and cognitive and affective attitudes toward food commercials. As hypothesized, the intervention successfully decreased susceptibility to unhealthy food decision-making evidenced by reduced decision weights of the taste in food decisions, decreased tasty perception of unhealthy foods, and increased cognitive skepticism and critical thinking toward food commercials. In addition, as children's opinions assimilated to intervention narratives, their cognitive skepticism and critical thinking toward commercials increased. The aforementioned results were not shown in the control condition. However, this brief intervention was not enough to change actual food choices or food consumption. Results of this study suggest that promoting resilience to food commercials by enhancing cognitive skepticism and critical thinking effectively reduced children's susceptibility to unhealthy food-decision making.

AB  - Purpose The study has identified the factors among students that can enable or inhibit students from using online learning platforms. Students enrolled at different levels, diversified streams and separate courses were surveyed for the investigation. The study also highlights the significant hitches faced in using or adopting e-learning. Design/methodology/approach Responses were collected from Indian students on a seven-point Likert-type scale using a structured questionnaire around the updated Technology Readiness Index's four dimensions. Adapted dimensions were evolved to identify the people's propensity to accept and reject the new technology. Findings The result of the survey highlights the students' positive attitude towards the e-learning approach. The diffusion of e-learning platforms occupies them with a feeling of optimism and innovativeness. However, discomfort in using the newly penetrated e-learning platforms was also found. Furthermore, no significant variances concerning the different demographics were detected. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional research approach was used for the investigation. However, it is evident that with the use and experience of technology, an increase in its acceptance follows. Thus, a longitudinal research approach should explore the differences between students' earlier and later involvement after experiencing the platform. A cross-country investigation is also needed to measure the technological biases among students. Practical implications With advancements in technology, the chances of diffusion of e-learning in traditional classrooms have risen. However, to encourage the student's engagement towards e-learning, the platform needs to be student and teacher-friendly. This study serves the purpose of exploring the determinants that will guide educational institutes and developers of online platforms in achieving excellence in enhancement and engagement among students. Originality/value The investigation adds to recognize the acceptance of e-learning among students by exploring its determinants using the Technology Readiness Index 2.0. The study has also explored the differences in readiness to use e-learning on differences in enrolment level, institute type and courses.

AB  - Political observers of all types often express concerns that Americans are dangerously polarized on political issues and are, in part due to the availability of opinionated niche news programming (e.g., ideological cable, radio, and Internet news sources), developing more entrenched political positions. However, these accounts often overlook the fact that the rise of niche news has been accompanied by the expansion of entertainment options and the ability to screen out political news altogether. We examine the polarizing effects of opinionated political talk shows by integrating the Elaboration Likelihood Model of attitude development into our own theoretical model of selective media exposure. We employ a novel experimental design that gives participants agency to choose among news and entertainment programming by including treatments that allow participants to select the programming they view. The results from two studies show that ideological shows do indeed have the power to polarize political attitudes, especially among individuals who possess strong motivations to craft counterarguments. However, the polarizing force of cable news is diminished considerably when individuals are given the option to tune out. [Supplementary material is available for this article.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of the content elements of online banner ads on customers' visual attention, and to evaluate the impacts of gender, discount rate and brand familiarity on this issue. An eye-tracking study with 34 participants (18 male and 16 female) was conducted, in which the participants were presented with eight types of online banner ads comprising three content elements-namely brand, discount rate and image-while their eye movements were recorded. The results showed that the image was the most attractive area among the three main content elements. Furthermore, the middle areas of the banners were noticed first, and areas located on the left side were mostly noticed earlier than those on the right side. The results also indicated that the discount areas of banners with higher discount rates were more attractive and eye-catching compared to those of banners with lower discount rates. In addition to these, the participants who were familiar with the brand mostly concentrated on the discount area, while those who were unfamiliar with the brand mostly paid attention to the image area. The findings from this study will assist marketers in creating more effective and efficient online banner ads that appeal to customers, ultimately fostering positive attitudes towards the advertisement.

AB  - Although food retailers have embraced organic certified food products as a way to reduce their environmental loading, organic sales only make up a small proportion of total sales worldwide. Most consumers have positive attitudes towards organic food, but attitudes are not reflected in behaviour. This article addresses consumers' attitude-behaviour gap regarding their purchase of organic food and reports on how visualization of personal shopping data may encourage them to buy more organic food. Through the design of the visualization tool, the EcoPanel, and through an empirical study of its use, we provide evidence on the potential of the tool to promote sustainable food shopping practices. Of 65 users that tested the EcoPanel for five months, in-depth interviews were made with nine of these. The test users increased their purchase of organic food by 23%. The informants used the EcoPanel to reflect on their shopping behaviour and to increase their organic shopping. We conclude that the visualization of food purchases stimulates critical reflection and the formation of new food shopping practices. This implies that food retailers may increase sales of organic food through using a visualization tool available for their customers. In this way, these retailers may decrease their environmental impact.

AB  - Public opposition to immigration in Britain reflects perceptions of immigrants that focus disproportionately on illegal immigration and asylum seekers, rather than more numerous workers, students, and family members. This study examines coverage of immigration in the British national press, to see whether press portrayals of migrants provide a basis for these images of immigration underlying public attitudes. We use corpus linguistic methods to analyze 43 million words of news from 2010 to 2012. Among other findings, we show that press portrayals match public perceptions of migrants, with illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as predominant depictions in broadsheet and tabloid newspapers.

AB  - The persuasiveness of right-wing populist communication has become a widely discussed topic; it is often assumed that such messages might foster anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens. The present study explores the effects of the different components of right-wing populist communicationanti-immigrant messages, populist content, and populist styleon attitudes toward immigrants. By combining a media content analysis (N = 605 articles) with a panel survey (N = 1,968) in metropolitan areas of four Western European countries (France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), this study analyzes how citizens' attitudes toward immigrants are influenced by the right-wing populist communication with which they are confronted in their individual media diet. The results show that anti-immigrant statements in the media lead to more negative cognitions toward immigrants, while populist content leads to more negative emotions. The study, thus, demonstrates that not only anti-immigrant rhetoric but also populism as a thin-centered ideology influence citizens' attitudes toward immigrants on top of pre-existing attitudes.

AB  - Domestic approaches to compliance with international commitments often presume that international law has a distinct effect on the beliefs and preferences of national publics. Studies attempting to estimate the consequences of international law unfortunately face a wide range of empirical and methodological challenges. This article uses an experimental design embedded in two U.S. national surveys to offer direct systematic evidence of international law's effect on mass attitudes. To provide a relatively tough test for international law, the surveys examine public attitudes toward the use of torture, an issue in which national security concerns are often considered paramount. Contrary to the common contention of international law's inefficacy, I find that legal commitments have a discernible impact on public support for the use of torture. The effect of international law is also strongest in those contexts where pressures to resort to torture are at their highest. However, the effects of different dimensions in the level of international agreements' legalization are far from uniform. In contrast to the attention often devoted to binding rules, I find that the level of obligation seems to make little difference on public attitudes toward torture. Rather, the relative precision of the rules, along with the degree to which enforcement is delegated to third parties, plays a much greater role in shaping public preferences. Across both international law and legalization, an individual's political ideology also exerts a strong mediating effect, though in varying directions depending on the design of the agreement. The findings have implications for understanding the overall impact of international law on domestic actors, the importance of institutional design, and the role of political ideology on compliance with international agreements.

AB  - This study investigated whether conflictual information about novel medical findings in online newspaper articles affected laypeople's perception of tentativeness, their attitude toward, and fear of, the medical procedure in question. For this purpose, we rated the user comments from all available online newspaper articles about Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). Multilevel regressions revealed that higher levels of conflictual information in the articles were associated with higher levels of expressed tentativeness and a more negative attitude toward DBS expressed in the user comments. No significant relationship with expressed fear of DBS was found. We conclude that journalistic preparation and style is directly associated with readers' perception of tentativeness and opinion formation and discuss suggestions for journalistic presentation of scientific information.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the perceptions and experiences of nurses caring for patients and families under the COVID-19 pandemic's socially restrictive practices and policies. Background: The COVID-19 global pandemic has affected the delivery of health care to patients and their families, with many aspects altered because of the need for social distancing, social isolation, and visitation restriction policies. These policies have created communication challenges for interdisciplinary health care teams, patients, and families. As frontline caregivers, nurses have felt strongly the impact of these challenges. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted among 17 RNs who were caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and were recruited via social media posts on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Watson's theory of human caring served as the conceptual framework for the study. Results: Several themes emerged regarding nurses' experiences of communication with patients and families. These include communication challenges and barriers, prioritization, integration of group communication, nurse self-reflection, and acceptance of gratitude. Conclusions: The study findings underscore the importance of nurses' communication with patients and families under the pandemic's restricted conditions. They demonstrate the value of nurses' ability to innovate in fostering all parties' participation in the plan of care, and highlight the comfort nurses provide to patients who are isolated from loved ones. Strategies that fostered communication were identified, as were areas for further research.

AB  - Current research suggests a link between negative attitudes toward women and violence against women, and it also suggests that media may condition such negative attitudes. When considering the tremendous and continued growth of video game sales, and the resulting proliferation of sexual objectification and violence against women in some video games, it is lamentable that there is a dearth of research exploring the effect of such imagery on attitudes toward women. This study is the first study to use actual video game playing and control for causal order, when exploring the effect of sexual exploitation and violence against women in video games on attitudes toward women. By employing a Solomon Four-Group experimental research design, this exploratory study found that a video game depicting sexual objectification of women and violence against women resulted in statistically significant increased rape myths acceptance (rape-supportive attitudes) for male study participants but not for female participants.

AB  - Introduction: This study explored what influences the use of social media platforms within the CPD of occupational therapy students and qualified occupational therapists. It also considered perceived barriers to its use and whether age in line with generation theory, in particular digital natives vs digital immigrants impacted on willingness to utilise social media within CPD.
   Method: A mixed method survey design was utilised to collect qualitative and quantitative data through an online questionnaire. Content analysis was used to code and identify themes. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the findings and consider variations across the digital native/immigrant divide.
   Findings: Results highlighted that there was a predominantly positive attitude to social media use within CPD. Accessibility, networking and learning were highlighted advantages to its use. The results suggest that the digital native/immigrant divide does not impact on willingness to use social media within CPD but does impact on confidence in using platforms professionally.
   Conclusion: The study has highlighted a need for more structured teaching on professional social media use within the occupational therapy curriculum in both undergraduate and post graduate programmes. It has also highlighted a need for more training among qualified occupational therapists if platforms are to be embraced more universally.

AB  - Many animals exhibit an astonishing ability to form groups of large numbers of individuals. The dynamic properties of such groups have been the subject of intensive investigation. The actual grouping processes and underlying neural mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Here, we established a social clustering paradigm in Drosophila to investigate the principles governing social group formation. Fruit flies spontaneously assembled into a stable cluster mimicking a distributed network. Social clustering was exhibited as a highly dynamic process including all individuals, which participated in stochastic pair-wise encounters mediated by appendage touches. Depriving sensory inputs resulted in abnormal encounter responses and a high failure rate of cluster formation. Furthermore, the social distance of the emergent network was regulated by ppk-specific neurons, which were activated by contact-dependent social grouping. Taken together, these findings revealed the development of an orderly social structure from initially unorganised individuals via collective actions.

Qualtrics online panel data was self-reported by a representative sample of 18-year-old men and women (n = 702). Results show that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are significantly associated with youth feeling disconnected from parents. ACEs were also associated with higher-risk online behaviors (such as sexting and cyberbullying). In turn, cyberbullying victimization was associated with recent experiences of relationship violence. Parent-youth disconnectedness also contributed to less positive attitudes toward social media and hindered future-oriented thinking among youth. This lack of future orientation was directly associated with increased reports of relationship violence. Findings illustrate how childhood patterns of interpersonal difficulties can perpetuate into youth peer and romantic relationships. This is consistent with a toxic stress response where sources of strain, such as negative family or online experiences, can elicit negative emotions and affect, contributing to emotional, behavioral, or interpersonal problems.

AB  - Patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAUPC) have a poor prognosis. In addition their quality of life impaired by cancer pain and biliary tract infections. Therefore, multimodality therapy and selection of optimal treatment methods are essential for achieving prolonged survival. The present study investigated the significance of using hyperthermia concurrently with multimodality therapy to improve treatment outcomes in patients with LAUPC. In total, 13 patients receiving concurrent hyperthermia and chemoradiotherapy (HCR) or chemoradiotherapy (CR) alone for LAUPC between 2002 and 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Of the 13 patients, 5 received concurrent HCR and 8 received CR. The chemotherapy regimens were 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in 5 patients and gemcitabine hydrochloride (GEM) in the other8. Patients who gave consent for hyperthermia treatment received GEM plus CR. The median overall survival period for all patients was 12 months and the 1-year survival rate was 55%; the corresponding values were 12 months and 57% in the GEM CR group, and 15 months and 80% in the HCR group. Univariate analyses was perfomed to identify factors predicting recurrence after treatment. The potential prognostic factors analyzed were: Age, sex, performance status, location, tumor size, the tumor marker CA 19-9, total radiation dose, chemotherapy and hyperthermia. Univariate analysis for factors associated with outcomes revealed a significant difference favoring the HCR group [relative risk=15.97 (95% confidence interval: 12.87-19.83) P=0.021]. In conclusion, hyperthermia merits active recommendation to pancreatic cancer patients who have a positive attitude toward this treatment and whose performance status is satisfactory.

AB  - The emergent COVID-19 pandemic dictates an urgent switch to teleconsultation. India has high patient to rheumatologist ratio, and patients have limited concepts about telemedicine. Thus, we attempted to find the feasibility and acceptance of patients in switching to teleconsultation. The CARE rheumatology clinic at Kerala, India, caters to average 170 (range: 140-240) patients per day. Patients with prefixed appointments had two-level screening for eligibility for teleconsultation. Those eligible were given the option for teleconsultation on the widely available WhatsApp app. Of those who completed teleconsultations, 100 were chosen at random to provide feedback. In the first 7 days, out of 1469 appointments, 975 were found eligible for teleconsultation. Of these, 723 (74%) opted for it. The average footfall in the clinic was reduced to 67 (range 29-117). The proportion of patients accepting teleconsultations increased with time. Amongst the 100 respondents, median satisfaction was 9 (IQR 8-10) and recommendation for continuing was 9.5 (IQR 8-10) on a 0-10 scale. Multivariate analysis showed the recommendation score was dependent on beliefs about social distancing, perceptions about clinical examination, and the satisfaction score of the first teleconsultation. Age, sex, availability of personal video conferencing app or of vehicles did not independently influence this score. Without teleconsultation facilities, three-fourths of the respondents would have stopped drugs or self-medicated. The switch was feasible and accepted by patients. It enabled quick reduction in the number of persons travelling to the centre. Not making the switch could have deprived approximately three-quarters of these patients of proper medical care.

AB  - Background
   Nurses have a primary role in providing palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care. Their knowledge of EOL care, attitudes toward care of the dying, and palliative care self-efficacy are important in care delivery. Little is known regarding palliative care preparedness among Mongolian nurses. This study examines palliative care knowledge, attitude towards death and dying, and self-efficacy among Mongolian nurses, and examines predictors of self-efficacy.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Participants were 141 nurses employed at the National Cancer Center in Mongolia. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire.
   Results
   The median score for the knowledge of palliative care was 8.0/20. "Psychosocial and spiritual care" was the lowest score on the palliative care knowledge subscale. The mean score for attitude toward care of the dying was 69.1%, indicating positive attitudes. The mean score for the palliative care self-efficacy was 33.8/48. Nurses reported low self-efficacy toward communicating with dying patients and their families, and managing delirium. Palliative care knowledge and duration of experience as an oncology nurse significantly predicted self-efficacy toward palliative care, accounting for 14.0% of the variance. Conclusions Palliative education for nurses should address the knowledge gaps in EOL care and focus in increasing palliative care self-efficacy.
   Considering
   palliative care knowledge and nursing experience as an oncology nurse were significant predictors of self-efficacy toward palliative care, more effort is needed to fill the knowledge gaps in EOL care among nurses, especially for less experienced nurses.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam was exceptional in a global context in the year 2014. Darrang district is amongst the most affected districts that is hit by deadly JE virus in Assam. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of the residents regarding JE at Darrang. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed for the period of 3 months from November 2014 to January 2015 in Darrang. Multistage stage sampling was done to select participants from the district. A pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression tests were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 396 participants responded to the questionnaire, thus giving the response rate of 51.5%. One-fourth of the participants exhibited a good knowledge of JE (24.7%). The majority of the participants incorrectly answered the questions relating to management (83.3%) and prevention of JE (66.7%). Further, tertiary education and JE patient in family/ relative were significantly associated with the knowledge of the participants (P < 0.001). A large proportion of the respondents exhibited positive attitudes towards JE (96.5%). Television was the major source of information of the participants regarding JE (29.2%). Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate a lack of knowledge regarding JE among the residents of Darrang. However, their attitudes towards JE were generally positive. Further studies on this topic need to be conducted throughout the state of Assam to identify and subsequently bridge the knowledge gaps among its residents.

AB  - This study sought to determine whether playing a "serious" interactive digital game (IDG) - the Re-Mission videogame for cancer patients - activates mesolimbic neural circuits associated with incentive motivation, and if so, whether such effects stem from the participatory aspects of interactive gameplay, or from the complex sensory/ perceptual engagement generated by its dynamic event-stream. Healthy undergraduates were randomized to groups in which they were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as they either actively played Re-Mission or as they passively observed a gameplay audio-visual stream generated by a yoked active group subject. Onset of interactive game play robustly activated mesolimbic projection regions including the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens, as well as a subregion of the parahippocampal gyrus. During interactive gameplay, subjects showed extended activation of the thalamus, anterior insula, putamen, and motor-related regions, accompanied by decreased activation in parietal and medial prefrontal cortex. Offset of interactive gameplay activated the anterior insula and anterior cingulate. Between-group comparisons of within-subject contrasts confirmed that mesolimbic activation was significantly more pronounced in the active playgroup than in the passive exposure control group. Individual difference analyses also found the magnitude of parahippocampal activation following gameplay onset to correlate with positive attitudes toward chemotherapy assessed both at the end of the scanning session and at an unannounced one-month follow-up. These findings suggest that IDG-induced activation of reward-related mesolimbic neural circuits stems primarily from participatory engagement in gameplay (interactivity), rather than from the effects of vivid and dynamic sensory stimulation.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This study investigates the perceptions of faculty members at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia, towards preparedness of institutions of higher education (IHE) for assessment in virtual learning environments (VLEs) during the COVID-19 lockdown. In addition, the study explores evidence of bona fide challenges that impede the implementation of assessment in VLE for both formative and summative purposes, and it attempts to propose some pragmatic solutions.
   Background Assessment of student performance is an essential aspect of teaching and learning. However, substantial challenges exist in assessing student learning in VLEs.
   Methodology Data on faculty's perceptions were collected using an e-survey. Ninety-six faculty members took part in this study.
   Contribution This paper contributes to COVID-19 research by investigating preparedness of IHE for assessment in VLEs from faculty members' perceptions. This practical research explores deleterious challenges that impede the implementation of assessment in VLE for both formative and summative purposes, and it proposes effective solutions to prevent future challenges. These solutions can be used by IHE to improve the quality of assessment in VLEs.
   Findings The findings revealed that IHE were not fully prepared to provide a proper assessment in a VLE during the lockdown, nor did they have clear mechanisms for online assessment. The findings also showed that faculty members were not convinced that e-assessment could adequately assess all intended learning outcomes. They were convinced that most students cheated in a way or another. Additionally, faculty had other concerns about (1) the absence of advanced systems to prevent academic dishonesty; (2) insufficient qualifications of some faculty in e-assessment because most of them have never done it before, and e-assessment has never been mandated by the university before the pandemic; and (3) insufficient attention paid to formative assessment.
   Recommendations for Practitioners It is recommended that decision makers help faculty members improve by continuous training on developing e-assessment tests for both formative and summative assessments. Decision makers should also ensure the inclusion of technology-based invigilation software to preclude cheating, make pedagogical and technical expertise available, and reconsider e-assessment mechanisms. Faculty members are recommended to attend training sessions if they do not master the basic skills of e-assessment and should devise a variety of innovative e-assessments for formative and summative purposes.
   Recommendations for Researchers More similar work is needed to provide more solutions to the challenges identified in this paper regarding the e-assessment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Impact on Society The study suggests introducing technology-based solutions to ensure e-assessment security, or holding tests in locations where they can be invigilated whilst rules of social distancing can still be applied.
   Future Research Future research could suggest processes and mechanisms to help faculty develop assessment in VLEs more effectively.

AB  - The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased concern about people'smental health under such serious stressful situation, especially depressive symptoms. Cognitive biases have been related to depression degree in previous studies. Here, we used behavioral and brain imaging analysis, to determine if and how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the relationship between current cognitive biases and future depression degree and the underlying neural basis in a nonclinical depressed population. An out-expectation result showed that a more negative memory bias was associated with a greater decrease in future depressive indices in nonclinical depressed participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might be due to decreased social stress. These data enhance our understanding of how the depressive degree of nonclinical depressed populations will change during the COVID-19 pandemic and also provide support for social distancing policies from a psychological perspective.

AB  - Majority of parents use social media platforms, with young mothers being the most active users. Academic research has only recently started addressing the impact of social media on mothers, although they are one of the most engaged online audiences. Instagram and Facebook perceived as positive types of social media, where users post positive content to increase encouraging response from their subscribers and thus enhance their self-esteem. This also relates to mothers portraying positive self presentation online, therefore enhancing their parental self-esteem. This study provides in-depth analysis of 23 popular online profiles of mothers with more than thirty thousand followers on Instagram and 12 interviews with socially active mothers. This work focuses on mothers in Russia. Research findings show mothers with children of pre-school age are the most regular users of social media. This is due to time availability, as majority of these mothers are on maternity leave and due to little knowledge in child related aspects, which leads to lower self-esteem. They often look for assurance in online community. Mothers that are more confident have positive attitude towards social media communication. Mothers with initially lower self-esteem feel under pressure to maintain positive image to be in line with other mothers' presentation on social media. Mothers find Facebook more informative and supportive vehicle of communication than Instagram. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In present time, the whole world is in the phase of war against the deadly pandemic COVID'19 and working on different interventions in this regard. Variety of strategies are taken into account from ground level to the state to reduce the transmission rate. For this purpose, the epidemiologists are also augmenting their contribution in structuring such models that could depict a scheme to diminish the basic reproduction number. These tactics also include the awareness campaigns initiated by the stakeholders through digital, print media and etc. Analyzing the cost and profit effectiveness of these tactics, we design an optimal control dynamical model to study the proficiency of each strategy in reducing the virulence of COVID'19. The aim is to illustrate the memory effect on the dynamics of COVID'19 with and without prevention measures through fractional calculus. Therefore, the structure of the model is in line with generalized proportional fractional derivative to assess the effects at each chronological change. Awareness about using medical mask, social distancing, frequent use of sanitizer or cleaning hand and supportive care during treatment are the strategies followed worldwide in this fight. Taking these into consideration, the optimal objective function proposed for the surveillance mitigation of COVID'19, is contemplated as the cost function. The effect analysis is supported through graphs and tabulated values. In addition, sensitivity inspection of basic reproduction number is also carried out with respect to different values of fractional index and cost function. Ultimately, social distancing and supportive care of infected are found to be significant in decreasing the basic reproduction number more rapidly.

AB  - Does consumption distance as a measure of individual alienation reveal the effect of social identity? Using the central idea of Akerlors 'social distance' theory, individual distance is calculated from their own group mean consumption and then we examine whether individuals from different social groups - caste and religion-are alienated across the distance distribution. Using India's household-level micro data on consumption expenditure covering three major survey rounds since the inception of the reform period, we find a non-unique pattern where the marginalised and minority group households tend to be alienated across the distance distribution. However, among them, the households with higher educational attainment become more integrated as reflected in the interaction effect of education. These results are robust even after controlling for the endogeneity of education. Given this significant group difference in consumption, we undertake a group-level comparison by creating a counterfactual group through exchanging the characteristics of the privileged group to the marginalised group (or Hindus to non Hindus), and find that the privileged group still consumes more than the counterfactual marginalised group, explaining around 77% of the estimated average consumption gap at the median quantile in 2011-12 (or 59% for Hindus versus Non-Hindus). This suggests other inherent identity-specific social factors as possible contributors to within-group alienation (relative to a better-off category) that can only be minimised through promoting education for the marginalised (or minority religion) group.

AB  - In this research, the attitude of European young adults (age 18 to 30 years) regarding their consumption of local and traditional products was examined. The survey was conducted on a sample of 836 consumers from seven European countries (Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Croatia, Denmark and France). Data collection was made by distributing a developed questionnaire through social media and university mail services. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify consumer perception comparing the overall sample with two subsets (consumers from Eastern and Western European countries). Six major factors were revealed: consumer behavior, uncertainty about health issues, cost, influence of media and friends and availability in store. Young adults had a positive attitude to local and traditional food products, but they expressed insecurity about health issues. Cost factor had less of an influence on interviewees from Eastern European countries than those from the overall sample (3rd and 5th factor accordingly). Influence of close environment was a different factor in Eastern countries compared to Western ones, for which it was common to see an influence from media. Females and older people (25-30 years old) have fewer doubts about Traditional Food Products, while media have a high influence on consumers' decisions. The aim of this survey was to identify the consumer profiles of young adults and create different promotion strategies of local and traditional products among the two groups of countries.

AB  - This research explores the intended and unintended consequences of eating disorder public service announcements. We assessed participants' attitudes toward eating disorders and people with eating disorders, willingness to interact with people with eating disorders, and experience with eating disorders (covariate) at Time 1. At Time 2, participants were randomly assigned to watch a stigmatizing or a non-stigmatizing eating disorder public service announcement. Exposure to the stigmatizing public service announcement resulted in more negative attitudes toward eating disorders and in less willingness to interact with people with eating disorders, but not in significantly more negative attitudes toward people with eating disorders. The discussion highlights the practical implications for health communication campaigns.

AB  - Background: Decades of research demonstrate the pernicious effects of targeted cigarette marketing on young people. Now, with tobacco marketing shifting toward greater incorporation of alternative products, it is critical to identify current attitudes toward the new landscape of tobacco advertisements. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to understand the present landscape of tobacco marketing to which young adults are exposed, and to assess how they respond to it. Method: During 2015-2016, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA), in which 44 young adults (aged 18-28) carried smartphones equipped with a survey app. Seventy-seven percent were ever-users of tobacco and 29.5% were intermittent users of tobacco (someday users of cigarettes and/or those who used another tobacco product >5 times within the past year). For ten days, participants were prompted at three random times/day to complete a brief survey about their exposures and responses to tobacco-related advertising. Analyses used t-test and multilevel modeling. Results: Intermittent users reported greater exposure than non-intermittent users to tobacco advertising. Further, both intermittent and ever-users reported more positive attitudes toward the tobacco advertising. Of the tobacco advertisements reported, 22% were for products unregulated by the FDA at the time of data collection. Conclusions/Importance: These findings indicate that young adults, and especially young adults who use tobacco, are exposed to a fair amount of tobacco advertising on a weekly basis. As the tobacco users in our sample were largely experimental and occasional users, these marketing exposures could put young adults at risk for progression toward regular use.

AB  - Background: Mammography screening can reduce breast cancer mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate non-attendance in mammography screening in relation to different aspects of a women's social network, attitudes and cancer in close relations.
   Methods: Data from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study baseline examination in 1991-1996 was used. A re-examination began in 2007, and 1452 women participated. Family composition, social support, sense of belonging, attitudes on screening and breast cancer risk and on previous cancer in close relations were investigated in relation to self-reported participation in mammography screening using logistic regression analysis, yielding odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals.
   Results: Both attendees (98.0 %) and non-attendees (95.2 %) considered mammography screening important. Non-attendance in mammography screening was associated with being unmarried vs. married (2.40:1.30-4.45) and with not having vs. having children (1.77:1.08-2.92). Non-attendees planned to abstain from mammography screening in the future more often than attendees (4.78:2.56-8.90), and they had often abstained from cervical cancer screening (1.69:1.04-2.75). No other statistically significant association was found.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that family composition, but not necessarily the presence or absence of social support, perceived cancer risk or cancer in close relations, may affect non-attendance in mammography screening. A positive attitude towards mammography screening was found among both attendees and non-attendees, although the latter group planned to a lesser degree to attend mammography screening in the future.

AB  - This study tested whether intergroup threat enhances prejudice and discrimination toward the highly discriminated out-group of Roma. An implicit measure of linguistic discrimination, namely language abstraction of terms used in Roma descriptions, and an explicit measure of affective prejudice, that is, feelings thermometer, were employed. The relation between implicit and explicit discrimination was also analyzed. Threat enhanced linguistic derogation and affective prejudice toward Roma. Linguistic abstraction mediated threat's effect on affective prejudice. The implications of the findings were discussed with reference to the role of language in shaping intergroup relations and social exclusion.

AB  - The study explored factors associated with intention to be screened for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study also examined whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between knowledge about screening and the intention to be screened for AD. A population-based, random-digit dialing survey was performed and 1,043 responses were collected from a sample of nondemented persons (50 years or older) living in urban, suburban and rural areas in a Midwestern state. The findings showed that participants who were younger and who had higher levels of (a) perceived benefits and barriers, (b) social support and (c) self-efficacy reported higher levels of intention to be screened for AD. Older adults with positive life orientation reported greater intention to be screened for AD, whereas depressed participants were more likely to report a plan to be screened for AD. Self-efficacy mediated the relationship between knowledge about screening and intention to be screened. Older adults were more likely to report intention to be screened when they had positive attitudes about the screen and believed that they could receive the screen. The intention to be screened for AD could serve public awareness by defining effective ways to assist older adults to seek a cognitive screen.

AB  - This study investigates whether sharing of or commenting on online news enhances loyalty toward online news outlets. We identify two mediators of audience integration and loyalty: satisfaction and trust, which are measured by attitudinal attributions toward a news outlet. Loyalty is measured by frequently and exclusively using an online news outlet and an absent willingness to change to another online news outlet in the future. The relations between audience integration, satisfaction, trust, and loyalty are estimated with a mediation model. Results from an online survey with N = 1825 Swiss online news users reveal small but significant effects of sharing and commenting quantities on loyalty. Sharing tends to increase satisfaction, which in turn enhances loyalty. In contrast, commenting deteriorates satisfaction and trust, but directly improves loyalty. Overall, sharing and commenting slightly increase loyalty. In conclusion, sharing has a small, positive attitudinal relationship-building capacity for online news outlets, whereas commenting does not. Nonetheless, commenting features should not be abandoned by news outlets.

AB  - Purpose Based on the concepts confined in Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study investigates users' attitudes towards adoption of a blockchain-based framework in the esports industry that proposes a scheme of rewarding stakeholders for their invested attention along with blockchain technology's inherent protocols. Design/methodology/approach The present study uses RStudio (Version 1.3.1093) package RedditExtractoR for scraping and analysis of the discussion referring to the keyword "Verasity" on the Reddit website. The final corpus of 1,913 user comments was considered for the study. Sentiment analysis was initially conducted to explore the semantic orientation of the users concerning Verasity. This was followed by generalized equation modeling to analyze the impact of social media attributed to the users' commenting behavior. Findings The study found that Redditors, in general, have a positive attitude towards the adoption of a blockchain-based esports platform. This was validated through the empirical findings. The regression model states that there is a significant positive impact of the positivity in the comments over the Redditors' attitude and in their commenting behavior. Originality/value This study offers a new understanding of key contributing attributes of sentiment formation over social media concerning a blockchain-based esports framework. The study also establishes an empirical relationship between the social media attributes and the commenting behavior of Redditors. Finally, the current study offers valuable insights into social media engagements and the selection of highly influential Redditors for practicing marketing managers.

AB  - This study explored how a 2-year, maker-centered science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project-based learning (M-STEM-PjBL) curriculum aimed at leading students to be makers changed students, science teachers, and a rural middle school in Taiwan, where teachers were stressed due to the low birth rate and low grades in the Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School Students (CAP). This practical action research study utilized data collected from 24 students in a maker class, their peers, 4 teachers, and administrative documents related to school enrollment and student competitions' records. Results showed that teachers had shifted their teaching from being teacher-centered to student-centered. The students who participated in the M-STEM-PjBL curriculum actively assisted peer learning and initiated active teacher-student interactions. Both teacher and student participants improved their practical skills during the process. Students in the maker science class had more positive attitudes toward science and science learning and changed their peers' attitudes in the regular science class. The problematic rate of not meeting the required standard in the science subtest of the CAP was reduced from 36 to 26%. Moreover, student participants' products recommended to the county or national level competitions frequently won awards. Student participants' creativity and the science teachers' teaching efforts were recognized in the media. Parent endorsement of the school was increased, the threat of losing students to other schools was decreased, and the crisis of cutting the number of classes was reduced.

AB  - Democracy may contribute to friendly attitudes and positive attitudes toward outgroups (i.e., outgroup tolerance) because members of democratic societies learn to exercise their rights (i.e., cast a vote) and, in the process, listen to different opinions. Study 1 was a survey study with representative samples from 33 countries (N = 45,070, 53.6% female) and it showed a positive association between the levels of democracy and outgroup tolerance after controlling for gender, age and the rate of immigrants influx from 2010 to 2013. Study 1 demonstrated that members in countries with higher political participation and civil liberty showed greater tolerance toward immigrants. In Study 2, we conducted an experimental study in Taiwan (N = 93, 67.7% female) to further examine two potential mediators (opinion sharing and voting) of the effect of democratic system on tolerance toward outgroups (i.e., attitudes toward mental patients) after controlling for gender and age. We found that when individuals were allowed to share opinions and vote, they had the highest positive other-oriented emotions toward mental patients, which in turn led to greater tolerance toward outgroups compared to those who were not allowed to share opinions or vote. In general, these results demonstrated that the democratic system plays a critical role in increasing outgroup tolerance. Limitations of the two studies and implications regarding opinion sharing, voting, democratic systems, and effects on outgroup tolerance are discussed.

AB  - BackgroundAs public health leaders prepare for possible future influenza pandemics, the rapid spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza highlights the need to focus on measures the public can adopt to help slow disease transmission. Such measures may relate to hygiene (e.g., hand washing), social distancing (e.g., avoiding places where many people gather), and pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., vaccination). Given the disproportionate impact of public health emergencies on minority communities in the United States, it is important to understand whether there are differences in acceptance across racial/ethnic groups that could lead to targeted and more effective policies and communications.
   ObjectivesThis study explores racial/ethnic differences in the adoption of preventive behaviors during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.
   Patients/MethodsData are from a national telephone poll conducted March 17 to April 11, 2010, among a representative sample of 1123 white, 330 African American, 317 Hispanic, 268 Asian, and 262 American Indian/Alaska Native adults in the USA.
   ResultsPeople in at least one racial/ethnic minority group were more likely than whites to adopt several behaviors related to hygiene, social distancing, and healthcare access, including increased hand washing and talking with a healthcare provider (P-values <005). Exceptions included avoiding others with influenza-like illnesses and receiving 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccinations. After we controlled the data for socioeconomic status, demographic factors, healthcare access, and illness- and vaccine-related attitudes, nearly all racial/ethnic differences in behaviors persisted.
   ConclusionsMinority groups appear to be receptive to several preventive behaviors, but barriers to vaccination are more pervasive.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate inpatient and staff member attitudes toward and experiences with ward cats, and identify possible mechanisms for how cats affect patient satisfaction in a psychiatric clinic. Thirty-three inpatients diagnosed with depression or psychosis residing on wards with and without cats and 17 staff members working on wards with cats participated in semi-structured interviews using a cross-sectional study design. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and correlations. The results showed that 17 out of 19 inpatients and all the staff members liked having a cat on their ward. Further, 12 out of 14 inpatients on wards without cats would like having a cat on their ward. Inpatient perceptions of the cat's impact on the ward atmosphere correlated significantly with their emotional relationship with the cat (p = 0.015, r = 0.561), how often they saw the cat (p = 0.002, r = 0.676), and if they liked cats in general (p = 0.041, r = 0.486). Our results highlight the positive attitudes of inpatients and staff members toward ward cats and the potential of ward cats to enhance patient satisfaction. This influence might be mediated by factors such as the frequency of contact, the relationship between each patient and the cat, and each patient's attitude toward cats in general.

AB  - This study reports on the development of the interpersonal discourse semantic system of involvement based on the analysis of evaluative meanings in 3 different data sets of Chinese digitally mediated communication. It builds on prior work developed within tenor and interpersonal meanings. Within the proposed system, 3 kinds of interpersonal meaning dimensions are posited. The first relates to the relative status between interlocutors and participants within a social hierarchy and is, thus, named social hierarchy. The second relates to the positioning of the person posting and others in relation to how close their relationship is and is, thus, named social distance. The third relates to who is being positioned within the other 2 dimensions and is called involvement type. Within the 3 data sets of digitally mediated Chinese communication (i.e., forum posts, SMS, and chat room messages), we found that the Chinese interlocutors frequently positioned themselves and others in relationships both within a social hierarchy as well as in relationships concerning their relative social distance. Results show there are a number of linguistic realisations of these 3 involvement systems which Chinese interlocutors use to negotiate their relative social positions in digitally mediated communication.

AB  - Authenticity is an increasingly important factor in citizens' evaluations of political candidates and their voting decisions. As citizens value political authenticity, politicians attempt to appear true to themselves in the public eye. However, little research has examined how these perceptions of politicians as more or less authentic are constructed. This study examines how citizens form perceptions of politicians' authenticity and particularly sheds light on the relationship between political media exposure and perceived political authenticity. Drawing on the literature on performed authenticity in social media, personalized media coverage, and information processing, we examine the effects of exposure to political information in different media on perceptions of political authenticity and its subdimensions. Results from an online quota survey in Germany (N = 1,210) show that differences in perceived political authenticity are not simply determined by citizens' political attitudes but can also be explained by their frequency of exposure to political information in different media types. When citizens use private TV news, political accounts on social media, and follow candidate profiles, they perceive politicians as more authentic. Our analyses also suggest that some effects of media exposure on perceived political authenticity are conditioned by citizens' party identification and their tendency to select ideologically congruent political information.

AB  - With the growth of the internet, electronic (online) business has become an important trend in the economy. This study investigates how retailers could enhance their shopping processes and hence help sustain their e-business development. Therefore, we propose a unified information system-consumer behavior (IS-CB) model for online shopping to analyze factors that impact online shopping. We used an online survey to gather data from 633 online customers to test the theoretical model, matching differences using structural equation modeling. Highly influencing factors for the IS-CB online shopping model included perceived value (PV), perceived risk (PR), social factors (SF), perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), online shopping intention, trust, online shopping experience, actual online shopping purchases, entertainment gratification (EG), website irritation (WI), information design (ID), visual design (VD), and navigation design (ND). This study provides important theoretical and practical implications. PV and trust in online shopping can nurture positive attitudes and shopping intentions among online customers. Well-designed websites produce higher levels of trust and reduced WI. Similarly, online shopping sites with better ID, ND, and VD also reduce WI and increase trust. This study fills gaps in previous studies relating to IS and CB and provides explanations for IS and CB constituent impacts on acceptance and use of online shopping. The proposed unified IS-CB explains consumer online shopping patterns for a sustainable e-business.

AB  - This paper reports on an Australian study around early childhood educators' attitudes and beliefs on the use of touchscreen technologies by very young children, under three years of age. The study adopted an ecological perspective and educators and directors of early childhood centres completed an online survey and were interviewed on this specific topic. Data were analysed to identify teachers' competencies (eg, digital skills) but also possible factors behind attitudes and beliefs (eg, leadership styles; training; teaching philosophy). Findings suggest that early childhood teachers' views are evolving and they are now more confident when they use technology for work/personal purposes but not as confident when integrating technology with very young children. Educators' overall confidence and hours using technology is significantly associated with a positive attitude towards the incorporation of technology. Their teaching philosophy is also associated with their technology use with very young children. In contrast, training or lack of it is not significant. This study has direct implications for Early Childhood Education as it will contribute to better understanding educators' views and practices on a hotly debated topic and whether they are ready to change their traditional views and embrace this new social reality. The need for more research on the influence of technological use on very young children's development will also be underlined.

AB  - Objectives: We used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine young adults' attitudes towards pro-tobacco messages encountered in real time and their association with intentions to use tobacco. Methods: Young adults (N = 92, ages 18-29) recorded sightings of marketing or social media related to tobacco in real time via mobile app for 28 days. Participants reported message characteristics, their attitudes towards the message, and intentions to use the depicted product for each submission. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine factors related to attitude towards message and intentions to use tobacco. Results: Messages depicting e-cigarettes (p < .001) or hookah (p < .05) were associated with significantly more favorable attitudes compared with traditional cigarettes. Positive attitude towards the message was significantly associated with intention to use the depicted product (p < .001). Messages depicting e-cigarettes and hookah were significantly associated with higher intention to use. Message source was not significantly related to attitudes towards the message or product use intentions. Conclusions: Marketing featuring e-cigarettes and hookah is an important target for future regulation. Given that pro-tobacco and e-cigarette messages are prevalent online, future research should consider the Internet and social media as important venues for counter-marketing and intervention efforts.

AB  - This paper focuses on the question of how young people today evaluate the Second World War today and how this difficult past' determines their political attitudes. Furthermore, the channels through which the current young generation in Europe is informed about the events dating back to the first half of the twentieth century (e.g. parents and grandparents, schools, the media) are examined. The theoretical basis chosen for addressing these questions is the work of Mannheim (1928) on the formation of successive generations, and the theories of collective memories and identities of Eisenstadt and his followers. Our empirical evidence comes from a transnational comparison of young people's memories of this difficult past in Denmark, Finland and Germany. From a historical perspective a comparison of the three countries is particularly interesting as they played different roles during the Second World War. The evidence highlights the different perceptions of history among youth and points to the absence of a common European understanding of what happened between 1939 and 1945. The empirical evidence comes from a research project (2011-2015) funded by the European Commission and covering 14 European countries. Its main focus has been on present-day young people's perceptions of history and politics (MYPLACE=Memory, Youth, Political Legacy and Civic Engagement).

AB  - In his acculturative family distancing (AFD) theory, Hwang (2006b) argued that acculturation gaps among parents and youth may lead to psychological and emotional distancing. AFD includes 2 dimensions: incongruent cultural values and breakdowns in communication. This study examined whether bicultural competence (BC) served as a mediator and moderator for the relationship between AFD and depression using structural equation modeling. Two hundred and forty-one Latino/a college students attending predominantly White, midwestern universities completed an online survey at 2 time points. For mediation, results indicated that BC at Time 2 (T2) mediated the relationship between AFD at Time 1 (T1) and depression at T2 above and beyond the effects of depression, acculturation, and enculturation at T1. A bootstrap method estimated the significance of the indirect effect. Moreover, 16% of the variance in BC at T2 was explained by acculturation, enculturation, and AFD at T1; 30% of the variance in depression at T2 was explained by BC at T2 and depression at T1. Post hoc analyses of the AFD and BC dimensions suggested that (a) positive attitudes toward both groups, communication ability, and social groundedness were significant mediators for the incongruent cultural values-depression link and (b) communication ability and social groundedness were significant mediators for the communication breakdown-depression link. For moderation, the AFD X BC interaction did not significantly predict depression at T2. Limitations, future research directions, and counseling implications are discussed.

AB  - YouTube has become an educational and entertainment tool among Western European families, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study monitored the main channels for children aged 0-5 years by using the social media analysis (SNA) methodology from March 24, 2020 to August 24, 2020. The software used has been FanpageKarma, which allows the collection and interpretation of data. The results indicate not only a growth in the use of such channels during confinement, but also how their expansion is related to the evolution of the COVID-19, reflecting, in turn, the consequences of the government policies adopted. Social distancing generated a greater consumption of recreational content, but not a greater growth in educational content regardless of the country or culture.

AB  - In this study, we experimentally examined parents' perceptions of scientific information about spanking, a controversial topic, and car seat safety, a consensus topic, presented in online news articles. Specifically, we tested whether parents of children ages 2 to 8 years would trust scientific experts (speaking from professional expertise) more than online lay commenters (speaking from personal experience). One hundred and eighty parents across 41 U.S. states were recruited online from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (124 mothers, 56 fathers; 74% White, 9% Black, 8% Latino, 8% Asian, and 1% other or multiple ethnicities). Parents were randomly assigned to read a news article with an expert discussing spanking research that varied by two conditions: The news article contained either anti-spanking lay comments or pro-spanking lay comments. All parents also read a second news article on car seat safety (a consensus topic). Between-condition analyses were used to compare perceptions of the comment conditions, and within-condition analyses were used to compare perceptions of the expert knowledge versus the comments and to compare perceptions of the spanking expert versus the car seat expert. Moderation analyses were used to compare parents' perceptions based on their attitudes toward spanking. Parents with positive attitudes toward spanking recognized pro-spanking comments as opinion, yet still found them more trustworthy than a scientist taking the opposite position. All parents perceived the car seat expert as trustworthy. The results highlight challenges in disseminating information about controversial topics to the public.

AB  - Background: Oral cancer is a preventable disease. Its occurrence is mostly due to lifestyle. In Sudan, the use of smokeless tobacco (Toombak) has long been linked to oral cancer. Knowledge of the signs and symptoms of oral cancer may well aid in early diagnosis and treatment. This is bound to result in increasing survival rates, as well as reducing the oral cancer burden on the society. This study aimed to assess oral cancer awareness regarding knowledge of signs, symptoms, risk factors and sources of the information. Furthermore, it attempts to evaluate attitudes towards oral cancer screening and any previous experience of screening, amongst dental patients attending University of Science and Technology (UST) Dental Teaching Hospital. Omdurman, Sudan.
   Methods: A hospital based cross-sectional study, interviewer-administered questionnaire was conducted amongst 500 adult patients attending the UST Dental Hospital during 2015.
   Results: A total of 57.7% (286) of the individuals demonstrated good knowledge of signs and symptoms, whereas 49% (139) expressed good knowledge of risk factors of oral cancer. For the majority of the individuals 66.1% (290), the most common source of information about oral cancer was from the media, while 33.9% individuals (149), obtained knowledge from direct contact of health workers. The overwhelming majority, 93.2% (466) never screened for oral cancer despite their positive attitude towards it 66.4% (332). Knowledge of risk factors associated significantly with those reported positive attitude towards oral cancer screening and those reported direct contact with health workers as a source of information, (p <= 0.001). Moreover, females and those living in urban districts scores higher than their counterpart in knowledge of risk factor of oral cancer. In addition, those employed 58.6% (280) and 62.8% (164) with correct believes about oral cancer showed significant association with positive knowledge of signs and symptoms (p <= 0.05).
   Conclusions: Awareness levels, knowledge of risk factors and identifying early signs and symptoms of oral cancer necessitate the need for more structured preventive programs using media. Dentists and health workers should do more because they have a pivotal role in early diagnosis by performing oral cancer screening, raising levels of knowledge and in rectifying misconceptions about oral cancer. This would entail a reduction in high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with oral cancer.

AB  - Cause-related marketing improves corporate image and consumer attitudes toward brands. An important research gap is how the visual attention paid to cause-related cues in social media affect consumer attitudes and behaviors. In the present study, we analyze the moderating role of the visual attention paid to Instagram-based, cause-related posts on the impact of consumer perceptions (i.e., corporate image), beliefs (trust), and attitudes (i.e., corporate social responsibility [CSR] support) on behavioral intentions (i.e., cause participation, consumer advocacy, and intention to share posts) for fast-food restaurants. Data for the study were collected in a between-subjects experiment with 123 participants. Visual attention was measured using eye-tracking technology, and consumer attitudes and behavioral intentions through an online survey. The results show that the greater the attention paid to images (amount and duration of fixations) and the more revisits made lead to more positive attitudes and behaviors toward the cause and the company. On the other hand, the more time spent looking at the company's responses to negative user-generated content weakens the relationship between trust and consumer advocacy toward the company. These results can help practitioners design appropriate cause-related marketing strategies in social media.

AB  - In an effort to reduce learners' pregnancies, the government introduced various interventions in schools such as life skills and HIV/AIDS programmes. In addition there are also clinics, television, radio and internet that provide information about HIV/AIDS and teenage pregnancy. However, despite these interventions and information about HIV/AIDS, pregnancies among female learners have continued to increase. The purpose of this study was to attain an understanding of knowledge, attitudes and use of contraception among learners attending a high school in Mdantsane. A quantitative, descriptive survey was conducted. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, which was self-administered to 150 female learners. When the learners were asked about their understanding of contraception, 86.67% understood it as prevention of pregnancy and 8.67% understood it as prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. About 66.3% of learners had positive attitudes to contraceptives and 77.27% were using injectable contraceptives. The main cited reason for stopping the use of contraception was the side effects. Given the main used type of contraception and reason for discontinuation, learners need to be educated about the mechanism of contraceptives and side effects associated with them. In addition, more contraceptive options should be offered to learners.

AB  - The current research explores the motivity behind young adults' Instagram posts about the factors - documentation, promotion, creativity, validation, and escape to understand if the results signal towards a rise in creativity, narcissism, or attention-seeking, determine the intent of creative expression of users' Instagram posts, and to study the positive aspect in Instagram usage. The Study employs the qualitative method of in-depth interviews for the collection of data. It applies the social interactionist and creative destruction theories to interpret the results to understand the mindsets of the respondents concerning their usage of Instagram. Findings suggest a positive attitude in creative usage of the platform. However, it was seen that the sample did not quite indicate attention-seeking behavior and narcissism. This Study is important in the space of new media and its usage because a large amount of research has been done to understand the negative impacts of social media. However, there hasn't been much exploration when it comes to the positive aspects of it. Hence, it leaves a lot of scope for more extensive research with larger sample sizes to establish a near concrete conclusion.

AB  - When posting content in social media, users can feel excluded due to lacking (cyber-ostracism) or negative (cyber-rejection) feedback. Referring to the temporal need-threat model, this study examined the impact that both exclusion experiences have on social media users' need threat and on their online coping behavior to fortify threatened needs. For this purpose, a pre-registered between-subjects experiment (N= 211) was conducted by manipulating the type of social exclusion on three levels (ostracism; rejection; inclusion). Results indicated that both types of exclusion threatened media users' needs for belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and control. Compared to ostracized users, rejected ones were more threatened in their needs for belonging and self-esteem, but equally threatened in their needs for meaningful existence and control. Regarding social media users' coping behavior, ostracized users showed more prosocial behavior, whereas rejected ones rather withdrew from social interactions.

AB  - A virtual medical imaging department is an innovative and demanding organizational model, to the extent that the underlying goal is to achieve a continuous and advanced organizational integration of human and physical resources, clinical data, and clienteles. To better understand the kind of benefits offered, we conducted a survey of three groups of users-radiologists, radiological technologists, and medical specialists-working in a five-site virtual organization. We received 127 valid questionnaires, for an overall response rate of 66%. The assessments vary according to the use made of the system. The scores for system quality and the quality of the data produced were markedly higher for intra-hospital use (respectively 7.9 and 8.7 out of 10) than for inter-hospital use (5.4 and 7.0). Despite the negative assessments they made of inter-hospital use, users maintained a positive attitude toward some type of virtual organization of medical imaging. Indeed, the score for Overall satisfaction with the system was very high, 8.9 out of 10. Moreover, the scores for Intended future use of the system were very high for both intra-hospital use (8.9) and inter-hospital use (8.7). We also found significant differences in perceptions among user groups.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) helps prevention and aftercare of sporadic breast cancer (BC), cardiopulmonary fitness (CPF) being an age-independent predictor of tumor-specific mortality. Therefore, we wanted to identify predictors of CPF (represented by peak oxygen uptake: VO2peak) in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers whose risk of developing BC is high. We used cross-sectional data from 68 BRCA1/2 germline mutation carrying women participating in the randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study LIBRE-1. Assessments included cardiopulmonary exercise testing, medical and lifestyle history plus socioeconomic status. Additionally, the participants completed a psychological questionnaire regarding their attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control and intention towards PA. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify predictors for participants reaching their age- and sex-adjusted VO2peak reference values. 22 participants (median age: 40 years, interquartile range (IQR) 33-46) were cancer-unaffected and 46 cancer-affected (median age: 44 years, IQR 35-50). The strongest predictor for reaching the reference VO2peak value was attitude towards PA (Odds Ratio 3.0; 95% Confidence Interval 1.3-8.4; p = 0.021). None of the other predictors showed a significant association. A positive attitude towards PA seems to be associated with VO2peak, which should be considered in developing therapeutic and preventive strategies. Trial registrations: NCT02087592; DRKS00005736.

AB  - Objectives: Since 2009 the number of unvaccinated children in Poland has been regularly increasing. The purpose of the study was to learn what parents who decide to vaccinate their children feel and believe about their children's vaccines and in particular to find out how these sentiments and beliefs affect their attitude and decision-making with reference to vaccinations. Methods: The interviews were conducted during an immunization visit of parents whose children are covered by immunization schedule; 53 parents aged 23 to 48 years took part in the study. Most study participants were high school or university graduates living in rural areas. Children were 1 week to 5 years old. Thematic analysis was used to analyse interview data. Results: Identified factors shaping the parents' positive attitude to vaccination included conviction of necessity of vaccines (effective disease prevention, safety, favourable benefit-to-risk ratio, and concerns about the child). The general anti-vaccination belief was that vaccines are unnecessary. External factors, mainly authority figures and media broadcasts, affect parents' beliefs and decisions. Conclusions: Various factors affect parents' decision concerning immunization of their children. Both compulsory and recommended vaccines should be provided free-of-charge. Choice overload should be reduced. Paediatricians should address parental vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - Past suicide attempts are a powerful predictor of suicide. This study developed and evaluated the feasibility of a mobile application for creating safety plans, which include coping strategies that can be immediately accessed and used by suicide attempt survivors during a crisis. A safety plan mobile application, called Brake of My Mind, was developed (study 1). Heuristic evaluation (for experts) and user evaluations (for health professionals and adolescent suicide attempt survivors) were performed. A pilot test was then conducted based on the theory of planned behavior to evaluate the feasibility of Brake of My Mind (study 2). Three adolescent suicide attempt survivors used a pilot version of Brake of My Mind. Attitude toward suicide attempts, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and suicide intentions were assessed before, immediately after, and 1 week after using Brake of My Mind. Brake of My Mind showed very few low-priority usability problems, and it was considered a "good" and "acceptable" application. In study 2, median scores for attitudes toward suicide attempts, perceived behavioral control, and suicide intentions decreased over time after using Brake of My Mind. The subjective norm scores did not change. Brake of My Mind is an acceptable application for adolescent suicide attempt survivors that appears effective in decreasing their positive attitude toward suicide attempts.

AB  - Carsharing is often promoted as a potentially environmental-friendly alternative to individual car ownership. However, various carsharing programs have displayed limited success in the past. An initial field study of a new carsharing service is such a story of failure: The introduction of this new service at a medium-sized German university generated unexpectedly low adoption rates so that the service was eventually scaled down and then suspended. Quantitative field study results as well as additional qualitative focus groups reveal that missing compatibility is a key barrier to adoption. Drawing on extant conceptual frameworks of user participation in sharing business models, a factorial survey identifies the importance of different dimensions of carsharing business models for their acceptance. The results reveal that a set of convenience and lifestyle dimensions influences usage intentions, including mode of drive, pickup and drop-off mode, service level, price model, availability, and type of market mediation. In contrast, vehicle fleet does not appear to influence carsharing models' acceptance. These findings contribute to research on business model configuration as well as the attitude-behavior gap in the sharing economy by determining relevant dimensions of a carsharing business model that can bridge the gap between basically positive attitudes and usage resistance. Thereby, they also serve for concrete managerial recommendations.

AB  - We explore the quantity (frequency) and quality (priority, atmosphere, structure) of family mealtimes and associations with nutritional and emotional health in Jamaica. Urban adolescents (N = 330, M = 13.8 years, SD = 1.8, 64% girls) and their mothers (M = 41.4 years, SD = 7.8) completed questionnaires. On average, mothers reported having family meals 3-4 times/week and mealtime quality, but not quantity, was associated with health. Correlations revealed that mothers ate more unhealthily if they watched more TV during meals, and actor-partner independence modeling showed that high SES adolescents ate more unhealthily if their mothers had more difficulty finding time for family meals (and vice versa: partner interaction). Additionally, adolescents and mothers were more psychologically distressed if they themselves had more difficulty finding time for family meals, if they had less positive attitudes/behaviors around mealtime atmosphere (actor effects), or if they were high SES individuals placing lower importance on mealtimes (actor interaction). Overall, however many weekly meals Jamaican families are able to share together, what's important is to make those mealtimes count as quality time. Leisurely family meals with enjoyable conversation uninterrupted by television, such as the age-old Jamaican tradition of "Sunday Dinner", may nourish both body and soul.

AB  - On the surface, it seems that journalists are more publicly accessible than ever before, largely thanks to the popular microblogging website/ app, Twitter. But determining who is interacting with journalists on Twitter is important in order to understand who benefits from these interactions. We argue that social capital provides a useful framework for understanding this phenomenon because it sheds light on the ways in which journalists are embedded in structures of formal and informal social connection, and it highlights social inclusion and exclusion in these processes. Relying on a two-wave, online survey collected before and after the 2018 Midterm Elections, we examine the relationship between social capital and interactions with journalists on Twitter. Results show that people with higher levels of social capital are more likely to interact with journalists, which can be interpreted as a form of social exclusion. Results are discussed in light of the role of journalism in fostering social connectivity and civic engagement.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate health professions student's awareness, attitude, and perception towards the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and also to determine the influence of socio-demographic variables on the descriptive outcomes of this study.
   Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted among Undergraduate Health Professions Students (n=398) at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences at Riyadh campus, through a validated questionnaire.
   Results: The results of the study revealed that among various modalities of CAM, most students were aware and used prayers/spirituality, followed by nutritional supplements, cupping, massage, herbal medicine and yoga. The least effective modality was aromatherapy, whereas the most harmful modality was acupuncture. The data showed that the students obtained more information from friends/relatives and media and less from formal CAM training/courses. Awareness/self-use and beliefs/attitudes were found to have significant associations (p < 0.05) in regard to gender, parent's educational level, and family income.
   Conclusion: The study shows that most of the healthcare students are aware of and demonstrate positive attitudes towards the effectiveness and safety of most CAM modalities. However, the lack of formal training or courses is a major barrier towards its use and practice.

AB  - The goal of this study is to determine the possible factors leading to increased anti-Muslim sentiment or Islamophobia in a comparative examination of public opinion in the United States and Europe. Secondary analyses of data from the 2008 Pew Global Attitude Project and the 2010 Pew News Interest Index, allow us to assess the role of religious practice, news interest and political affiliation in the attitudes toward Muslim minorities in several countries. Predictors of anti-Muslim attitudes include being politically more conservative and being older in all countries, and paying close attention to news coverage of the Park51 Islamic Community Center in the United States (which was proposed to be built near Ground Zero in New York). In France, but not in the other countries of the study, the importance of the respondents' religion was positively related to anti-Muslim attitudes.

AB  - Health brands are based on the relations between individuals and health behaviors and lifestyles. Brands can be measured by the brand equity construct validated in previous studies. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign brands alternative, non-drug use behaviors as a behavior change strategy. This study goes beyond previous campaign evaluations, which did not include specific brand equity measurements. Using data from a nationally representative media tracking, this study examined the relation between antidrug campaign brand equity and adoption of targeted attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Data were gathered before the relaunch of the campaign, and follow-up data collected 3 months later. On the basis of factor analysis, the authors developed a higher order antidrug brand equity factor and regressed campaign outcomes on that factor in multivariable models. The authors observed significant effects of higher brand equity on higher levels of targeted antidrug attitudes and normative beliefs at follow-up. The authors also observed some counterintuitive relations (i.e., less positive attitudes at follow-up). They interpreted these results in light of the changing messages and campaign strategy. The authors conclude that antidrug brand equity is an important construct for understanding campaign effectiveness. The present campaign shows signs of changing targeted antidrug attitudes and beliefs among youth with brand equity.

AB  - This study is among the first to investigate the religiosity patterns, identity motives and attitudes towards Christians and non-believers among recent Muslim refugees in Finland (N = 128). There are two novelties in this study. First, it applies the religious orientation framework to study religious identities among Muslim refugees in Europe. Second, it combines a variable- and person-centred approach to study religiosity in the context of intergroup relations. Using the variable-centred approach with a multiple mediation analysis, we found that refugees' extrinsic religiosity was associated with more positive attitudes towards Christians. Neither intrinsic religiosity nor participants' religious identity motives were associated with out-group attitudes. Using the person-centred approach with a Two-Step cluster analysis, we showed that individuals with higher levels of intrinsic as compared to extrinsic religiosity and those with pronounced religious identity motives were more biased towards non-believers than towards Christians. Attitudes towards Christians and non-believers were similarly positive in a group characterised by equal levels of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity. We discuss these findings in light of the role of religiosity in understanding Muslim refugees' attitudes towards receiving societies.

AB  - Introduction: The article presents a protocol of a cross-sectional study of mental health of pregnant women in relation to the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary aim is to compare differences in anxiety and depression scores of pregnant women between countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim is to assess demographic, economic, and social aspects affecting maternal anxiety and depression scores among pregnant women worldwide in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we will be able to compare differences in perception of the different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic (social distancing, restrictions related to delivery) between countries and according to the epidemic status (number of infected patients, number of reported deaths). The comparisons will also be done according to the COVID-19 status of the participants. Methods and analysis: It is a web-based anonymous survey of pregnant women living in countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey is comprised of 3 sections: 1) Questions related to general demography, pregnancy health history, mental health history, socioeconomic factors, as well as perception of fear, burden and restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire for anxiety assessment and; 3) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression assessment. Web-based recruitment for health research has proven to be cost-effective and efficient. At current times with the COVID-19 pandemic, limited resources and social distancing restrictions, performing a mental health study involving pregnant women on a large international scale cannot be safely conducted without involving social-media. The fears of pregnant women fall into 3 categories: the medical condition, the economic status and the organization of daily activity. The study has received approval of the medical ethics committee and has been registered on Clinicaltrials.gov. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and made public through all available media.

AB  - In urbanized settlements, ensuring access to the outdoor environment is essential to stimulate well-being responses indoors. Windows provide access to aesthetic and natural features and bring in clues about the time, weather, and seasonal conditions outdoors. Although dynamic environmental attributes are inherent outdoor view qualities, no studies have explored the effects induced by such dynamic conditions on individuals, limiting the extent to which these features might inform design guidelines for sustained indoor well-being. To address this gap, a virtual reality experiment was conducted to analyze subjective responses to lightness changes in outdoor views with respect to three view constructs (i.e., preference, recovery, and imageability). A novel framework for classifying, capturing, and analyzing urban views was extended to generate the view stimuli material consisting of dynamic and static scenes (i.e., panorama images and 360? videos). Attitudes toward dynamic and static views were tested with an adjusted rating instrument. Results showed significant interactions between view type and lightness change factors for the three view constructs presented in dynamic format. Mean scores for views presenting lightness variations were higher than those observed for identical scenes portraying no lightness variations. Low coefficients of variation for individual questions were found, suggesting the adequacy of the subjective instruments to evaluate dynamic views. Moderate to high positive Pearson correlation coefficients were found between three construct pairs, indicating links between the approaches to examine views. The findings in this study demonstrate that positive attitudes toward views are strongly mediated by the presence of luminous changes in these views.

AB  - It is essential that health professionals are trained to provide optimal care for our ageing population. Key to this is a positive attitude to older adults along with the ability to work in teams and provide interprofessional care. There is limited evidence on the impact an interprofessional education (IPE) placement in a residential aged care facility (RACF) has on students. In 2015 in Western Australia, 51 students (30% male, median age 23years), from seven professions, undertook a placement between 2 and 13weeks in length at 1 RACF. Pre- and post-placement measurements of attitudes to the elderly were collected using the Ageing Semantic Differential (ASD) questionnaire and level of readiness for interprofessional learning with the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). A total of 47 students completed matched ASD and RIPLS surveys. The mean total score on the ASD survey decreased significantly from pre- to post-placement from 116.0 to 108.9 (p=0.033), indicating attitudes became increasingly positive towards older adults. Significant differences post-placement were seen indicating better readiness for interprofessional learning, for two out of four subscales on the RIPLS, namely teamwork & collaboration (42.1-44.0; (p=0.000)) and positive professional identity (18.2-19.3 (p=0.001)). The degree of change is similar to findings from other settings. The results support IPE-focussed student placements within RACF positively influence student's attitudes towards the older adult as well as increase student's readiness for interprofessional learning, confirming RACF are valuable places for training health professionals.

AB  - Many studies demonstrate that mortality salience can increase negativity toward outgroups but few have examined variables that mitigate this effect. The present research examined whether subtly priming people to think of human experiences shared by people from diverse cultures increases perceived similarity of members of different groups, which then reduces MS-induced negativity toward outgroups. In Study 1, exposure to pictures of people from diverse cultures engaged in common human activities non-significantly reversed the effect of MS on implicit anti-Arab prejudice. In Study 2, thinking about similarities between one's own favorite childhood memories and those of people from other countries eliminated MS-induced explicit negative attitudes toward immigrants. In Study 3, thinking about similarities between one's own painful childhood memories and those of people from other countries eliminated the MS-induced reduction in support for peace-making. Mediation analyses suggest the effects were driven by perceived similarity of people across cultures. These findings suggest that priming widely shared human experiences can attenuate MS-induced intergroup conflict. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sapmi is a geographical area that runs across the Kola Peninsula in Russia to northern Finland, Norway and Sweden. All Sami languages have been going through a rapid language change process and many of the traditional language domains have disappeared during the last decades due to previous national and local language policies. Nevertheless, recent growth of positive attitudes towards Sami languages and culture both within and outside the Sami group has given new momentum to the language revitalisation process. At the same time, English is becoming more present in the Sami context through tourism, media and popular culture. This study investigates 15-year-old writers' meaning-making in three languages they meet on a daily basis: North Sami, the majority language Finnish/Norwegian/Swedish and English. Data were collected in schools where writers wrote two texts in each language, one argumentative and one descriptive. Using a functional approach, we analyse how three writers make meaning across three languages and two genres. Results show that writers made use of similar ways of expressing meaning on the three levels we investigated: ideational, interpersonal and textual, but also how the production differed between the texts, and how context and content interacted with writers' meaning-making in the three languages.

AB  - Reflection offers an important means to learn effectively from changes induced by the workplace. The authors examined readiness to change and work-related self-determination as preconditions for reflection at work and expected personal initiative-defined as self-starting and proactive behaviour-to have a mediating effect. The study tested these relations using a questionnaire with 84 client advisors working in retail banking departments. These client advisors were about to undergo a range of changes in their workplaces at the time of the data collection. The changes-most importantly, the implementation of a new advisory concept accompanied by new advisory software-afforded these individuals the opportunity to learn. Further, the study conceptualised self-determination as an individual's experience of autonomy, competence and social integration at work. Regression analyses revealed that social integration and perceived competence exert positive effects on reflection. The results indicate that personal initiative mediates the relationship between readiness to change and reflection as well as the relationship between all facets of self-determination and reflection. This paper discusses these findings in terms of their theoretical contribution to the literature on workplace learning and in relation to the practical importance of developing positive attitudes toward changes at work and active work behaviours for change-related learning activities such as reflection to succeed.

AB  - Background: In 2014, the world was startled by a sudden outbreak of Ebola. Although Ebola infections and deaths occurred almost exclusively in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, few potential Western cases, in particular, caused a great stir among the public in Western countries.
   Objective: This study builds on the construal level theory to examine the relationship between psychological distance to an epidemic and public attention and sentiment expressed on Twitter. Whereas previous research has shown the potential of social media to assess real-time public opinion and sentiment, generalizable insights that further the theory development lack.
   Methods: Epidemiological data (number of Ebola infections and fatalities) and media data (tweet volume and key events reported in the media) were collected for the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and Twitter content from the Netherlands was coded for (1) expressions of fear for self or fear for others and (2) psychological distance of the outbreak to the tweet source. Longitudinal relations were compared using vector error correction model (VECM) methodology.
   Results: Analyses based on 4500 tweets revealed that increases in public attention to Ebola co-occurred with severe world events related to the epidemic, but not all severe events evoked fear. As hypothesized, Web-based public attention and expressions of fear responded mainly to the psychological distance of the epidemic. A chi-square test showed a significant positive relation between proximity and fear:X-2(2)=103.2 (P<. 001). Public attention and fear for self in the Netherlands showed peaks when Ebola became spatially closer by crossing the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Fear for others was mostly predicted by the social distance to the affected parties.
   Conclusions: Spatial and social distance are important predictors of public attention to worldwide crisis such as epidemics. These factors need to be taken into account when communicating about human tragedies.

AB  - Wine production is directly related to the environmentally responsible production. In recent years, due to demands for an environmentally responsible wine production in the Republic of Serbia, wine producers have become aware of the environmental responsibilities and are taking measures to prevent environmental problems. The objective of this research was to investigate attitudes of winery owners/managers on business performance of the wineries concerning the environmental behavior and its disclosure. The research has been conducted in the period from July to the end of October 2021 on a sample of 330 small wineries in the Republic of Serbia. The data were processed in the Smart PLS software v.3.2.7. The findings show a positive connection between of both service and financial performance with an ethical environmental behavior and environmental disclosure. However, no positive connection between innovative performance and ethical environmental behavior or ethical environmental disclosure has been determined. The positive attitudes of managers on the environment influence the business performance of wineries and indirectly on environmental behavior and disclosure. The current study should contribute to the relevant literature, as it investigates not only firm behavior in the wine sector, but also the impact of firm performance on the environment.

AB  - This study examined factors that affect journalists' Twitter use behaviors based on the framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A survey of Korean journalists supported that TPB is a useful theoretical framework for understanding journalists' Twitter use behaviors. This study found that three TPB variables - positive attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control - are positively associated with journalists' general Twitter use (i.e., time spent using Twitter). More importantly, beyond looking at journalists' general Twitter use, this study expands the literature by distinguishing between expressive Twitter use (e.g., tweeting messages) and consumptive Twitter use (e.g., reading others' tweets). Results showed that journalists' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls were associated differently depending on patterns of expressive and consumptive Twitter usage. Given the role of professional journalists in society, their ways of using Twitter may have a profound impact on the ecology of journalism. Contributing to the literature of the theory of planned behavior by extending its explanatory power to professional journalists' Twitter usage, the results of this study suggest that future research on journalists' Twitter use should pay more attention to how Twitter is employed within the journalistic context.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in the world and the mortality rate is getting higher and higher. Due to the outbreak of such epidemic disease, many countries imposed stricter measures among which is social distancing and enforced isolation. The present study tries to establish a realistic model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures. In so doing, it takes into account stochastic perturbation and investigates the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics. This paper seeks to study the existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution to the proposed model and establish conditions for extinction and persistence in mean of the disease. Numerical simulations are presented to show the theoretical results obtained from this study.

AB  - Thin-idealized models are mainly promoted in fashion ads, supporting "thinness sells." Based on the self-schema theory, this study investigated how self-evaluative and motivational schema in appearance influenced attitudes toward brand advertising thin models and purchase intention. A web-based survey consisting of three different model stimuli-thin, average-sized, and no models-in fashion ads was conducted. A total of 380 female college students at a large Midwestern university in the United States responded to the web-based survey. Results indicate participants with higher motivational schema in appearance showed more positive attitudes toward brand and greater purchase intention when exposed to thin models rather than average-sized and no models. However, participants with lower motivational schema in appearance responded to thin models less favorably than those with higher motivational schema. These results explored individual differences of motivational self-schema in appearance in responses to thin models. Implications on marketing and advertising strategies for fashion ads were discussed.

AB  - The integration of Faccbook into English as a Second Language (ESL) environment arc prevalent in many higher institution settings, but not many focuses on the receptive skills of reading. This study examines university students' perceptions of Facebook for ESL reading activities. To accomplish this, three methods of data collection were employed; a questionnaire, an informal Facebook group (IFG), and interviews. The findings show that students with good reading ability undertook more reading activities on Facebook, perceived the highest development of language skills after using Facebook and had the most positive attitudes towards English language learning on Facebook compared to students with moderate and poor reading ability. The students saw the effectiveness of the IFG in ESL, but, participated more as silent readers and believed that a higher involvement from the moderator would further enhance ESL progress. They preferred to read non-academic content on Facebook, particularly creative productions like short stories and poems to further cultivate ESL reading habits, develop reading comprehension and boost reading interest.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of organizational justice and conflict management on employee relations (ER) through the mediating role of climate of trust. Design/methodology/approach This study was conducted with a sample of 331 employees working in a power transmission unit of Odisha. Data were collected by administering a structured questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (AMOS 20). Findings The results reveal that climate of trust plays the role of a partial mediator between organizational justice and ER and conflict management and ER. Also, it was found that organizational justice, conflict management and climate of trust are the positive and significant predictors of ER. Research limitations/implications - The study was confined to a single state-owned power transmission unit of an Indian state, which restricts its generalizability. The research would benefit from exploration in alternative units. Practical implications - This scholarly work may encourage managers and decision makers to develop trust building climate by focusing on organizational justice and conflict management to flourish an environment of harmonious ER, furthermore to formulate effective strategies for cultivating facilitative work environment to enhance positive attitude among the employees to challenge future goals. Originality/value The research is exclusive in determining the influence of organizational justice and conflict management on ER through the mediator of climate of trust in the new perspective of the power sector that provides empirical evidence to the extant literature.

AB  - Researchers have only recently begun to explore the role of parenthood and family in politics. While some scholars focus on the political attitudes of parents, others examine the advantages and disadvantages of politicians' parental status on candidate viability. Building on the concept of politicized motherhood, we argue that focusing on candidates' parental status alone provides an incomplete picture of the full range and symbolic functioning of family in political discourse. We coin the theory, politicized family, which includes narratives of candidates' spouses, parents, grandparents, and children, and argue it provides a more useful frame for understanding these processes. We also move the literature forward by assessing how media coverage of families of presidential hopefuls varies along gendered and racialized lines. Using 2,458 articles and opinion pieces from the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal, we conduct a content analysis of candidate coverage from the 2004 and 2008 Democratic presidential primaries to explore how national print media portrays the family narratives of presidential candidates. Our results uncover both gendered and racialized family discourses embedded in media representations of presidential hopefuls. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of such portrayals for establishing candidates' relatability and electoral viability.

AB  - As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Finnish citizens started to display teddy bears in their windows. As this activity gained media interest and popularity, it grew into a transgenerational form of toy play, where children and adults participated as displayers and spectators in this visual-material play pattern, made available to a broader audience through sharing on social media. A previous phase of the study articulated and analyzed the phenomenon as an act that facilitates mental well-being through imagination, participation, and playing for the common good (Heljakka, 2020). By theorizing and framing the phenomenon as pandemic toy play, the researcher suggested the importance of resistance, resourcefulness, and playful resilience in times of forced self-isolation and social distancing. This article builds on the earlier phase of the study by focusing on the previously identified themes and investigates the occurrence of these themes in adult toy play during a pandemic.

AB  - This study attempted to disentangle the issues underlying the marked drop recorded in political engagement of young Greek Cypriots. To reveal the dynamic processes through which people debate, disagree or convince each other towards the formation of political attitudes, eight focus-groups were carried out with a total of forty participants, equally distributed according to age and gender. The analysis showed that young Greek Cypriots appear uncertain for their future, pessimistic, cynical, and highly disillusioned with traditional politics. Contrary to what is observed in other European countries, young Greek Cypriots do not experiment with alternative forms of political action, remain inactive, and although the country's politicised culture of the past is still reflected in their theoretical discussions about social issues, they express embarrassment and confusion when asked to elaborate on how theory could be transformed into practice. They associate politics with corruption and economic interests, they are scornfully disillusioned with the European Union, and they emotionally distance themselves from important changes to come with the possible reunification of Cyprus. Young Greek Cypriots appear insecure, pessimistic, disoriented, uninspired, and in an urgent need to rediscover passion for ideas which they cannot any more find in traditional politics and forms of political action.

AB  - The majority of research on media counter-stereotyping of race/ethnicity has tended to employ positive portrayals or counter-stereotypical exemplars as a primary strategy in eliciting positive attitudes among White participants. In contrast, this article reports the results of an experiment on the unique role of affective responses to media messages as a mechanism in inducing greater feelings of connectedness with a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. Our focus is on the affective response of elevation specifically, which refers to feelings of being moved, touched, and inspired by images of people engaged in morally beautiful acts such as love, generosity, and kindness. Results show that the experience of elevation in response to inspiring videos was associated with heightened feelings of overlap between the self and humanity, with this overlap associated with greater feelings of connectedness with those from a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. This connection was also associated with more favorable attitudes.

AB  - The concepts of virtualization for facilitating learning have become the focus of attention in several countries. Yet, the limited understanding of how technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can be used to improve the learning and teaching of science makes it difficult for educational policy makers to apply additional measures in order to ensure the availability of equipment and trained staff. A semi-structured interview was used to gather data from primary school teachers about the challenges and prospects of utilizing VR and AR technologies in teaching science subjects. A set of evidence and recommendations on AR and VR utilization for teaching science were provided based on an interview of 29 science teachers. It was determined that lack of competency, limited instructional design, lack of focused attention, lack of time, and limited environmental resources were common challenges in VR and AR utilization. In addition, we found that both technologies can be used to promote exploratory behavior and perceived usefulness and develop a positive attitude. Other findings related to these aspects were identified and described. The outcomes from this study can provide insights for administrators and policy makers to set priorities for using VR and AR in school practice to carry out various reflective and exploration tasks.

AB  - Consumers mainly acquire information through social learning in online shopping environment, and social presence as a media attribute generated by real-time interactions in live streaming commerce is more conducive for consumers' social learning. Therefore, it is worth investigating the roles of social presence and social learning on consumers' purchase intention (PI) in the strong interactive environment. Based on social cognitive theory (SCT) framework and drawing on social presence theory and social learning theory, this study investigates the relationships among social presence, social learning process, and PI. Social presence is operationalized into social presence of others (SPO) and social presence of interactions (SPI), whereas social learning process contains external interaction process [exploitative learning (ETL) and exploratory learning (ERL)] and internal psychological process [cognitive appraisal (CAP) and affective appraisal AAP)]. The results from a survey of 372 consumers of live streaming commerce indicate that SPO and SPI positively affect ETL and ERL and then contribute significantly to the building of CAP and AAP, which can lead to PI. The findings also provide guidance for brand managers and retailers in building more effective interactive atmosphere and promoting consumers' positive attitude toward brands in live streaming marketing.

AB  - Today, turning to the quality of life and the use of spiritual and health attitudes have become one of the communities' concerns. This study aimed to determine a structural model of urban quality of life (UQL) based on socioeconomic status (SES), religious attitude, and mental health status among Iranian Muslims. The sample included 383 individuals (256 females and 179 males) from Yazd selected by multi-stage cluster sampling method. The subjects responded to the demographic form, Urban Quality of Life Scale-47 (UQLS-47), the Religion Assessment Questionnaire-26 (RAQ-26), and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). The results showed that SES and religious attitude were negatively associated with mental health and positively associated with UQL. Also, mental health negatively associated with UQL and has the role of a mediating variable. This means that three variables (SES, religious attitude and mental health) can predict a 0.45 variance of UQL. The findings are in line with similar studies. So, Iranian Muslims have better mental health and SES in society and a more positive attitude toward religion and spirituality; they will have better UQL.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to compare a Web-based curriculum with a traditional lecture format on medical students' cultural competency attitudes using a standardized instrument and to examine the internal consistency of the standardized instrument. Methods: In 2010, we randomized all 180 1st-year medical students into a Web-based (intervention group) or a lecture-based (control group) cultural competency training. The main outcome was the overall score on the Health Belief Attitudes Survey (1 5 lowest, 6 5 highest). We examined internal consistency with factor analysis. Results: No differences were observed in the overall median scores between the intervention (median 5.2; 25th percentile [Q1] 4.9, 75th percentile [Q3] 5.5) and the control groups (median 5.3, Q1 4.9, Q3 5.6) (P = 0.77). The internal consistency of the 2 main subcomponents was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83) to acceptable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.69). Conclusions: A Web-based and a lecture-based cultural competency training strategies were associated with equally high positive attitudes among 1st-year medical students. These findings warrant further evaluation of Web-based cultural competency educational interventions.

AB  - The three stage model set forth by the ACGME, which provides a framework for pandemic residency program management, is insufficient and could best be expanded to 5 stages to include post-pandemic-peak residency program management. Stage 4, "Increased non-COVID clinical demands," present the challenge of an increased clinical workload in the setting of social distancing while reengaging the educational mission of the residency program. In Stage 5, "Business as usual, redefined," the residency program must learn to adapt to new challenges including uncertainty surrounding the American Board of Radiology (ABR) Core examination, uncertainty in the job market, and potential diminished medical student interest in radiology. Despite these challenges, this post-pandemic environment offers tremendous opportunity to build on and enhance the residency program now and into the future.

AB  - While public policy worldwide has focused on providing digital connectivity infrastructure in remote areas, there remain people who are digitally excluded. Hence, it is important to explore why people, despite having access to a digital connection, do not go online. As the third part of a three-year project on digital inclusion in isolated communities in Chile, this study draws on findings from focus groups conducted with non-Internet users who live in three remotes but digitally connected villages, to unravel the elements associated with their decision to remain digitally excluded. The main findings indicate that strong ties within the community shelter their sense of isolation providing a feeling of closeness, whereas the internet is perceived as disruptive. In addition, negative attitudes about the Internet emerge from the discussions: the internet is associated with addiction and isolation. Finally, the absence of digital skills makes smartphones and computers unknown entities, a black box people feel unable to or overwhelmed at the thought of learning how to use. However, many are facing a hard choice due to their need to remain in contact with those outside the community as well as promote and develop their small business ventures. Therefore, there is a cultural construction of the Internet as a required form of progress that nonetheless does more harm than good to a tight-knit community.

AB  - Background: It is important to measure the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users.
   Methods: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, "coronavirus," "COVID-19," "quarantine") from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets.
   Results: Popular unigrams included "virus," "lockdown," and "quarantine." Popular bigrams included "COVID-19," "stay home," "corona virus," "social distancing," and "new cases." We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics.
   Conclusions: This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning Pandemic-related fear, stigma, and mental health concerns are already evident and may continue to influence public trust when a second wave of COVID-19 occurs or there is a new surge of the current pandemic.

AB  - The study compared the level of physical activity (PA) between older people living with HIV (PLWH) and their HIV-negative counterparts in China and tested the mediational roles of self-compassion, attitudes toward aging, and perceived stress in the between-group difference in PA. From December 2017 to August 2018, face-to-face interviews were conducted among 337 and 363 HIV-positive and -negative people aged >= 50 in Yongzhou City, Hunan, China. Path analysis was performed. The proportions of low, moderate, and high levels of PA in the HIV-positive and -negative groups were 18.9% versus 6.7%, 43.1% versus 32.0%, and 38.0% versus 61.3%, respectively, yielding a statistically significant difference. The path analysis showed that older PLWH reported less self-compassion and positive attitudes toward aging, which was in turn associated with more perceived stress and ultimately associated with less PA. Chinese older PLWH were more sedentary than their HIV-negative counterparts. Future PA interventions may modify the mediators.

AB  - Although a limited amount of research exists on pay communication, most shows that pay communication is associated with positive attitudes. Little research exists on pay secrecy and its outcomes. Using equity theory, this article explores the dynamics of how perceived pay communication and perceived pay secrecy policies relate to desirable attitudes. The article proposes that pay equity is the link that mediates these relationships. Data were collected in a U.S. public utility, and findings reveal that perceived communication about how pay levels are determined is positively associated with affective organizational commitment and three dimensions of pay satisfaction, and most of these relationships are fully or partially mediated by pay equity. While perceived written pay secrecy policies show no relationship with attitudes, perceived unwritten secrecy policies negatively predict pay administration satisfaction and this relationship is mediated by pay equity. Finally, neither written nor unwritten pay secrecy policies are related to whether or not respondents report discussing their pay.

AB  - The growing interest in sustainable development in all sectors of the economy has fostered a noteworthy shift toward responsible management education (RME). This emerging view underscores that business schools provide students with more than just managerial knowledge as they also develop students toward responsible management. Based on socialization theory, we show how this development occurs by studying RME as a process that relates to students' values, attitudes and behavioral intentions. With data from a large international survey of business students from 21 countries, our findings show that RME facilitates students' self-transcendence, the development of conservation values and positive attitudes toward corporate social responsibility (CSR). Further, RME is positively related to students' CSR behavioral intentions (willingness to sacrifice salary to work for a responsible employer) through the mediating role of values and attitudes. In sum, this study extends socialization theory to the higher education domain to show that business schools can affect students' prosocial, ethical values and intentions, with implications for responsible management and RME.

AB  - Literature shows the immense importance of technology acceptance among junior school teachers. Hence based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the current study aims to investigate the impact of various external factors, i.e., appreciation learning climate, facilitation learning climate, learning through reflection, and learning through experimentation on the adoption of technology among junior school teachers in Indonesia. Using a quantitative field survey, data were collected from 410 respondents and were analyzed using SmartPls3 by testing through the measurement and structural model. Results revealed that junior school teachers have a positive attitude towards the use of educational technology. Also, the external factors, i.e., appreciation learning climate was positively associated with perceived usefulness. Whereas facilitation learning climate, learning through reflection, and learning through experimentation were found to be positively and significantly associated with the perceived ease of use and actual use of the educational technology. Integrating Motivation-Hygiene Theory with the TAM model, this study revealed how multiple external factors motivate teachers to incorporate educational technology in their teaching methodologies. Besides extending the literature related to TAM and motivation theory, several future research directions are suggested.

AB  - Although both storied and extensive, social scientific research on the effects of pornography consumption on males has primarily focused on testing the feminist contention that pornography contributes to sexual aggression against females. Other parties have expressed concern about males use of pornography, however. Moralists (Linz & Malamuth, ) have argued that pornography promotes a permissive approach to sexual relations. Public health researchers have hypothesized that pornography encourages epidemiologically risky sexual behavior. This study used cross-sectional General Social Survey data gathered between 1973 and 2010 to assess these claims for empirical support. In line with moralists contentions, pornography consumption was associated with having more positive attitudes toward teenage sex, adult premarital sex, and extramarital sex. Pornography consumption was also positively related to actually engaging in extramarital sex. In line with public health researchers concerns, pornography consumption was associated with having more sexual partners and engaging in paid sex behavior. Additional longitudinal and experimental research is needed to determine the directionality of these associations and to rule out possible third-variable confounds, such as erotophilia or hypersexuality. Regarding consumption, the percentage of adult U.S. males who consume pornography appears to have increased only slightly over time.

AB  - A 2 x 2 x 2 experiment examined the role of immigrants' religion and perceived acculturation strategy on majority members' attitudes. Acculturation strategies were manipulated along the two dimensions of contact and culture maintenance. Italian majority members (N = 247) read fictitious but seemingly real interviews with Arab immigrants, in which the immigrants' religion (Muslim vs. Christian) and acculturation preferences (desire for contact and for culture maintenance) were manipulated. MANOVA showed a main effect of contact majority members associated immigrants who were perceived to favour contact with more positive attitudes, empathy, trust, positive stereotypes and metastereotypes, and lower levels of threat. MANOVA also showed a main effect of culture maintenance: when immigrants were perceived to abandon their culture, majority members reported lower levels of symbolic threat and greater empathy towards them. A significant Religion x Culture maintenance interaction effect emerged on majority members' stereotypes and contact intentions: Muslim immigrants who were perceived to abandon their heritage culture elicited more favourable responses than Muslim immigrants who were perceived to maintain their heritage culture. Taken together, these findings suggest that desire for intergroup contact amongst immigrants, independently of their religion, can promote harmonious intergroup relations with the majority group.

AB  - The development of automated vehicles (AVs) has attracted increasing attention. Understanding public acceptance of AVs and their intention to use them, which are the primary aims of the present study, are especially important considering that increasingly more AVs will be moving on the road in the coming future. A total of 527 participants voluntarily and validly completed a series of questionnaires, including the automated vehicle acceptability scale (AVAS), Big Five Inventory (BFI), and some sociodemographic variables. The results of an internal consistency, reliability, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the two-factor (contextual acceptability and impaired driving) structure of the AVAS. The Chinese public generally has a positive attitude towards AVs. In addition, our results indicate the possibility of the misuse of AVs. More importantly, the results reveal that contextual acceptability partially mediated the effect of agreeableness on the willingness to drive and the willingness to own AVs and fully mediated its effect on the willingness to rent AVs, while contextual acceptability and interest in impaired driving fully mediated the effect of the openness on the willingness to drive, own, and rent AVs. Manufacturers and retailers in the automotive vehicle industry should provide their customers with comprehensive information regarding the principles and limitations behind the system and the responsibility and obligations of the drivers to avoid misuse. Moreover, providing more targeted services according to customers' different personality traits might be a useful sales technique.

AB  - The current study tested the impact of different messaging interventions on changing attitude and behaviour in relation to Red and Processed Meat Consumption (RPMC). The study compared the effectiveness of receiving fourteen daily messages on the health, environment, or health + environment benefits of reduced RPMC, against a no message control condition. All three intervention conditions also received daily reminders of the goal regarding RPMC and were asked to record RPMC using a food diary. Participants in the control condition were only asked to use a food diary to record daily food intake. Behaviour and attitude in relation to RPMC of all participants were assessed at Time 1 (pre-message), Time 2 (immediately post-message, two weeks later) and Time 3 (one month later again). Participants were Italian undergraduates (at Time 1 N = 322) randomly allocated to one of the four conditions. Only those completing all measures at all time points were retained for analysis (N = 241). Results showed that health message condition and environment message condition, but not health + environment messages condition, were effective in increasing a positive attitude towards reduced RPMC compared to the control condition. Attitude mediated the effects of health condition and environmental condition on the reduction of behaviour. The effects of health and environment messages on attitude and behaviour persisted for one month after the end of the intervention. Implications for devising effective messaging intervention to change RPMC are discussed.

Participants were 290 Greek junior high school PE teachers. Two years after the introduction of the new curriculum, participants responded to de-identified questionnaires with acceptable psychometric properties. Mastery-oriented and high self-efficacious teachers had positive attitudes towards the new curriculum, implemented the biggest number of teaching plans and they intended to do the same in the future. Performance approach goal orientation had low positive relationship with the implementation of teaching plans and no relationship with intention to do the same in the future, while performance avoidance goal was not related to any determinant of curriculum implementation and intention. The effects of mastery goal orientation on intention and behaviour were mediated by self-efficacy to achieve an educational aim which is an end in itself, that is, the promotion of students' self-regulation in exercise settings. The effects of performance approach goal orientation on behaviour were mediated by self-efficacy to achieve a curricular goal which is a means to promote other educational aims, that is, the adoption of student-centred teaching styles. Teaching experience was negatively related to implementation of the new curriculum and with most of its determinants. Strategies aiming to strengthen teachers' self-efficacy, mastery goals, attitudes and intentions to implement a new curriculum are suggested.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the key factors that influence behavioral intention to adopt MOOCs. The study was conducted in three countries namely, Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan. The study was considered significant considering the advancements in technology that have had an unprecedented impact on education, and the need to conduct learning online due to the COVID-19 to pandemics. The research adopted the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and extended it by including other variables including culture, social distancing, and absorptive capacity. The study was conducted using the quantitative methodology, where the data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The data was collected from a sample from each of the three countries, and sample sizes were 455, 490, and 513 for Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan respectively. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and multi-group SEM analysis. The results of the study indicated that effort expectancy and culture significantly and positively influenced behavioral intention to use MOOCs in all three countries. As well, absorptive capacity is mediated significantly by performance expectancy and effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions have a significant influence on MOOCs in both Thailand and Pakistan. Social influence has a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Thailand, hedonic motivation and price value have a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Poland, and the habit has a significant factor in Pakistan. The keys aspects influencing behavioral intention to Use MOOCs were different in Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan, in various factors which are performance expectancy, social distancing, price value, facilitating conditions, and social influence. The research recommended that it is important to evaluate the situation and prevailing conditions of the concerned country, before implementing the MOOCs and the associated online learning practices.

AB  - Purpose Identify the elements (defining characteristics, related factors, and risk factors) of the diagnoses of NANDA international impaired religiosity (00169), risk for impaired religiosity (00170), and readiness for enhanced religiosity (00171), in a period of social distancing in the pandemic of COVID-19, and associate them with the behavior of individual and collective religious practice, before and during the pandemic. Methods Survey study, released via social media to members of religious communities in Brazil. Data collection took place in June 2020, by online questionnaire. Findings Participants were 719 people, 563 (78.3%) were women, with a median age of 39 years (min 18-max 73), of Catholic religion (64.7%), with a median of 29 years of religious practice (min 0-max 70). The participants were from Southeast 652 (90.68%), South 49 (6.82%), Northeast 13 (1.82%), Midwest 4 (0.56%), and North 01 (0.14%) of Brazil. The increase of individual religious practice was associated with two diagnostic elements and the reduction of individual practice to nine elements. The reduction of collective religious practice was associated with seven diagnostic elements and the maintenance of the practice associated with five elements. The increase of collective religious practice was associated with five diagnostic elements. Conclusions In individuals who presented during the pandemic reduction of individual religious practice, reduction of collective religious practice, and maintenance of collective religious practice, the elements of the diagnosis impaired religiosity were predominant. In individuals who presented increased practice of collective religious activity during the pandemic, the elements of the diagnosis readiness for enhanced religiosity were predominant. Implications for nursing practice This study highlights defining characteristics, risk factors, and related factors of the religiosity diagnoses presented due to social distancing in the pandemic; these should be screened during nursing consultations in primary health care.

KW  - INFECTION-CONTROL
AB  - Background: Antibiotic resistance is a growing issue in nursing homes (NHs). Antibiotic stewardship (ABS) programmes can reduce antibiotic use in NHs, but few studies have assessed to what extent they are implemented in NHs.
   Objectives: To describe ABS current practices and describe the opinion of NH stakeholders regarding ABS and opportunities for improvement in one French region.
   Methods: We invited by e-mail the medical and nurse coordinators of all NHs of the Grand Est region, France, to participate in our survey in 2019. The online questionnaire included 35 questions covering four topics: NH characteristics, current ABS practices, attitudes towards ABS and opinions on strategies to promote ABS. A score evaluating implementation of core ABS elements was calculated using the current ABS practice responses.
   Results: Out of 417 NHs, 75 (18%) participated in our survey. The three most implemented ABS activities were antibiotic consumption monitoring (65%), antibiotic plan documentation (56%) and antibiotic prescription guide distribution (54%). Audit and feedback, training sessions or identification of a local ABS leader ranged from 13% to 29%. Participants positively perceived ABS and most suggestions to improve ABS programmes in NH, with maximal interest in training, audit and feedback interventions. The median score for implementation of core ABS elements was 3.3 (IQR = 2.3-5.4; theoretical range 0-11), and the score distribution was not associated with any NH characteristic.
   Conclusions: While there is still room for improvement, NHs had a positive attitude towards ABS strategies. Some regional and national initiatives to promote ABS in NHs exist and should be actively promoted.

AB  - In this study, the attitudes, expectations and views of 206 students in four high schools within the scope of the FATIH project in Turkey were assessed regarding tablet PC technology after six months of a pilot plan that included the distribution of tablet PCs to students. The research questions of this study are whether there is a meaningful difference between tablet PC use by male and female students and the effect of computer and Internet by students on attitudes toward tablet PC use. Qualitative and quantitative data collection tools were used in the research. The Computer Attitude Measure for Young students (CAMYS) developed by Teo and Noyes (2008) was used in evaluating the students' attitudes toward the tablet PC usage. Interviews were conducted with eight teachers at pilot schools concerning the integration of tablet PCs into their classes; the positive and negative dimensions of tablet PCs were analyzed. The findings indicate that students have a positive attitude toward tablet PCs. There was not a meaningful difference between the attitudes of male and female students toward tablet PCs. The length of computer and Internet by the students did not affect their attitudes toward tablet PCs. The ways that teachers used tablet PCs in classes, the positive and negative aspects of tablet PC usage and the students' expectations of tablet PCs were discussed in the study.

AB  - Social isolation and its deleterious effects on health increases with age in the general population. People with Parkinson's Disease (PWP) are no exception. Social isolation is a risk factor for worsened health outcomes and increased mortality. Symptoms such as depression and sleep dysfunction are adversely affected by loneliness. There is a paucity of research on social isolation in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is all the more critical now in the setting of social distancing due to COVID-19. The goal of this study was to survey individuals with PD to evaluate whether social isolation is associated with PD symptom severity and quality of life. Only individuals reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic PD were included in this analysis. The primary outcome measures were the Patient-Reported Outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) and questions from PROMIS Global related to social health. PRO-PD scores increased as social performance and social satisfaction scores diminished. Individuals who reported being lonely experienced a 55% greater symptom severity than those who were not lonely (P < 0.01). Individuals who documented having a lot of friends had 21% fewer symptoms than those with few or no friends (P < 0.01). Social isolation was associated with greater patient-reported PD severity and lower quality of life, although it is unclear whether this is the cause and/or a consequence of the disease. In essence, the Parkinson pandemic and the pandemic of social isolation have been further compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasize the need to keep PWP socially connected and prevent loneliness in this time of social distancing. Proactive use of virtual modalities for support groups and social prescribing should be explored.

AB  - Sexting (sending and receiving sexual messages) could entail risk for adolescent users. Hence, it is important that parents are able to address their children's sexuality and mediate to them the implications of sexting. The goal of the current study was to identify parental factors that lead to dysfunctional communication about sexting among 427 parents of Israeli adolescents (ages 10-18) and to determine whether parents' perceived severity of sexting and perceived susceptibility of sexting function as mediating factors. Parents completed a set of online questionnaires. Findings indicated that of the parenting styles examined, the authoritarian and permissive styles were positively associated with dysfunctional parent-child communication. The authoritative style was inversely related to dysfunctional communication and was mediated by positive attitudes regarding sex education. Additionally, authoritative parents were capable of assessing the severity and susceptibility of their children's sexting activities. It appears that the quality of the discussion initiated by authoritative parents enabled them to be aware of adolescent behaviors and phenomena and modulate their communication regarding the implied risks accordingly. Moreover, ethnic differences emerged between Arab and Jewish parents with regard to the quality of parent-child communication about sexting. Specifically, Arab parents tended more toward dysfunctional communication about sexting than did Jewish parents. Findings suggest that perceiving the implications of sexting as too risky diminishes parents' ability to conduct a high-quality discussion. In conclusion, parents need to mediate and conduct constructive discussions with their children regarding this topic.

AB  - Advertorials-advertisements camouflaged as editorial material-are a pervasive advertising strategy. Presentational features of advertorials, such as a small or omitted advertisement label and useful information presented in an editorial format prior to promoting a product, are likely to give impressions to readers that the reading material is a useful resource rather than advertising material. We examined the cognitive and persuasive effects of health product-related advertorials based on a schema-laden information processing model framework. Study 1 (n = 337) found that advertorials were less likely to trigger advertising schema, especially consumer awareness of persuasive intent. Study 2 (n = 336) found that the structure presenting useful information before advertising a related product decreased consumer skepticism. Overall, readers exhibited more positive attitudes toward advertorials than they did toward traditional advertisements due to decreased awareness of persuasive intent (Study 1) and advertorials' structure (Study 2), which, in turn, increased willingness to purchase advertised products.

AB  - Since most audit engagements identify multiple proposed audit adjustments, auditors must decide how best to present and negotiate these adjustments with their clients. Prior research indicates that auditors can negotiate adjustments individually (a sequential strategy) or can negotiate multiple adjustments within the same negotiation setting (a simultaneous strategy). This paper examines the relative effectiveness of a simultaneous versus sequential negotiation strategy in eliciting concessions from clients and engendering greater client satisfaction. Participants negotiated audit adjustments with a simulated auditor who employed one of the two negotiation strategies. We find evidence that a simultaneous strategy elicits significantly greater total concessions from client managers and also generates more positive attitudes toward the auditor. We also manipulate the magnitude of the issues negotiated and find that significantly greater concessions are offered when larger issues are presented first. These findings have important implications for auditors, as they suggest that negotiating issues simultaneously and presenting larger issues first can result in significantly improved negotiation outcomes.

AB  - Background: From the theory of compensatory Internet use, escapism through videogames may constitute a coping strategy that is sometimes helpful but, in some cases, maladaptive. To date, however, evidence supporting this view has been gathered only through the use of explicit self-reported questionnaires, which are known to be biased. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to test whether the escapism motive is related to a preference for the virtual environment.
   Method: A laboratory task that allowed the measurement of implicit attitudes, namely, the Affect Misattribution Procedure, was created with stimuli from real world and videogames. The task was administered online with a series of questionnaire and completed by 273 online gamers from the community.
   Results: Participants had more positive attitudes toward pictures depicting virtual environments than toward those depicting real environments. Furthermore, participants who frequently used videogames to escape real life and were highly engaged in video gaming had a more pronounced positive implicit attitude toward virtual environments.
   Discussion: This study contributes to a better understanding of the psychological processes underlying escapism in videogames and calls for a refinement of the escapism construct, which can be related to both problematic (i.e., potential coping strategy) and nonproblematic patterns of videogame use. Among the limitations, it should be noted that the selection of stimuli related to videogames is restricted to one genre of game, and that the participants' environment could not be controlled due to the online design.

AB  - Governments around the world have sought to promote school choice, not just in order to improve educational outcomes, but also because such choice is believed to be intrinsically valuable: parents are believed to want to choice and to feel empowered by it. This article empirically evaluates the intrinsic value of school choice, comparing the attitudes and experiences of parents in England (where expanding choice is an explicit policy goal) and Scotland (where policymakers tend to play down choice), combining an online survey with in-depth interviews. While the overwhelming majority of parents in both countries express a desire for some school choice, only a minority want choice primarily for intrinsic reasons. Rather, most believe it is necessary to avoid negative outcomes for their children. Moreover, while parents in England tend to say they have more choice than their Scottish counterparts, they are no more satisfied with the level of choice that they have. Indeed, they tend to be more cynical, fatalistic and disempowered. Based on the British experience, school choice policies have not been successful in promoting intrinsic value.

AB  - Conservation science has rapidly adopted citizen science to engage the public in knowledge generation, developing environmental policies, solving localized environmental issues, and generating public support for environmental management. For conservation benefits to be just and equitable, it is important to ensure under served groups have the opportunity to contribute to citizen science, but the barriers and drivers for their participation are poorly understood. This study explores the perspectives of young adults (18-50 years) who feed wild birds. Their cohort is underrepresented in Project FeederWatch, a large-scale North American citizen science project. Interviews with 72 young adults who do not participate in Project FeederWatch, reveal their motivations to feed birds to be primarily for the benefits it provides for themselves (such as experiencing nature, joy and relaxation) and helping the birds survive. An additional motivation, previously undetected, is to share their feeder bird experiences with others in their social networks. The interviewees hold positive attitudes towards involvement in, and outcomes of Project FeederWatch, although some concerns and barriers to participation are particular to their age group. Most notably, limits on their time and financial resources typical for their life-stage present substantial challenges to their involvement. Project design elements including simple instructions and protocol, a mobile app, and reminders will enable their participation. Social norms related to participation in citizen science are found to be weak. This exploratory work is essential for further research on young adults' involvement in knowledge generation to inform conservation science and practice.

AB  - Research links intrinsic religiousness to less prejudice toward Black people and greater prejudice toward gay people. We examined longitudinally in a sample of 865 adolescents three variables that might serve as a mediator of attitudes toward Black people yet produce a suppression effect in attitudes toward gay people: (a) humanitarian values, (b) favorable evaluations of social groups, and (c) socially desirable responding. In light of evidence that Black people on average are more religious than are White people, we also examined whether self-identifying as Black helped explain racial prejudice. Our mediation analyses provided strong evidence that humanitarian values and the tendency to view all social groups favorably accounted for the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and positive attitudes toward Black people. We found no support that socially desirable responding or identifying as Black accounted for our effects. Consistent with a suppression effect, controlling statistically for the agreeable aspects of religiousness strengthened the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and prejudice toward gay people. These findings illustrate mechanisms through which intrinsic religiousness can correspond both positively and negatively with attitudes toward marginalized groups.

AB  - Educational and technical resources are regarded as central in combating disinformation and safeguarding democracy in an era of 'fake news'. In this study, we investigated whether a professional fact-checking tool could be utilised in curricular activity to make pupils more skilled in determining the credibility of digital news and to inspire them to use digital tools to further their transliteracy and technocognition. In addition, we explored how pupils' performance and attitudes regarding digital news and tools varied across four countries (France, Romania, Spain, and Sweden). Our findings showed that a two-hour intervention had a statistically significant impact on teenagers' abilities to determine the credibility of fake images and videos. We also found that the intervention inspired pupils to use digital tools in information credibility assessments. Importantly, the intervention did not make pupils more sceptical of credible news. The impact of the intervention was greater in Romania and Spain than among pupils in Sweden and France. The greater impact in these two countries, we argue, is due to cultural context and the fact that pupils in Romania and Spain learned to focus less on 'gut feelings', increased their use of digital tools, and had a more positive attitude toward the use of the fact-checking tool than pupils in Sweden and France.

AB  - Some archaeological sites are not easily accessible by visitors due to mobility or geographical restrictions. Digital technology can make such sites virtually accessible and provide educational information at the same time. Toward this goal, we created a digital reconstruction of the archaeological site of Choirokoitia. Given that a 3D digital reconstruction can be used along with different technologies, we designed and developed an interactive application, where users can navigate and get information about the site, for two different systems: Virtual Reality (VR) systems and desktop computers. A feasibility study was conducted where we compared aspects of the two systems so as to allow the suggestion of the proper technology to utilize according to a user's aims. The results showed higher levels of presence and more positive experience by the participants who used the VR system compared to those who used the desktop version. On the other hand, greater learning gains were demonstrated in participants who used the desktop version compared to those who used the VR version. No differences were shown between the two groups regarding the participants' change of attitudes toward the archaeology of Cyprus.</p>

AB  - Public Significance Statement People view highly prototypical gay men to be more identified and involved with the gay community compared to low prototypical gay men. Additionally, perceivers treated highly prototypical gay men with more prejudice than low prototypical gay men. Perceived group identification and negative stereotype attribution were found to mediate the relationship between prototypicality and discrimination.
   The current study assessed how the extent to which a gay man resembled a prototypical gay man influenced the judgements others made about them. We hypothesized that highly prototypical gay men would be perceived to be more identified with the gay community, possess more negative stereotypes of gay men, engage in more activities within the gay community, viewed less positively by others, and receive more discrimination. Additionally, perceived group identification and negative stereotypes attributed to the gay man were expected to serially mediate the relationship between prototypicality and perceived engagement in gay activities, positive attitudes, and discrimination from others. Participants (N = 364) were randomly assigned to view stimuli depicting either a low or high prototypical gay man. High prototypical gay men were perceived to be more identified with the gay community, possess more negative stereotypes, and engage in more stereotypical immoral activities, than low prototypical gay men. Moreover, perceived group identification and negative stereotype attribution serially mediated the relationship between prototypicality and perceived engagement in gay activities, attitudes toward target, and discrimination. Implications for the Prejudice Distribution Account are discussed.

AB  - The core idea of the find-remind-and-bind theory articulated by (Algoe, 2012, Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 6, 455) is that receiving expressed gratitude facilitates positive attitudes toward the expressor such as increased prosocial behaviour. The current study tries to observe the phenomena in Japan where apologies are sometimes used when people express gratitude. In this experimental study, 671 Japanese participants received expressions of gratitude, apologies, both, or neither (control condition) in exchange for their help. The results showed that expressed gratitude had the most positive effect compared to the control, apology and both conditions; that is, expressed gratitude most strongly facilitated the message receiver's prosocial behaviour, self-disclosure, predicted outcome values, and social worth. Expressed apologies showed a limited positive effect. A structural equation model further indicated that predicted outcome values and social worth functioned in unique ways to mediate the link between expressed gratitude and prosocial behaviour as well as self-disclosure.

AB  - In this study, an experiment was used to examine the effects of employee norm-violations in the service encounter with respect to what was considered appropriate behavior (e.g., social distancing) during the 2020 corona pandemic. The participants were exposed to a grocery store employee whose behavior was manipulated (norm-violating vs. norm-confirming). Norm-violating behavior resulted in lower perceived employee warmth, lower perceived employee competence, higher disgust, and more dehumanization of the employee. These responses mediated the impact of employee behavior on customer satisfaction, so that satisfaction was attenuated when norms were violated. The mediators, however, typically also instill a hostile, avoidance-seeking mindset for those who are subject to norm violations, which is likely to result in problems when transgressors are to be persuaded to change their behaviors.

AB  - Schools are expected to contribute to preparing students for engaged citizenship. Research shows that open classroom discussions on political issues have a positive effect on political attitudes and behaviour. However, a deeper understanding of why students perceive their classrooms as open for discussion is missing. The purpose of this study is to examine how deliberative democratic theory can be used to explain such perceptions. We argue that the openness of the discussion climate is positively affected by, on the one hand, a context of good student-teacher relations characterised by fairness and respect, and, on the other hand, by the level of collective efficacy, which is the perception of responsiveness of the school towards student demands. Using multilevel analyses on the European data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009), we find that these predictors are significant at the student level and the school level. This means that both the individual experience of a student as well as the average school's score on good student-teacher relations and collective efficacy affect how students perceive the discussion climate. Our findings, based on high-quality survey data from 22 countries, are a significant contribution to clarifying the underlying mechanism leading to an open classroom climate. As such discussions have proven to be an effective way to stimulate political engagement, we conclude that a school context characterised by fairness and responsiveness, should not be overlooked by schools and policy.

AB  - As the use of mobile phones for health promotion continues to grow, more work needs to be done to determine which health communication strategies are influential on mobile devices. In two studies conducted with college women in the United States, we assessed the potential for the use of narratives, a strategy found successful in a number of communication channels, in a text-message intervention. The first study consisted of seven focus groups with young women (n = 31) about their perceptions of narrative storylines in a text-message intervention about alcohol and casual sexual encounters. In a second study, we then used an experiment (n = 137) to test the potential of narrative messages to influence transportation, counter-arguing, identification, attitudes toward the intervention type, and attitudes toward the messages. Results showed that women were interested in the possibility of receiving health messages, including narrative health messages, via text message. However, the experiment found limited differences between narrative, non-narrative, and control conditions. Transportation was greater in the narrative condition than in the control, but did not significantly differ from the non-narrative condition. Counter-arguing was also greater in the narrative condition than in the non-narrative condition. Participants who viewed the narrative messages had more positive attitudes toward the messages. Based on both studies, we found that the use of narratives in text messages may be a promising strategy, but it may be a challenge to craft effective content.

AB  - This study tests the effect of pharmaceutical Direct-to-Consumer Advertising (DTCA) for antidepressants on perceived stigma surrounding mental disorders. We randomly assigned participants into one of three experimental conditions: antidepressant DTCA with portrayals of discrimination, cognitive separation, and stereotyping (DCSS), antidepressant DTCA without these representations, or a no-exposure control. Contrary to study hypotheses, participants who viewed ads containing portrayals of DCSS were significantly less likely to want to socially distance themselves from those with mental illnesses than those assigned to the no-exposure control condition, even when controlling for demographics and personal experience with mental illness. We discuss plausible explanations for the unexpected pattern of effects and resulting implications for future research on the topic.

TI  - 'People and their homes rather than housing in the usual sense'? Locating the tenant's voice in Homes in High Flats
T2  - WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - In recent years, the social research of Pearl Jephcott has been subject to scholarly reappraisal on the grounds that it displays an early commitment to the unmediated reporting of 'the authentic voice of her participants'. This article investigates the extent to which this claim holds for Jephcott's seminal 1971 study Homes in High Flats. It suggests that, although Homes in High Flats sought to investigate 'people and their homes rather than housing in the usual sense', the study's ability to realise this aim was complicated by the social distance obtaining between researcher and researched. Based on re-analysis of the study's archived research materials, the article explores how this distance mediated the researchers' interpretation and re-presentation of the tenant's voice, deepening understanding of the epistemological premises of Jephcott's work.

AB  - This paper addresses the use of digital and information literacy with primary pupils and its relationship with the development of literacy inside and outside school. Information and Communication Technologies have created new opportunities for reading and writing texts in social spaces that have modified the way children learn. This study was a non-experimental, explanatory design. 1540 Spanish primary school pupils completed a self-report questionnaire based on the literacy, digital and information events developed by pupils. The data obtained were analyzed through a Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA) that identified two components related to the events "inside school" and "outside school". These components were later used as variables to classify the socioeconomic status and type of school, curricular preferences, as well as age, sex and year of study. The results obtained show two spaces for literacy: one was promoted inside school and was based on printed texts; the other developed outside school and favoured digital and information literacy. This work concludes with the need to establish bridges which connect digital competence inside and outside school through the creation of a third literacy space.

AB  - Purpose: Public stigma is an important barrier to the recovery of patients with psychosis. This study aimed to explore public stigma associated with a newly adopted Chinese name for psychosis si-jue-shi-tiao' in a representative Chinese population in Hong Kong, focusing on factors contributing to public stigma. Exposure to mass media and its relationship with the stigma were explored in detail.
   Methods: Random telephone survey of general population in Hong Kong was conducted. Information including basic demographics, psychosis literacy, recent news recall about psychosis and stigma, measured with the revised Link's Perceived Discrimination-Devaluation Scale (LPDDS) were obtained. Univariate analysis of LPDDS score and demographic variables, news exposure, previous contacts with people with psychosis and knowledge about psychosis were conducted. Further hierarchical regression analysis was performed.
   Results: A total of 1,016 subjects were interviewed. The sample was comparable with the whole Hong Kong population aged 18 years and above. Those of female gender, with higher educational level and better knowledge about symptoms and treatment of psychosis had higher score of LPDDS. The model significantly explained 8.3% of variance of LPDDS score (F(7, 895)=12.606, p<.0001, p<.0001). The negative news recall had trend significance in the model.
   Conclusion: The finding suggested that discrimination among the general public against people with psychosis was still common. Specific strategies will need to be established in targeting media news reporting about psychosis, knowledge disseminating and needs of specific population. Further researches should be conducted to understand the mechanisms of the stigma development in relation to these factors so that more focused and effective strategies could be developed.

AB  - Collaborations between influencers and brands have become increasingly popular in recent years. Previous research has mainly focused on influencer marketing as a commercial action designed to enhance followers' perceptions and reactions toward promoted brands, ignoring the consequences of these promotional actions on influencers' credibility and their relationships with their followers. This research sheds light on the topic by exploring how influencers' promotional actions affect their credibility, and followers' attitudes and behavioral responses toward the influencer (i.e., to continue following, imitate, and recommend them to other users). A study addressed to the followers of a popular influencer was carried out to test the research model. The results showed that perceived influencer-product congruence positively affects followers' perceptions of the credibility of, and attitude toward, influencers, and negatively affects perceptions of paid communication. Followers' perceptions that influencers have been paid to take part in promotional activities harms their credibility; however, credibility is essential for generating positive attitudes toward the influencer. Finally, both perceived credibility and attitude foster positive behavioral responses toward the influencer; influencers must enhance these factors to retain their influencing capacity. This research provides managerial implications for influencers and brands that can help enhance followers' experiences when exposed to promotions on social media.

AB  - Objectively, the purpose of this study aims to re-confirm and analyze the relationship between variables through direct relationships and mediation (i.e., career optimism (CO), organizational fairness (OF), organizational entrepreneurship commitment (OEC) on employee engagement). This study also addresses whether career optimism provides a strong-impact if it mediates other antecedent variables on employee engagement. Therefore, to test and prove this, we made observations on 200 samples comprising lecturers in Indonesia. The data collection method uses a survey both offline and online. Through the PLS-SEM approach, the statistical testing demonstration states that all hypotheses, either through direct relationship or mediation, are proven to have a positive and significant effect. Career optimism has also proven to be a substantial and positive contribution to testing employee engagement as a mediating variable. The results of seven hypothesis testing in our study confirm that the broaden-built theory and organizational theory are closely related. Therefore, this study positively contributes to human resource management's science to balance the psychological and organizational aspects. In this study, we also add that consistency and a positive attitude in a career trigger a person's career optimization in a better and more positive direction, especially for career-path and employee engagement.

AB  - In a democratic society, school has the goal to foster democratic attitudes in students. Besides explicit attempts to do so, justice experiences in school may be crucial to develop positive attitudes towards democracy. Therefore, we studied the relationship between different dimensions of justice experiences in school and democratic attitudes. We further examined a potential mechanism underlying this relationship, namely general trust, and hypothesized that the relationship between justice experiences in school and democratic attitudes can be understood on the basis of social exchange theory. A total of 210 participants who had visited a public school gave information about their justice experiences in school, general trust, and democratic attitudes. First, it was shown that overall experiences of distributive and interactional justice predict democratic attitudes, more specifically the approval of civic and human rights and the approval of the democratic institutions. Second, we found that the relationships between overall distributive and interactional justice and the approval of civic and human rights, the approval of the democratic institutions, and the approval of democracy-supporting behaviors are each mediated by general trust which can be interpreted as a social exchange process. This study therefore highlights the role of general justice-related school experiences for the development of democratic attitudes.

AB  - This research aims at providing a new model of consumers' personal space to limit the spread of contagious disease while shopping in person. To this end, it adopts an agents-based simulation approach to model consumers' movements in the store during COVID-19 pandemic. Findings show the extent to which consumers' contacts with others increase the risk of contagion, due to the occurrence of social gatherings in certain areas. Specifically, there is a linear correlation between the number of consumers in the store and the number of consumers susceptible to contract the disease. Thus, the personal space from a psychological perception becomes an individual and compulsory boundary to protect consumers from contagious disease. Finally, our results extend the concept of social distance and personal space while shopping, and support retailers to provide safer shopping experiences.

AB  - Research has shown that accounting for moral sentiment in natural language can yield insight into a variety of on- and off-line phenomena such as message diffusion, protest dynamics, and social distancing. However, measuring moral sentiment in natural language is challenging, and the difficulty of this task is exacerbated by the limited availability of annotated data. To address this issue, we introduce the Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus, a collection of 35,108 tweets that have been curated from seven distinct domains of discourse and hand annotated by at least three trained annotators for 10 categories of moral sentiment. To facilitate investigations of annotator response dynamics, we also provide psychological and demographic metadata for each annotator. Finally, we report moral sentiment classification baselines for this corpus using a range of popular methodologies.

AB  - The current worldwide COVID19 pandemic has required the rapid and drastic adoption of social distancing and protective measures as the leading method for reducing the spread of the disease and death. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the adoption of such measures in a large sample of the Brazilian population. We relied on recreancy theory, which argues that confidence in the ability of social institutions and perceived vulnerability to the disease are central factors predicting the adoption of these behaviors. Our results, drawn from 7554 respondents, indicate that self-confidence in the ability to carry out these behaviors, confidence in the ability of social institutions such as the government, hospitals, health workers and the media to cope with the pandemic crisis, and risk perceptions are associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors. Our results expand the recreancy theory and show that beyond the main effects, the effect of perceived vulnerability depends on the values of self-confidence and confidence in social institutions. The theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - How do religious affiliation and beliefs shape vaccine attitudes and behaviors? This study examined the associations of attitudes and behaviors relevant to the flu, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), and human-papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines with religious affiliations, as well as philosophical, spiritual, and moral beliefs. Respondents were 3005 adults from a probability-based, four-wave panel survey in the United States. Longitudinal structural equation modeling examined how religious affiliations and philosophical/moral beliefs shaped attitudes toward vaccines and actual vaccination. Stronger philosophical beliefs predicted more negative attitudes toward each vaccine and stronger moral beliefs more negative attitudes toward the HPV vaccine. Negative vaccine attitudes then predicted weaker intentions to encourage others to vaccinate and lower probability of receiving a vaccine.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has made videoconferencing tools an essential part of our lives as these tools are what allowed us to keep in touch in a time of social distancing. Having said that, however, many people have found virtual interactions to be surprisingly exhausting. This has given rise to the concept of Zoom fatigue. The purpose of this article is to explore the dynamics that give rise to this peculiar phenomenon. The article first discusses the concept of Zoom fatigue and critiques the brain-centrism of current explanations. It then proposes a more embodied approach to interaction, discusses the mediating role of technology in videoconferencing, and proceeds to presents a list of five videoconferencing dynamics that may induce Zoom fatigue: Awkward turn-taking, inhibited spontaneity, restricted motility, lack of eye contact and increased self-awareness. Finally, it is argued that these dynamics should make us temper our collective expectations about the hybrid future.

AB  - Sharks are crucial to the marine ecosystem, but they are critically declining. Their bad public image explains, to some extent, the lesser concern for their conservation compared to other marine species. Extending previous research which has mainly focused on the study of attitudes towards sharks, we propose a two studies sequence, first by exploring the shark's social representation, followed by an exploration of some stereotypical traits that may affect attitudes toward shark conservation. Study 1 specifically exploreed the social representation of sharks in a sample of zoo goers (N = 979). Main results showed that the representation was ambivalent and participants considered sharks as human predators. Surprisingly, findings showed that sharks were also seen as highly agentic and little communal animals. Consequently, Study 2 (N = 60) was designed to more thoroughly explore this gendered view as well as its implications in the attitudes and behavioral intention towards shark conservation. Results showed that, although sharks were again perceived as highly agentic, it was the perception of the sharks' communality that was associated with more positive attitudes towards their conservation and a higher tendency to choose a shark conservation trust as first choice. Implications of studies 1 and 2 results for sharks' conservation communication strategies and policies are discussed.

AB  - It is well established that emphasizing a biogenetic etiology of mental health problems in anti-stigma interventions inadvertently increases potentially stigmatizing attitudes. The "mixed-blessings" model suggests that biogenetic explanations and greater stigma are linked by essentialism. The present study tests this hypothesis experimentally. In this online experiment, 367 subjects read either a biogenetic or a psychosocial explanation for the etiology of schizophrenia, followed by a vignette describing an individual who has schizophrenia. Subsequently, we measured (a) causal beliefs on the etiology of schizophrenia (as a manipulation check), (b) the degree of essentialist beliefs (mediator), (c) the extent to which subjects subscribed to assumptions of dangerousness, (d) prognostic pessimism, and (e) desire for social distance. Subjects reported a stronger agreement with the etiology they had been presented. Against our expectations, this did not result in higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes in the biogenetic vignette group. Correspondingly, mediation through essentialism could not be tested. In the psychosocial vignette group, biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with a stronger desire for social distance. Essentialist thinking fully mediated this effect. The evidence we found for the assumptions of the mixed-blessings extended to the psychosocial vignette group only. We explain this by the subjects' different readiness to subscribe to biogenetic and psychosocial causal beliefs. We argue that the same levels of essentialism between the experimental groups contributed to the equal levels of stigmatizing attitudes. This underlines the fundamental importance of essentialism in stigma, going beyond a role in the psychological effects of biogenetic causal models.

AB  - Sexting (sending, receiving, and forwarding nude, semi-nude, or sexually explicit content) entails risks for adolescents; therefore, it is important for parents to be able to communicate with their children about its implications. The goal of the present study was to identify parental characteristics that lead to dysfunctional communication (lower quality of communication) about sexting, on a sample of 427 parents (336 mothers and 91 fathers) of Israeli adolescents aged 10-18 years and to determine whether parents' perceived severity of sexting and the degree to which they perceive their adolescent to be susceptible to sexting function as mediating factors. Parents completed a set of questionnaires online. Findings indicated that authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were positively associated with dysfunctional parent-child communication about sexting. Authoritative style was inversely related to dysfunctional communication and was mediated by positive attitudes toward sex education. Additionally, authoritative parents were capable of assessing the severity of their children's sexting activities, and the degree to which their children were susceptible to engage in sexting. The quality of the discussion initiated by authoritative parents appears to have enabled them to be aware of adolescent behaviors and to adjust their communication about the inherent risks. Findings suggest that the perception of sexting as too risky diminishes parents' ability to conduct a high-quality discussion about it. In conclusion, research findings emphasize parents' role in mediation of the online experiences of their children and conducting a constructive discussions with them about sexting.

AB  - In 2004, the second International Association of Language and Social Psychology Task Force focused on relationships involving language and emerging communication technology, culminating in a Special Issue of the Journal of Language and Social Psychology (Vol. 23, No. 4). The present article reviews the topics and conclusions of that work and traces the continuation of study on those topics as they have evolved and influenced language and social psychology research to the present. Communication technology research offers views on the central question of how individuals adapt language to communicative action in the presence or absence of various nonverbal cue systems. This question is reflected in topics such as the expression of affect and immediacy online, the virtual presentation of self and gender, the management of online conversations, adaptation via visual grounding in electronic collaboration, and the employment of online interaction technology to reduce intergroup prejudice. As communication systems have evolved, interfaces offer new cues and representations of users, which continue to propel inquiry into these central questions about language and its usage within various technological contexts.

AB  - The present study examined the mediating role of pleasure in parenting in the link between fathers' attachment representations and paternal sensitivity among 138 father-infant dyads from a rural part of the southeastern United States. First-time fathers' attachment representations were assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) prenatally. Pleasure in parenting-a multidimensional construct assessing positive attitudes and beliefs toward the parenting role-was coded from fathers' interviews at 3 months. Paternal sensitivity was coded from father-infant play interactions at 12 months. Results indicated that fathers with secure-autonomous adult attachment representations showed more pleasure in parenting. In turn, fathers who took more pleasure in parenting also interacted more sensitively during father-infant interactions. Moreover, although the direct association between fathers' attachment representations and sensitivity was nonsignificant, the indirect effect from secure-autonomous representations to sensitivity via pleasure in parenting was significant. Findings suggest that first-time fathers' parenting attitudes may play a role in transmitting representations of early caregiving experiences to sensitive interactions with their own infants.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic brought along with it concerns about anxiety, racial bias, and pushback against public health recommendations, all of which are intensified by the news and social media. This study investigated the effects of constructive journalism in the context of this crisis, by randomly assigning 492 subjects to view simulated social media news updates with different headlines and images. The results showed positive and constructive headlines led to less anger and anxiety than negative headlines. The sanitization of graphic images decreased anger, anxiety, COVID-19 risk perceptions, and anti-Chinese sentiment-a relationship that was mediated by anger and anxiety. These findings suggest constructive journalism can be useful in times of crisis, and that its visual aspect warrants more scholarly attention. Further, these results shed new light on the effects of news exposure via social media in times of crisis, and how this impact depends on specific attributes of the headlines and images of the content being shared. The findings are discussed in relation to the theory of affective intelligence and recent concerns about how news and social media influence the public in times of crisis.

AB  - Aims: Demography of patients and complexity in the management of multimorbid conditions has made collaborative practice a necessity for the future, also in Switzerland. Since 2012, the University of Applied Sciences (UAS) and its Healthcare School as well as the University of Geneva (UG) with its Medical Faculty have joined forces to implement a training program in collaborative practice, using simulation as one of the main learning/teaching process.
   Methods: The actual program consists of three sequential modules and totalizes 300 h of teaching and learning for approximately 1400-1500 students from six tracks (nutritionists, physiotherapists, midwives, nurses, technologists in medical radiology, physicians); in 2019 another hundred pharmacists will also be included. The main issues addressed by the modules are
   Module 1: the Swiss healthcare system and collaborative tools.
   Module 2: roles and responsibilities of the different health professionals, basic tools acquisition in team working (situation monitoring, mutual support, communication).
   Module 3: the axis of quality and safety of care through different contexts and cases.
   Conclusions: A very first evaluation of the teaching and learning and particularly on the aspects of acquisition of collaborative tools shows positive attitudes of students towards the implementation of this new training program. Furthermore, a pre-post questionnaire on teamwork aspects reveals significant modifications.

AB  - Connectivity is intrinsic to all aspects of our life today, be it political, economic, technological, scientific, or personal. Higher education is also transcending the previous paradigm of technology enabled content delivery and e-learning, with a new emphasis on connectivity, enabling participants to exchange knowledge and collaborate to meet educational goals. In this study, a social media technology supported website-digiMe-was developed and evaluated at the School of Medicine of one Australian university. Connectivity to other medical learners and health professionals is intrinsic to digiMe. This paper reports the functionalities of this website, results of a post-intervention evaluative survey, and statistics of website usage generated from Google Analytics. The results revealed more active adoptions and a more positive attitude towards digiMe from Year 4 students compared to Year 5 students. The participants showed a desire for access to a recommended collection of apps, such as those offered through digiMe. However, many participants did not use digiMe beyond initial introduction to it. digiMe demonstrated its potential in raising awareness of web and mobile apps useful for enhancing connectivity, although it needs to be introduced to students in earlier years of their medical education to achieve a higher impact on their learning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the perceptions of pregnant women about COVID-19 and the prevalence of common mental disorders during the implemented social distancing period.
   METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional study using digital media, of pregnant women exposed to social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in Fortaleza, Ceara, Northeastern Brazil. Common mental disorders were estimated using the modified Self-Report Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) scale, and the feelings towards COVID-19 were assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 scale through telephone calls made in May 2020. COX multivariate regression models were used to verify the associations.
   RESULTS: Of the 1,041 pregnant women, 45.7% (95%CI: 42.7-48.8) had common mental disorders (CMD). All items of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale showed a significant association with the prevalence of CMD (p < 0.001). A CMD risk gradient was observed, going from a prevalence ratio of 1.52 (95%CI: 1.13-2.04) in pregnant women with two positive items to 2.70 (95%CI: 2.08-3.51) for those with four positive items. Early gestational age and the lack of prenatal care were also associated with CMD.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of common mental disorders in pregnant women was high during the period of social distancing and was aggravated by negative feelings towards COVID-19.

AB  - Learner-Generated Digital Media (LGDM) has become prevalent in higher education. Frameworks have been developed for video-making in the classroom that consider technical requirements, pedagogies, and the combination of both. However, missing is a practical model to guide academics and students on the implementation of LGDM assignments. This research aims to test a model to design, implement, and evaluate LGDM as an assessment tool. The model was built based on research gaps and it considers the following elements: (1) pedagogy, (2) student training, (3) hosting of videos, (4) marking schemes, (5) group contribution, (6) feedback, (7) reflection, and (8) evaluation. For this purpose, five science subjects (N = 270) were used to test the model as a guide to implementing LGDM assignments. Data was gathered using a validated 33-step questionnaire instrument. Additionally, group contributions were received using the SPARKPlus peer review application, and marks attained were gathered. Methodological triangulation of the datasets suggested that students have a positive attitude toward LGDM for science learning. Students enjoyed the group work and creativity, and they identified digital media support as a critical component of their learning experience. Preliminary data support using the LGDM framework to design digital media assignments for science education.

AB  - Background: People's adherence to control measures is imperative in the fight against COVID-19. The present study was done to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among residents of Jharkhand and to assist the government in deciding further course of action during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   Methods: This study was an online cross-sectional survey. The link to the questionnaire was displayed on the official website of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi, National Health Mission, Jharkhand, official website of all districts under Jharkhand state administration, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme and Information & Public Relations department. Participation of residents in the survey was extensively propagated using mass media mainly local television networks, radio channels and newspapers.
   Results: A total of 4683 responses were received from all districts of Jharkhand. The majority of the participants were young adults (47.5%) and the number of male participants was more than the females (81.4%). The mean correct knowledge score for participants of this study was 10.73+2.2 (maximum attainable score was 14) while the mean practice score for the participants was 4.5+0.69 (maximum attainable score was 5). The knowledge score of the participants was significantly associated with their age, education status and economic class (p<0.0001). The participants largely held an optimistic attitude and healthy practices towards COVID-19.
   Conclusion: Participants had a positive attitude but were also logically worried and uncertain about the near future. Adequate knowledge of participants was visible in their practices. There was however a gap across age groups, gender, literacy and income levels which should be addressed in future campaigns.

AB  - Uptake of telepractice has drastically increased among speech-language therapists (SLTs) following the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the sudden uptake of telepractice in India among SLTs. An online survey consisting of 20 questions was carried out between 4 and 17 May 2020 using Google form. The participants comprised of SLTs who indicated that they had shifted their services to telepractice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive analysis was used to summarize the findings. Eighty-four SLTs participated in the study, working across different work settings and from 21 to 53 years of age. Forty-nine percent of SLTs had conducted more than 11 telepractice sessions, 89% conducted only individual sessions. Further, 85% had a mostly paediatric caseload with 75% working with child language disorders. They learnt about telepractice in a range of ways including from colleagues (19%), social media and the internet (18%), formal education (24%), reading (8%) and experience (8%). Overall, SLTs exhibited a positive attitude towards the use of telepractice. The most common platform used was WhatsApp video calling feature (82%), although more than one platform was being used. The greatest challenges faced were dealing with network issues (38%) and lack of cooperation from the child during sessions (27%). The findings highlight an acceptance and uptake towards telepractice. This might pave the path for serious consideration for telepractice in the field of speech-language therapy in India in the future.

AB  - Change and innovation are increasingly critical to organizational survival, as well as sustained success. While it is common to discuss mistakes as critical components of the learning process, how can organizations balance the detrimental costs of workplace mistakes with the beneficial outcomes of increased risk-taking and innovation? This cross-regional comparative research investigates the relationship between employee perceptions of leadership style, mindset (fixed versus growth), and orientation to error learning in a sample of 554 employees recruited in Europe, China, and the US. We examine the relationship between a leader's perceived style - transformational, transactional, laissez-faire, and aversive leadership - follower mindset, and attitudes toward error learning. Our results suggest that transformational leadership fosters significantly more positive attitudes toward employee error learning, while laissez-faire and aversive leadership styles actively inhibit employee error learning. Somewhat surprisingly, in two of the three samples, laissez-faire leadership showed the strongest and most negative effect on error learning orientation, although followers with fixed mindsets reported being less likely to learn from errors regardless of leadership style. Our findings examine the relationship between leadership style and employee error learning and highlight that inattentive leaders may be particularly destructive in work settings that seek to develop creativity and innovation as part of the organizational change process.

AB  - The aims of the present research were to evaluate the preliminary psychometric properties of a new measure for evaluating teachers' attitudes towards the representation of homosexuality in film and television, and to explore the association between moral disengagement and teachers' negative attitudes towards homosexual representations. Participants were 241 Italian primary and secondary school teachers. The new self-report measure comprises 14 items or 8 items (brief version) scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Teachers completed three instruments: the new measure created to capture participants' social and emotional evaluations of homosexuality in film and television, the latent and manifest prejudice scale, and the Italian moral disengagement scale. Exploratory factor analysis of the new measure suggested a single factor. The results demonstrated that the measure had satisfactory construct and convergent validity and reliability. Finally, we identified how teachers' dehumanization of victims and euphemistic labelling were positively associated with their negative attitudes towards representations of homosexuality.

AB  - The social distancing and lockdown measures enacted to address the COVID-19 pandemic entailed an unprecedented shift to digitally-mediated communication. The move to remote learning at schools was one of such important changes. Drawing on privacy and STS literature, we investigate the role of different privacy cultures during the initial moment of turbulence, when schools had to quickly adapt to remote teaching. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with teachers in Israel and Germany. Our interviews carved out three distinct phases: A moment of turbulence, a period of negotiation and a phase of temporary closure, leading to the dominance of Zoom and Google Classroom in Israel, and government-mandated open-source tools for German teachers. These different pathways are shaped by considerations of vertical privacy among German teachers, and the absence of such considerations on the part of Israeli teachers.

AB  - This study differentiates the roles of telepresence and transportation, the two widely cited processes underpinning an immersive media viewing experience, in the context of virtual marketing. In Study 1, college students viewed a real estate property tour in virtual reality (VR; high immersion) or as a 360 degrees video (low immersion) in a research lab. The tour was accompanied by a voiceover presenting descriptive information about the apartment (descriptive evidence) or a narrative-based introduction (narrative evidence). We found the enhanced telepresence under the VR viewing condition negatively impacted users' memory of the property; this effect was particularly pronounced with the narrative voiceover. Study 2 replicated key findings from Study 1 in an online experiment with a larger and more diverse sample. We also found that narrative-induced transportation strengthened attitudinal outcomes, and enhanced telepresence boosted this effect. Our studies disentangle the impacts of VR-induced telepresence on cognitive processing from the effects of narrative-induced transportation on persuasive outcomes. The highly immersive media experience combined with deep transportation into the narrative can strengthen viewers' positive attitude towards the overall experience but hinder their ability to remember the details of the content. The findings point to a medium-message matching strategy to achieve marketing goals.

AB  - Prior studies suggest that the growth in online retail is attributed to the effective implementation of media-rich and interactive services and functionalities that help overcome the para-social distance between customers and online retail stores. However, few studies have offered empirical evidence that demonstrates the specific impacts these interactive services and functionalities have on the financial performance of online retailers. Using data on the operations and financial performance of the top 500 online retailers in the U.S., this study investigates the impact that website features and functionalities have on sales performance and other intermediate performance measures. Our findings suggest that website features and functionalities have a significant direct impact on sales as well as an indirect impact through intermediate performance measures. Furthermore, our model identifies the specific performance measures that each website feature targets to improve.

AB  - Of the social media tools available to brand managers, consumer-generated advertising (CGA) has attractive features combining consumer-generated content, social media advertising, and online interactive marketing campaigns. However, only a small number of customers actively participate in co-creation of CGA. Based on social presence theory and service-dominant logic conceptualization, we examined CGA observers, knowledgeable and attentive viewers of value co-creation processes who do not directly participate in value co-creation. In two studies, we examined consumer responses to company-driven CGA and found no significant differences between CGA creators, or direct participants, and CGA observers, or indirect participants in the process of involvement with CGA, its antecedents, and its outcomes. Study 1 demonstrated that CGA observers developed positive attitudes toward co-created CGA that influenced their brand loyalty and willingness to participate in the process. Study 2 revealed that both creators' and observers' involvement with CGA led to stronger perceptions of competitive advantage, which positively affected brand loyalty and trust. Perceptions of competitive advantage also had a mediation effect.

AB  - Both right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and the dominance facet of social dominance orientation (SDO-D) are related to positive attitudes towards torture in a war context We investigated whether dehumanization of Muslims and identification with Swedes as an in-group served as mediators of these relationships. Employing a student and a military sample we found that the relationship between RWA, SDO-D and torture was completely mediated by dehumanization. In-group identification added to the model by partially mediating RWA and the equalization facet of social dominance orientation (SDO-E). The relationship between SDO-D and torture was weaker in the military sample, which also scored higher than the student sample on all variables. It is argued that the mediating effect of dehumanization on RWA and SDO-D might be understood as authoritarians and social dominators feeling lower empathy towards dehumanized out-groups and that research on the relationship between RWA, SDO and abuse in a war context should preferably be conducted on relevant groups (such as soldiers).

AB  - IMPORTANCE An increased risk for psychosis is observed in people with hearing impairment. According to the social defeat hypothesis, the long-term experience of exclusion leads to enhanced baseline activity and/or sensitization of the dopamine system and puts the individual at increased risk for psychosis.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate whether young adults with severe hearing impairment (SHI) experience more feelings of social defeat, show greater dopamine release in response to dexamphetamine, and report a stronger subjective reaction to this substance than normal-hearing young adults and to examine whether dopamine release is associated with both self-reported social exclusion and dexamphetamine-induced psychotic experiences.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A sample of 19 participants with SHI and 19 smoking-, age-, and sex-matched healthy controls underwent single-photon emission computed tomography with iodine 123-labeled iodobenzamide as a radiotracer before and after an amphetamine challenge at an academic hospital.
   EXPOSURES Dexamphetamine sulfate (0.3mg/kg) administered intravenously.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Baseline D-2/3 receptor binding and endogenous dopamine release.
   RESULTS The participants with SHI reported experiencing more feelings of social defeat (U = 109, z = -2.09, P = .04) and loneliness (U = 87.5, z = -2.72, P = <.001) than did healthy controls, but they did not differ from healthy controls with regard to baseline psychotic symptoms (U = 156.5, z = -0.70, P = .48). There were no significant group differences in baseline D-2/3 receptor binding. However, repeated-measures multivariate analysis of covariance with age (in months) and tobacco smoking (in pack-years) as covariates showed that there was a greater amphetamine-induced striatal dopamine release among the participants with SHI than among the healthy controls (F-1,F-34 = 4.55, P = .04). After amphetamine administration, the participants with SHI reported more changes in affect than the healthy controls, but not a greater increase in psychotic symptoms. Likewise, reports of social exclusion and an increase in psychotic symptoms were not associated with dopamine release.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our study presents preliminary evidence of dopamine sensitization in a socially excluded group of people with hearing impairment. If replicated by future studies in other excluded groups, this finding may have major implications for our understanding of the underlying mechanism and for prevention of psychotic disorders.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive global health crisis. The rapid transmission rate of the virus, as well as the lack of effective medications and vaccines, has posed serious challenges to controlling the spread of the disease. Dealing with this public health crisis has required major changes in people's behavior, including the adoption of social distancing measures such as avoiding meeting with family members and friends, crowded places, and public transportation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the adoption of these behaviors in China and Israel. We relied on the 3Cs model that has been used to predict the adoption of a specific preventive behavior (vaccinations) with the goal of testing its applicability to other preventive behaviors such as in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The model indicates that confidence in social institutions, complacency (fear of and assessments about the risk of becoming ill) and constraints (levels of self-efficacy and confidence in being able to engage in the behaviors) are predictors of adopting preventive behaviors. Data were collected in China and Israel through an online survey of the population (n = 1406). We used latent variables and structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses derived from the 3Cs model. The findings indicate that there are some differences in the types of preventive behaviors adopted in the two countries. In Israel, higher levels of confidence predicted the adoption of avoidant behaviors and more constraints predicted engaging in fewer avoidant behaviors. In China, more constraints also contributed to the adoption of fewer avoidant behaviors, but people's level of confidence fully mediated this result. The multi-group analysis indicated that the conceptualized model fits the Chinese and Israeli data reasonably well. The findings suggest that the 3Cs model can be generalized from getting vaccinated to adopting avoidant behaviors and that the model can be used across cultures and countries.

AB  - Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) that originated in China in December 2019 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11th March, 2020. It has resulted in extensive lockdown measures in India and in the state of West Bengal. Both Central and State Governments have made considerable efforts to increase awareness about the pandemic among the general public.
   Aim: This study was conducted to assess the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) among the general public of West Bengal about the pandemic as no such data is available till date.
   Materials and Methods: The retrospective survey was undertaken among the general public of the state of West Bengal, India, by means of social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) through a validated e-questionnaire containing 10 questions during 18th April, 2020 to 3rd May, 2020. Data was captured on Google Forms, which were analysed using appropriate tools.
   Results: A total of 355 responses were obtained. A 97% of responders were completely aware of the pandemic with 92% practising preventive measures, such as social distancing, washing hands, and wearing a mask. Majority of the participants were young (18-30 years of age) with 51% being males. A 99% of the responders were literate and 86% were from urban dwelling. Total 61% of the participants stated that they have learnt something new after participating in this survey.
   Conclusion: KAP about COVID- 19 pandemic was found to be high in the general population of West Bengal. Involvement of various social media platforms is required for generating mass awareness about COVID-19 in rural West Bengal. Continuous communication and survey by the Government is necessary to spread public awareness as information about COVID-19 is constantly evolving.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by the virus now called as SARS-CoV-2 and first identified in Wuhan, China, has spread to all regions of the world. At the time of this write-up, over 5.1 million people had been infected by the virus globally. The World Health Organization estimates that in Africa over 5 million people would need hospital admission during the course of the pandemic. Interventions to prevent the disease include social distancing and nationwide lockdowns, which, whilst necessary, have had negative effects not only on the economic status of many but also on primary care and especially the management of chronic illnesses. There are opportunities for primary care physicians to continue learning, lend humanitarian aid and provide the needed care in this context. Social media has promising applications in this rapidly changing context.

AB  - The media plays an important role in how the American public understands controversial social and political issues, such as immigration. The purpose of this article is to examine how key features of the media, such as location (Arizona vs. National) and political ideology (Liberal vs. Conservative), affect the framing of arguments supporting and opposing the anti-immigration bill (Arizona SB 1070). A content analysis was conducted using 3 weeks of newspaper articles from two Arizona newspapers (one Conservative, one Liberal) and five national newspapers (three Conservative, two Liberal). Analyses revealed that both location and political ideology influenced the framing. Specifically, the national newspapers were more likely than Arizona newspapers to frame arguments supporting the bill in terms of threats (e.g., threats to economic and public safety) and to frame arguments against the bill in terms of civil rights issues (e.g., racial profiling). In terms of political ideology, Conservative newspapers were more likely than Liberal newspapers to frame the bill in terms of economic and public safety threats, but did not differ in mentions of civil rights issues. The implications for attitudes toward immigrants and legal ethnic minorities and for defining the boundaries of the American national identity are discussed.

AB  - Background and aims Childhood vaccinations are an important component of primary prevention. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinics in Israel provide routine vaccinations without charge. Several vaccine-preventable-diseases outbreaks (measles, mumps) emerged in Jerusalem in the past decade. We aimed to study attitudes and knowledge on vaccinations among mothers, in communities with low immunization coverage. Methods A qualitative study including focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Results Low immunization coverage was defined below the district's mean (age 2 years, 2013) for measles-mumps-rubella-varicella 1st dose (MMR1\MMRV1) and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis 4th dose (DTaP4), 96 and 89%, respectively. Five communities were included, all were Jewish ultra-orthodox. The mothers' (n = 87) median age was 30 years and median number of children 4. Most mothers (94%) rated vaccinations as the main activity in the MCH clinics with overall positive attitudes. Knowledge about vaccines and vaccination schedule was inadequate. Of vaccines scheduled at ages 0-2 years (n = 13), the mean number mentioned was 3.9 +/- 2.8 (median 4, range 0-9). Vaccines mentioned more often were outbreak-related (measles, mumps, polio) and HBV (given to newborns). Concerns about vaccines were obvious, trust issues and religious beliefs were not. Vaccination delay was very common and timeliness was considered insignificant. Practical difficulties in adhering to the recommended schedule prevailed. The vaccinations visits were associated with pain and stress. Overall, there was a sense of self-responsibility accompanied by inability to influence others. Conclusion Investigating maternal knowledge and attitudes on childhood vaccinations provides insights that may assist in planning tailored intervention programs aimed to increase both vaccination coverage and timeliness.

AB  - Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a life-saving treatment, but donor numbers are lacking in Turkey and elsewhere. Increased awareness of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation among university students might help expand donation. We evaluated the effect of a brief targeted educational intervention on knowledge and attitudes about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and donation among first-year university students in Turkey.
   Materials and Methods: There were 301 first-year university students (median age, 18 y) who volunteered: 163 medical students (54%) and 138 law students (46%). Before and after a brief lecture about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, students answered a 5-item yes-or-no questionnaire regarding (1) knowledge about health benefits of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; (2) knowledge about stem cell banking and donation in Turkey; (3) knowledge about the transplantation procedure; (4) prior experience and/or willingness to donate blood; and (5) willingness to donate stem cells. Reasons for motivation to donate blood and/or stem cells were categorized. Results before and after the lecture were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: The response rate was 100%. Significantly greater proportions of students had knowledge about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and willingness to donate blood and stem cells after the lecture. There were no differences between medical and law students before the lecture. After the lecture, a significantly greater proportion of medical students indicated knowledge about health benefits of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, stem cell banking and donation in Turkey, and the transplantation procedure.
   Conclusions: Brief education about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for university students can increase knowledge and awareness about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and cause more positive attitudes about stem cell donation.

AB  - In this work, we describe an educational approach based on augmented reality (AR) and mobile technology that has been developed with the aim to engage students in a learning procedure regarding the electric forces as well as Coulomb's Law. Initially, we present the AR learning environment and we explain its design principles with respect to the educational goals we aim to accomplish. The idea behind the present approach has been to present students with a novel learning environment that aligns well with their familiarization with mobile technology and the pleasure they take in making use of this technology, in order to stimulate their intrinsic motivation and learning performance. In addition, we demonstrate the early results of a classroom study performed in order to estimate students' reaction to the AR approach and get an indication of their motivation levels and ease of use, with respect to the AR tool. Based on the study results, we conclude that students have demonstrated positive attitudes toward the AR learning approach and we claim that mobile AR may be incorporated for educational purposes in physics curricula.

AB  - Background: Although annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for healthcare personnel (HCPs), their vaccination uptake has been suboptimal. This study aimed to examine the psychosocial determinants of influenza vaccination among HCPs in Hong Kong using a longitudinal study design based on behavioral change theories.
   Methods: Participants were invited to complete a baseline survey before the 2017/18 influenza vaccination campaign to measure their baseline perceptions and vaccination intention, and followed up for 9 months to measure actual vaccination uptake. The survey used a theoretical framework combining the Health Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behaviour with extended psychosocial factors for predicting HCPs' vaccination uptake. Structural equation modelling was used to test the theoretical model and estimate path coefficients (p) to infer associations of psychosocial factors with HCPs' influenza vaccination uptake.
   Results: Of the 845 participants who completed follow-up, 43.0% indicated intending to take vaccination and 30.8% reported actual receipt of the vaccination. The structural equation modeling analysis showed that positive attitude towards influenza vaccination (beta= 0.69), greater perceived susceptibility to influenza virus infection (beta = 0.34), greater anticipated regret for not vaccinating (beta = 0.31), and more cues to action (beta= 0.29) were significantly associated with higher vaccination intention which directly predicted greater vaccination uptake (beta = 0.82). Norms were found to have an indirect association with vaccination intention through the mediation of attitude towards influenza vaccination (beta = 0.63). Self-efficacy was significantly associated with actual receipt of influenza vaccination (beta = 0.13) but not vaccination intention. The structural equation model explained 84.7% and 69.6% of the variance, respectively, in HCPs' intention to receive and actual receipt of influenza vaccination.
   Conclusions: Attitude towards influenza vaccination was the strongest predictor of HCPs' intention and actual receipt of influenza vaccination. Social norm approach may be an intervention strategy to shape HCPs' attitude towards influenza vaccination and their subsequent decision-making for influenza vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a unique data set of historic newspaper coverage of 20 capital cases in California in which defendants filed change of venue motions, we conducted a detailed content analysis of 1,831 newspaper articles to examine the nature and extent of the pretrial publicity in each case. We used a detailed coding scheme with 27 content categories to describe the types of information conveyed; analyze the relative amounts of negative, positive, and neutral content in the publicity; and determine whether the publicity included the kind of information that has been shown to bias prospective jurors. The publicity was overwhelmingly negative and we identified a number of highly prejudicial aspects, including heav y reliance on law enforcement and prosecution sources, numerous instances of sensationalized descriptions of the crime and criminal defendant, and the inclusion of legally excludable material. Despite the potentially biasing effects of the publicity analyzed, venue was rarely changed. Moreover, the trial courts' decisions appeared largely unrelated to the substantial amount and prejudicial content of the pretrial publicity. Implications for a capital defendant's light to an impartial jury, due process protections, and the adequacy and availability of effective legal remedies are discussed.

AB  - Numerous empirical investigations demonstrate that exposure to the stereotypic and oftentimes threatening portrayals of race/ethnicity in the media predict a wide range of unfavorable intergroup outcomes. The current study extends this work by experimentally examining the role of emotions in this process. Specifically, a 2 (Immigration Threat: Present/Absent) x 2 (Ingroup Emotion Endorsement: Present/Absent) + 1 (Control Group) experimental design tests the influence of exposure to immigration news stories on group-level emotions and intergroup behaviors. Findings indicate that exposure to threatening immigration news coverage indirectly influences intergroup outcomes through group-level emotions. Exposure to immigration news indirectly produces active and passive harming behaviors through feelings of contempt. These results provide an important first step in understanding a broader array of media-related intergroup processes and effects.

AB  - Objective: The National Human Genome Research Institute has emphasised community engagement and public dialogue in the U.S. on issues related to genetics. This study examines how online discussions among the U.S. public directly or indirectly influence psychosocial constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior, including intention to take part in genetic research.Design: After completing the baseline questionnaire, participants (n=3754) were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: the discussion group, the pre-/post-only group and the End-of-Project group. The discussion group (n=1824) was invited and participated in up to three online discussions, which were held from November 2008 to May 2009.Main outcome measures: Behavioural intention, beliefs, attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control variables were assessed.Results: The most interesting finding was that those participating in online discussions had fewer negative beliefs about volunteering for genetic research, which in turn contributed to more positive attitudes, increased injunctive and descriptive norms and enhanced behavioural control. These relationships, then, were associated with higher intention to participate in genetic research.Conclusion: These findings suggest that continuous public discussions seem to positively affect volunteer intention for genetic research through ameliorating fears of negative consequences.

AB  - The global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the world in many ways. Due to the communicable nature of the disease, it is difficult to investigate the causal reason for the epidemic's spread sufficiently. This study comprehensively investigates the causal relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and mobility level on a multi time-scale and its influencing factors, by using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the causal decomposition approach. Linear regression analysis investigates the significance and importance of the influential factors on the intrastate and interstate causal strength. The results of an EEMD analysis indicate that the mid-term and long-term domain portrays the macroscopic component of the states' mobility level and COVID-19 cases, which represents overall intrinsic characteristics. In particular, the mobility level is highly associated with the long-term variations of COVID-19 cases rather than short-term variations. Intrastate causality analysis identifies the significant effects of median age and political orientation on the causal strength at a specific time-scale, and some of them cannot be identified from the existing method. Interstate causality results show a negative association with the interstate distance and the positive one with the airline traffic in the long-term domain. Clustering analysis confirms that the states with the higher the gross domestic product and the more politically democratic tend to more adhere to social distancing. The findings of this study can provide practical implications to the policymakers that whether the social distancing policies are effectively working or not should be monitored by long-term trends of COVID-19 cases rather than short-term.

AB  - Since early 2020, COVID-19 has spread throughout the United States (US), killing more than 700,000. Mask-wearing, social-distancing, and hand hygiene can curb the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. However, the adherence to COVID-19 safety measures varies considerably among the US public, likely due to disparate perceptions of COVID-19's risk. The current study examines risk perceptions for COVID-19 (RP-C) in a nationally representative sample of US residents (N = 512), as well as their political preferences, news media consumption, COVID-19 safety attitudes (SA-C) and reported COVID-19 safety behaviors (SB-C; e.g., mask-wearing and social-distancing). Using structural equation modeling, we tested a comprehensive measure for RP-C with a single latent factor, finding good model fit. We found that higher RP-C was associated with being more liberal, consuming more traditional news media, having attitudes that supported compliance with COVID-19 safety measures, and having greater reported compliance with COVID-19 safety measures. In addition, factor loadings for RP-C items indicate that people's RP-C was more strongly determined by personal and family, rather than collective or societal risk, which suggests risk communication may be improved by focusing on personal and family risk. Public health efforts to combat COVID-19 are only as good as compliance allows, and RP-C's strong relationship with SB-C indicates a potential means for risk communicators to increase compliance with COVID-19 safety measures. This finding will remain important as new COVID-19 variants, such as the Delta variant, emerge.

AB  - This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted to explore readiness with regard to the sudden shift towards emergency remote teaching and its correlation with perceived effectiveness, satisfaction, anxiety and attitudes among instructors in Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (PNU) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Data were gathered using an online questionnaire on readiness and perceptions of effectiveness, attitudes and satisfaction relating to the emergency remote teaching, as well as the anxiety resulting from it. Pearson's test was performed to assess the correlations between different parameters. The results of the study showed that readiness in terms of emergency remote teaching was high, at 44.9% among instructors, while 64.8% of them scored moderately regarding their perception of the emergency remote teaching's effectiveness. A positive attitude towards emergency remote teaching was reported by 18.5% of the instructors, although a high level of satisfaction was observed in 79.6% of the cases, and 38.7% showed no anxiety. A positive and significant correlation was obtained between a readiness to shift to emergency remote teaching and perceived effectiveness, attitudes and satisfaction (r = 0.2 and p < 0.01); however, anxiety showed a significant moderate negative correlation with perceived effectiveness (r = -0.35) p < 0.01, attitudes (r = -0.33) p < 0.01 and satisfaction (r = -0.44), p < 0.01. In conclusion, instructors at PNU were ready to provide emergency remote teaching, which led to high perceived effectiveness and levels of satisfaction, while the high level of anxiety could be attributed to stressful circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose. The study is aimed at exploring the popularity, impact, and usefulness of using YouTube in learning anatomy as perceived by Jordanian medical students studying at Jordan University of Science and Technology. Methods. The present work is a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. First-, second-, and third-year medical students were invited to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Students' responses were numerically coded, and the results were analyzed to reveal any statistically significant differences related to gender or level of study. Results. The results showed that 96.4% of the students used YouTube in general, 91.2% used it as a source of information, and 83.9% used YouTube as a learning tool in medical school. Further, YouTube was used by 79.1% of the students as an anatomy-learning tool. Most of these students used this platform in learning gross anatomy. The study also revealed that dissection videos were the most viewed anatomy-related content. Regarding the perceived value of YouTube as an anatomy-learning tool, the majority of the students reported that YouTube offered them useful anatomical information and enhanced their understanding, memorization, and recall of anatomical information. In addition, most of them recommended using YouTube as an anatomy-learning tool. Statistical analysis of the results revealed the presence of gender-related significant differences in students' perspectives. Such differences were also found among students of different levels of study. Conclusion. Medical students have positive attitudes toward using YouTube in augmenting their anatomy learning. For this, educators are encouraged to adopt YouTube as an educational tool in their anatomy instruction and to create new anatomy-related YouTube videos to enhance their students' learning.

AB  - Context. There is limited research on how community-based long-term care (CBLTC) providers' personal characteristics and attitudes affect their decisions to initiate advance care planning (ACP) conversations with consumers.
   Objectives. To examine judgments by CBLTC providers as to whether a consumer was in need of ACP and to compare the relative influence of situational features of the consumer with the influence of personal characteristics of the CBLTC provider.
   Methods. Factorial surveys with vignettes with randomly assigned situational features of a hypothetical consumer were obtained from 182 CBLTC providers at three Area Agencies on Aging located in the Midwestern U. S. Measures included the consumer's situational features, such as demographics, diagnosis, pain level, level of functioning, and caregiver involvement. Personal characteristics of the CBLTC provider included demographics, discipline, past experience with ACP, and attitudes toward ACP.
   Results. Hierarchical linear models indicated that most variability in ACP decisions was the result of differences among CBLTC providers (64%) rather than consumers' situational features. Positive decisions to discuss ACP were associated with consumers who needed assistance with legal issues and had a cancer diagnosis; these variables explained 8% of the vignette level variance. Significant personal characteristics of the CBLTC provider included a nursing background, less direct contact with consumers, past experience with ACP, and positive attitudes toward ACP; these variables explained 41% of the person-level variance.
   Conclusion. This study shows the lack of normative consensus about ACP and highlights the need for consistent educational programs regarding the role of the CBLTC provider in the ACP process.

AB  - Objective: Integrating constructs from three prominent health behavior theories including the extended parallel process model, the health belief model, and the theory of planned behavior, this study seeks to identify sociopsychological factors that influenced American's intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
   Method: An online survey was delivered to a U.S. sample (N = 934), assessing the influences of risk perception and fear associated with COVID-19, beliefs about and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, self-efficacy, social and psychological contexts, and demographic characteristics on people's intention to get COVID-19 vaccines.
   Results: Most respondents intended to get vaccinated. However, they tended to underestimate their risks of contracting COVID-19. Disease exposure led to higher uptake intent via the mediation of fear. Safety concerns negatively influenced vaccination intention, while perceived community benefits were positively associated with vaccination intention. Positive attitudes toward vaccines and recent vaccine history were positively linked to vaccination intent.
   Conclusion: This study attests the effectiveness of HBT constructs in predicting people's intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
   Practice Implications: The results point to the importance of fostering confidence in vaccine safety and countering overoptimism of individual susceptibility to the disease in interventions promoting COVID-19 vaccines uptake. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Waste prevention is currently a critical issue, and our research aims to provide a more nuanced view by examining the determinants of individual behaviour when deciding to either purchase a certain item or to extend the life of an owned item through repair or reuse activities. Our research has two main aims: (1) to examine the importance that being aware of consequences and personal norms have in shaping positive attitudes towards waste prevention behaviour; and (2) to explore the relationship between attitudes and perceived behavioural control on waste prevention by testing the mediation effects of perceived behavioural control and waste prevention behaviour. The research is based on 375 questionnaires collected in Pietra Ligure, a municipality located in Northwest Italy. Data were modelled using a structural equation model to test the hypotheses. The findings show that awareness of the consequences is a fundamental driver of waste prevention attitudes while personal norms are not. The findings also confirm a positive relationship between attitudes and perceived behavioural control. Finally, a positive significant relationship was found between perceived behavioural control and waste prevention behaviour, and between social norms and waste prevention behaviour. The results of our investigation are contextualised in theoretical, political and managerial frameworks and suggest several avenues for further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article we synthesize theory and research from several areas of psychology and political science to propose and test a causal model of the effects of threat on political attitudes. Based in part on prior research showing that fear, threat, and anxiety decrease cognitive capacity and motivation, we hypothesize that under high (vs. low) threat, people will seek to curtail open-ended information searches and exhibit motivated closed-mindedness (one aspect of the need for cognitive closure). The subjective desire for certainty, control, and closure, in turn, is expected to increase the individual's affinity for political conservatism, insofar as resistance to change and adherence to authority figures and conventional forms of morality are assumed to satisfy these epistemic motives more successfully than their ideological opposites. Consistent with this account, we find in Studies 1a and 1b that putting people into a highly threatened mindset leads them to exhibit an increase in motivated closed-mindedness and to perceive the world as more dangerous. Furthermore, in Study 2 we demonstrate that a subtle threat manipulation increases self-reported conservatism (or decreases self-reported liberalism), and this effect is mediated by closed-mindedness. In Study 3, we manipulated closed-mindedness directly and found that high (vs. low) cognitive load results in a greater affinity for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party. Finally, in Study 4 we conducted an experiment involving political elites in Iceland and found that three different types of threat (to the self, group, and system) all led center-right politicians to score higher on closed-mindedness and issue-based political conservatism. Implications for society and for the theory of ideology as motivated social cognition are discussed.

AB  - Background Many important strategies to reduce the spread of pandemic influenza need public participation. To assess public receptivity to such strategies, we compared adoption of preventive behaviours in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic among the public in five countries and examined whether certain non-pharmaceutical behaviours (such as handwashing) were deterrents to vaccination. We also assessed public support for related public health recommendations.
   Methods We used data from simultaneous telephone polls (mobile telephone and landline) in Argentina, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the USA. In each country, interviews were done in a nationally representative sample of adults, who were selected by the use of random digit dial techniques. The questionnaire asked people whether or not they had adopted each of various preventive behaviours (non-pharmaceutical such as personal protective and social distancing behaviour or vaccinations) to protect themselves or their family from H1N1 at any point during the pandemic. Two-tailed t tests were used for statistical analysis.
   Findings 900 people were surveyed in each country except the USA where 911 people were contacted. There were wide differences in the adoption of preventive behaviours between countries, although certain personal protective behaviours (eg, handwashing) were more commonly adopted than social distancing behaviours (eg, avoiding places where many people gather) across countries (53-89% vs 11-69%). These non-pharmaceutical behaviours did not reduce the likelihood of getting vaccinated in any country. There was also support across all countries for government recommendations related to school closure, avoiding places where many people gather, and wearing masks in public.
   Interpretation There is a need for country-specific approaches in pandemic policy planning that use both non-pharmaceutical approaches and vaccination.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a worldwide emergency, which may have harmful consequences on people's mental health. Parallel to research focused on risk factors, it could be useful to investigate the factors that help to cope with such crises at an emotional level. Therefore, this study aimed to strengthen the role of variables that protect from subjective distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, explore the pathways between satisfaction with life and perceived stress, and consider the role of coping strategies and defense mechanisms in this relationship. A sample of 1102 Italian participants who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures (Mage = 34.91, SD = 11.91) completed an online survey in which the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire were included. The data were analyzed using Pearson's r correlations and moderation analysis. A chained-mediation model showed that the relationship between life satisfaction and perceived stress is partially mediated by approach coping, positive attitude and mature defenses. This study contributes toward gaining a better understanding of a protective pathway for mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could be useful from both a preventive and an intervention perspective.

AB  - The naive social Darwinism, also called the Competitive Jungle Belief (CJB), according to the theory of the Dual-Process Motivational (DPM) model, is recognized as an expanded perceptual scheme acting as a cognitive mediator between deep individual characteristics and the area of socio-political attitudes and ideologies. This article aims to show the individual differences that can be dispositional characteristics to believe in the Competitive Jungle scheme's principles. The presented studies' main theoretical question is to find out whether the CJB bases on positive "individual resources" or rather some psychological deficits. In an extensive survey study, including four random-representative samples of adults Poles (with N ranging from 624 to 853 respondents), we tested the predictive power of the five categories of variables: 1) attachment styles; 2) Big Five personality traits; 3) Dark Triad of personality; 4) basic human values and 5) moral judgments. The results showed the psychological profile of social Darwinists as clearly dysfunctional in terms of personal life quality. They express characteristics like admiration for power and desire to dominate, pursue one's goals at all costs, exploitative attitude towards people, and hostility. On the other hand, they reveal a fearful style in close relations with others and have low self-esteem and low self-sufficiency. From the societal perspective, such beliefs make up a vision of social life that is unfavorable for building a cooperative, helpful, and relatively egalitarian society. The supreme idea that only those who do not sympathize with others and are ready to use them can be successful and survive is far from the principles of liberal democracy.

AB  - Conflicts over environmental spaces that are sites of trauma or have been designated as sacred involve questions about who has a legitimate stake in determining the use of the site, and where the hallowedness attached to that space ends. We examine these questions in a study of the 2009-2010 controversy about the Park51 [sic] Islamic Community Center, sometimes called the "Ground Zero Mosque," to examine how issues of distributive, procedural, and inclusionary justice play out in a conflict over valuable land close to Ground Zero. This conflict, though in a specifically fraught locale, speaks to resistance to mosque construction in the USA and Europe. Using newspaper articles on the public debate as data (N = 65), and performing a thematic analysis, we identified four key themes: (1) views of Islam, (2) conflict, (3) American identity and ideals, and (4) proximity and place. Utilizing Chi square analyses to examine the effect of propinquity on support for Park51, we found that people living within New York City were more likely to support Park51 than those outside of the city. Our conclusion discusses constructs that link values, space, and social relations-hallowed ground, place attachment, social distance-and discuss their relationship to justice. We argue that while several kinds of justice are relevant, at its heart, this conflict concerns inclusionary questions about who can speak, who belongs, and who should be excluded.

AB  - Objectives. This study assessed the physical and psychological burden of lead apron use on Jordanian interventionists and investigated the attitudes and knowledge of interventional personnel toward ergonomic guidelines and practices. Methods. A cross-sectional investigation of a randomly sampled Jordanian cohort of interventional personnel was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. Results. A nationwide sample of 130 practitioners with a mean 9.3 +/- 8.1 years of experience in interventional procedures participated. Practitioners were aware of their apron's weight but not of its lead equivalence (71.5%). More than 60% of respondents complained of back pain. While 66.9% did not develop musculoskeletal pathologies, 64.3% of those with already established musculoskeletal pathologies experienced worse pain due to apron usage. Despite believing in the effect of lead aprons on muscular strain and work performance, 78.5% adhere to its usage. In terms of ergonomics, only 39.2% were aware of ergonomic guidelines; however, 90.0% believe that ergonomic practices are essential as 49.2% have experienced discomfort due to bad ergonomics. In terms of psychological burden, anxiety and depression were suggested in 16.4 and 21.6% of the sample. Conclusion. Jordanian interventionists portray positive attitudes toward lead aprons; nevertheless, their awareness of ergonomic practices warrants the implementation of evidenced-based interventions.

AB  - This paper considers the role of nostalgia-based leisure in the present COVID-19 pandemic. Enforced lockdowns and social distancing initiatives have been met with various media channels replaying famous sport matches, classic films and memorable concerts from the past. Furthermore, social media is full of families interacting more; playing traditional board games and numerous other leisure-related activities such as baking bread and making fresh pasta. Nostalgia may well end up being one of the primary coping mechanisms (for all generations) of enduring isolation, fear - and a general loss of freedom. It is also worth considering whether we are now creating our own future nostalgia where, when the crisis is through, we will long for the social bonds and sense of community the pandemic created.

Information and communication technologies are increasingly playing a major part in mobilizing collective social and political action as a response to the outdated planning policies and practices. With transport infrastructures constrained by the unprecedented global impact of COVID-19, DSI can potentially become a defining element of the post-pandemic world. We use the case of transport planning in Auckland and analyse the role of a proactive advocacy group and its use of technical expertise to offer opinions through virtual shared platforms for public participation and empowerment. City Rail Link is discussed as a large-scale public transport project that received political and community support due to the efforts of digital social innovators.

AB  - Purpose In light of the recent shift in the US culture, this paper investigates the effectiveness of female sexual empowerment as ad appeal in the apparel industry. Design/methodology/approach Study 1 aimed to understand consumers' reactions to female sexual empowerment in ads in terms of their attitudes toward the ad, attitudes toward the brand and purchase intention. Study 2 investigated the role of gender in perceptions of female sexual empowerment in ads. Findings This research establishes that consumers display positive attitudes toward female sexual empowerment in the apparel advertisement. These attitudes positively influence attitudes toward the brand, which in turn improve purchase intention. These effects are stronger for women than men. Research limitations/implications This research borrows from social power theory to reveal the impact of female sexual empowerment in ads in the apparel industry. Based on the theory of planned behavior, the findings also show that female sexual empowerment can have a positive impact on purchase intention through a serial mediation of attitude toward the ad and brand. Practical implications Marketers need to be aware of the impact of female sexual empowerment as ad appeal.

AB  - Responding to a call for research on pornography and women's sexuality made by Weinberg, Williams, Kleiner, and Irizarry (2010), this study assessed pornography consumption, predictors, and correlates using nationally representative data gathered from U.S. women between 1973 and 2010 (N = 18,225). Women who were younger, less religious, and non-White were more likely to consume pornography. Women who consumed pornography had more positive attitudes toward extramarital sex, adult premarital sex, and teenage sex. Women who consumed pornography also had more sexual partners in the prior year, prior 5 years, and were more likely to have engaged in extramarital sex and paid sex. Consistent with Wright's (2011a) acquisition, activation, application model of mass media sexual socialization and the theorizing of Linz and Malamuth (1993), liberal-conservative ideology moderated the association between pornography exposure and sexual behavior. Specifically, the positive association between pornography exposure and women's recent sexual behavior was strongest for the most liberal women and weakest for the most conservative women. Cultural commentators and some academics argue that technological advances have resulted in a steady increase in the percentage of individuals who consume pornography. Little support was found for this assertion among U.S. women.

AB  - Objective: To determine the qualities of a good medical teacher from a trainee's perspective, to evaluate the best teaching method, and to explore the association of specialty and level of training with teaching methods and qualities of a medical teacher.
   Methods: The questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in two tertiary care teaching hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan, from July 2019 to December 2020, and comprised all house officers and postgraduate residents. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire that had three sections: demographics, best method of teaching, and the characteristics of a good medical teacher. Data was analysed using SPSS 20.
   Results: Of the 135 subjects, 56(41.5%) were males; 79(58.5%) were females; 76(56%) were junior trainees; and 77(57%) belonged to surgical specialties. The overall mean age was 27.6 +/- 2.4 years. Best teaching method identified by the trainees was 'asking of problem-based questions' 46(33.6%). Good communication skills 61(44.5%), and calm and non-humiliating demeanour 61(44.5%) were the most frequently identified qualities. More surgical trainees considered the generation of competition among learners as the best teaching method than the trainees from other specialties (p=0.001). House officers reported 'unbiased' (p=0.001) and 'moral and ethical' (p=0.001) significantly more frequently as a good trait in their teachers compared to the residents.
   Conclusion: The most important qualities in a medial teacher, as identified by the learners, were good communication skills and calm and polite attitude.

KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - The association between women's levels of relationship intimacy and how frequently their partner viewed pornography was examined in a community sample of 136 NZ heterosexual women. Controlling for age, ethnicity and education, partner use of pornography was significantly negatively correlated with emotional, sexual, intellectual and recreational intimacy, but not social intimacy. Women's attitudes toward pornography did not mediate any of these associations. However, significant moderation effects were found: women with more negative attitudes toward pornography reported lower rates of emotional and social intimacy when their partner was believed to be viewing pornography weekly or more, but not when this frequency was less. No association was found for women with less negative attitudes toward pornography. These findings indicate that pornography may be detrimental to relationship intimacy for women with strongly negative attitudes toward it.

AB  - The commercial application of transgenic technology in the food industry has become a crucial topic worldwide. This study aims to achieve the following objectives: (i) to examine consumers' purchase intention toward genetically modified (GM) food by using benefit-risk analysis (BRA); (ii) to examine consumers' purchase intention toward GM food based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB); and (iii) to determine which framework or theory significantly influences the interpretation of purchase intention toward GM food under an integrated framework incorporating the BRA and the TPB. An online survey was conducted among 408 qualified samples who were analysed through structural equation modeling. The result analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) under the BRA framework, Chinese consumers rely on their positive attitude toward GM food to increase purchase intention and their perceived risks to decrease purchase intention. Moreover, consumers' trust increases their perceived benefits offered by GM food and decrease their perceived risks; (ii) under the TPB framework, attitude toward GM technology is the most significant predictor of purchase intention toward GM food, followed by perceived behavioral control and subjective norms; and (iii) under the integrated framework, although most of the results in the single framework of the BRA or the TPB are supported, the BRA provides better interpretation than the TPB. In addition, several mediating effects are found in the context of purchase intention toward GM food.

KW  - belief preservation
AB  - It is commonly believed that the general public is heavily dependent on the media for its political news and views and that, as a consequence, the media exercise a strong influence over public opinion and behaviour. However, many millions in the Western world strongly believe things that are barely ever mentioned in the mainstream media, just as many millions also firmly reject or ignore some of the messages that are repeated incessantly by them. This confirms sixty years of experimental psychology research showing that most individuals are capable of preserving their beliefs, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, argument and logic to the contrary. Consistent with this, political science research finds little evidence of strong media influence on the party voting, political attitudes and election agendas of citizens. They have their own ways of gathering political information about the world around them, and they do not necessarily believe what they read in the papers, unless they are so inclined to start with. Consequently, media influences on mass opinion and behaviour are weaker than commonly assumed and, such as they are, their effects are more beneficial than harmful for democracy.

   The playable ad is a new type of digital advertising that combines interactivity with gamification. Guided by psychological reactance theory, this study aims to explore the psychological processes and effects of playable ads on consumers' perceived control and product attitudes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper conducted two experiments to examine the relationship between playable ads, perceived control and product attitude. This paper also applied psychological reactance theory and investigated whether perceived control triggered by the interactive features of playable ads influenced psychological reactance toward them.
   Findings
   Findings from two experiments show that playable ads, compared to video ads, increased consumers' perceived control, which, in turn, led to more positive attitudes toward the advertised products (Studies 1 and 2). This study also supports psychological reactance theory by revealing that increased perceived control diminished perceived freedom threat and subsequently alleviated consumers' psychological reactance toward advertising messages (Study 2).
   Originality/value
   This study sheds light on the effectiveness of a new type of ad-game integration - playable ads. Different from prior research in gamification of advertising, this paper examined the effectiveness of playable ads in an information processing context in which the ads were not the primary task to focus on. This study also extends psychological reactance theory in the context of interactive marketing by exploring the effect of perceived control afforded by digital message features in mitigating reactance.

KW  - albinism
KW  - contact strategy
AB  - Reducing stigma is key to improving the wellbeing of people with albinism in Tanzania. This study aimed to obtain more insight into the effects of two radio interventions with regard to albinism-related stigma: a radio drama and a radio interview. Assessment of the radio interventions was based on two attitude measurement instruments (The Albinism Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue Community Stigma Scale and the Albinism Social Distance Scale), an entertainment scale, and two informal (group) interviews. In total, 111 community members participated in the assessment prior to the radio drama, and 65 after. In the case of the radio interview, 123 community members participated in the assessment prior to the radio show, and 77 after. Following the radio drama, a significant reduction was found in terms of community stigma, and a reduction in social distance was found after both interventions. The entertainment score for both interventions was high, but significantly higher for the radio drama. The respondents indicated that they had gained more understanding of albinism as a result of the interventions, and were positive about this type of education. The current study shows that a radio show in which the listener interacts with someone with albinism can contribute to a reduction in stigma, and demonstrates that different types of radio intervention can have different outcomes.
   Points of interest
   Reducing discrimination is key to improving the wellbeing of people with albinism in Tanzania.
   This research investigated the use of radio shows to change attitudes towards people with albinism within the community; two types of radio show were tested: a radio drama and a radio interview.
   Through the shows the respondents got into contact with someone with albinism.
   The shows were valued by the community members as an attractive means of education.
   The shows proved to be effective in terms of improving peoples' knowledge about, and attitude towards people with albinism.
   People enjoyed the radio drama more than the radio interview. The radio drama was also more effective than the radio interview in improving peoples' attitudes towards people with albinism.
   This research offers recommendations for organisations that are working to raise awareness with regard to albinism.

AB  - Introduction: Exposure to violence is a risk factor for firearm carriage. Youth exposed to violence also have difficulty envisioning positive future outcomes (e.g., educational outcomes), which can increase the likelihood of firearm carriage over time. Researchers, however, have not yet examined whether changes in exposure to violence over time can influence the developmental trajectories of firearm carriage. To address this gap, we (1) examined the longitudinal association between exposure to violence and firearm carriage (grades 9 to 12) and then (2) examined whether changes in future expectations mediated this longitudinal association.
   Method: The longitudinal association between exposure to violence and firearm carriage through future expectations was examined among 850 adolescents from the Flint Adolescent Study. Participants were recruited from four high schools in a midwestern city in the United States. Parallel latent growth models and latent growth mediation models were estimated.
   Results: A positive association was observed between the rate of change in exposure to violence and firearm carriage. Exposure to violence also indirectly increased the risk for firearm carriage over time by decreasing future expectation in the 9th grade.
   Conclusions: Our results support the idea that helping youth develop positive attitude about educational success may help reduce firearm carriage. Increasing positive expectations about future may help prevent firearm carriage within the context of violence exposure.

AB  - Background: This study explored the extent of COVID-19 vaccination coverage and investigated drivers and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake among people in prison. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2021 among 517 detained people in the Campania region of South Italy. Results: In total, 47.1% of participants expressed a high concern about contracting COVID-19 after vaccination, whereas 60.6% and 53.8% of respondents reported a positive attitude towards usefulness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. Adherence to the active offer of COVID-19 vaccination involved 89.7% of detained subjects. COVID-19 vaccination uptake was significantly higher in females, and in those who reported influenza vaccination uptake, had received information about COVID-19 vaccination from media and newspapers, did not express need of additional information about COVID-19 vaccine, believed that COVID-19 vaccine is safe, were involved in working activities in the prison, and had a high school or university degree. Conclusions: These findings showed a high self-reported COVID-19 vaccination coverage in detained subjects, supporting the effectiveness of the strategy aimed at giving priority to COVID-19 vaccinations in prisons. Further efforts are needed to contrast the hesitancy of those who refused vaccination to increase their confidence about usefulness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Handwashing (HW) with water and soap is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of protecting oneself and others against the coronavirus. Here, the HW knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Saudi adults were assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic using a cross-sectional study conducted between May 8 and June 8, 2020, during a partial lockdown period. A web-based validated questionnaire was distributed through different social media platforms, and the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, seven items related to knowledge, four items related to attitudes, and thirteen items related to the practice of HW were assessed. A total of 1323 (51% male and 49% female) adults from all regions of Saudi Arabia responded to the questionnaire. The overall mean (+/- SD) was 5.13 (+/- 1.18) for knowledge of HW and COVID-19, 2.79 (+/- 0.77) for attitude toward HW, and 7.8 (+/- 2.56) for HW practice. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed factors associated with knowledge to be age and family income. Sex, educational level, family income, and HW knowledge were associated with negative and neutral attitude, whereas age, sex, family income, and HW knowledge were associated with practice. These results suggest that HW knowledge was strongly associated with positive attitudes toward HW and correct HW practice in Saudi adults during the COVID-19 lockdown.

AB  - This article investigates the impact of perceived age norms on the formation of entrepreneurial intentions in the third age. Age norms refer to those social norms that determine whether establishing and running a business are considered appropriate behavior for a mature individual. An empirical analysis of Finnish individuals finds that norms perceived as permissive of enterprising activity in the third age exert a significant positive influence on entrepreneurial intentions in this segment, even when controlling for the general level of entrepreneurship in the municipalities. This influence is partially mediated by whether the individual has a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship, by how the individual perceives their own ability to start and run a business, by the extent of support from their family and friends they perceive and by the importance of that support to them. Thus, if policy aims to increase enterprising activity in the third-age segment, the portfolio of instruments should include measures that address people's general awareness of third-age entrepreneurship as a viable, positive and attractive late-career option.

AB  - Before consequences of climate change continue to intensify and increasingly affect the entire planet, immediate action must be taken. For instance, adopt the pro-environmental behaviors such as purchase of organic food to minimize the harmful human-caused impacts to the environment. This paper aims to determine the factors that influence the purchase intention of organic food in Malaysia by applying the theory of planned behavior and the protection motivation theory. A total of 300 questionnaires were collected and PLS-SEM was employed to test the structural relationships. Consequences of climate change and health threats were not the primary concerns among Malaysians when deciding whether to purchase organic food. Results show that perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, self-efficacy, subjective norm, and attitude affect purchase intention towards organic food. Consumers were more likely to have positive attitude towards organic food when they have adequate information on vulnerability of a threat and its consequences. The findings provide insights on the antecedents and outcomes of purchase intention towards organic food particularly in Malaysia. Although predictive power of perceived factors such as perceived rewards and perceived efficacy have been extensively researched in the past, there are limited studies that integrate both theories that simultaneously investigate antecedents of consumers' purchase intention towards organic food.

AB  - Background: Gender-based data indicates that within-race STI rate disparities exist for young African Americans males, (YAAMs) ages 18 to 24. Social media may prove to be a valuable tool for delivering theory-driven messages about sexual health knowledge and behaviors, including condom usage, directly to YAAMs in promoting safer sex behaviors for this population. Purpose: To examine the current attitudes, norms and perceived controls related to the influence of social media on condom use among YAAMs ages 18 to 21. Methods: Nine group-depth interviews were held with 41 participants, mean age 19, SD +1.2, were conducted in metro Detroit to understand use of social media for condom use education, and health messages among YAAMs ages 18 to 21. Results: Participants demonstrated positive attitudes about using social media for condom use education. Social media sites that were educational (n = 12) and engaging (n = 5) made it easy to seek out sexual health information related to condom use. Similarly, participants liked social media for condom use education if the sites provided educational (n = 9) content and had creative advertisements. (n = 7). Top reasons to dislike social media as a mode for condom use education included negative comments (n = 6) displayed on the sites or if the site provided misinformation (n = 5) about the use of condoms. Conclusion: The findings here can help healthcare providers, the community and researchers understand media preference, navigation, and better understand the role of social media in adolescent health care.

AB  - Framed by a social exchange perspective, this study address the issue of whether positive employees' perceptions about human resource management practices influence positive attitudes and behaviour. We hypothesize that human resource management practices (HRMP) have a significant negative effect on intention to voluntary leave the organization and a positive effect on organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB), and that OCB could mediate the relationship between HRMP and turnover intention. A sample of 165 employees from the Portuguese public administration participated in the study. Data was analysed through descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis and hypotheses were tested using single and multiple linear regressions. Results indicate that HRMP is positively associated with OCB, but only internal communication practice is highly valued by Portuguese public employees and successfully predicts OCB. HRMP also show a positive association with turnover intention but only celebration and recognition practices are predictors of turnover intention. Contrary to our hypothesis OCB did not acted as mediator between HRMP and turnover intention. Some suggestions on managerial human resource practices were proposed as well as some main questions raised in the Portuguese public administration context.

AB  - This study investigates attitudes towards legalizing land sales and Willingness to Accept (WTA) sales prices and compensation prices for land among smallholder households in the southern highlands of Ethiopia. Household panel data from 2007 and 2012 are used. The large majority of the sample prefers land sales to remain illegal, and the resistance to legalizing land sales increased from 2007 to 2012. While resistance against land sales was strongest among the most land poor in 2007, the relatively more land rich had become more negative towards legalizing land sales in 2012. Younger age and more education were not associated with a more positive attitude towards legalizing land sales. In the same period, perceived median real land values increased sharply but also exhibit substantial local variation with higher land values in areas with better market access. Stated minimum land sales prices increased with farm size in 2012. The substantial increase in perceived land values, high economic growth and outmigration of youth have yet to persuade the rural population in southern Ethiopia to open the land sales market.

AB  - We explore the potential of teleoperated androids, which are embodied telecommunication media with humanlike appearances. By conducting a pilot study, we investigated how Telenoid, a teleoperated android designed as a minimalistic human, affects people in the real world when it is employed to express telepresence and a sense of 'being there'. Our exploratory study focused on the social aspects of the android robot, which might facilitate communication between the elderly and Telenoid's operator. This new way of creating social relationships can be used to solve a problem in society, the social isolation of senior citizens. It has become a major issue even in Denmark that is known as one of countries with advanced welfare systems. In this pilot study at Danish homes, we found that the elderly with or without dementia showed positive attitudes toward Telenoid and developed various dialogue strategies. Contrary to the issue of revulsion that can be caused by humanlike robots and the negative reactions by non-users in media reports, we discuss potentials and challenges of the android's embodiment for social inclusion of senior citizens in telecommunications.

AB  - The success of digital longforms in terms of readership and viral spread promotes an optimistic perspective on innovative web journalism with regard to the attention, engagement, and subsequent knowledge acquisition of citizens when consuming news. Since empirical evidence for such effects is scant, this experimental study focuses on visual aesthetics as a signature element of novel news formats that are designed to attract attention in a highly competitive media landscape. Specifically, it draws on the theoretical framework of user engagement and shows that the presence of visual aesthetics contributes to meaningful learning from the news by initiating positive attitudes towards the interface, which in turn leads to deeper involvement with the content. However, when the presence of visual aesthetics fails to affect interface evaluation, the opposite effect occurs. Surprisingly, these effects are not found to be contingent upon individual differences such as issue involvement or issue-specific prior knowledge. Overall, our results suggest that for news organizations, it is worth investing financial and personal resources in innovative news formats in order to support knowledge gain, although they need to be carefully designed as the first encounter with the interface decides about the subsequent engagement with and processing of the news.

AB  - Background. A novel coronavirus first reported in Wuhan City in China in 2019 (COVID-19) developed into a global pandemic throughout 2020. Many countries around the world implemented strict social distancing policies to curb the spread of the virus. In this study we aimed to examine potential change in mental/physical health and social relationships during a highly restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia during April 2020.
   Methods. Our survey (n = 1,599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020).
   Results. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction.
   Conclusions. The psychological toll of COVID-19 on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater infection rates. Our findings highlight how technology-mediated communication can allow people to adequately maintain social relationships during an extreme lockdown event.

AB  - When receiving unfair monetary offers from another person, the most common response is punishment. Existing literature on the Ultimatum Game indicates that individuals frequently refuse unfair offers even when this results in a loss for themselves. Here, we present behavioral and neurophysiological evidence demonstrating that friendship substantially modifies this response. When the proposer was a friend rather than an unknown person, unfair offers were less frequently rejected and the medial frontal negativity (MFN) typically associated with unfair offers was reversed to positive polarity. The underlying generators were located in inferior-mesial and right inferior-and medial-lateral frontal regions (BA10 and BA11). These findings highlight the fundamental role of the anterior prefrontal cortex in interpersonal economic interaction and, particularly, present new evidence on the effects of social distance on the MFN.

AB  - Recent studies conducted in the UK, US, and in few other European countries have revealed a prominent political parallelism phenomenon in the news coverage of Islam and Muslims. The studies have evidenced that the coverage of Islam and Muslims is widely influenced by the ideological leanings of the newspapers. This paper sets out to explore whether the ideological differences of the Australian newspapers are reflected in the coverage of Islam and Muslims from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017. Employing Van Dijk's ideological square and lexicalisation approaches within the CDA paradigm, this study examined editorials from two leading Australian newspapers. The findings validate the existence of the political parallelism phenomenon in the editorial contents of the selected newspapers representing Islam and Muslims. The findings show that The Australian, which is a rightist or conservative newspaper, toed the line of right-wing political parties and politicians such as Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Turnbull, portrayed Islam and Muslims in an overwhelmingly negative way, appreciated anti-immigration policies, criticised those who support accepting refugees, highlighted violence in Muslims countries, and collectivised Muslims while commenting on terrorist attacks in the West. On the other hand, The Age, which is a leftist or centre-left newspaper, criticised the far-rights for appreciating and supporting the rightist or conservative policies against Muslims, advocated the leftist or progressive or liberal stance, portrayed Islam and Muslims in a positive, supportive and balanced way, and advocated understanding, harmony and cohesion in Australia.

AB  - Background and Purpose Virus mitigation strategies such as adhering to stay-at-home orders, practicing social distancing, and engaging in personal protective behaviors are central to slowing the spread of COVID-19. This population-based cohort study sought to identify sociodemographic characteristics and Health Belief Model factors that are associated with nonadherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies with the goal of informing public health messaging campaigns.
   Methods An online population-based survey was distributed via social media over an 8-week period from April 13, 2020, to June 8, 2020.
   Results Data were derived from 2,222 adults (57% female; 40% racial/ethnic minorities). Univariate analyses revealed that men, younger aged (18-30 years) and unmarried adults, and noncollege educated individuals had lower levels of perceived threat, control, and knowledge about COVID-19 (p <= .001). Multivariable linear regression models further revealed that male gender was significantly associated with reporting lower levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .001), and that higher levels of perceived threat, perceived control, and knowledge about how to keep oneself and others safe from COVID-19 were significantly associated with reporting higher levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .01).
   Conclusions Findings suggest that public health appeals that target men, emphasize individual risk, and provide clear, consistent guidance on what individuals can do to decrease their risk for COVID-19 may be effective in motivating increased mitigation adherence.

KW  - QUANTIFIED AUDIENCES
AB  - As newsrooms are increasingly using web analytics to monitor news behavior, journalism is likely to become increasingly "metrics-driven." Research suggests that analytics are commonly used by web editors to decide on the distribution and promotion of news stories, but how does this affect the news practices of journalists? To what extent are audience metrics taken into account by individual journalists and reporters who work in a specific news beat? This paper explores this question through a survey of political journalists in Belgium. The study examines the level of access that political news journalists have to audience metrics, and to what extent their level of exposure to and use of metrics affects their attitudes toward analytics in news work. Results show that while three quarters of the political news journalists are nowadays exposed to audience metrics on a regular basis, more than half of them report to never make direct use of web metrics in their daily work. Younger journalists are more likely to be exposed and to use web metrics than their senior colleagues, but journalists working for commercial media do not use metrics more intensely than journalists from public service media. Journalists who actively use metrics themselves tend to hold more positive attitudes toward web metrics, whereas the passive exposure to metrics seems to make journalists more skeptical or negative about them.

AB  - Electric mobility has been around for a long time. In recent years, with advancements in technology, electric vehicles (EVs) have shown a new potential to meet many of the challenges being faced by humanity. These challenges include increasing dependence on fossil fuels, environmental concerns, challenges posed by rapid urbanization, urban mobility, and employment. However, the adoption of electric vehicles has remained challenging despite consumers having a positive attitude toward EVs and big policy pushes by governments in many countries. Marketers from the electric vehicle (EV) industry are finding it difficult to identify genuine buyers for their products. In this context, the present study attempts to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a person would "Buy" or "Won't Buy" an electric vehicle in India. To develop the model, an exploration of EV context was done first by conducting a text analysis of online content relating to electric vehicles. The objective was to find frequently occurring words to gain a meaningful understanding of the consumer's interests and concerns relating to electric vehicles. The machine learning model indicates that age, gender, income, level of environmental concerns, vehicle cost, running cost, vehicle performance, driving range, and mass behavior are significant predictors of electrical vehicle purchase in India. The level of education, employment, and government subsidy are not significant predictors of EV uptake.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN ITALIAN STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - Political polarization
KW  - dramatization
KW  - media system
KW  - segmentation
AB  - This contribution is organized along two main interpretive lines. First: the Italian public sphere is very polarized because of well-established historical attitudes, a crowded media market and new technologies that push towards segmentation of the audience. The arrival of Berlusconi has only reinforced the already existing polarization that goes well beyond the borders of partisanship involving the content of news, the structure and professionalism of news outlets and also the recipients that divide themselves along the lines of political attitudes. The second characteristic feature of the Italian public sphere involves the tendency towards dramatization, which is also produced by the sudden commercialization of the entire mass media system that started in 1980. This article's thesis is supported by examples of dramatization and extreme political discourse. The consequences that derive from this situation are discussed in the conclusion.

AB  - Social distancing received top priority during the COVID-19 crisis, resulting in new users of public digital services (PDS) with heterogeneous use motivation. While some users decided to use a PDS voluntarily and independently of COVID-19, others were forced to use PDS because of the COVID-19 lockdown. Based on technology acceptance models, we compared forced users (N-1 = 346) and voluntary users (N-2 = 315) using latent multigroup analysis. First-time users of a PDS (N = 661) participated in the survey after reporting a crime online to the police. Results showed that forced and voluntary users differed regarding key factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, behavioral intention) and antecedents (system trust, ICT self-concept) of technology acceptance with less positive values for forced users. Further, forced users had stronger needs for system trust and usefulness (performance expectancy) than voluntary users, revealing user group-specific predictive values. The lessons learned for PDS design and marketing beyond pandemic times are discussed.

AB  - Sharks have historically suffered from a negative image, which has been indirectly fuelling public fear and government decisions to kill sharks, as part of bather protection programmes in various countries. Scientists are arguing, however, that the public opinion of sharks is increasingly positive, and that opposition to lethal shark control and to negative shark framing is growing. Positive attitudes and behaviour towards sharks tend to be influenced by an array of factors, which ought to be considered in studies aimed at effectively steering shark conservation actions. This study used a questionnaire survey of 1138 beach visitors in South Africa, together with structural equation modelling, to investigate human perceptions of sharks, and their influence on outcome variables including attitudes and behaviour towards shark hazard mitigation and shark framing. The results show that basic knowledge and attitudes towards sharks have a significant effect on the outcome variables. Additionally, attitudes towards sharks moderate the effect of perceived risk from sharks on the outcome variables. The results support arguments of public concern for sharks, and provide guidance for strategies aimed at garnering more support for shark conservation.

AB  - The main objective of the research was to analyse the study attitudes and study behaviour of online students at DOBA Business School. Furthermore, the aim was to evaluate the interrelationship between study attitudes and study behaviour and to assess the predictive value of the two sets of variables for students' general satisfaction with the study programmes. A total of 331 students participated in the web survey. Participants expressed the most positive attitudes towards the use of technology and flexibility of online learning, while the absence of personal contacts was also perceived as highly favourable. Average scores for both deep and strategic approaches were quite high, while the surface approach was much less prominent. Participants were highly engaged with their teamwork assignments, whereas proactive communication was somewhat less developed. Study attitudes seem to be far more powerful predictors of general satisfaction than study behaviour, which is not surprising. Satisfaction is thought to be the result of the complex subjective evaluation of all relevant aspects of the study programme implementation, as they were measured by attitudinal subscales.

AB  - This article examines how young Muslims and Christians with ethnic minority backgrounds in Oslo reflect on their use of social media as a way to present themselves and their religiosity. The study draws upon Arlie Hochschild's concepts of feeling rules and emotional labour and Erving Goffman's typology of frontstage and backstage behaviour to analyse how young Muslims and Christian informants present themselves on social media. For minority groups, these strategies can be used to negotiate religion and create a different image. This study shows that both Christian and Muslim youth with minority backgrounds use different strategies to present their religiosity. Even though all the informants want to portray themselves as religious, they carefully consider what type of religious content they share to avoid social exclusion, conflict and religious discussions.

AB  - In this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship between national identification of majority Finns (nation-wide probability sample, N = 335) and their attitudes towards Russian immigrants living in Finland. As previous research indicates both possibilities, we tested whether this relationship was moderated or mediated by threats and gains perceived to result from immigration. The results supported the mediation hypothesis; those individuals who identified stronger with their national ingroup perceived more threats than gains related to increased immigration and these perceptions, in turn, were associated with more negative attitudes towards immigrants. The role of realistic as opposed to symbolic threats and gains was particularly pronounced. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of their theoretical relevance and practical means to improve intergroup relations, with a particular focus on the relations between Finns and Russian immigrants in Finland.

KW  - REGION
AB  - Objectives: Malaria affects millions of people in urban and rural India every year. This study addresses two main gaps in current research: 1) attitudes towards personal protective strategies against Malaria among urban populations; and 2) understanding of the extent to which urban health information seeking preferences shape preventive behaviours.
   Study design: Cross-sectional face-to-face surveys using stratified sampling design.
   Methods: A 60-min survey was carried out to 1000 middle-of-pyramid (MOP) population in five main cities in India by trained interviewers. Variables assessed included perceived effectiveness and actual practice of 14 scientific and indigenous personal protection methods, Malaria-related attitudes (susceptibility, severity and response efficacy) and health information seeking preferences.
   Results: Actual practice of Malaria preventive behaviours was found to be significantly lower than the perceived effectiveness of each of the fourteen scientific and indigenous methods. Television, newspapers, and mobile phones were reported as the top three preferred media for seeking public health information. Lastly, perceived susceptibility, response efficacy, and health-related media use were found to play significant roles in predicting actual practice behaviours.
   Conclusions: Our study highlights a need for health authorities to focus on translating positive attitudes to actual practice of preventive behaviours. Communication efforts may focus on the use of TV, newspapers and mobile phones for greater reach and efficacy. Other implications for Malaria prevention programs are discussed.

AB  - After several significant nuclear accidents, public attitudes toward nuclear energy technologies and facilities are considered to be one of the essential factors in the national energy and electricity policy-making process of several nations that employ nuclear energy as their key energy resource. However, it is difficult to explore and capture such an attitude, because the majority of prior studies analyzed public attitudes with a limited number of respondents and fragmentary opinion polls. In order to supplement this point, this study suggests a big data analyzing method with K-LIWC (Korean-Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), sentiment and query analysis methods, and investigates public attitudes, positive and negative emotional statements about nuclear energy with the collected data sets of well-known social media and network services in Korea over time. Results show that several events and accidents related to nuclear energy have consistent or temporary effects on the attitude and ratios of the statements, depending on the kind of events and accidents. The presented methodology and the use of big data in relation to the energy industry is suggested as it can be helpful in addressing and exploring public attitudes. Based on the results, implications, limitations, and future research areas are presented. (C) 2018 Korean Nuclear Society, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB  - Background. While sport is often considered a vehicle for peace, the evidence for this notion is weak. There is also a vast difference in the way in which sports have been studied.
   Problem and aim. In light of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the current study investigated reconciliatory attitudes among Ukrainian athletes when facing Russian and non-Russian opponents. The aim was to explore whether sport and competition can unite combat sports athletes despite them coming from countries in conflict.
   Method. One hundred and fifty-six Ukrainian athletes in several different types of combat sports were recruited and divided into two groups according to whether or not they faced a Russian opponent. The groups then answered questions in regard to reconciliatory attitudes, sociopolitical hostility and aggression. Their answers were analyzed in an ANOVA and with subsequent moderation analysis with the PROCESS macro v3.1.
   Results and conclusions. We found that, in general, competition influenced reconciliatory attitudes in a positive way. Moreover, the effect was predicted by physical aggression, verbal aggression and anger. Additionally, hostility moderated the relationship between pre-and post-reconciliatory attitudes. However, neither nationality nor sociopolitical perception of Russia influenced reconciliatory attitudes. These findings might have implications for future research on combat sports, such as identifying individuals suitable to reconcile and the fostering of positive attitudes (peace) despite political conflict.

AB  - This research assessed fatalism toward COVID-19 and its role in behavioral intentions to support mitigation efforts (e. g., social distancing) and mental well-being. A COVID-19 fatalism measure was developed, and a messaging manipulation (fatalistic vs. optimistic vs. no message) was created to examine causal links between fatalism scores. Support for mitigation efforts and negative affect (anxiety, fear, depression, and insecurity) were measured to examine the consequences of fatalism toward COVID-19. Results showed that the fatalistic messaging condition increased fatalism whereas the optimistic message reduced it. The effects of the messaging manipulation were also apparent in the downstream measures of support for mitigation and negative affect through the mediator of fatalism toward COVID-19. Specifically, fatalism negatively predicted intentions to support mitigation. Regarding mental health, fatalism was positively associated with depression but negatively associated with fear and insecurity. Implications for COVID-19 mitigation efforts and mental health in the face of the coronavirus pandemic are discussed.

AB  - Makerspaces and hacklabs are believed to encourage a positive attitude towards gaining computer skills. Within these communities for peer production, citizens can apply cutting-edge technologies in DIY projects. In recent decades, mushrooming makerspaces and hacklabs were embraced by the tech industry and governments alike. Feminist makerspaces and hacklabs, however, as they are centred around a queer feminist agenda, have raised eyebrows. In order to foster diversity in tech development, they create safer spaces for self-expression. Here, feminist lay(wo)men* (To emphasise that the category 'Woman' is constructed and that more people than only those who identify as women are being included, one uses the sign * after the term 'women' ), makers, designers, artists and tinkerers experiment with open-source hardware and software. Art and design projects emerging from feminist hacklabs focus on issues of representation and democratic participation in digital media, as well as on ways of reclaiming one's own body. This article tries to unpack how, after an exhibition on sexual health norms, a feminist hacklab was attacked by local right-wing and conservative politicians. The attack resulted in the defunding of the feminist hacklab. But it also started a transformation process within the collective, as members became aware of critical interferences of diffracting marginalisations. The crisis triggered a discussion on how each member was threatened to very different degrees; for example, there was more at stake for members depending on their legal status in the country. The right-wing and conservative campaign against the feminist hacklab damaged the initiative, but at the same time it pushed the collective to generate increased vehemence and resilience.

AB  - Objectives: To identify elderly inpatients' attitudes toward deprescribing at King Khalid University Hospital and determine the most commonly used polypharmacy drugs. Methods: A cross-sectional study on deprescribing in elderly patients was conducted at Riyadh's King Saud university medical city during January-February/2019. We used the validated Arabic version of the Patient Attitude toward Deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire. Results: One hundred fourteen patients completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 83%. The participants' mean age was 68.9 +/- 7.4. Most were females (54.4%), married (86.8%), and illiterate (42.1%). Despite 63% of the patients feeling that they were taking many medicines, 58.8% of the participants did not perceive a financial burden of medications. The median (range) of comorbidities was 3(6). The cardiovascular and metabolic diseases account for (86.0%) and (79.8%). Patients took a median (range) of 8(12) medications. The most were statins (48.2%), proton pump inhibitor (46.4%), beta-blocker (41.8%), insulin (38.2%), biguanides (35.5%) and Anticoagulants (22.7). Overall, 87.7% would like to some of their drugs if their physicians allow it, although 80.7% reported satisfication with their drugs. The positive attitude towards deprescribing) accounted for 48.2%. It was higher among those younger 80, p<0.05. Also, the illiterate scored higher median than other educational groups on the burden factor subscale, p<0.01. Conclusion: The majority of elderly patients are willing to deprescribe when it is appropriate. We recommend the utilization of clinical pharmacists' expertise to simplify the polypharmacy for patients. Further studies should be held to obtain more evidence to initiate the deprescribing process.

AB  - Background: Globally, depression is the fourth leading cause of mental illness and disability among adolescents (15-19 years). This study aimed to assess knowledge and attitude toward depression among adolescents attending secondary schools. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study among 257 adolescents attending secondary schools in an urban area of Lagos State. Multistage sampling technique was used to identify appropriate schools, and a semi-structured self-administered questionnaire that contained a vignette depicting depression was used to collect data. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Results: Overall, 257 students participated in the study. The mean age was 15.8 +/- 1.3 years. Majority (91.5%) had prior knowledge about depression. The most common sources of information were from school (38.9%), family and friends (23.3%), and social media (20.6%). Majority (87.9%) correctly recognized depression in the vignette. Attempted suicide and social withdrawal from friends (71% and 67.3%, respectively) were less recognized as symptoms of depression. Similarly, only 36.2% recognized depression as a real medical condition. Students in science (76.9%) had better knowledge about depression than students in arts (43.5%) and commerce (43.8%) (P = 0.006). The teacher was considered as the primary access to care compared to the need for specialized care. Majority of the respondents had positive attitudes toward depression and 75.4% believed that people with depression should not be stigmatized. Conclusion: This study showed important gaps in knowledge of causes, symptoms, and the need for professional or psychiatric care of depression. It highlights the need to promote mental health literacy in schools.

AB  - Objective. Our aim was to (1) survey public' perception and attitudes toward organ donation and (2) analyze the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to donate.
   Methods. We developed a questionnaire, and conducted the survey with stratified random sampling. Overall, 600 residents, aged >= 18 who resided in Hunan, and 600 undergraduates from 3 universities in Hunan were surveyed randomly. For this study, 1085 valid questionnaires were completed, with a response rate of 90.4%.
   Results. Of the 1085 participants, 581 (53.5%) were students, 504 (46.5%) were residents, and 519 (47.8%) were male and 566 (52.2%) female. The mean accuracy rate was 71.96%, and the students' mean accuracy rate was slightly higher than that of the resident population (73.06% vs 70.68%, respectively). The results showed that 82.2% of public support organ donation, and 53.5% were willing to donate their organs after death. Students scored higher than the residents (88% vs 75.6% and 55.6% vs 51.2%). Nearly 1.8% felt that organ donation was against their religion, 14.9% thought it was important to ensure the integrity of the body, 71.7% agreed that organ donation allowed a positive outcome after a person's death, and 61.5% agreed that organ donation represented a continuation of life, to help families cope with grief. Age and gender were related to attitudes. Public knowledge of organ donation and their attitudes were correlated positively (r = 0.666).
   Conclusions. Public knowledge of organ donation is poor, biased, and incomplete, and based on television, movies, and communication networks. Positive attitudes toward donation displayed in the surveys were not matched by actual organ donation.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the influence of poor health on job-search behavior and re-employment, and the mediating role of job-search cognitions and coping resources. Methods A prospective study was conducted among unemployed persons receiving social security benefits in the Netherlands (n = 510). Self-rated health, self-esteem, mastery, job-search cognitions, and the intention to search for a job were measured at baseline. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate determinants of job-search behavior during a follow-up period of 6 months. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to investigate the influence of health, job-search cognitions and coping resources on re-employment during a mean follow-up period of 23 months. Results Persons with poor health were less likely to search for paid employment (OR 0.58, 95 % CI 0.39-0.85) and were also less likely to find paid employment (HR 0.58, 95 % CI 0.39-0.89). Persons with a positive attitude toward job-search, high perceived social pressure to look for a job, high job-search self-efficacy and high job-search intention were more likely to search actively and also to actually find paid employment. Adjustment for job-search cognitions and coping reduced the influence of health on active search behavior by 50 % and on re-employment by 33 %. Conclusions Health-related differences in job-search behavior and re-employment can be partly explained by differences in coping, job-search attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norms towards job-search behavior. Measures to reduce the negative impact of poor health on re-employment should address the interplay of health with job-search cognitions and coping resources.

AB  - Previous literature has proposed that successful adoption measures involve positive attitudes regarding using technology, high levels of technological self-efficacy beliefs, low levels of perceived complexity, and high levels of perceived relative advantage. The purpose of this study is to investigate these antecedents of technology adoption among national team Canadian coaches. Twenty-five current and retired Summer and Winter Canadian national team coaches participated in this investigation. They completed four questionnaires: a general information form, the Affinity for Technology Interaction Scale (ATI), the Computer Self-Efficacy Measure (CSEM), and the Perceived Relative Advantage and Perceived Complexity Scales (PRA/PCo). Canadian national team coaches who responded were found to have a moderate affinity for technology when engaging with technology in their coaching practice. They also reported to have very high self-efficacy when it comes to using technology. They were shown to have a moderately high conviction in their ability to use technology. Coaches also viewed technology as giving them a high relative advantage over not using technology. Finally, they generally viewed technology as not very complex to operate. Most Canadian national team coaches who responded showed favourable views regarding using technology, had belief in their ability, and seemed capable of overcoming challenges in using technology. Future investigations should also identify elite coaches who do not use innovations and focus on sport specific challenges in adopting or implementing technology, as well as identifying barriers coaches face when acquiring or using new technology.

AB  - Many patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) experience difficulties in empathizing with others and are sensitive to social exclusion. Accordingly, the authors developed a novel Social Interaction Empathy Task to examine empathy for physical and psychological pain from first-and third-person perspectives. Fifty female patients with BPD and forty-eight controls matched for age and gender were included. Alexithymia was also measured. Patients with BPD rated neutral and psychologically painful situations as more painful than healthy controls, and patients with BPD rated psychological pain as more intense in the first-person perspective than in the third-person perspective. In contrast, controls did not differentiate between the perspectives and rated physical pain as most intense. The impact of early adversity on empathy for psychological pain was mediated by alexithymia. Increased sensitivity for psychological pain in BPD correlated with symptom severity. BPD is associated with altered empathy for pain, which is related to difficulties in reflecting emotional states.

AB  - Background: Our study aimed to describe themes of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines, race, and ethnicity to explore the context of the intersection of these topics on Twitter. Methods: We utilized Twitter's Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect a random 1% sample of publicly available tweets from October 2020 to January 2021. The study team conducted a qualitative content analysis from the full data set of 1110 tweets. Results: The tweets revealed vaccine support through vaccine affirmation, advocacy through reproach, a need for a vaccine, COVID-19 and racism, vaccine development and efficacy, racist vaccine humor, and news updates. Vaccine opposition was demonstrated through direct opposition, vaccine hesitancy, and adverse reactions. Conspiracy and misinformation included scientific misinformation, political misinformation, beliefs about immunity and protective behaviors, and race extermination conspiracy. Equity and access focused on overcoming history of medical racism, pointing out health disparities, and facilitators to vaccine access. Representation touted pride in development and role models, and politics discussed the role of politics in vaccines and international politics. Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that Twitter can provide nuances about multiple viewpoints on the vaccine related to race and ethnicity and can be beneficial in contributing to insights for public health messaging.

AB  - This article analyses some ways in which racialising discourses around refugees interact with the spatial and social dynamics of marketised schooling. It identifies conflicting discourses that contribute to the polarisation of school social composition and resourcing in the Australian state of Victoria. Media narratives around 'ethnic' gangs contribute to wider discourses surrounding working-class neighbourhoods and schools as dangerous and violent 'hotspots'. At the same time, some elite private schools discursively produce themselves as providing a ladder of opportunity for talented and deserving refugee youth, offering volunteer tutoring and scholarships. These discourses work together to legitimate the funding of socially exclusive sites at twice the rate of the schools that cater to virtually all refugee-background students. The article draws on critical discourse analysis, based on media reporting on refugees, and interviews with parents selecting a secondary school for their children. The findings have implications for the management of school choice as a policy framework, suggesting that its exclusionary effects are heightened in the context of intense media and political attention to refugees as racialised subjects.

AB  - General Medicine Practitioners (GPs) are often the first point of contact for advice and management in cases of dental related pain. The reasons for presentation to the General Practitioners, rather than the dentist, include non-classic presentation of dento-facial pain, lack of coordinated after hours dental care, poor patient education, patients' prescription of their GP as the primary coordinator of integrated total health care and financial considerations. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude and awareness of the common oral diseases and to create awareness of the prevailing dental conditions among general practitioners, techniques for better diagnosis, and appropriate management protocols for different dental conditions. A questionnaire study was carried out among 130 General Practitioners in the suburban areas of Nagpur City using an online survey tool. 21 questions related to dental or denture-related problems and benign and malignant disease were presented in the questionnaire. The doctors have spent an average of 5 minutes to finish the survey. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Out of 130 General Practitioners 71 were well versed about plaque and calculus, whereas 86% felt that referral of the patient to a dentist is the more appropriate way to treat a dental abscess. The results of the study show that general practitioners had good dental knowledge. They were well aware about most of the dental conditions, along with the various oral manifestations of systemic diseases, and life threatening conditions. It is essential that the general practitioners should keep their knowledge updated with time. Oral health education can be included in the medical curriculum to emphasize a positive attitude towards oral health.

AB  - The response of churches to the challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic invites a closer examination of the relationships between virtual and embodied religious communities during a time of social distancing. The speed and the scale of the closure of church buildings during Easter 2020 sheds light upon the multiplicity of practical, emotional, and spiritual responses to a relationship between church and people that is increasingly dominated by online interactions. Such a seismic shift in social culture opens up the possibility and challenges of a new understanding of belonging and participation in a religious community. Given its liturgical, pastoral, and sacramental significance, Easter 2020 was a highly charged moment for the relationship between the Christian churches and the faithful, and between religious worship and social media. In the shift from embodied community to virtual congregation that followed, the material absence of physical presence in collective worship was striking, as was the psychological presence of that absence. This paper analyses different understandings of religion, church, and community in the period of a pandemic, and argues for the value of an approach that situates the debates spawned in the context of historical precedent, personal experience, and theoretical approaches to networks, communities, religion, and social media.

AB  - The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) originated in China at the end of 2019, the virus festered there for four months before spreading globally. Impacting the developed and developing world including Indonesia. It has transformed social, economic and political practices social life, everyday habits and government policies, with multi-dimensional consequences on human life. The present study endeavours to explore the relationship between religiosity, social capital, and psychological well-being of the general public, particularly in terms of coping with the pandemic. In addition to this, the study aims to highlight the importance of public awareness regarding social distancing, use of religion as a coping mechanism, and living a healthy lifestyle during pandemic. For knowing the perception of the masses, an online survey by using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out among coronavirus patients, the general public, social media activists, students, and professionals across Indonesia. The findings indicate that the pandemic has altered the lifestyle of the masses in different ways and that people have varied perceptions towards this virus regarding its spread and preventive measures. The study also reveals that, social capital (beta = .418, p < .001), psychological well-being (beta = .343, p < .001), and religious coping (beta = .145, p <. 01) have a significant amount of the variance of coronavirus situational stress (F = 69.77, p < .001, R2 = 0.485). Lastly, the study suggests that, adopting preventative measures, standard operating procedures that are sustainable and healthy forms of coping with the pandemic will be equally as important as medical care in order to contain and eventually eradicate the virus.

AB  - This study focuses on the process of the integration of Arab Muslim Israelis suffering from mental disorders into the normative community, addressing perspectives of both people with mental disorders and the community. This qualitative-constructivist study seeks to understand the dynamics of face-to-face meetings by highlighting the participants' points of view. The main themes of the findings included stereotypes and prejudices, gender discrimination, and the effect of face-to-face meetings on integration of people with mental disorders (PMD) into the community. The findings support former studies about the integration of PMD into the normative community, but add a unique finding that females suffer from double discrimination: both as women in a conservative society and as PMD. The study findings indicate a perception of lack of self-efficacy of PMD as a key barrier preventing integration into the community, which also prevents community members and counselors from accepting them or treating them as equals. We recommend on a social marketing campaign to be undertaken with the Arab Muslim community to refute stigmas and prejudices, particulary with double gender discrimination suffered by women with mental disorders in the Muslim community and training of community center counselors who have contact with the PMD population.

AB  - "Mental travel" is a cognitive concept embodying the human capacity to intentionally disengage from the here and now, and mentally experience the world from different perspectives. We explored how individuals mentally "travel" to the point of view (POV) of other people in varying levels of personal closeness and from these perspectives process these people's social network. Under fMRI, participants were asked to "project" themselves to the POVs of four different people: a close other, a non-close other, a famous-person, and their own-self, and rate the level of affiliation (closeness) to different individuals in the respective social network. Participants were always faster making judgments from their own POV compared with other POVs (self-projection effect) and for people who were personally closer to their adopted POV (social-distance effect). Brain activity at the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the self-POV was higher, compared with all other conditions. Activity at the right temporoparietal junction and medial parietal cortex was found to distinguish between the personally related (self, close, and nonclose others) and unrelated (famous-person) people. No difference was found between mental travel to the POVs of close and nonclose others. Regardless of POV, the precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction distinguished between close and distant individuals within the different social networks. Representational similarity analysis implicated the left retrosplenial cortex as crucial for social distance processing across all POVs. These distinctions suggest several constraints regarding our ability to adopt others' POV and process not only ours but also other people's social networks and stress the importance of proximity in social cognition.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mental-travel, the ability to mentally imagine oneself in a different place and time, is a fundamental cognitive concept. Investigation of mental-travel in the social domain under fMRI revealed that a network of brain regions, largely overlapping the default-mode-network, is responsible for "traveling" to points of view of different others; moreover, this network distinguishes between closer and less-close others, suggesting that mental-travel is a rich dynamical process, encompassing individuals in different proximities and these individuals' social network.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to investigate: (1) the characteristics of people using, or had previously used, assistance animals within community living in Australia; (2) positive and/or negative experiences of these users; and (3) educational resources that may aid public awareness. Materials and methods An online survey was distributed through Australian assistance animal organisations and social media channels. Past/current assistance animal users (n = 112) responded to questions on demographic and types of animal supports used, experience of assistance animal use, community attitudes experienced, and perspectives about the need for public education. Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Content analysis provided additional insights of the positive and/or negative experiences assistance animal users had faced. Results Nearly all participants used an assistance dog (n = 111), and 37 (33%) used the animal for more than one type of support. Seventy percent reported experiencing both positive and negative community attitudes/reactions. Length of time of having an assistance animal was associated with significantly higher prevalence of positive attitudes/reactions, whilst users who received medical support from the animal tended to experience more negative community attitudes/reactions than other users. The majority (90%) agreed that more public education is needed regarding assistance animal public access rights. Conclusions This study is the first in Australia to undertake a large-scale survey of assistance animal users with a range of disability types. It highlights the benefits and challenges of assistance animals, which could be useful to consider when determining the most appropriate support for an individual.

AB  - Depression, depression stigma, and attitude toward psychiatric help are associated factors of suicide in adolescents. As parents are the main decision-makers of receiving professional help for their children's depression and suicide, parental factors influencing their children's suicide should be examined. Moreover, parents' help-seeking attitude for their own mental health problems could affect their children's mental health problems. Therefore, this study examined the serial mediation of adolescents' depression, depression stigma, and attitude toward psychiatric help in the relationship between parental attitude toward psychiatric help and the suicidal ideation of their children, using data of 103 parent-child pairs. A cross-sectional study was conducted by employing a self-administered survey. A serial mediation analysis was performed using Amos 25.0. Parental attitude toward psychiatric help directly and indirectly influenced children's suicidal ideation. Children's depression stigma, attitude toward psychiatric help, and depression mediated the relationship of parental attitude toward psychiatric help and their children's suicidal ideation. When parents have a more positive attitude toward psychiatric help, their children's suicidal ideation become more decreased. Enhancing only parental attitude toward psychiatric help may make a positive change on their children's suicidal ideation. The study findings imply that when developing and applying youth suicide prevention programs, how parents affect their children's suicidal ideation should be considered as well as adolescents' depression stigma, attitude toward psychiatric help, and depression. Given the results of this study, healthcare providers may better evaluate the effectiveness of their intervention programs for preventing adolescents' suicide.

TI  - Health Care Professionals as Relatives in Organ Donation Interviews: Analysis of the Important Role of Health Care Professionals as Family Members
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - Introduction. The organ and tissue donation interview is a vital step in obtaining the donation. Therefore, it is important to obtain as much information as possible regarding the relatives of the potential donor prior to this interview and know if there is a health care professional among the relatives who may act as an interlocutor. Objective. The objective of this study is to assess the influence that relatives who are health care professionals may have if present at the interview for the organ and tissue donation request. Methods. This is a descriptive study of all the organ donations from 1996 to 2019. Variables of the interview record form were completed by the Regional Transplant Coordination Office. Quantitative variables are expressed as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range), and qualitative variables are expressed in percentage. The c2 test was used for inferential statistics. Results. Health care professionals were present as interlocutors in 8.4% of the total interviews conducted (9279). Organ donation was accepted in 86% of these interviews, while the relative who was a health care professional gave a 93.8% (729) positive response to the donation. Having a health care professional as an interlocutor favors the acceptance of the donation (odds ratio 9.325, 95% confidence interval: 5.05417.205; P < .001). Conclusion.

AB  - Purpose Based on social exchange theory and the substitutes for leadership theory, this paper aims to investigate whether an organization's high-commitment HRM strategy can substitute for the effect of servant leadership in promoting employees' affective commitment, psychological empowerment and intent to remain with the organization. Design/methodology/approach This study's hypotheses were tested with moderation and mediation analyses conducted on a sample of 172 Chinese employees. Findings The results show significant negative interaction effects between high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership, such that high levels of one will reduce the positive effect of the other on affective commitment and psychological empowerment. Further, the effects of high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership on turnover intentions are mediated through affective commitment and psychological empowerment. Finally, support was found for a mediated moderation model where the negative interaction effect between high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership on turnover intentions is mediated through affective commitment. Practical implications - The results of this study can help practitioners identify alternative means to influence employees' positive attitudes and work motivation when implementing high-commitment HRM systems is not feasible for the organization. Originality/value This study contributes to the leadership literature by providing evidence supporting the substitutes for leadership theory and describing the specific conditions under which this theory is valid, as well as contributing to the HRM literature by examining the dynamic interaction of HRM and leadership.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Demographers are increasingly interested in connecting demographic behaviour and trends with 'soft' measures, i.e., complementary information on attitudes, values, feelings, and intentions.
   OBJECTIVE
   The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how computational linguistic techniques can be used to explore opinions and semantic orientations related to parenthood.
   METHODS
   In this article we scrutinize about three million filtered Italian tweets from 2014. First, we implement a methodological framework relying on Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, which is used to extract sentiments. We then run a supervised machine-learning experiment on the overall dataset, based on the annotated set of tweets from the previous stage. Consequently, we infer to what extent social media users report negative or positive affect on topics relevant to the fertility domain.
   RESULTS
   Parents express a generally positive attitude towards being and becoming parents, but they are also fearful, surprised, and sad. They also have quite negative sentiments about their children's future, politics, fertility, and parental behaviour. By exploiting geographical information from tweets we find a significant correlation between the prevalence of positive sentiments about parenthood and macro-regional indicators of both life satisfaction and fertility level.
   CONTRIBUTION
   We show how tweets can be used to represent soft measures such as attitudes, values, and feelings, and we establish how they relate to demographic features. Linguistic analysis of social media data provides a middle ground between qualitative studies and more standard quantitative approaches.

AB  - In the international context of efforts to combat the stigmatization of people with mental health problems, representations and attitudes about these illnesses have not to date been widely investigated in France. However, new technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to collect such information on a large scale and to deploy more efficient action against stigma.
   Objectives. - The Crazy'App survey was designed as an instrument for studying potentially stigmatizing representations and attitudes towards mental disorders. It asks respondents to react, rather than to standard diagnostic labels or case vignettes, to video testimonies by people with different mental disorders talking about their experiences.
   Methods. - The web survey was made available on smartphone or computer and advertised on various media and during a French exhibition about mental disorders, mental health and well-being ("Mental Desordre", Cite des sciences, Paris, 2016). It consisted of short (<2 min) video testimonials by four people presenting respectively anorexia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction to alcohol. Each testimony was immediately followed by series of questions to which participants were to respond using visual analog scales. The questionnaires investigated different domains, such as the causes of each of these mental disorders, the possible treatments and the respondent's personal attitudes in hypothetical situations (e.g. working with the person seen in the video). After having completed the survey, respondents were offered an opportunity to compare their own responses to those of the other respondents, and watch expert psychiatrists interviews delivering clinical and scientific knowledge and sharing their own attitudes.
   Results. - The respondents (n = 2600) were young, mostly women, educated and concerned about the subject. They exhibited good knowledge of the disorders. They reported a multi-causal view of the etiologies, where psychological causes were rated higher than neurobiological causes (although less so for respondents reporting having had a mental disorder themselves), while other types of causes (environmental, spiritual, and nutritional) received much lower ratings. Respondents also expressed high potential social proximity, but this result varied according to the type of disorder, in particular, the social distance and the perception of dangerousness were greater for addiction and bipolar disorder.
   Conclusions. - Crazy'App operationalizes emerging strategies in the efforts to combat stigma, implementing what is known as a "contact based intervention" in English-speaking countries. While it does not erase the differences in attitudes observed from one pathology to another, this type of survey -intervention based on video testimonies could help to reduce the desire for social distancing from people with mental disorders, even in a particularly sensitized and informed population. Multimedia technologies are an efficient way to offer rich, potentially interactive content better able to embody people and their actual experiences than clinical descriptions or even life narratives. However the use of videos could put the focus on the individual characteristics (physical, gestural, verbal, nonverbal. . .), and this should be cautiously taken into account according to the anti-stigma objectives. Connected technologies also make it possible to enhance the more classic de-stigmatization actions focused on the deconstruction of preconceived ideas, making the action more participatory, while simultaneously assessing their efficacy. By mediating contact with individuals and behaviors perceived as deviant, the aim would be to develop psycho-social skills and concrete abilities for action in the general population, to include people with mental disorders in the community.

AB  - Background: Stigmatizing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking are important barriers for people with mental health problems to obtain adequate professional help. This study aimed to examine: (1) population attitudes toward depression and toward seeking professional help in four European countries; (2) the relation between depression stigma and attitudes toward help-seeking; (3) the relation between both attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics; and (4) differences in attitudes across countries.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (n=4011) was conducted in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal, assessing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking, and a number of socio-demographic variables.
   Results: Respondents showed a moderate degree of personal stigma toward depression and a strikingly higher degree of perceived stigma. Although a substantial majority showed openness to seek professional help, only half of the people perceived professional help as valuable. More negative attitudes were found in Hungary and were associated with male gender, older age, lower educational level and living alone. Also, personal stigma was related to less openness to and less perceived value of professional treatment.
   Limitations: The survey was cross-sectional, so no causal inferences could be drawn.
   Conclusions: Personal and perceived stigma toward depression deserves public health attention, since they impact upon the intention of people with depression to seek professional help. Public media campaigns should focus on the credibility of the mental health care sector, and target males, older people, and those with a lower educational level and living alone. The content of each campaign should be adapted to the cultural norms of the country for which it is intended. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sentiment analysis techniques have a long history in natural language processing and have become a standard tool in the analysis of political texts, promising a conceptually straightforward automated method of extracting meaning from textual data by scoring documents on a scale from positive to negative. However, while these kinds of sentiment scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the document's stance with respect to a given target-how positively or negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group-as this reflects the author's underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document's sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in the data and leading to faulty conclusions.

AB  - Social distancing is the core policy response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state's social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state's own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the "loss from anarchy" in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers. These results suggest a substantial cost of uncoordinated government responses to COVID-19 when people, ideas, and media move across borders.

   Design/methodology/approach - This study obtained 221 responses from Indonesian youngsters, which was used to validate the proposed model using structural equation modeling analysis.
   Findings - The direct effect indicated that perceived behavior and social distance attitude were the most significant predictors of intention followed by boredom and place attachment (PA), and the indirect effect of loneliness and social presence. In addition, moderating impact contributed significantly by providing profound knowledge toward the result.
   Originality/value - The combination of PA and personal traits based on the push-pull-mooring framework relating to the virtual third place adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic offered a comprehensive model that has not been explored extensively by previous studies.

AB  - Health promoters who use the mass media to encourage people to change their health behaviours usually underestimate the importance of audience's mental predispositions, which may determine their susceptibility to such influences. This paper presents research findings that show how some elements of an audience's mentality are related to their attitudes towards healthy lifestyle promotion in the mass media (HLPMM). The research project, undertaken between 2007 and 2009, comprised: a qualitative study using in-depth interviews (N=30); a self-administered survey on a purposive sample (N=237) and a computer-assisted personal interview or interviewing (CAPI) survey on a representative sample of Polish adult population (N=934). The findings from the first two studies were used to construct a scale to investigate the attitude towards HLPMM. This scale was applied in a nation wide survey and, as a result, four dimensions of the attitude were identified: (1) appraisal of the idea of HLPMM; (2) appraisal of HLPMM practice; (3) propensity to receive media messages promoting healthy lifestyle and (4) propensity to avoid such messages. Moreover, the survey results confirmed the hypotheses whereby a higher degree of individualism, a higher degree of authoritarianism, a weaker demanding orientation and generalised trust are related to a more positive attitude towards HLPMM. The aforementioned relationships indicate that producers of media messages promoting a healthy lifestyle need to take account of their audience's mentality, since knowledge of mental predispositions of the target audience may help them make the message more suitable for specific recipients.

AB  - In December 2020, we conducted a telephone survey to determine what factors are connected to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among adults in Nevada. The survey was based on factors identified in other studies, such as demographic variables (age, race, ethnicity, gender, household income, urbanicity, educational attainment), health status, previous COVID-19 infections, social media engagement, adherence to social distancing guidelines, beliefs about COVID-19, and political ideology identifications. Using a proportional odds model, we compared vaccine hesitancy levels to determine the odds of being more likely versus unlikely to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Of 1,000 people surveyed, 30.4% exhibited vaccine hesitancy. Findings showed that adults with significantly lower odds of vaccine hesitancy included those who were male, older, worried about COVID-19 infection or its community effects, adhered to social distancing, and reported higher incomes. Adults who identified as African American or Black or as multiple or "other" races exhibited significantly higher odds of vaccine hesitancy than White adults. Adults self-identifying as conservative had significantly higher odds of vaccine hesitancy than others. Vaccine hesitancy levels suggest possible hurdles to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in a state with high visitor volumes and demographics that resemble the country's future as minority White, highlighting possible lessons for future pandemics. Most measures of COVID-19 worry were not significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy, suggesting that vaccination efforts should focus on other motivators. COVID-19 vaccination efforts should also directly encourage uptake by younger and middle-aged adults who are female, African American, have lower incomes, and identify as conservative.

AB  - Electronic communication is emotionally gratifying, but how do such technological distractions impact academic learning? The current study observed 263 middle school, high school and university students studying for 15 min in their homes. Observers noted technologies present and computer windows open in the learning environment prior to studying plus a minute-by-minute assessment of on-task behavior, off-task technology use and open computer windows during studying. A questionnaire assessed study strategies, task-switching preference, technology attitudes, media usage, monthly texting and phone calling, social networking use and grade point average (GPA). Participants averaged less than six minutes on task prior to switching most often due to technological distractions including social media, texting and preference for task-switching. Having a positive attitude toward technology did not affect being on-task during studying. However, those who preferred to task-switch had more distracting technologies available and were more likely to be off-task than others. Also, those who accessed Facebook had lower GPAs than those who avoided it. Finally, students with relatively high use of study strategies were more likely to stay on-task than other students. The educational implications include allowing students short "technology breaks" to reduce distractions and teaching students metacognitive strategies regarding when interruptions negatively impact learning.

We further examined whether internal religious coping and external religious coping mediated both relationships. Results indicated a significant association with religiosity and negative attitudes towards mental health services, as well as external religious coping and internal religious coping. Results also showed a nonsignificant association with both religious coping and negative attitudes towards mental health services. Finally, external religious coping mediated the relationship between religiosity and negative attitudes towards mental health services for men but not for women.

AB  - Aims: Poor academic achievement is strongly related to smoking but studies that examine the mechanism between academic achievement and smoking are lacking. The aim of this study, therefore, was to examine the smoking-related cognitions (i.e. attitude, social influence, self-efficacy and intention to smoke) in relation to academic achievement and determine whether these cognitions explain different patterns of smoking. Methods: The study uses the data of a longitudinal study that was carried out in Finland, and the sample comprised 1,096 students in grades seven to nine. Results: During the seventh-grade students with poor academic achievement reported more positive attitudes to smoking and a greater social influence of their peers regarding smoking, weaker self-efficacy to refuse smoking and more intentions to smoke in the future compared to students with high academic achievement. Moreover, the follow-up analyses after a 24-month interval revealed that sel-fefficacy to refuse smoking of students with poor grades had become weaker compared to students with high grades. Furthermore, the influence of seventh-grade academic achievement predicting ninth-grade weekly smoking was partially mediated through the self-efficacy beliefs and the intention to smoke. Conclusions: Differences in academic achievement may have an impact on adolescents' self-efficacy beliefs and the intention to smoke in the future. To reduce health inequalities a strong input on continuing research to improve smoking prevention methods, especially for students with low academic achievement, is needed.

AB  - Background The U.S. is experiencing an opioid overdose health crisis, largely driven by opioid use disorder (OUD). College students have relatively high rates of substance use disorders. Objectives To identify perceived knowledge of and perceived helpfulness of various OUD treatments, including medications for OUD (MOUD), among college students. Methods A convenience sample of students enrolled at two public universities during Fall 2018/Spring 2019 were recruited for an online cross-sectional survey. Questions examined reported knowledge of and perceived helpfulness of MOUD (i.e. methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) and non-MOUD treatments for OUD (e.g. peer support groups, individual counseling, group counseling, outpatient treatment). Logistic regression examined associations between knowledge, perceived helpfulness, and demographic variables. Results We received 1,439 responses and kept 1,280 (39% male; 61% female). Respondents were significantly more likely to report knowledge about non-MOUD treatments than MOUD treatments (48.7% of respondents reported being very knowledgeable about individual counseling, 4.4% about methadone, 3.8% about naltrexone, and 3.4% about buprenorphine). Among those reporting at least some MOUD knowledge, few perceived MOUD as helpful/very helpful (methadone 14%, naltrexone 14%, and buprenorphine 11%). Among those reporting at least some counseling knowledge, 71% felt counseling was helpful/very helpful. Perceived treatment knowledge was significantly and positively associated with perceived treatment helpfulness. Conclusions Students had more positive attitudes toward non-MOUD treatments than toward MOUD despite greater efficacy of the latter for OUD. Colleges could provide information about MOUD during orientation, in course work, through student extracurricular organizations, or through college health clinics.

AB  - This paper primarily focuses on the family language policy of bilingual Russian-Estonian and Russian-Spanish families in relation to the maintenance of Russian as a heritage language. Its main objective is to identify social factors that either help or hinder this process. In doing so, this paper searches for commonalities and specificities of the mainstream attitudes towards Russian as a heritage language in Estonia and Spain, by analysing the sociolinguistic situation of Russian in both countries and by examining the factors conditioning the maintenance of Russian as a heritage language in family settings. Our research is based on an in-depth analysis of a variety of sources, mainly quantitative statistical and demographic data on self-reported language behaviour and language ideologies in mixed families from Estonia (n = 40) and Spain (n = 40). The main results of our comparative study confirm the general positive attitude towards Russian as a heritage language, but they also highlight an important variability of these attitudes both between countries and within each community. We show that these attitudes directly determine the principles of family language policy, the parents' strategies to transmit Russian as a heritage language, and the level of proficiency in Russian as a heritage language in the second generation. These results allow us to conclude that, as a heritage language, Russian relies on strong attitudinal support in even small communities, like Estonian or Spanish, but also that its confident transmission should rely on external subsidy.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the use patterns and ownership of smartphone apps among students at the Department of Library and Information Science (DLIS) at the South Valley University (SVU), Egypt. This study may help faculty members and students, as well as DLISs in general and SVU's DLIS, in particular, to understand the nature and purpose of such use.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used quantitative research methodology in the form of a survey, which was undertaken from February to March 2015. The survey instrument was a self-administrated questionnaire, with a response rate 82.7 per cent (441/533).
   Findings - The findings of this study showed that smartphone users (82.7 per cent) at SVU's DLIS tended to be junior females. Smartphone non-users (17.3 per cent) tended to be also young females but primarily sophomores. The highest percentage of smartphone users had been using smartphones for four to five years, and the largest number of students was described to be advanced users who heard first about these mobile devices through friends and the Web. Most users had 21 to 25 apps. Social apps were the most popular and included Facebook, e-mail and Twitter. For professional purposes, students used smartphones more for communication purposes than learning purposes. Apps related to educational purposes included Google Mobile, Facebook, e-mail, Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia Mobile. Students perceived most apps to be easy to use and useful to them. There were a number of uses for socializing including messaging, following the news and playing games. Students had mainly positive attitudes towards apps with a few negative concerns. Almost all students confirmed that they trust most apps. Barriers related to the use of apps included training and lack of awareness. Further research may be needed to specify the relationship between the students' use of these apps and their academic performance. The main tasks done on smartphone devices were mainly for socializing. Students indicated that popular tasks and activities, such as sending and receiving messages, following the news, making communications, making chat, making friends, finding specific information, finding general information, making discussion groups, playing games, completing class assignments, checking materials related to courses, doing business, seeking jobs, watching movies, listening to music and accessing library services are important tasks accomplished by them through the use of these devices. The current study indicated very positive attitudes towards the use of these apps. Student at least agree with the statement that smartphone apps allow for easy dissemination of information, provide too much information, increase the speed of finding information, help communication, convenient, secure, build confident and reduce paper use. However, a large number of students also at least agree with the statement that these apps are time consuming, intimidating, addictive, violate privacy, require high language and technical skills, harmful and frustrating. Almost all students confirmed that they are at least trustful in some apps, such as WhatsApp, e-mail, YouTube, Facebook, Flickr, Twitter and Viber. A large number of smartphone users surveyed in this study have been described to make excessive usage of social apps, such as communication apps, messaging/texting apps and social networking sites, which were at the forefront of use. Additionally, a large number of them adopted these devices, especially for communication purposes. The most used apps were Facebook, e-mail, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Viber. For professional purposes, students used smartphones more for communication purposes than learning purposes. However, some of the students were using some of apps related to educational purposes, such as Google mobile, Facebook, e-mail, Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia mobile but not on a regular basis. Students perceived the use of e-mail app, Google mobile, Facebook app WhatsApp, Kik, Twitter, YouTube, Google maps, Viber, Line, Skype, Tango, Instagram, Flickr and Wikipedia mobile as at least fairly easy to them.
   Additionally, they perceived the use of e-mail app Google mobile, WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Viber, Instagram, Wikipedia mobile, Google maps, Kik, Skype, Line, Tango and Flickr as at least fairly useful to them, especially for the purpose socialization more than learning.
   Research limitations/implications - This study focuses only on undergraduate library and information science students belonging to SVU's DLIS, Egypt. Any findings and conclusions resulting from this study are limited in scope to only SVU's DLIS's undergraduate students. The study does not contain a significantly large sample of a population from across Egypt to draw meaningful widespread conclusions indicative of such a larger population.
   Practical implications - This study provides valuable insight into the use pattern of smartphones among a very important client group. It may serve as useful input to researchers who are interested in the study of mobile internet technologies (MITs), particularly in the education society.
   Originality/value - Being the first study of its kind about university students in Egypt, it is considered a pioneering and a unique study among studies conducted in the field of ICTs and MITs, especially with this category of information users.

AB  - Results of radiology imaging studies are not typically comprehensible to patients. With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology in recent years, it is expected that AI technology can aid patients' understanding of radiology imaging data. The aim of this study is to understand patients' perceptions and acceptance of using AI technology to interpret their radiology reports. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 participants to elicit reflections pertaining to the use of AI technology in radiology report interpretation. A thematic analysis approach was employed to analyze the interview data. Participants have a generally positive attitude toward using AI-based systems to comprehend their radiology reports. AI is perceived to be particularly useful in seeking actionable information, confirming the doctor's opinions, and preparing for the consultation. However, we also found various concerns related to the use of AI in this context, such as cyber-security, accuracy, and lack of empathy. Our results highlight the necessity of providing AI explanations to promote people's trust and acceptance of AI. Designers of patient-centered AI systems should employ user-centered design approaches to address patients' concerns. Such systems should also be designed to promote trust and deliver concerning health results in an empathetic manner to optimize the user experience.

AB  - Objectives Following the outbreak of COVID-19, social distancing restrictions limited access to face-to-face mental health services in Western Australia (WA), necessitating a rapid transition to non-face-to-face alternatives, including telehealth. The current study investigated barriers and facilitators to telehealth access and engagement, and preferences for child and youth mental health service delivery during and beyond COVID-19. Methods Three participant groups were recruited via social media and partner organisations, and completed a tailored online survey: i) young people (14-25 years) who had ever accessed or attempted to access mental health support or services (n = 84), ii) parents of young people with a child aged 0-25 years who had ever accessed or attempted to access mental health support or services with or on behalf of their child (n = 68), and iii) professionals working in the child or youth mental health sector (n = 167). Results Regarding barriers to engagement, young people were primarily concerned with the privacy implications of telehealth and its efficacy relative to face-to-face alternatives. Parents and clinicians were more concerned with the technological pitfalls of telehealth (e.g., internet-connectivity, picture/sound issues). Telehealth's accessibility was highlighted as a facilitator for all groups. Although certain participant groups were considered to be more suited to telehealth than others, most participants endorsed a blended approach to the future provision of mental health services. Conclusions To facilitate a blended approach to the delivery of child and youth mental health services, participants recommended more reliable and affordable internet access, implementing funding models that support telehealth delivery, and training for clinical staff.

Many of them have started using digital payments for online or offline transactions to minimize contact with others. This study aims to analyze the continuance intention of the baby boomers and X generation toward the use of digital payments using UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance Technology). Data were collected from 320 users with an age range of 40-74 who had just started using digital payments during this pandemic. Structural equation modeling has been used to analyze the data. The result indicates that UTAUT indicators positively affect user satisfaction. User satisfaction positively affects inertia. Overall satisfaction and inertia positively affect continuance intention. Therefore, digital payment companies and banks with digital services can expand their target market beyond Millennials and pay more attention to the older generation like baby boomers and X generation. Managers can find the results of this study useful and beneficial to develop their marketing strategy and take advantage of this situation to increase digital payment users to a broader age range.

AB  - In the context of ethical consumption, we examine the effects of farmers' facial expression in print advertising on consumers' responses to local food. Furthermore, we try to verify the moderating role of emotional intelligence (EI) on consumers' responses to the advertising message strategy. The advertising message strategy that connects farmers and consumers is expected to create more favorable responses among consumers toward local food and its retailers. This study examines consumers' responses (perceived product quality, trust, and a positive attitude toward the local food retailer) to three conditions of farmers' facial expression in the advertisement (neutral facial expression, positive facial expression, and product only, with no portrait) across two levels of EI (low and high). We find that farmers' positive facial expressions in the advertisements have the greatest positive effects on consumers' perceived product quality, trust, and attitude toward the local food retailer under a high level of EI. Therefore, individuals with a high level of EI were more influenced by facial expressions in print advertising, whereas those with a low level of EI were less influenced by facial expressions in print advertising, and their responses were indifferent to whether the local food farmer had a neutral or a positive facial expression in print advertising. Our findings suggest that marketing practitioners consider personal characteristics such as EI in persuading local food consumers in target markets to implement strategies to promote local food purchase and consumption.

AB  - Embodied cognition research documents the interplay between physical sensations and corresponding psychological experiences within the individual. Accordingly, physical warmth leads to a sense of social inclusion, and being socially rejected leads to physical coldness. In the current research, we demonstrate that these embodied cognition relationships also apply to a media consumer and a media character with whom the consumer identifies. In Study 1, participants (N = 120) read one of four narratives in which we manipulated identification with the protagonist and her social exclusion/inclusion situation. In Study 2 (N = 120), the narrative described the protagonist experiencing coldness/warmth in high/low identification conditions. The findings suggest that when the character experiences either the physical or the psychological state, the identifying consumer consequently experiences either psychological feelings or physical sensations, respectively. We discuss potential limitations of the study and also its contribution to media psychology and to embodied cognition research.

AB  - Problem: Many studies focus on knowledge and attitudes of unaffected people towards epilepsy and people with epilepsy (PWE). The perspective of PWE themselves is much less explored.
   Methods: We invited PWE in Germany to answer a questionnaire on their knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy and PWE.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 230 PWE (median age: 40 years; min./max.: 19/83; 66 % female). Of PWE, 22 % thought that PWE are more helpful, and 10 % thought that PWE are friendlier than other people. Nevertheless, reservations about relationships and friendships with other PWE existed: of the participants, only 74 % would definitely go on a date with another PWE, and 90 % would definitely include another PWE they liked into their circle of friends. Swimming was judged as more dangerous for PWE than for healthy people by 71 % of PWE. Of PWE, 86 % correctly assumed it was not useful to hold a person having a seizure to the ground. Putting a solid object in the mouth was considered not useful by 85 % of PWE. Of PWE, 20 % would definitely administer an available emergency medication if another PWE had a seizure. For 67 % of PWE, certain preconditions should have to be fulfilled such as an available document with instructions. Of PWE, 11 % stated they would not administer an available emergency medication if another PWE had a seizure.
   Conclusion: Although positive attitudes of PWE towards other PWE exist, we also found some reservations calling for psychosocial support. Most PWE had sufficient knowledge about risks of certain activities and about measures to be taken during a seizure. Nevertheless, a small group of PWE showed knowledge gaps. Thus, educational support still seems essential.

AB  - Background/purpose: This study was undertaken to document the knowledge, attitude and behavior among family caregivers, and to identify the related factors influencing their behavior in promoting their and children's oral health.
   Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect self-administered questionnaires from 503 family caregivers, who cared for 6-12 year-old children with disabilities in 10 special schools. Multiple regression models were used to analyze the association between caregiver's oral health behaviors and related factors.
   Results: Most caregivers were female (74.8%). The top three sources of oral health knowledge among caregivers were dentists (66.60%), books (34.59%) and television (31.21%). Comparison of oral health knowledge and attitude scores among different education levels of caregivers yielded statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Eighty-four percent of caregivers cleaned their teeth twice a day and 46.12% used dental floss. More than half of caregivers (60.44%) assisted their children to brush teeth. Only 12.65% took their children to receive fluoride varnish services. Caregivers' favorable oral health behavior was found to be significantly associated with a higher education level, better knowledge and positive attitude. The determining factor of caregivers' preventive behavior was attitude. Education level influenced the caregiver's knowledge. Knowledge is positively associated with attitude.
   Conclusion: Inadequate knowledge is the major factor preventing caregivers from favorable oral health behavior. Oral health related educational programs aimed at promoting caregivers' behavior must take into consideration the caregivers' knowledge level first. Education programs should be recommended to caregivers with a lower education level. (C) 2017 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence of bed-sharing and examine correlates of bed-sharing habits in early adolescents.
   Methods: Participants were 1452 early adolescents from 10 primary schools in Shanghai, China. Children's health status and past history, family environment and parents' attitude towards bed-sharing, and children's sleep arrangements were surveyed. Sleep was assessed by the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire. Tanner stage was determined by the endocrinologist.
   Results: The median of age was 10.83 years (range: 9.42-12.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.79-10.83) and boys accounted for 51.17%. The prevalence of bed-sharing was 16.8%. Positive parental attitude toward bed-sharing (OR: 9.87; 95% CI: 6.57-14.83), asthma (OR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.16-3.98), smaller residential space (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.17-3.09), extended family (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.16-2.18), and being physically less mature (OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.16-4.91) increased the likelihood of bed-sharing. Bed sharers were more likely to have bedtime resistance (OR: 12.20; 95% CI: 8.59-17.33), sleep anxiety (OR: 3.76; 95% CI: 2.74-5.15), and poor sleep quality (OR: 3.21; 95% CI: 2.28-4.81) compared to non-bed-sharers. Furthermore, bed-sharing was associated with daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.10-2.13) but not with sleep duration.
   Conclusions: Bed-sharing is highly prevalent among Chinese early adolescents and is significantly related to sleep quality. Parental positive attitude toward bed-sharing was the most determining factor. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Christchurch attack on March 15, 2019, on two mosques by a white supremacist is marked as a lethal incident in the history of New Zealand. In this deadly attack, at least 5o Muslims were killed and more than 5o got fatal injuries. The oddity found in this attack was that both the shootings, one on mosque Al Noor and the other on Linwood Islamic Centre, were broadcast live on Facebook. Though, the incident sparked a wave of anger throughout the Muslim world. However, that Jacinda Arden the Prime Minister of New Zealand stood in front and showed sympathy with Muslims by assuring them justice. In this way, the primary purpose of this study was to examine the representation and framing of Jacinda Ardern in post-Christchurch attack press coverage in the Muslim country newspapers. The study found that most of the stories related to Jacinda Ardern are found in Daily Dawn Pakistan, New Straits Times of Malaysia, and in the UAE's leading newspaper Khaleej Times. However, the Tehran Times of Iran has given less coverage to Jacinda. Further, findings of the framing of Jacinda Ardern in the Muslim world press after Christchurch's attack showed most of the stories published in the four newspapers have and have framed her neutral and positive. Besides, frames like the icon of peace, anti-racist, Jacindamania, comparison of JA, and anti-Islamophobia are represented higher and paragon of leadership and redefining leadership are framed lowest in the Muslim world press.

AB  - Two experiments evaluated the effects of exposure to pictures of suntanned and untanned fashion models on attitudes regarding the importance of having a tan. In Experiment 1, 128 women were randomly assigned to view images of photographer's models that had been digitally altered to make it appear that the model either did or did not have a tan. Participants who viewed images of the models without a tan expressed significantly less positive attitudes toward tanning than did those who viewed the same models with a tan. In Experiment 2, 169 women were randomly assigned to view advertisements taken from fashion and beauty magazines that contained models who appeared to have suntanned skin, models who appeared not to have a tan, or no models at all. The results demonstrated that participants who viewed ads depicting models with untanned skin expressed less favorable attitudes toward tanning than did those who viewed control ads or those who viewed tan models. Given escalating skincancer rates, it is important to examine the role that media exposure may play in promoting risky behaviors.

AB  - The increasing trend of using new media technologies and particularly social media (SM) among students provides an advantage for lecturers. Apparently their importance accelerated with the application of social distancing during a pandemic crisis such as the one World has been experiencing since the end of 2019. In this article, the stories of two academics are used expressing experiences, motives and perceptions on benefits and challenges of using SM to support teaching and learning in the classroom. The stories which form the data of the research describe how and why the participants started to use SM, their intended purpose and the ways of use. Besides, reasons, difficulties and positive as well as the negative sides are explored. The findings show that the virtual learning environments provided by SM facilitated the development of students' enthusiasm and interaction with peers assertively, thus increasing the students' participation. Because of emerging technologies, SM platforms surge and plummet quickly; therefore, it is important for institutions to either develop their platform or to subscribe to existing ones for effective knowledge sharing at an institutional level with clear ethical rules.

AB  - Background We developed the informed health choices (IHC) primary school resources to teach children how to assess the trustworthiness of claims about the effects of treatments. We evaluated these resources in a randomised trial in Uganda. This paper describes the process evaluation that we conducted alongside this trial.
   Objectives To identify factors affecting the implementation, impact and scaling up of the intervention; and potential adverse and beneficial effects of the intervention.
   Methods All 85 teachers in the 60 schools in the intervention arm of the trial completed a questionnaire after each lesson and at the end of the term. We conducted structured classroom observations at all 60 schools. For interviews and focus groups, we purposively selected six schools. We interviewed district education officers, teachers, head teachers, children and their parents. We used a framework analysis approach to analyse the data.
   Results Most of the participants liked the IHC resources and felt that the content was important. This motivated the teachers and contributed to positive attitudes. Although some teachers started out lacking confidence, many found that the children's enthusiasm for the lessons made them more confident. Nearly everyone interviewed thought that the children learnt something important and many thought that it improved their decision-making. The main barrier to scaling up use of the IHC resources that participants identified was the need to incorporate the lessons into the national curriculum.
   Conclusion The mostly positive findings reflect the trial results, which showed large effects on the children's and the teachers' critical appraisal skills. The main limitations of this evaluation are that the investigators were responsible for both developing and evaluating the intervention.

AB  - Positive attitudes towards the aged and expectations of the ageing process have been recognised as important drivers of healthy ageing. Utilising novel methods previously used to improve attitudes towards older adults, the current article reports the impact of imagined contact with an older adult on expectations of ageing and ageing anxiety compared to a control. Two hundred and one undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions; (1) imagined contact with a 75 year old male, (2) imagined contact with a 75 year old female, or (3) a control. Results revealed that imagined contact with either an older male or female was associated with more positive expectations of ageing in male participants, both immediately after the intervention and at a four week follow-up, compared to the control. No such results were found for female participants. Among male participants, the relationship between imagined intergenerational contact and expectations of ageing was mediated by ageing anxiety, indicating that males in the imagined contact conditions experienced significantly better expectations of ageing through reduced anxiety about ageing, compared to the control. No indirect effect of ageing anxiety on the relationship between imagined intergenerational contact and expectations of ageing was found for female participants. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research will be discussed. Overall, the findings of the current study suggest that imagined contact may be an efficacious alternative for decreasing ageing anxiety and for producing more positive expectations of ageing when the opportunity for direct contact is unavailable.

AB  - In lay perception, dirty work is a type of labor that degrades human dignity. Work can be perceived as dirty on three bases: social (related to the subordinate position or associated with contact with stigmatized people), physical (related to direct contact with garbage and waste), and moral (related to jobs considered sinful, dubious, or defying social norms). "Dirty" stigma makes workers objects of dehumanization and discrimination, in particular, people distance themselves from dirty workers and are not ready to help and support them. In the experimental study (N = 340), we investigated how certain types of dirty workers are dehumanized compared to nondirty workers and the indirect effect of the type of dirty work on attitudes toward the social support of dirty workers via animalistic (attribution of uniquely human traits) and the mechanistic (attribution of human nature traits) dehumanization. The results show that individuals are willing to offer more social support to a low status but not dirty worker rather than to social or moral dirty workers. At the same time, less social support is provided to nondirty than to physical dirty worker. Animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization mediates the relationship between the types of dirty work and the attitudes toward social support. In particular, less dehumanization leads to more positive attitudes toward social support. The limitations and future directions of the obtained results are discussed.

AB  - BackgroundOrgan donation is a life-saving process for patients suffering from an advanced organ failure.A disparity between donated organs and required organs for transplantation is one of the major problems in Iran. Since personal attitudes about organ donation is a main factor influencing willingness to donate organ, the present study sought to provide a deeper understanding of the attitudes of university students in Iran regarding organ donation.MethodsThis qualitative study was conducted in 2016. Semi-structured interviews were held for collecting data from eighty five students from various universities in Hamadan city, Iran. Using a purposive sampling method, the students were selected based on the maximum variation. The content analysis method was used for data analysis by the research team and criteria for the study's rigor was considered.ResultsOverall, the students had positive attitudes toward organ donation by brain-dead patients. Nevertheless, not of them stated that they would become an organ donor. During the data analysis, 376 primary codes, 13 categories, and 6 themes were developed. Themes were cognitive readiness, mediators of decision making, beliefs and motivations, interactions with the health system, dependency, and integrity of the body. Also, thirteen sub-themes were developed.ConclusionMany factors influence the students' attitudes toward organ donation. Identification and explanation of these factors can help healthcare managers and policymakers for planning and improving the organ donation culture in the society.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of social media use among students, and the way in which it affects their performance and attitude when used in the classroom in Saudi Arabia. The study explores students' attitudes to using social media to perform activities in the classroom and in their future careers.
   Design/methodology/approach - A convergent mixed methods design was adopted, administering an online survey to a sample of 622 university students and conducting interviews with 20 students.
   Findings - The results revealed that the relationship between the level of a student's social media usage and GPA (Grade Point Average) was negatively correlated. Moreover, the students with a high level of social media usage generally reported a highly positive attitude towards using social media in classroom activities. Finally, the students' level of social media usage was found to predict their attitude towards performing classroom activities using social media.
   Research limitations/implications - This study has implications for both theory and practice. For example, the findings confirm the ways in which social media are deployed, according to uses and gratification theory. In particular, social media are used by Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University students for escapism, social integration and interaction, establishing personal identity, and meeting affective and cognitive needs. Meanwhile, the theoretical implications of this study are that new dimensions and social media terms can be added to the assumptions of uses and gratification theory. For example, virtual tolerance corresponds to escapism, virtual communication corresponds to integration and social interaction, virtual problems can be matched with personal identity and affective needs, and virtual information corresponds to cognitive needs.
   Practical implications - On a practical level, the results could be useful for students, teachers, educational policymakers and society. The results would show students how high social media usage could have a negative impact on their performance. Therefore, they should control their usage by managing their time, for example, via time management apps, if necessary. In particular, students could use social media in their learning and to develop their skills. A positive attitude among students, with regard to using social media in classroom activities, should correspondingly increase teachers' use of social media in the teaching process. This implies the expected benefits for teachers of using social media to teach and communicate with students. In addition, policymakers need to use social media as a means of reaching those population segments who display high social media usage, and who are unlikely to use traditional media to connect with those who formulate policy.
   Social implications - It is important to consider that high levels of social media use have a tendency to affect users' health, causing neck and back pain and psychological issues, for example, stress and depression. This points to a pressing need for society's institutions to raise public awareness of the disadvantages of high social media usage.
   Originality/value - This study could serve as a useful source of information for faculty members seeking to integrate social media into their curricula. It could also encourage students to activate social media in their learning and communication with teachers and peers, while at the same time reducing their non-academic social media usage. This study provides a scale for measuring students' social media usage and attitudes to undertaking classroom activities via social media in the Saudi context. The scale is validated through adaptation of the scales developed by Sahin (2018) and Kitchakarn (2016).

AB  - How do people form their political beliefs? In an effort to address this question, we adopt a neuropsychological approach. In a natural experiment, we explored links between neuroanatomy and ideological preferences in two samples of brain lesion patients in New York City. Specifically, we compared the political orientations of patients with frontal lobe lesions, patients with amygdala lesions and healthy control subjects. Lesion type classification analyses revealed that people with frontal lesions held more conservative (or less liberal) beliefs than those with anterior temporal lobe lesions or no lesions. Additional analyses predicting ideology by extent of damage provided convergent evidence that greater damage in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-but not the amygdala-was associated with greater conservatism. These findings were robust to model specifications that adjusted for demographic, mood, and affect-related variables. Although measures of executive function failed to mediate the relationship between frontal lesions and ideology, our findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex may play a role in promoting the development of liberal ideology. Our approach suggests useful directions for future work to address the issue of whether biological developments precede political attitudes or vice versa-or both. This article is part of the theme issue 'The political brain: neurocognitive and computational mechanisms'.

AB  - Background People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) from low income diverse communities are experiencing the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic most acutely. Method To better understand the impacts of the pandemic on the wellbeing of adults with IDD from an urban US region and how they are managing the associated disruptions, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 14 participants. A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze data. Results Participants experienced stress in response to pandemic media reports and attempted to cope by sanitizing and wearing masks. These did little to reduce stress and may have added to frustration with non-compliers. Social distancing limited access to family, leading to isolation. Participants who engaged in spiritual practices, physical fitness and creative activities were more successful in coping. Conclusions People with IDD may benefit from mindfulness practices or developing creative hobbies to be better equipped to cope.

AB  - Uncertainty, fear, and distress have become prevalent in the lives of U.S. residents since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unpredictable reality of social distancing, shutdowns, and isolation have affected daily routines and influenced well-being and health. Drawing on consumer culture theory, we conducted an exploratory study to examine the mediating role of consumer spirituality in the subjective well-being of religious Christians during COVID-19 and to discover links between well-being and health outcomes. Participants from the United States (n = 104) were recruited via a Qualtrics' online panel. Findings show that religiosity among Christians enhanced subjective well-being, demonstrating the positive effect of religious beliefs, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, spiritual consumption mediated this relationship, suggesting the importance of possessions to religious expression and subjective well-being. Implications for messaging about health and well-being are discussed.

AB  - BackgroundDigital health technologies are being increasingly developed with the aim of allowing older adults to maintain functional independence throughout the old age, a process known as healthy ageing. Such digital health technologies for healthy ageing are expected to mitigate the socio-economic effects of population ageing and improve the quality of life of older people. However, little is known regarding the views and needs of older people regarding these technologies.AimThe aim of this study was to explore the views, needs and perceptions of community-dwelling older adults regarding the use of digital health technologies for healthy ageing.MethodFace-to-face, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with community-dwelling older adults (median age 79.6 years). The interview process involved both abstract reflections and practical demonstrations. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed according to inductive content analysis.ResultsThree main themes and twelve sub-themes addressing our study aim resulted from the data obtained. The main themes revolved around favorable views and perceptions on technology-assisted living, usability evaluations and ethical considerations.ConclusionsOur study reveals a generally positive attitude towards digital health technologies as participants believed digital tools could positively contribute to improving their overall wellbeing, especially if designed in a patient-centered manner. Safety concerns and ethical issues related to privacy, empowerment and lack of human contact were also addressed by participants as key considerations.

AB  - Biodiversity is in worldwide decline and it is becoming increasingly important to expand biodiversity awareness and achieve broad-based support for conservation. We introduce the concept of species literacy, as knowledge about species can be a good starting point for engaging people in biodiversity. However, concern has been raised about a general lack of knowledge about native species. We explored species literacy via a species identification test in the Netherlands, and we investigated potential drivers of it. The dataset included 3210 general public participants, 602 primary school children aged 9/10, and 938 biodiversity professionals.
   A considerable gap in species literacy was found between professionals and laypeople. Knowledge about common, native animals was particularly low in children, who on average identified only 35% of the species correctly. Mammals received relatively high identification scores as compared to birds. Laypeople's species literacy increased with age and educational level, and was associated with positive attitudes towards nature and animals, media exposure and having a garden.
   The results indicate that a considerable part of the Dutch lay public is disconnected from native biodiversity. This points to a separation between people and nature that could hinder future efforts to preserve biodiversity. Our assessment can help bridge the gap between laypeople and professionals, as it can help set up communication and education strategies about native biodiversity that fit prior knowledge.

AB  - With the accelerating industrialization of 5G-V2X and smart automobiles, the intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) integrated with sophisticated communication, caching, computing, and control techniques enhance the functionality of in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) and also provide more powerful telematic or entertainment choices in vehicular environment. The diverse needs of ICV users (e.g., drivers and passengers) can be satisfied during commuting and traveling. However, considering the limitations of transportation environment, the potential attitude and usage behavior for the upcoming ICV infotainment directly impacts on the traffic and road safety in sustainable cities. In this paper, we conduct an online and offline survey to investigate the key factors influencing the user attitude and intention of ICV infotainment, where the answers of a total of 502 valid respondents (i.e., IVI users) are collected in China. A conceptual technology acceptance model with the constructs of perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), social influence (SI), consumer innovation (CI), and perceived risk (PR) is established, and then assessed via partial least square structural equation modeling. We find that the constructs of PU, PEOU, CI, and SI have a direct impact on attitude and usage intention, of which 46.8% and 73.4% of variance, respectively, are explained. The respondents show positive attitudes and higher usage intention towards the ICV infotainment. Although PR has insignificant path with attitude and intention, the driving experience moderation effect exists between PR and usage intention. We can see that ICV infotainment will become a trend in future transportation scenario. Through this survey, reference for traffic safety and usage norms will be provided to reduce the risky of public health issues (e.g., traffic accidents) in the context of ICV infotainment.</p>

AB  - Drones, a small aviation craft that can hold sensors and be directed to certain locations, have been explored and utilized in domains such as public safety, traffic monitoring, and healthcare. Yet, the scientific research of drone usage still in progress. This article investigates the following: (1) how the public perceives a drone as a healthcare tool, and (2) what the concerns are of public acceptance of drones in healthcare. A qualitative approach with demographic questions such as participants' age, education level, current knowledge of drones, as well as willingness to learn about the technology was used. The contribution is to have an understanding of how the public perceives drones. The results can be used in enhancing public views of drones through skilled personnel and an educated workforce. In a conservative community such as Saudi Arabia, the public holds a relatively positive attitude towards drones. Respondents are aware of such technology from different sources, mainly TV news. Informants also did show a decent level of perceived beneficial usage of drones in healthcare. There are few participants who disclosed concerns of safety, security, and privacy for the usage of drones in healthcare due to a lack of knowledge about the technology. The results propose that government and industry stakeholders should invest more in increasing public awareness of technology. Media coverage will likely influence the public view and help the community move forward.

AB  - Objective: Cervical cancer is known to impair women's sexual function. This study aimed at investigating the attitudes and behavior of radiation oncologists regarding sexual functioning of female cervical cancer patients who receive radiation therapy.
   Methods: A total of 186 radiation oncologists were included. A self-reported questionnaire was used to investigate the attitudes and behavior of radiation oncologists. The oncologists were queried on their history of consultation on sexual issues, attitudes, and behavior toward sexual issues and considerations of sexual life for cervical cancer patients who receive radiotherapy.
   Results: Among 120 radiation oncologists who completed the questionnaires, 101 (84.2%) had been consulted on sexual issues, of whom only 29 (24.2%) were consulted by more than 10% of cervical cancer patients who received radiation therapy or their families. Compared with those without a history of consultation, radiation oncologists with a history of consultation were more likely to agree that "radiation oncologists should deal with a patient's sexual issues" (88.1% vs 68.4%) and disagree that "sex is private and should not be interfered with" (66.2% vs 44.5%). Five radiation oncologists (4.2%) had received special training to deal with the sexual issues of cervical cancer patients who receive radiotherapy, and 112 oncologists (93.3%) did not have any information on sexual functioning to give the their patients.
   Conclusions: History of consultation on sexual issues affects radiation oncologists' attitudes and behavior toward sexual issues of cervical cancer patients. Radiation oncologists should have a more positive attitude toward sexual issues and should receive more specific relevant training.

AB  - Encounters between animals and humans in zoos and aquariums are being increasingly enhanced, mediated and extended using digital technologies. This article presents the results of research into the design, use and experience of stereoscopic (3D) 180 degrees film viewed via a Virtual Reality (VR) headset at the zoo. This technology has recently emerged as an affordable consumer device with increasing uptake in education and museums. Drawing on research methodologies from the field of human-computer interaction, this project followed a 'research-through-design' approach, which sought to discover more about the potential of VR technologies in the zoo generally, through the process of designing a particular installation. This paper reports on the results of a qualitative interview-based study into zoo visitor experiences of using a specific VR installation, a 5-min video encounter that combined footage shot inside the little penguin Eudyptula minor enclosure during feeding, and behind-the-scenes preparation of food, with narration by the zookeeper in each scene. It was found that visitors had positive attitudes towards the use of VR video in the zoo as an addition to the experience of seeing live animals. The paper further discusses the specific opportunities for VR video via the key themes that emerged in the qualitative evaluation: cognitive immersion, emotional immersion, physical presence and social presence. This paper therefore supports further investigation of VR video as a form of visitor experience to be deployed alongside keeper talks, animal presentations and behind-the-scenes experiences, with clear opportunities for positive visitor experience, conservation caring, and ensuring the welfare of animals in captivity in zoos.

AB  - The Anatomy Learning Experiences Questionnaire (ALEQ) was designed by Smith and Mathias to explore students' perceptions and experiences of learning anatomy. In this study, the psychometric properties of a slightly altered 34-item ALEQ (ALEQ-34) were evaluated, and correlations with learning outcomes investigated, by surveying first- and second-year undergraduate medical students; 181 usable responses were obtained (75% response rate). Psychometric analysis demonstrated overall good reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.85). Exploratory factor analysis yielded a 27-item, three-factor solution (ALEQ-27, Cronbach's alpha of 0.86), described as: (Factor 1) (Reversed) challenges in learning anatomy, (Factor 2) Applications and importance of anatomy, and (Factor 3) Learning in the dissection laboratory. Second-year students had somewhat greater challenges and less positive attitudes in learning anatomy than first-year students. Females reported slightly greater challenges and less confidence in learning anatomy than males. Total scores on summative gross anatomy examination questions correlated with ALEQ-27, Pearson's r=0.222 and 0.271, in years 1 and 2, respectively, and with Factor 1, r=0.479 and 0.317 (all statistically significant). Factor 1 also had similar correlations across different question types (multiple choice; short answer or essay; cadaveric; and anatomical models, bones, or radiological images). In a retrospective analysis, Factor 1 predicted poor end-of-semester anatomy examination results in year 1 with a sensitivity of 88% and positive predictive value of 33%. Further development of ALEQ-27 may enable deeper understanding of students' learning of anatomy, and its ten-item Factor 1 may be a useful screening tool to identify at-risk students.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to identify, empirically analyze and validate the relationship between various social media marketing activities influencing the attitude of Indian consumers toward green products and their willingness to pay (WTP) a premium price for them.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data was collected from 536 respondents who not only use various social media channels for purchases and gaining information but also prefer and buy green products across India. Exploratory factor analysis was done for the refinement and validation of the questionnaire items, and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationship among various variables.
   Findings
   The findings of the empirical study confer consumer's attitude toward green products being shaped by four main social media marketing activities, namely, word of mouth, interaction, entertainment and customization, whereas trendiness was found to be insignificant toward predicting consumer's attitude. The positive attitude so formed has a significant and positive impact on the willingness of consumers to pay a premium price for green products.
   Originality/value
   This research takes a lead in analyzing the construct WTP a premium for green products because this has been comparably less explored in Indian context. As spending a little extra by Indian consumers is a super sensitive issue, studying their willingness is therefore an important construct to be taken into account.

AB  - Introduction: Considering health professionals among high-risk individuals, we aimed to evaluate their knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19.
   Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted among the health professionals (medical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, hospital technicians and technologists) providing services at seven hospitals of Punjab province of Pakistan. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices regarding COVID-19.
   Results: All of the participants (N = 429) reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source (65%) of this information. Mean knowledge score was 12 +/- 2.1, with 75.5% of participants having satisfactory knowledge. Doctors were found to have significantly better knowledge scores than the other health professionals (p = 0.001). Mean attitude score was 8.0 +/- 1.2, with a wide majority of health professionals (86.5%) having positive attitudes. Regarding preventive practices, around 64% reported of always covering nose and mouth with a tissue paper during sneezing or coughing and nearly 65% disposed of the dirty tissue paper in trash bin. Only 40% of the participants reported that 'if they do not have tissue, they cough or sneeze into upper sleeves'. Around 45% reported that they used face mask during their working hours in hospitals nowadays. Mean practice score was 23.3 +/- 3.6, with 73.4% of health professionals having satisfactory practices.
   Conclusions: The overall COVID-19 related KAP of Pakistani health professionals are satisfactory, however some misperceptions and malpractices uncovered in the present study must be addressed to effectively combat COVID-19.

AB  - Pharmacists play a vital role in providing counseling to the hypertensive patients to understand disease, risk factors, medications, and non-pharmacological measures required in controlling Blood Pressure (BP). This study aims to evaluate the impact of pharmacist delivered counseling services on KAP levels and control of BP in hypertensive patients. A prospective, open-labeled, randomized control trial was conducted among hypertensive patients attending medical outpatient department of Non-governmental Organization (NGO) Hospital located in rural settings in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The study was performed after getting ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board with a registration number of RIPER/IRB/2018/038 and in accordance with ICH-GCP and CONSORT guidelines. The study was carried out for a period of one year from February 2018 to January 2019. The findings of the study reveal that there was a significant difference in the mean systolic and diastolic BP levels in intervention (138 +/- 10.5, 82.3 +/- 7.2) and control group (146.0 +/- 8.2, 87.2 +/- 5.4) at final follow-up visits. The mean percentage of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards hypertension management were significantly improved in the intervention group compared to control group. The study concludes that pharmacist is an integral part of the health care team to improve the health outcomes in hypertension. The study shows that patients had positive attitude levels regarding the management of hypertension. Due to lack of knowledge and awareness, the patients were under irrational practices. Finally, the pharmacist mediated counseling had significantly improved the KAP levels and BP control.

AB  - Background An ED visit provides a unique opportunity to identify elder abuse, which is common and has serious medical consequences. Despite this, emergency providers rarely recognise or report it. We have begun the design of an ED-based multidisciplinary consultation service to improve identification and provide comprehensive medical and forensic assessment and treatment for potential victims.
   Methods We qualitatively explored provider perspectives to inform intervention development. We conducted 15 semistructured focus groups with 101 providers, including emergency physicians, social workers, nurses, technologists, security, radiologists and psychiatrists at a large, urban academic medical centre. Focus groups were transcribed, and data were analysed to identify themes.
   Results Providers reported not routinely assessing for elder mistreatment and believed that they commonly missed it. They reported 10 reasons for this, including lack of knowledge or training, no time to conduct an evaluation, concern that identifying elder abuse would lead to additional work, and absence of a standardised response. Providers believed an ED-based consultation service would be frequently used and would increase identification, improve care and help ensure safety. They made 21 recommendations for a multidisciplinary team, including the importance of 24/7 availability, the value of a positive attitude in a consulting service and the importance of feedback to referring ED providers. Participants also highlighted that geriatric nurse practitioners may have ideal clinical and personal care training to contribute to the team.
   Conclusions An ED-based multidisciplinary consultation service has potential to impact care for elder abuse victims. Insights from providers will inform intervention development.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a pilot interdisciplinary inhouse training in palliative care (PC) for gynecological oncologists.
   Competencies of participants from a gynecological university department were evaluated taking part in an interdisciplinary PC course in a pre and post design. The multiprofessional course covered basic principles of PC, symptom management and communication taught by PC specialists. Competencies were evaluated using self-designed questionnaires before (ISPG-1), right after (ISPG-2), and 6 months after the training (ISPG-3) (inhouse seminar palliative care in gynecology: ISPG).
   31 persons from the department of gynecology took part in the course, of which 27 answered the first questionnaire (seven nurses (26%), 19 doctors (71%), one profession not indicated (3%), median working experience in gynecological oncology: 5 years). Return rates were: ISPG-1 27/31 (87.1%), ISPG-2 20/31 (64.5%) and IPSG-3 14/31 (45.2%). A more positive attitude towards PC could be observed in the majority of participants after the course (ISPG-2 62%, ISPG-3 71%). They felt more competent in the care of palliative patients (46%). PC would be initiated earlier and the interaction with other disciplines was improved (ISPG-2 85%, ISPG-3 100%). The participants assessed a significant improvement of their skills in all palliative fields which were analyzed.
   PC inhouse training improves the understanding of PC and the interdisciplinary approach in the management of patients with advanced disease. It is a feasible and useful instrument to improve the competencies in generalist PC of specialists in gynecological oncology.

AB  - As China prepares to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee has committed to making public participation a fundamental part of its broader sustainability objectives. Unfortunately, the existing research on information openness and public participation towards Winter Olympic Games is limited in the perspective of host residents. Therefore, this article aims to understand the information disclosure and public participation, as well as the roles information and technologies (ICTs) play in achieving environmental sustainability. With the help of self-administered questionnaires, data were compiled. The survey was conducted in April 2017 with 650 residents in Beijing and Zhangjiakou via face-to-face interviews to obtain a random and statistically representative sample of host residents. Our findings indicated that only few respondents participated in the limited activities of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The respondents' views on important issues of public participation varied obviously including the participating level, principles, time, ways, mechanism, and influencing factor. The analysis illustrated over 70% of respondents had the positive attitudes towards ICTs roles and functions in Beijing 2022. ICTs have helped the public to obtain information about environmental management and sustainability issues, and to facilitate public awareness and collective action by building new management practices. This study has implications and contributes to the burgeoning literature surrounding the Olympic Games by providing an in-depth analysis of public participation in relation to the theory.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine online purchase behaviours amongst young consumers in Australia and the USA. It also aims to develop and test a theoretical framework of young consumers' online purchase behaviour. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through online surveys targeting young online shoppers in Australia and the USA. A multi-group structural equation modelling was used to test the proposed structural model and hypotheses. Findings The model shows a good fit with the data. Young consumers in Australia and the USA have positive attitude towards online shopping that significantly affects their online purchase intentions. Social motive negatively impacts online purchase intentions in the Australian sample. Escapism and value motives positively affect Australian and American young shoppers' online purchase intentions. Young consumers in Australia and the USA are very familiar with the online shopping process. The familiarity strongly triggers their information search behaviour that leads to online purchase intentions. Originality/value Using the generational cohort theory, this paper contributes to the extant literature by providing insights on the Australian and American young generation's unique values and characteristics that influence their online purchase behaviours. This research also contributes insights for the marketers and policy makers to improve their marketing efforts and services and appeal to this young segment, based on their unique values and characteristics.

AB  - Background. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to pre-CRT in patients of stage II/III rectal cancer. Materials and Methods. Questionnaires regarding the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pre-CRT were mailed to 145 rectal cancer patients in II/III stage between January 2012 and December 2014, and 111 agreed to participate and returned completed questionnaires to the researcher. Logistic regression model was used to compare sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, and attitude with practice, respectively. Results. A total of 145 patients were approached for interview, of which 111 responded and 48.6% (54) had undergone pre-CRT. Only 31.5% of the participants knew that CRT is a treatment of rectal cancer and 39.6% were aware of the importance of CRT. However, the vast majority of participants (68.5%) expressed a positive attitude toward rectal cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that knowledge level (p = 0.006) and attitudes (p = 0.001) influence the actual practice significantly. Furthermore, age, gender, and income were potential predictors of practice (all p < 0.05). Conclusion. This study shows that, despite the fact that participants had suboptimal level of knowledge on rectal cancer, their attitude is favorable to pre-CRT. Strengthening the professional health knowledge and realizing the importance of attitudes may deepen patients' understanding of preoperative therapy.

AB  - Background: Among the various types of stem cells which have been suggested for therapeutic purposes, human amnion epithelial cells (hAEC) are highly promising. Purpose: This study aims to assess the knowledge and attitudes of the Taif University population toward the therapeutic potential of hAEC. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out among the students of Taif University. A self-administrated questionnaire was used in this descriptive study. The questionnaire consisted of demographic information, knowledge, and attitudes regarding stem cells and hAEC. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics in SPSS-IBM 25. Results: Out of 1026 subjects, 908 (88.6%) were female, 686 (66.9%) from the age group of less than 25 years, 984 (96%) Saudi nationals, and 834 (81.45%) were undergraduate students. Unfortunately, 35% of the subjects in this study have no idea about stem cells and 55% have never heard about hAEC. Only a moderate level of knowledge score was noticed among the participants about stem cells. Significantly (P= 0.001) high percentage of females would like to conserve their human amniotic epithelial cells for family or for research purposes. More than 88% of the subjects would like to have awareness programs in the community about human amniotic epithelial cells. The knowledge and attitude scores were shown to have a substantial positive association. Conclusion: As a result of this research, it is suggested that various stem cell educational programs and awareness campaigns need to be implemented in universities in order to improve stem cell knowledge and encourage a more positive attitude toward the use of stem cells for therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Background: Increasing substance use among adolescents has prompted investigation in the emergence and evolution of substance use behaviors. Two basic elements which are influenced in person's behavior are self-efficacy and outcome expectancies. While the importance of these construct is high, their origin is less clear. In the present study we sought to elucidate influences of social influence on the development of cognition factors as predictors of substance use behavior.Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of a model that proposes that self-efficacy and outcome expectancies are mediators of the association between social influences and substance use behavior in 720 adolescents, aged between 14 and 18, in the cross-sectional survey in Isfahan, Iran.Results: Positive expectancies, in contrast to negative ones, form positive attitudes regarding drug use. The phenomenon combined with a sense of low resistance self-efficacy leaded to the substance use behavior. The model provided a good fit to the data and explained 53% of the variance in substance use behavior in adolescents.Conclusions: Results of the study shed light on the development of substance use-related cognitions and contribute to our understanding of the structural relationship between social influence, expectancies, and self-efficacy in substance use behavior in adolescents.

AB  - Entertainment persuasion theory was applied to investigate how an epilogue to a dramatic episode with an educational subtext about bipolar disorder affected viewer processing and response. In an experiment, viewers (N=89) were randomly assigned to watch the episode either with or without an epilogue. Exposure to the epilogue increased recognition of the subtext. It also increased counterarguing against the subtext, but only among viewers less involved with the episode's story. The epilogue decreased social distance for people with bipolar disorder and decreased their belief that bipolar disorder is not treatable. These findings speak to the utility of epilogues as a tool to both reinforce intended entertainment-education messages and to combat misinformation. This function is particularly useful for entertainment portrayals of stigmatized conditions, which are at greater risk of being misunderstood. To avoid viewer reactance, epilogues should be paired with highly involving narratives.

AB  - Waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS or hookah) is common among adolescents and college students in the USA. However, there has not yet been a large-scale, nationally representative study independently examining WTS among young adults who are not in college.
   This study sought to examine associations between attitudes, normative beliefs, certain socio-demographic factors and current WTS among young adults not in college and compare them to young adults in college.
   A total of 3131 US adults ages 1830 completed an online survey about WTS behaviour, attitudes, normative beliefs and relevant socio-demographic factors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine independent associations between these variables and current WTS stratified by student status.
   Ever WTS was reported by 29% of young adults not in college and by 35% of those in college, and current use rates were 3 and 7%, respectively. Multivariable models demonstrated that positive attitudes and perceived peer acceptability of WTS were significantly associated with increased current WTS for both young adults not in college [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.72; 95% CI: 2.003.71 and AOR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.502.71, respectively] and young adults in college (AOR = 3.37; 95% CI: 2.484.58 and AOR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.492.83, respectively). The magnitude of these associations was not significantly different when comparing individuals in college and not in college.
   Among young adults, WTS is common in non-college-based populations as well as in college-based populations. Therefore, prevention programming should extend to all young adults, not only to those in college.

AB  - Using online comments posted on news stories as the context, this study aimed to examine the interplay between the third-person perception (TPP) - that people believe media message have a greater effect on changing the attitudes of others compared with themselves - and online incivility. It also examined whether people's agreement with the content of the comments would influence the TPP. Results of an experiment (N = 301) showed incivility muted the persuasive effect of online comments, so only civil comments produced a TPP, whereby people felt comments had greater persuasive power over others compared with themselves. However, counter to predictions, whether people agreed with the comments did not influence the TPP. Findings also supported the TPP social distance corollary such that subjects perceived comments as having the largest third-person perceptual gap between the self and those who disagreed with them. Results are discussed in relation to TPP and face and politeness theories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increase in numbers of multimedia technologies around us, movies and videos on social media and OTT platforms are growing, making it confusing for users to decide which one to watch for. For this, movie recommendation systems are widely used. It has been observed that two-thirds of the films watched on Netflix are the recommended ones to its users. The target of this work is to use implicit feedback given by other users to recommend movies, i.e., ratings given by them. Implicit feedback will help to enhance Data Sparsity as for a replacement logged-in user, the system won't have details of their past liked movies. So, matching the similarity with other users is often a plus point to recommend movies that they would like. The anticipated result will depend upon the positive attitude; i.e., if the predicted rating is high, then it'll be recommended; otherwise it'll not be recommended. The performance of the methodology is measured with accuracy and precision values for different strategies. It gives the best accuracy and highest precision values using Logistic Regression (LR) and lowest recall value as compared to other algorithms. This technique gives an accuracy, precision, and recall value of 81.9%, 69.82%, and 32.5%, respectively, using LR.

AB  - Social participation is a crucial condition for successful learning in inclusive primary schools. Unfortunately, students with non-compliant classroom behaviour are at risk of being socially excluded from their class. Recently, students' attitudes have been identified as the central indicator of the social participation of students with non-compliant behaviour in the classroom. However, the determinants of students' attitudes are unclear. In accordance with the 'contact theory' and the principle of 'homophily', we investigated the relationship between students' attitudes towards peers with non-compliant behaviour, their contact experiences with peers with non-compliant behaviour, and their experiences of having behavioural difficulties or formally assessed special educational needs (SEN) themselves. 589 fourth grade primary school students completed a questionnaire on their contact experiences and attitudes towards peers with non-compliant behaviour. Additionally, teachers provided information on students' behavioural difficulties and formal SEN. Results from a multilevel regression analysis revealed that students' attitudes towards peers with non-compliant behaviour could be explained by their contact experiences. Overall, our findings emphasise the importance of students' contact experiences in relation to their attitudes towards peers with non-compliant behaviour and mark an important initial point for the implementation of future interventions (e.g. peer-mediated learning) that foster valuable contacts and positive attitudes.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of high-involvement work systems (HIWS) on absorptive capacity. In addition, the mediating effect of happiness at work in the relationship between high-involvement work practices and absorptive capacity is analyzed. Design/methodology/approach A 2-1-2 bathtub multilevel mediation model was used to analyze a sample of 783 employees from 111 bank branches, gathering data at three different times. Findings The results reveal that HIWS positively affect absorptive capacity. In addition, they show that happiness at work partially mediates the relationship between HIWS and absorptive capacity. Originality/value Happiness at work is a fundamental element for knowledge absorption. The findings support the basic assumptions of the job demands-resources model, and demonstrate how HIWS, acting as a job resource, lead to positive attitudes (happiness at work) and, in turn, to positive outcomes (absorptive capacity). The proposed HIWS, based on the assumptions of the mutual gains model, reveal a positive employment relationship with effects on both HAW and organizational outcomes. If organizations expose their employees to management practices that have specific benefits for their HAW, employees are more likely to perform their jobs in ways that will promote their absorptive capacity.

AB  - Objective: In recent years, Vietnam has been recorded as one of the most endemic areas of dengue fever (DF). Thus, controlling DF has become a matter of concern to healthcare professionals and the government. Nevertheless, there has been little research exploring inhabitants' awareness about DF in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The aims of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding DF by the population in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
   Methods: In July 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,175 people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, using an administered questionnaire.
   Results: Only 38% of participants had good knowledge, and 55% of the population reached the satisfactory practices score, while 74% showed positive attitudes relating to DF. Unlike many other studies, education level was not associated with KAP score. However, marital status and monthly income seemed to be related to participants' knowledge levels. In addition, the main sources of information in this research were television and the Internet.
   Conclusion: This study showed that participants lacked knowledge regarding DF and practices to prevent it. These results recommend improving the population's knowledge and practices through campaigns aimed at preventing breeding of mosquitoes.

AB  - As explicit administrative expectations to use meaningful inquiry-based instructional activities and formative assessment tasks might influence teachers' classroom practices, this study assessed science teachers' use of contemporary educational activities and assessment tasks above and beyond their conceptions of traditional teaching and learning and their attitudes toward using final tests. Data were gathered from 127 primary school science teachers from 60 Israeli public schools. The results showed that although used less frequently than final tests, formative assessment tasks were used to some extent by the participants during learning processes. Partial least squares structural equation modeling results pointed to the mediating role of teachers' positive attitudes toward tests in linking their conceptions of traditional teaching to increased use of summative assessment tasks (final tests). Moreover, teachers who reported using constructivist educational activities, more specifically collaborative practices, also reported using formative assessment tasks. Contrary to expectations, this study's model did not point to a significant negative connection between teachers' traditional conceptions of teaching and learning and their tendency to use constructivist activities in their classes. It is inferred that in practice teachers need to respond to explicit administrative expectations to use meaningful inquiry-based instructional activities and formative assessment and therefore might use those activities in spite of their traditional conceptions of teaching and learning.

AB  - Background. Environmental destruction is one of the most important problems in this century. Objective. The aim of the study was to determine the environmental attitudes and perceived risks associated with environmental factors of the students. Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 7 faculties of Mersin University. The research data were collected using a questionnaire. The questionnaire included sociodemographic characteristics, the "Environmental Attitudes Scale," and the "Environmental Risk Perception Scale." 774 students who filled out questionnaires were evaluated. Results. The sample included 55.8% females. Environmental Attitudes Scale mean scores of students were identified as 81.1 +/- 11.3. The highest perceived risk was release of radioactive materials associated with nuclear power generation. The environmental attitudes and risk perception scores were higher in Health Sciences than in the other faculties. Females were more positive towards the environment and had higher risk perceptions than the men. There is a negative correlation between age and resource depletion risk and global environmental risk score. Conclusion. Students had a positive attitude to the environment and had moderate-level risk perception about the environment. Environmental awareness of students, especially those studying in the Social Sciences, should be increased. The environmental education curriculum should be revised throughout all the courses.

AB  - This study maps Uganda LGBT+ experiences of online hate crime and analyzes how preexisting vulnerability morph in digital spaces. Based on field notes, workshop material, and interviews with 13 LGBT+ individuals, the study finds that digital presences in contexts where users are vulnerable due to state-sanctioned discrimination and social exclusion, digital arenas exacerbate users' vulnerability to hate crimes through their digital footprints. The longing for community and intimacy, together with in some cases an unfamiliarity with how digital media can be misused, appear to facilitate both the ideologically driven perpetrators hunting LGBT+, and Crime passionnel, where an (ex)partner miscalculates the implications of publishing private material. This study thus illustrates how digital spaces are not safe(r) spaces, where LGBT+ are free to playfully explore sexual orientation and gender non-conformity, away from society's abhorring gaze. Furthermore, contrary to what could be expected, LGBT+ individuals' vulnerability was most often not the result of an outside intruder hunting LGBT+ online. The article reiterates the importance of a situated approach, acknowledging the environmental influences when studying and addressing LGBT+ vulnerabilities in digital spaces.

AB  - Owing to strict access control implemented on university campuses during COVID-19, college students experienced increased isolation, resulting in several physical and mental health issues. This study investigates the relationships among perceived built environment, walking attitudes, walking behavior, physical and mental state, and the impact of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students (N = 429) at Dalian University of Technology, China, on September 20 (Sunday) and 21 (Monday), 2020. The survey questionnaire included questions related to socio-demographic factors, perceived environment (accessibility, road condition and safety, and aesthetics), walking attitudes, walking behavior (number of walking trips), physical and mental state, and the impact of pandemic. Subsequently, two structural equation models (SEMs) were developed to analyze the proposed conceptual framework. The empirical results indicated that the SEMs fit the data well, thereby validating the conceptual framework. Perceived environment (especially accessibility), attitudes, and walking behavior significantly influenced physical and mental state. Perceived environment mediated the effects between attitudes and walking behavior and physical and mental state. The pandemic negatively impacted attitudes and physical and mental state. The effect of perceived accessibility on walking behavior and that of walking behavior on physical and mental state were stronger on weekends, whereas the effects of attitudes and the pandemic on physical and mental state were stronger on weekdays. The findings indicate that universities should implement appropriate strategies to improve the objective and subjective built environment, especially accessibility, and cultivate positive attitudes among students to promote walking and improve physical and mental health during COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Febrile seizure is one of the most common kind of seizure in the children. Majority of mothers had adequate information about febrile seizures, but there were still mothers' negative beliefs about febrile seizures and these misconceptions can lead to inappropriate or even harmful actions to control seizure in the child.
   Aim: To explore k knowledge, beliefs and practices related to immediate home management among mothers of children with febrile seizures.
   Methods: The present study is a descriptive- analytical comparative study which includes 156 mothers who referred to "17- Shahrivar" health care center and neurology clinic in Rasht city and attended in the study. 78 patients were in the recurrence group and 78 patients were in the non-recurrence group. Data were collected through a questionnaire consisting of knowledge, attitude and home management questions, and finally, the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analytical statistics (independent t-test, Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficient).
   Results: The findings showed that the majority of the units in the group with and without recurrence were male. The mean score of knowledge in children' mothers without recurrence was higher than children' mothers with recurrence (p <0.023). The majority of mothers in both groups had a positive attitude.None of the mothers in both groups performed well.
   Conclusion: In this study, mothers' knowledge level is low which, in its turn, is effective in the treatment and recurrence trend of seizure. This issue highlights the necessity of educating mothers through medical centers and mass media.

AB  - We analyze a novel agent-based model of a social network in which agents make contributions to others conditional upon the social distance, which we measure in terms of the "degrees of separation" between the two players. On the basis of a simple imitation model, the emerging strategy profile is characterized by high levels of cooperation with those who are directly connected to the agent and lower but positive levels of cooperation with those who are indirectly connected to the agent. Increasing maximum interaction distance decreases cooperation with close neighbors but increases cooperation with distant neighbors for a net negative effect. On the other hand, allowing agents to learn and imitate socially distant neighbors increases cooperation for all types of interaction. Combining greater interaction distance with greater learning distance leads to a positive change in the total social welfare produced by the agents' contributions.

AB  - Background: Satisfaction with life is recognized to be a factor in alleviating burden in stressful caregiving duties. However, the mechanism underlying this relationship is indistinct. Positive aspects of caregiving (PAC) may help to regulate caregiving burden among caregivers of older adults. The study aims to examine whether positive caregiving characteristics mediate the effect between satisfaction with life and burden of care. Methods: Participants were 285 caregivers of older adults (aged 60 and above) in Singapore and were recruited in a cross-sectional, self-report study (mean [M] = 47.0 years; 64.6% females). Measures included in the study were the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Positive Aspects of Caregiving (PAC), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Mediation analyses were used to study the indirect effects of life satisfaction on caregiver burden through features of PAC. Results: Mean scores for the ZBI, PAC, and SWLS scales were M = 23.15 (standard deviation [SD] = 15.98), M = 34.55 (SD = 8.19), and M = 23.56 (SD = 6.62) respectively. Results from the mediation analysis revealed that the association between life satisfaction and caregiving burden was significantly mediated by the PAC (P < .001). Discussion: Positive aspects of caregiving may be a mechanism that links satisfaction with life and caregiver burden. Findings may represent attempts to manage caregiving duties as well as maintaining a positive attitude toward their responsibilities.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of the present study is to examine the relationship between Social and Environmental Accountability (SEA), Attitude towards Environmental Advertising (AEA), Materialism, and Intention to purchase Environmentally Sustainable Products (IPESP). Design/methodology/approach The study sample consists of 205 business students from two B schools in India. Data was collected through the survey method, and the moderated-mediation model was statistically tested using SPSS Process Macro software. Findings The findings of the study suggest that the attitude towards social and environmental accountability (SEA) is positively associated with the intention to purchase environmentally sustainable products (IPESP). Moreover, this relationship is mediated and moderated by AEA and materialism, respectively. Practical implications The findings of the study reveal that a consumer with low materialism and a positive attitude for both environmental sustainability and environmental advertising has higher chances of purchasing environmentally sustainable products. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature on sustainability by providing a basis for understanding the moderated-mediation mechanism, which affects the relationship between SEA and IPESP; two key variables that have not been examined in combination.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed our way of living. To minimize life losses, multi-level strategies requiring collective efforts were adopted while waiting for the vaccines' rollout. The management of such complex processes has taken benefit from the rising framework of the Internet of Things (IoT), and particularly the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) since it is probably the most suitable approach to both the micro (user) and the macro (processes) scale. Hence, a single infrastructure can support both the logistic and monitoring issues related to the war against a pandemic. Based on the COVID-19 experience, this paper is a survey on how state-of-the-art RFID systems can be employed in facing future pandemic outbreaks. The three pillars of the contrast of the pandemic are addressed: 1) use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 2) access control and social distancing, and 3) early detection of symptoms. For each class, the envisaged RFID devices and procedures are discussed based on the available technology and the current worldwide research. This survey shows that RFID could generate an extraordinary amount of data so that complementary paradigms of Edge Computing and Artificial intelligence can be tightly integrated to extract profiles and identify anomalous events in compliance with privacy and security.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Countries worldwide have adopted unprecedented infection control and prevention measures to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The success of these measures depends on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the general population toward COVID-19.The objective of this study was to measure the KAP of adult Greek residents toward COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional nationwide survey (n=1,004) was conducted during between April 28,2020 to May 03,2020 using a mixed methodology for data collection: Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and Computer Assisted web Interviewing (CAWI).A proportionate stratified by region systematic sampling procedure was used to ensure a nationally representative sample of the urban/rural population. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: 35% of respondents reported correctly the five most commonly related to COVID-19 symptoms (i.e. cough, fever, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms and myalgia). Most respondents (>90%) knew that coronavirus can be transmitted by droplets from human-to-human and contaminated surfaces. Avoiding touching the face with one's hands and social distancing were identified as the most appropriate prevention and control measures against COVID-19 by over 95% of respondents. The median (IQR) of the total knowledge score was 17 (16-19).45.6% of respondents believed that the novel coronavirus was developed by humans in laboratories, and 79.4% and 69.0% believed that novel coronavirus is more contagious and more lethal than flu virus H1N1, respectively.41.1% of respondents stated that they had proceeded to social distancing before government measures were taken. CONCLUSION: Overall, the Greek general population had adequate knowledge of the symptoms, transmission routes and prevention measures of the COVID-19,although there is undoubtedly still room for improvement.

AB  - Purpose Drawing from conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study empirically tests the impact of transformational leadership on commitment to and intention to support organizational change, proposing self-efficacy as a mediating mechanism. This study also aims to study whether the extent of change in the organization moderates the proposed relationship between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and change reactions. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted with a sample of 298 employees going through a major organizational change. The proposed moderated mediation relationship was tested by using PROCESS macro. Findings The findings showed that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and reactions to change. Moreover, the extent of changes experienced by the employees moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and outcome variables. In other words, in high change contexts, self-efficacy appeared as a more salient and instrumental resource leading to positive reactions.
   Practical implications - The results guide change managers to display a transformational leadership style to enhance self-efficacy of change recipients to generate positive attitudes and behaviors during change. Also, this study shows that self-efficacy particularly gains importance when the extent of change is high.
   Originality/value - This study makes several important contributions to the organizational change literature. First, it shows that leaders play a crucial role in generating resources that enhance employees' positive reactions to change. Second, the conditional factor of the extent of change has not received much attention in the literature. This study raises attention to the fact that the importance of such resources may differ across low versus high extent of change contexts.

AB  - Objectives:- To analyse the impact of different variables on repeated episodes of homelessness. Method: The study was conducted based on data obtained from a representative sample of homeless people in Madrid (Spain) (n=188). Results: Suffering from a serious or chronic illness has an effect on the revolving door to homelessness, which is mediated by a highly negative subjective perception of the individual's own health, which is in turn mediated by suffering from a disability. Excessive alcohol consumption has an effect on the revolving door to homelessness, mediated by access to treatment for problems caused by alcohol consumption. Suffering from a serious or chronic illness correlates with having problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Experiencing multiple stressful life events has a direct effect on the revolving door to homelessness. Conclusions: To prevent the revolving door to homelessness, it is necessary to remove the barriers that hinder access to normal health resources which are experienced by people suffering from social exclusion, while implementing ongoing support programmes for homeless people or those at risk of homelessness, which primarily deal with health issues.

AB  - Romantic jealousy, a complex response to a real or perceived threat to a romantic relationship, can have serious negative consequences for individuals, partners and perceived rivals. The likelihood of a jealous response is heightened among individuals who experience attachment anxiety, and online communication and social media provide unique fodder for romantic jealousy. The purpose of the current study is to test whether the association between attachment anxiety and online jealousy (jealous response to ambiguous hypothetical online scenarios) is moderated by negative attitudes about online communication. Individuals in dating relationships were asked about attachment anxiety and attitudes about online communication (i.e., apprehension and concern about misunderstandings) as well as emotional, cognitive, and behavioral online jealousy. Hierarchical linear regression revealed an attachment anxiety-attitude interaction, such that the link between attachment anxiety and jealousy was stronger for participants with relatively low levels of negative attitudes about online communication compared to participants with relatively high levels of negative attitudes. The current study expands knowledge about attachment anxiety and jealousy in the context of online communication and social media, and highlights the importance of considering attitudes about online communication when studying relationship processes in the digital arena.

AB  - It is well known that political elites can shape public attitudes toward policies and values. Less is known, however, about whether elites can also influence public perceptions of social groups they praise or denounce. I test this by analyzing the attitudinal effects of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign announcement speech, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and "criminals." First, to provide causal estimates, I analyze survey data using a counterfactual approach. I find evidence that Trump's statements negatively affected public opinion toward immigrants particularly among groups with restrictionist tendencies. Second, using a panel survey experiment, I corroborate this causal relationship but find that these effects are short-lived. This explains why restrictionist politicians like Trump constantly prod natives to keep their messages' effects from dissipating. I also find that only negative messages are consequential and find no evidence that elite statements are more impactful than those from non-elites, suggesting that the power of elite rhetoric lies primarily in its capacity to reach the masses via the news media.

AB  - With the high frequency and intensity of worldwide disasters, cause-related marketing campaigns with sudden disasters are becoming increasingly popular. However, little is known about whether and how cause acuteness may influence consumer attitudes. This research aims to extend this research area through investigating the relationship between cause acuteness and consumer attitudes toward the product, as well as its underlying mechanism and boundary conditions. Based on a moral psychology perspective, we propose a theoretical model focusing on the mediating role of moral elevation in influencing consumer attitudes. This model also incorporates product-cause fit and information transparency as moderators underpinning necessary conditions that are likely to lead to positive consumer attitudes. Four empirical studies were conducted to test our model. Our research results reveal that consumers have more positive attitudes toward the product associated with a sudden disaster than with an ongoing tragedy. Furthermore, the positive effect of cause acuteness on consumer attitudes is mediated by enhanced moral elevation, which occurs under the conditions of high product-cause fit and high information transparency.

AB  - Masculinity has been found to predict the sexual prejudice of heterosexual men against gay men. The present study investigated the role of four variables as moderators of the relationships between two masculinity constructs (endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology and gender role conflict) and sexual prejudice in men. The hypothesized moderators were: direct and indirect friendships with gay men, gender self-esteem, acknowledged same-sex attraction, and religious fundamentalism. A total of 383 men completed 8 scales plus a demographic questionnaire. Direct friendship strengthened the positive relationship between masculinity ideology and sexual prejudice, contrary to hypothesis. This finding could mean that high masculinity ideology scores reduced the likelihood that a man with many gay friends would let go of his prejudice. Direct friendship did not moderate the relationship between gender role conflict and sexual prejudice nor did indirect friendship moderate either relationship; however, both forms of friendship predicted prejudice, as hypothesized. Gender self-esteem strengthened the positive relationships between both masculinity variables and sexual prejudice as hypothesized. Same-sex attraction weakened the relationship between gender role conflict and sexual prejudice as hypothesized, but contrary to hypothesis did not moderate the relationship between masculinity ideology and sexual prejudice. Religious fundamentalism predicted prejudice, but showed no significant moderation. The results were discussed in terms of limitations and suggestions for future research and application. In conclusion, this line of investigation appears promising and should be continued and the present findings can be utilized in anti-prejudice social marketing campaigns and in counseling.

AB  - Previous neuroeconomic studies have observed that people display sympathetic neural responses toward others' misfortunes. We argue that the reverse emotions, such as gloating or schadenfreude, may also emerge in certain circumstances. To examine this theory, we recorded feedback-related negativity (FRN) toward others' large or small gains or losses in a stock market context. We adopted the framework of social distance, according to which we hypothesized that because others in the stock market are far away, unidentified, and indistinct, people would show less sympathy or even schadenfreude toward others' large losses. The results indicated that FRN at Fz was significantly less negative when observing larger decreases in others' stock, indicating that others' large losses are not unexpected negative events in the stock market and suggesting the existence of schadenfreude. Our research contributes to the understanding of social neurofinance by demonstrating the schadenfreude effect in relation to the stock market. This study also provides new information regarding the relationship between FRN and the social emotions that form the expectations of gain and loss.

AB  - Some immigrants can be reluctant to cooperate with the police due to experiences of social exclusion and discrimination. Procedural justice scholars argue that people cooperate with police when they feel the police are just and fair because such treatment motivates identification with social categories that police represent. In this paper, we consider whether immigrants in Australia respond favourably to procedurally just treatment from police because it enhances their identification with both Australia and the police. Using survey data from 903 Vietnamese, Middle Eastern and British immigrants, we demonstrate an association between police procedural justice and both modes of identification. We also find that both identities mediate the relationship between procedural justice and cooperation. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This study aimed to explore factors perceived to affect the intention of premarital sexual behaviours among junior high school students in Muang District, Thailand. A stratified random sampling technique was employed to select three schools out of ten public junior high schools. A situation analysis was conducted following a focus group discussion and in-depth interview. The informants included six junior high school students, five parents, three teachers, two health professionals and two school administrators. A thematic analysis was employed for the data analysis. Results illustrated negative attitude, social media, the internet use, socio-environmental space, peer pressure, social belief, low self-efficacy, generation gap and sexual education were the factors perceived to affect the intention of sexual behaviours. An integrated implementation of a comprehensive sexual education was the way forward to increasing self-efficacy.

AB  - This article examines the combined influence of cognitions (i.e., impact beliefs) and affect (i.e., feelings) on normative beliefs (i.e., support for management options) about wolves and brown bears. Data were obtained from stratified random face-to-face interviews (n=1,611). The survey was conducted in the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park (central Italy), where people have a long history of coexistence with large carnivores. Knowledge was hypothesized to moderate the relationships of beliefs and feelings on support for management actions. Path analyses supported the role of affect in mediating perceived impact beliefs and support for the protection of large carnivores. Knowledge moderated these relationships in the case of wolves but not brown bears. Residents of the national park had more knowledge about bears than wolves, which might partly explain both the stronger effect that knowledge had on the affective component and its lack of a moderating effect on the bear model. Overall, our findings show the positive attitude of residents toward large carnivores and support the idea of affect being more important than cognition in predicting normative beliefs.

AB  - We present recent improvements achieved for two important transmission parameters dispersion, induced by the optical fiber, and the chirp parameter of the laser source in a directly modulated system based on an injection-locked and directly modulated Fabry-Perot laser diode for high-speed optical access networks with a point-to-point topology. Measurements in the 20-GHz range of the frequency response for distances up to 35 km are conducted by carefully adjusting the optical power and frequency detuning of the distributed master laser in the central office, thereby overcoming the problem of chromatic dispersion in high-speed optical access. Moreover, the enhancements make it possible to increase the transmission distance when a 1550-nm Fabry-Perot laser is used as the light source in the central office of a point-to-point optical access network by distributing the seed light into numerous downstream lasers. This improvement to the injection-locked Fabry-Perot laser is expected to extend the length of already-built, fiber-to-the-home, point-to-point networks with a simple upgrade in the central office without prejudicing the terminal equipment.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the utilization of health care services, including Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Social distancing measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease have greatly affected the functioning of societies and reduced or halted many activities with a risk of injury. The aim of this study was to report the effects of lockdown measures on trauma-related EMS calls in the Finnish capital area. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all EMS calls in the Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) catchment area between 1 January and 31 July 2020. Calls were identified from the HUH EMS database. Calls were grouped into pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods according to the restrictions set by the Finnish government and compared to the mean number of calls for the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. Statistical comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U-test for weekly numbers and percentages. Results During the study period there was a total of 70,705 EMS calls, of which 14,998 (21.2%) were related to trauma; 67,973 patients (median age 61.6 years; IQR 35.3-78.6) were met by EMS. There was no significant change in the weekly number of total or trauma-related EMS calls during the pre-lockdown period. During the lockdown period, the number of weekly total EMS calls was reduced by 12.2% (p = 0.001) and the number of trauma-related calls was reduced by 23.3% (p = 0.004). The weekly number of injured patients met by EMS while intoxicated with alcohol was reduced by 41.8% (p = 0.002). During the post-lockdown period, the number of total and trauma-related calls and the number of injured patients intoxicated by alcohol returned to previous years' levels. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures reduced the number of trauma-related EMS calls. Lockdown measures had an especially significant effect on the number of injured patients intoxicated by alcohol met by the EMS.

AB  - Objectives Mental health problems are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their effect on adherence to precautionary measures is not well understood. Given that psychological morbidities are associated with lower treatment adherence, and that precautionary measures are important in containing the spread of COVID-19, this study aims to determine if people with mental health problems have lower adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19. Design We conducted a cross-sectional territory-wide online survey between 17 June and 31 July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinically significant mental health problems, adherence to precautionary behaviours, and confounding factors such as sociodemographic factors and self-reported physical health were assessed. Setting The link to the questionnaire was disseminated to the general population in all 18 districts of Hong Kong using various social media platforms. Participants 1036 individuals completed the survey. Of them, 1030 met the inclusion criteria of being adult Hong Kong residents. Primary outcome Adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19, including wearing face mask, frequent handwashing, household disinfection, social distancing, minimising unnecessary travel, and stocking up on food and daily essentials. Results Of the 1030 participants, 166 (16.1%) had clinically significant mental health problems. Interestingly, they were more likely to stock up on food and daily essentials during the pandemic (7 (4.2%) vs 15 (1.7%), p=0.04; unadjusted OR=2.49, 95% CI=1.00 to 6.21, p<0.05) and had a lesser tendency to stop social distancing even if the pandemic subsides (86 (51.8%) vs 513 (59.4%), p=0.07; unadjusted OR=0.74, 95% CI=0.53 to 1.03, p=0.07). The latter association remained significant after adjusting for the confounding factors (adjusted OR=0.68, 95% CI=0.48 to 0.96, p=0.03). Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, people who are mentally unwell might go beyond the recommended precautionary measures. Our findings highlight the need to identify mental health problems and provide care and support for those who might go too far with precautionary measures.

AB  - Research has shown that neoliberalism alters the balance of power in favour of market forces and produces mental distress in young people. Given that media narratives and narrative texts reflect public discourse and mutually constitute one another, this analysis focuses on Alan McMonagle's second novel, Laura Cassidy's Walk of Fame, which stands for an indictment of neoliberal failure where social exclusion is prominent. McMonagle is part of a creative explosion of Irish writers who have experimented with fiction in the last decade to write about capitalism's dark side and the empty dread of consumer culture. The author uses film noir as a framework for the story of his eponymous character, a young woman with mental health problems whose dream is to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This essay examines the significance of McMonagle's use of film noir influences and its cliches, Laura's silence and the surrounding cultural silence as a power relation in Michel Foucault's sense, and their consequences for the narrative in sociological and aesthetic terms.

AB  - Purpose
   Life insurance remains an essential part of financial and social security. The insurance penetration rate is high in the developed countries but very low in developing countries such as Malaysia, with only 4.8% penetration and extremely low underwritings. Therefore, this study aims to scrutinize the underlying determinants of a household purchase behaviour of life insurance.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The data generated from the administration of survey questionnaires to 325 households were analysed, using structural equation modelling to obtain the research purposes.
   Findings
   The analysis reveals that the knowledge of life insurance, attitudes towards life insurance, subjective norms (SN), trust and risk perception, affect the tendency of a household to purchase life insurance. The results of this study also highlight that households' purchase-propensity influences the purchase behaviour of life insurance. Concurrently, the intention to purchase has mediating effects on explanatory variables and purchase behaviour.
   Originality/value
   This paper established awareness, SN, perceived behavioural control, trust and risk perception as the key determinants promoting positive attitudes towards purchasing life insurance. The findings of this study can be successfully applied to different stakeholders in a similar context. This study suggests that the managers of life insurance companies should adjust their policy guidelines in accordance with the positive relationship between the constructs and consumers' intention to purchase life insurance.

AB  - Background: Several randomized trials have reported that graded exercise therapy (GET) is an effective treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). These trials were not blinded and relied on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). We investigate whether bias introduced by this study design influenced the results.
   Methods: We extracted standardized mean differences from the most recent meta-analysis on exercise therapy for CFS to analyze their size, consistency over time, and congruence with objective measurements. A narrative review methodology was used to examine mediation analyses, plausible mechanisms of improvement, and risk of response bias.
   Results: Patient-reported improvements in exercise trials for CFS tend to be small, transient, and poorly supported by objective measurements. The risk of expectancy effects and response bias was high as patients were actively encouraged to adopt a positive attitude towards exercise therapy. Mediation analyses suggest that self-reported improvements in fatigue and physical function are not mediated by objective measures of fitness.
   Conclusions: Treatment effects seen in exercise trials for CFS could be the result of bias associated with the use of PROMs in nonblinded trials. This might explain the discrepancy between positive results reported in randomized trials and views on exercise therapy expressed by patient organizations. We hope that this case study furthers critical assessment of patientreported improvements in areas of medicine where blinding of therapists and trial participants faces practical limitations.

AB  - Women leaders in the workforce are adversely affected by two sets of stereotypes: women are warm and communal but leaders are assertive and competent. This mismatch of stereotypes can lead to negative attitudes toward women leaders, however, not all individuals will be equally sensitive to these stereotypes. Men and women characterized by a need for cognitive closure (the desire for stable and certain knowledge) should be particularly sensitive to these stereotypes because they can be stable knowledge sources. We hypothesized that (a) negative attitudes toward women leaders in the workforce would vary with individuals' need for closure, independent of their gender, and that (b) binding moral foundations (a concern for the larger group and its norms and standards) would mediate this association. In two studies, MTurk workers completed measures of negative attitudes toward women managers (Study 1, n=149), stereotyped beliefs of women as not wanting or deserving high status positions in the workforce (Study 2, n=207), as well as need for cognitive closure, moral foundations, social desirability, gender, and political orientation. Our results were consistent with our hypotheses and suggest that attitudes toward woman managers can reflect acceptance of pre-existent norms. If these norms can be changed, then changes in attitudes could follow.

AB  - There are two classes of explanations of prejudice: situational and personality. In a sample of Polish community members (n=394), we tried to understand individual differences in prejudice towards refugees (i.e., classical and modern prejudice along with social distance) by considering the role of individual differences in the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), collective narcissism (i.e., agentic and communal), social dominance, and authoritarianism. Both the Dark Triad traits and collective narcissism were associated with prejudice towards refugees among Poles, but the association for the former was fully mediated by social dominance-an effect that was stronger in men-whereas the association for the latter was partially mediated by authoritarianism-an effect that was stronger in women. We discuss our findings referring to a dual process model of prejudice.

AB  - Choosing the right way of programming can prevent learning difficulties, contribute to increasing students' motivation to learn, and make teaching process more effective. The article is focused on assessing which way of programming, visual or textual, is appropriate for intermediate and advanced learners in the context of creating mobile applications. Three ways of programming were examined during an extracurricular programming course for teenagers aged 12-18 with previous programming experience and positive attitude to programming. The course was aimed at programming mobile applications. MIT App Inventor 2 as a visual programming tool and Android Studio with Java as a textual programming tool were chosen. Due to the gap between two programming tools, the method of transition from visual to textual programming using Java Bridge Code Generator and Java Bridge Library as mediators was implemented. The research results are based on the analysis of data obtained from participatory observations, interviews with students, questionnaires and source codes of applications created by students. The case study shows a difference in students' performance between visual and textual programming in favour of visual programming. However, the difference in students' attitudes toward visual and textual programming was the opposite in favour of textual programming, regardless of age and learning performance. These results suggest that App Inventor visual programming environment is advantageous at the beginning of learning programming, but may be perceived as too limited and not enough motivating for intermediate and advanced students, even though programming in Android Studio professional teed based environment is too challenging for them.

AB  - Background and objectives: The fast detection of and response to threatening stimuli is an important task of the human visual and motor systems, and is especially challenging when stimuli are ambiguous. This study investigates the perception, evaluation and fast response to ambiguous natural spider stimuli in spider-fearful and non-anxious participants.
   Methods: Stimuli were created by gradually morphing natural images of spiders and non-spiders (a crab, a starfish, a bunch of keys, and a flower). In Study 1, participants rated the images on perceptual and emotional dimensions and responded to them in a response priming task to measure rapid information processing. In Study 2, results were validated and extended in a different paradigm by using a go/no-go task.
   Results: As expected, spider-fearful participants showed an interpretative bias for ambiguous stimuli (i.e., perceived them as more similar to spiders) and rated spider(-like) stimuli as more unpleasant, arousing, and disgusting. In Study 1, spider stimuli were preferentially processed in spider-fearful participants as observed in faster responses to spider targets-however, responses were not different to comparison participants for ambiguous stimuli. Study 2 suggests that this finding can be explained by differences in stimulus duration.
   Limitations: No participants with positive attitudes towards spiders or a second fearful comparison group were included.
   Conclusions: We suggest that these findings can be explained by the nature of the applied tasks that tap into early phases of visual processing, thereby relying on feedforward-mediated low-spatial-frequency information extracted via the fast, subcortical path to the amygdala.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the risks and opportunities associated with Facebook usage and to explore the moderating role of psychosocial (mal)adjustment, nationality and age in these relationships. This correlational study involved a sample of 452 Brazilian and 500 Portuguese youths, aged between 14 and 20 years. Results showed that these youths spent a daily average of 61-120 minutes on Facebook, three to four times per week, displaying a positive attitude towards its use. These characteristics were most notable in the Brazilian youths [t(950) = 5.64, p < .001; 1(950) = -5.07, p < .001; and t(950) = - 6.85, p < .001, respectively]. The Portuguese youths ran more risks than the Brazilians [1(950) = 6.36, p < .001], but both youths equally enjoyed the opportunities. In the case of the Portuguese youths, the risks and opportunities were moderated by the frequency of use, in other words "the higher the usage, the more risks and opportunities" (beta = -235 p < .001and beta = -.167, p < .001, respectively). The psychosocial adjustment indicators did not moderate the effects of Facebook usage habits in risks and opportunities. The less psychosocially adjusted youths were those who ran more risks and also made the most of the opportunities. The results are discussed in light of the role of psychological, socio-cultural and developmental factors.

AB  - More and more people make opinions on air quality on social media, as science develops and the seriousness of air quality issues. Studies on sentiment analysis keyed to this kind of public opinions will do help in the introduction and perfection of policy of air quality. The evaluation of opinions sentiment is still a hard point in at this stage. There are only a few researches about the factors of the value of opinions sentiment. This article uses opinions related to air quality from Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) users, by online questionnaire surveys, and studies the results of opinions sentiment value about air quality in different groups, aiming at doing a research on the evaluation influence factors of opinions sentiment value on air quality. Furthermore, we came up with a solution synthesizing the influential level to calculate opinions sentiment value. We found amounts of respondents had a negative attitude to the opinions. We can now say with some confidence that education is the most significant influence factor on the public to tell the degree of sentiment level of air quality opinions. The sentiment calculation method where we come up could reduce the one-sidedness of different individuals' evaluations of the same opinion to some extent. The research could be reference for air quality management from the perspective of public opinion sentiment analysis.

AB  - Consumers are increasingly watching and sharing promotional and persuasive videos online via YouTube and other social media. Recent research has begun to explore both the content characteristics and the user motivations behind bona fide "viral" hits. The current study explores how both user motivations and emotional content of video messages containing the arousing emotion of disgust influence sharing intention among an undergraduate student sample (N = 456) and representative U.S. adult sample (N = 455). Some results mirror previous research and theory: Greater arousal and emotional response experienced while viewing was predictive of increased sharing intent across video message types and sources, as were positive attitudes and perceived social norms concerning sharing. Unique results also emerged in the data, revealing that advertising video messages elicited greater sharing intent than news videos and user-generated videos. In line with functional theories of disgust, videos which elicited higher-order, socio-moral disgust led to greater sharing intent than those that elicited sexual and pathogen avoidance disgusts. Implications for marketers and content creators are discussed.

AB  - We propose to use ambient sound as a privacy-aware source of information for COVID-19-related social distance monitoring and contact tracing. The aim is to complement currently dominant Bluetooth Low Energy Received Signal Strength Indicator (BLE RSSI) approaches. These often struggle with the complexity of Radio Frequency (RF) signal attenuation, which is strongly influenced by specific surrounding characteristics. This in turn renders the relationship between signal strength and the distance between transmitter and receiver highly non-deterministic. We analyze spatio-temporal variations in what we call "ambient sound fingerprints". We leverage the fact that ambient sound received by a mobile device is a superposition of sounds from sources at many different locations in the environment. Such a superposition is determined by the relative position of those sources with respect to the receiver. We present a method for using the above general idea to classify proximity between pairs of users based on Kullback-Leibler distance between sound intensity histograms. The method is based on intensity analysis only, and does not require the collection of any privacy sensitive signals. Further, we show how this information can be fused with BLE RSSI features using adaptive weighted voting. We also take into account that sound is not available in all windows. Our approach is evaluated in elaborate experiments in real-world settings. The results show that both Bluetooth and sound can be used to differentiate users within and out of critical distance (1.5 m) with high accuracies of 77% and 80% respectively. Their fusion, however, improves this to 86%, making evident the merit of augmenting BLE RSSI with sound. We conclude by discussing strengths and limitations of our approach and highlighting directions for future work.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the barriers and facilitators for allied health professional's participation in pressure ulcer prevention.
   Design Mixed method cohort study.
   Setting Single centre study in an acute university hospital trust.
   Participants Five physiotherapists and four occupational therapists were recruited from the hospital trust. Therapists had been working in the National Health Service (NHS) for a minimum of one year.
   Main outcome measures Therapist views and experiences were collated using an audio recorded focus group. This recording was analysed using constant comparison analysis. Secondary outcomes included assessment of attitudes and knowledge of pressure ulcer prevention using questionnaires.
   Results Key themes surrounding barriers to participation in pressure ulcer prevention included resources (staffing and equipment), education and professional boundaries. Fewer facilitators were described, with new training opportunities and communication being highlighted. Results from the questionnaires showed the therapists had a positive attitude towards pressure ulcer prevention with a median score of 81% (range 50 to 83%). However, there were gaps in knowledge with a median score of 69% (range 50 to 77%).
   Conclusions The therapist reported several barriers to pressure ulcer prevention and few facilitators. The primary barriers were resources, equipment and education. Attitudes and knowledge in AHPs were comparable to data previously reported from experienced nursing staff. (C) 2016 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Job satisfaction is a core variable in the study and practice of organizational psychology because of its implications for desirable work outcomes. Knowledge of its antecedents is abundant and informative, but there are still psychological processes underlying job satisfaction that have not received complete attention. This is the case of employee emotion regulation. In this study, we argue that employees' behaviors directed to manage their affective states participate in their level of job satisfaction and hypothesize that employee affect-improving and -worsening emotion regulation behaviors increase and decrease, respectively, job satisfaction, through the experience of positive and negative affect. Using a diary study with a sample of professionals from diverse jobs and organizations, for the most part, the mediational hypotheses were supported by the results albeit a more complex relationship was found in the case of affect worsening emotion regulation. This study contributes to expanding the job satisfaction and emotion regulation literatures and informs practitioners in people management in organizations about another route to foster and sustain positive attitudes at work.

AB  - Using an innovative fabrication technique, eco-friendly faux leather (EFFL) has been newly developed as a green leather alternative for the Chinese and Korean markets. Value-belief-attitude logic drawn from the heuristic-systemic model (Zuckmand and Chaiken in Psychol Mark 15(7):621-642, 1998) and value-belief-norm theory (Stern et al. in Environ Behav 27(6):723-743, 1995) is proposed to explicate the consumer acceptance attitudes toward the EFFL product. The findings from the multi-group structural equation modeling analysis of online data (n = 600) support the relevancy of VBA logic in which utilitarian and hedonic value motivate pro-environmental belief, and the EFFL product attributes significantly mediate belief and positive attitude toward the EFFL product. The discrepancies across two countries and two age cohorts are noteworthy when pro-environmental belief and product-related information lead to different consumer VBA processes in specific market segments. This study presents insights which provide novel opportunities for managerial implementations and theoretical advancements in eco-friendly related subjects and issues.

AB  - Extensive reading has been used as an approach to L2 instruction in foreign language contexts, where there is a need to provide rich and extensive input to learners. Previous research has shown that this type of instructional intervention is associated with improved performance in L2 reading comprehension and writing, as well as with increased positive attitudes toward L2 reading. However, not enough research has investigated the factors that mediate its effectiveness with young L2 learners. This study investigated the role of L1 reading-related factors in L2 learning under extensive reading-while-listening instruction. The findings of the study indicated a relationship between L2 learning gains in writing and positive L1 reading attitudes, a supportive reading environment at home, mother's reading interest, and parents' education level. The study concluded that extensive L2 reading-while-listening instruction allows some learners to gain additional benefits, but without disadvantaging the others. This has implications for teaching programs in the primary school context investigated, which should take learner background profiles into account when implementing this type of L2 instruction.

AB  - This study examines the direct impact of three dimensions of the institutional environment on managerial attitudes toward the natural environment and the direct influence of the latter on the environmental sustainability orientation (ESO) of small firms. We contend that when the institutional environment is perceived by owner-managers as supportive of sound natural environment management practices, they are more likely to develop a positive attitude toward natural environment issues and concerns. Such owner-manager attitudes are likely to lead to a positive and proactive orientation of their firms toward environmental sustainability. The study uses survey data from 166 small manufacturing firms located in three Philippine cities. First, the study develops and tests the measurement models to examine the validity of the constructs representing the firm's institutional environment, managerial attitudes toward the natural environment and the ESO of firms. Second, the study develops and tests the structural models examining the institutional environment-managerial attitudes-ESO linkages. Multi-sample invariance structural model analysis shows the mediating role of managerial attitudes in the institutional environment-ESO nexus. The findings show that ESO is a construct comprising three dimensions: knowledge of environmental issues, sustainable practices and commitment toward environmental sustainability. The cognitive, regulatory and normative elements of the institutional environment are strongly linked to positive managerial attitudes toward environmental sustainability, which in turn, positively influences the firm's overall ESO. Managerial attitudes play a mediating role in the institutional environment-ESO linkages. The managerial, practical, research and policy implications of the research findings are discussed.

AB  - Background: The patient's understanding of the illness may mediate beliefs towards its treatment. There is a paucity of studies examining the relationships between these variables in depression. This study was conducted to know the relationships between explanatory models and attitude to medication in depression. Materials and Methods: 494 patients with depression in remission were assessed with sociodemographic proforma, Drug Attitude Inventory, and Mental Distress Explanatory Model Questionnaire. Results: A favorable attitude toward medication was observed in 57.49% of participants. Mean scores on MDEMQ subscales Stress, Western Physiology, Non-Western Physiology, and Supernatural were 32.96, 21.87, 10.06, and 47.55, respectively. Statistically significant associations were found between attitude towards medication and the patient's marital status (more negative attitude with single status, chi 2 = 11.72, df = 3, P = 0.008) and occupation (more negative attitude among unemployed patients, chi(2) = 4.17, df = 1, P = 0.041). The scores of explanatory models did not differ based on positive or negative drug attitude. Conclusion: Though explanatory models are not linked to patient attitudes toward medication, patients who are single or unemployed have a negative attitude toward medications. Such negative attitude may impair compliance and worsen patient outcomes.

AB  - Before herd immunity is reached, preventive practices still play an important role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Adherence to preventive behaviors could be determined by individuals' health beliefs, which would be influenced by antecedent factors such as previous exposure to pandemic stressors. Applying the health belief model (HBM), this study aims to examine the mediation association among COVID-19 stressors, HBM constructs, and preventive behaviors. Longitudinal data were collected from 1225 Chinese college students using web-based surveys at wave 1 (w1; between January 31 and February 11, 2020) and wave 2 (w2; between March 20 and April 3, 2020). Participants reported their COVID-19 stressors (w1), five HBM constructs (w2), and preventive behaviors (w1 and w2). Paired t-tests suggested that social distancing and self-quarantine behaviors decreased while precautionary behaviors increased from w1 to w2. Path analysis indicated that two HBM constructs (perceived barriers and self-efficacy) mediated the association between COVID-19 stressors and precautionary behaviors. These findings suggested that tailored prevention intervention for college students should attend to perceived barriers and self-efficacy. Individuals who exposed to multiple pandemic stressors merit particular attention and intervention should account for their early pandemic stress experiences.

AB  - Many people perceive climate change as psychologically distant-a set of uncertain events that might occur far in the future, impacting distant places and affecting people dissimilar to themselves. In this study, we employed construal level theory to investigate whether a climate change communication intervention could increase public engagement by reducing the psychological distance of climate change. Australian residents (N = 333) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: one framed to increase psychological distance to climate change (distal frame), and the other framed to reduce psychological distance (proximal frame). Participants then completed measures of psychological distance of climate change impacts, climate change concern, and intentions to engage in mitigation behavior. Principal components analysis indicated that psychological distance to climate change was best conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of four components: geographic, temporal, social, and uncertainty. Path analysis revealed the effect of the treatment frame on climate change concern and intentions was fully mediated by psychological distance dimensions related to uncertainty and social distance. Our results suggest that climate communications framed to reduce psychological distance represent a promising strategy for increasing public engagement with climate change.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to propose a research framework to examine the effects of consumer consciousness, food safety concern and healthy lifestyle on the attitudes toward eating "green" simultaneously in a single study. Besides, the mediating role of healthy lifestyle in forming a positive attitude toward eating "green" is also examined in this study. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire-based approach was applied in this study. The unit of analysis was individual consumer (aged 18 years and above) who lived in Klang Valley, Malaysia. PLS-SEM was used to test the structural relationship of the constructs in the model based on the 300 useable data collected. Findings The results indicated that health consciousness, food safety concern and healthy lifestyle have a significant effect on attitudes toward eating "green", whereas environmental and price consciousness did not have such effect. A healthy lifestyle also mediates the relationship between health consciousness and attitude toward eating "green". An individual's healthy lifestyle that focused on physical health-related activities will increase the effect of consumer health consciousness on their attitudes toward eating "green". Practical implications The outcome of this study provided deeper insights for firms to assess the feasibility of entering or expanding their operations in the green market with more enduring and effective sales and marketing strategies. Originality/value Consumers' acceptance of or resistance toward organic food had become the centre of the research focus by the academician and the industrial practitioners over the years, despite the inconsistencies of the results obtained to predict such behavior. In this study, besides examining the direct effect of the proposed variables on the attitudes toward eating "green", the mediating role of a healthy lifestyle in forming such attitudes was also examined.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and currently becomes a serious cause of death worldwide. It is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 belonging to a family known as corona virus. The aim of this study is to assess the community knowledge, attitude and practice strategy implementation on SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). A cross-sectional survey study was done from July to October, 2020 in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia. Interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 404 respondents. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test with a 95% confidence interval to know the association of socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. From a total of 404 responses collected (64.1%, n = 259/404), (50.7%, n = 205/404) and (39.6%, n = 160/404) of the respondents were between ages 18-39 years, males and were diploma and above, respectively. The majority of the respondents had good knowledge about the transmission mode and symptoms of COVID-19 and they obtained information mainly through mass media. The knowledge of the respondents about the transmission mode of COVID-I9 through coughing and sneezing, direct contact with infected person and touching contaminated materials was statistically associated with education and occupation (p <0.001). Among the total respondents (53.7%, n = 217/404) had a negative attitude that COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled. The attitude of the respondents towards successfully controlling of COVID-I9 was statistically associated in terms of age, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.001). Most of the respondents (63.1%, n = 255/404), (58.9%, n = 238/404), (66.8%, n = 270/404) and (63.9%, n = 258/404) did not wash hands with soap, avoidance of touching the nose and mouth, practicing social distancing and wearing of face masks in public or crowded places, respectively. The practices of the respondents towards COVID-19 were statistically associated with sex, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.01). COVID-19 is currently the cause of death and it has a great impact on the economy, politics and social interactions in the study area. The government should strength the health system by increasing surveillance activities in detecting cases. Our findings suggest that the community should practice the WHO and EMoH recommendations to minimize the spread of the virus.

AB  - A stochastic model estimated the consequences of a COVID-19 super spreader event occurring in the local municipality of Stavanger, Norway as a result of a night on the town. The model imposed different infection control regulations and compared these different scenarios. For Stavanger's 161 locations of service, secondary transmissions from a super spreader event was estimated to infect a median of 37, requiring the quarantining of 200 guests given no infection control regulations, 23 and 167 when imposing social distancing regulations and other hygienic infection control measures, 7 infected and 63 quarantined guests with restrictions placed on the guest capacity, and 4 infected and 57 quarantined guests with both forms of restriction in use.

AB  - As a setting, prisons offer a unique opportunity to invest in the health of disadvantaged and marginalised populations and address health inequalities and social exclusion - thereby achieving sustainable improvements in well-being for offenders and their families and in turn, helping to reduce rates of re-offending. This article draws on English and French experiences and doctoral research to advocate a shift from a pathogenic model towards a salutogenic model of health as a helpful way to address inequalities and thus, by promoting joined-up working across justice and wider systems, impact positively beyond health' for the effective resettlement of prisoners. The paper utilises examples from horticulture to further argue the powerful role of nature in the prison setting in mediating aspects of culture particularly relating to processes of socialisation. Critical success lies in bridging across systems and a commitment to joined-up working at all levels across and beyond prison.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate social media posts regarding pilon fractures and its relationship to patient injury perception. We evaluated Instagram media posts in patients who have suffered pilon fractures for the following variables: gender, tone, discussion of rehabilitation, activities of daily living (ADL) reference, incision/scar reference, pain, post of radiograph/imaging, external fixation reference, discussion of bracing/splinting, pre- or postoperative swelling, and need for reoperation. Results were determined by comparing each variable to gender and tone of the post to study patient injury perception. Methods: Public Instagram posts from within a 1-year time period were isolated and evaluated using the hashtag "#pilonfracture." Individual posts were analyzed by authors. In total, 241 patient posts were included for investigation and analysis of patient injury perception via social media. Results: Of all included posts, 88% of posts had a positive tone. A majority of the posts (66.8%) mentioned rehabilitation and postoperative progress. There were significant associations between positive tone and rehabilitation (P = .0001), as well as positive tone and ADLs (P = .0361). Conclusion: Reported outcomes after surgical management of pilon fractures are generally poor. Nonetheless, this analysis of patients sharing their experience on social media after open reduction internal fixation of pilon fractures demonstrates a mostly positive attitude toward the injury and recovery. A positive tone of the post was significantly associated with mentions of rehabilitation and ADLs.

AB  - This study examined whether news stories about violent shooting homicides impact implicit and explicit attitudes about race. To explore these relationships, the authors used a 3 (race: White, Black, control) x 3 (role: victim, perpetrator, control) x 3 (multiple messages) mixed factorial design. The study found that high social dominant-oriented (SDO) individuals expressed more empathy in general, with the most empathy toward Black perpetrators in homicide news stories in comparison to low SDO individuals. Ironically, for high SDO individuals, perpetrators in the stories received more explicit negative Black stereotyping than victim in the stories. These findings indicate that aversive racism occurs in the processing of news stories. This has practical implications for journalists because stereotyping and bias in news coverage could reinforce aversive racism.

AB  - The onset of technological innovations (mobile and handhelds, virtual reality, multi-touch screens, and interactive 3D) have provided creative ideas and perspectives for online communication, dissemination, and protection of cultural heritage for costume museums. Digital costume museums (DCM) digitized clothing collections for the Internet, conducive to enhancing visitors' understanding, enjoyment, and positive attitudes and stimulating further learning, experience, and exploration. However, little attention has been paid to the influence and effects of these technologies on visitors' experience toward digital costume museums. Improving users' behavior intention and expanding the influence of digital costume museums are issues that need further discussion. In this study, we expand the technology acceptance model (TAM) by adding information quality and information richness as the system characteristics, constructing the research model, and 11 hypotheses of users' behavior intention toward digital costume museums. Analysis of data collected from 265 costume-related respondents reveal that information quality (IQ) positively influences perceived convenience (PC) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), while information richness (IR) has a positive impact on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived playfulness (PP). The finding also reveals that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived playfulness (PP) are significant predictors of users' behavior intention (BI) toward using digital costume museums. The research conclusion enriches academic theories and brings practical inspiration for managers, curators, and practitioners to construct and innovate digital costume museums.

AB  - It has recently been found that individuals high in autistic traits tend to believe that they are usually not treated fairly. In the present study, it is assumed that such a lowered personal belief in a just world is based on cumulative humiliation experiences that stem from autistic pragmatic language problems (e.g., communicating in a monotonous voice, not being "in tune" with others during conversations). Furthermore, the less individuals believe that they receive fair treatment, the more they may develop a negative attitude toward human nature (i. e., believing that humans are generally untrustworthy, unfair, and unhelpful). The serial multiple mediation model reflecting these assumptions received initial empirical support in a nonclinical sample (N = 344). Implications for professional health care are addressed.

AB  - The thousands of deaths and disabilities due to workplace accidents and injuries each year emphasize the importance of safety research. Despite occupational safety research that has contributed to identifying antecedents of safety, little is known about why and how safety knowledge leads to safety behaviours and how personal and situational factors interact to promote occupational safety. Using a multilevel, multisource, and time-lagged research design, the present study investigates whether safety knowledge affects safety behaviours through safety attitudes and further tests whether supervisory safety attitudes can impact the strength of these relationships and play a role as moderators of the proposed mediated relationship. Data were collected from workers (N = 177) and supervisors (N = 42) in a construction company in the energy industry at two time points. Results indicate full support for the moderated mediation model, demonstrating that worker safety attitudes partially mediate the relationship between safety knowledge and safety behaviours. Moreover, when supervisors had positive attitudes towards safety, both the direct relationship between worker safety attitudes and safety behaviours and the indirect relationship between safety knowledge and safety behaviours were more positive compared to when supervisors had negative safety attitudes. Theoretical and practical implications for occupational safety are discussed.

AB  - Background: Although peer-to-peer contact might empower patients in various ways, studies show that only a few patients actually engage in support groups.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to explore factors that facilitate or impede engagement in face-to-face and online peer support, using the Theory of Planned Behavior.
   Methods: A questionnaire was completed by 679 patients being treated for arthritis, breast cancer, or fibromyalgia at two Dutch regional hospitals.
   Results: Our results showed that only a minority of the patients engaged in organized forms of peer support. In total 10% (65/679) of the respondents had engaged in face-to-face meetings for patients in the past year. Only 4% (30/679) of the respondents had contact with peers via the Internet in the past year. Patients were more positive about face-to-face peer support than about online peer support (P < .001). In accordance with the Theory of Planned Behavior, having a more positive attitude (P < .01) and feeling more supported by people in the social environment (P < .001) increased the intention to participate in both kinds of peer support. In addition, perceived behavioral control (P = .01) influenced the intention to participate in online peer support. Nevertheless, the intention to engage in face-to-face and online peer support was only modestly predicted by the Theory of Planned Behavior variables (R-2 = .33 for face-to-face contact and R-2 = .26 for online contact).
   Conclusion: Although Health 2.0 Internet technology has significantly increased opportunities for having contact with fellow patients, only a minority seem to be interested in organized forms of peer contact (either online or face-to-face). Patients seem somewhat more positive about face-to-face contact than about online contact.

AB  - As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, teaching in universities needed to be quickly transitioned from regular on-campus classes into technology-enhanced teaching formats. In this article, we present the case study of Chemnitz University of Technology (Germany), where digital classes were introduced in a matter of weeks. By analyzing syllabus data, we found that the use of video and video conferencing is an important current development. Related to these findings, we present evidence from instructional psychology and social media research that can help in the design of teaching during this crisis. We highlight the need for multimodal learning, that is, learning settings that use multiple sensory modalities. Importantly, we present a strategy of hybrid campuses for this and potential future emergencies. This approach describes how the social distancing measures currently in effect can be used to re-think higher education based on a reasonable use of technology. Taken together, the COVID-19 crisis can be a time of major reform in higher education that will accelerate the process of digitalization in an unprecedented way.

AB  - This article analyses the political style of the Dutch nationalist-populist celebrity politician Geert Wilders and examines the ways in which his self-stylisation epitomises both the strategic use of national imagery, and the affective embodiment of associated sentiments in his public persona. Using insights from imagology, we argue, firstly, that Wilders' use of national images allows him to align himself with the traditional narrative of Dutch collective resistance to foreign rule and thus to authenticate his political attitude as compliant with that of the Dutch national character. Secondly, turning to the field of celebrity studies, we demonstrate that this self-stylisation also involves a form of emotional work. In speeches, texts, campaign advertisements, and tweets, Wilders projects an affectively charged public self that 'moves' the audience and lends a sense of urgency to his politics as well as a feeling of authenticity to his political persona.

AB  - Are people's perceptions of the newsworthiness of events biased by a tendency to rate as more important any news story that seems likely to lead others to share their own political attitudes? To assess this, we created six pairs of hypothetical news stories, each describing an event that seemed likely to encourage people to adopt attitudes on the opposite side of a particular controversial issue (e.g. affirmative action and gay marriage). In total, 569 subjects were asked to evaluate the importance of these stories 'to the readership of a general-circulation newspaper', disregarding how interesting they happened to find the event. Subjects later indicated their own personal attitudes to the underlying political issues. Predicted crossover interactions were confirmed for all six issues. All the interactions took the form of subjects rating stories offering 'ammunition' for their own side of the controversial issue as possessing greater intrinsic news importance.

AB  - In this study, we develop an evolutionary game model to analyze how human relations evolve in a context characterized by declining face-to-face interactions and growing online social participation. Our results suggest that online networks may constitute a coping response allowing individuals to defend their social life from increasing busyness and a reduction in the time available for leisure. Internet-mediated interaction can play a positive role in preventing the disruption of ties and the weakening of community life documented by empirical studies. In this scenario, the digital divide is likely to become an increasingly relevant factor of social exclusion, which may exacerbate inequalities in well-being and capabilities.

AB  - Aims: Little is known about the influence of parents' screen media habits and attitudes towards screen media on children's screen use. We investigated associations of parental screen use, their smartphone addiction and screen media attitudes, with children's recreational screen use. Methods: This study was based on a population-based cross-sectional survey sent between May 2019 and November 2020 to a random sample of 6820 Danish parent-child dyads who answered questions regarding their screen media habits. Children were 6-11 years of age and had to reside with the parent. Multivariable adjusted regression analyses were conducted (in October 2021) separately for screen media use on weekdays and weekend days. Results: The analyses included 5437 parents (41.0 years, 67.6% girls) and 5437 children (8.9 years, 48.2% girls). The adjusted relative odds of excessive amounts of screen use of children (>3 hours/weekday and >4 hours/weekend day) was 5.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6; 7.3) on weekdays and 7.2 (95% CI 5.9; 8.8) on weekend days comparing the fourth and first quartile of parental screen use. Children of parents in the fourth quartile of parental screen use had 2.1 (95% CI 1.7; 2.5) and 2.5 (95% CI 2.2; 3.0) greater odds of screen use before bedtime on all week and weekend days, respectively. Children of parents who had a positive attitude towards their child's screen use or were at high risk of smartphone addiction had significantly higher screen use and more frequent problematic screen use. Conclusions: Parent's screen media habits and attitudes were strongly associated with their children's recreational screen use.

AB  - Background: This study examines the evidence for a third- person effect (TPE) in the reactions of individuals affected by depression to direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements for antidepressants. TPE predicts that people will perceive the self to be less vulnerable to such advertisements than others. Previous research has identified such an effect, but did so in general population surveys. Past Previous research has also found a link between depression and diminished self-serving biases; whether this would be the case for TPE is unknown. Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 148 participants in an Internet depression support group to investigate their perceptions of the influence of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements for antidepressants. Results: Consistent with expectations derived from third-person effect TPE research, participants, although relatively neutral in their attitudes toward such advertisements, nevertheless perceived other individuals with depression as more influenced than themselves. Positive attitudes towards DTC advertisements and depressive symptoms at the time of the survey were each negatively associated with this third-person perception (TPE). Conclusions: Individuals who have been diagnosed with depression and who participated in an online depression support group believe that they are less vulnerable to the influence of DTC advertisements than the typical person with a history of depression. This is moderated by attitudes towards DTC advertisements as well as by depressive symptoms, each of which is associated with a weakened TPE. Depression and Anxiety 28:160-165, 2011.

AB  - Background Stigma associated with mental disorders is rooted among many pharmacists, and represents a major barrier to patient support in community-based psychiatry. We developed an assessment scale that is specifically designed to assess the level of stigma that pharmacists may have toward schizophrenia, and then examined the effects of reducing stigma with an educational program that focuses on communication with patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (PDS) using the newly developed Stigma Scale towards Schizophrenia for Community Pharmacists (SSCP). Methods SSCP was developed by exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation based on responses from 822 randomly selected community pharmacists. Furthermore, a randomized controlled trial was conducted for 115 community pharmacists to clarify the effects of reducing the stigma of schizophrenia using an educational program for them with a focus on communication with PDS. Participants were individually allocated to two groups: educational lecture group (56; only attending a lecture on schizophrenia) or contact-based intervention group (59; communicating with PDS and attending the lecture). The stigma assessment using SSCP was conducted immediately before and after the educational intervention. Results A total of 4 factors and 27 items were extracted from the exploratory factor analysis to comprise the SSCP. Cronbach's alpha of SSCP, social distance at professional pharmacy service (factor I), attitudes towards PDS (factor II), self-disclosure (factor III), and social distance in personal (factor IV) were 0.89, 0.88, 0.76, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. Educational program-related changes of the median (interquartile range) total SSCP score from baseline were - 9.0 (- 16.0 - - 5.0) in the contact-based intervention group and - 3.0 (- 7.0-1.0) in the educational lecture group, reflecting a significant reduction of stigma levels in the contact-based intervention group. On examining the SSCP subscales, scores for factor I and factor II significantly improved. The educational program was more effective for pharmacists aged 20-39 years or with negligible experience of communicating with PDS at work and/or in private life. Conclusions SSCP and the educational program for community pharmacists that focuses on communication with PDS were useful for assessing and reducing, respectively, the stigma attached by these pharmacists to schizophrenia.

AB  - In this article, we investigate the integration of concept-based pragmatics instruction, grounded in Vygotskian sociocultural psychology, in an intact second-semester French class (n = 13) over the course of an academic term. Our focus is on learners' appropriation of the concepts of self-presentation, social distance, and power with respect to the French second-person pronoun system (i.e., tu versus vous) as revealed through language awareness questionnaires, appropriateness judgment tasks, and computer-mediated strategic interaction scenario performances. Following this three-tiered approach to analysis, our findings show that learners developed a deeper and more systematic understanding of tu and vous, that they were able to apply the concepts in planning language use, and that their use of tu and vous became more sensitive to maintaining symmetrical social relationships.

AB  - Precautionary measures of physical isolation, social distancing, and masks have all aided in controlling the spread of COVID-19. However, detection of the virus is crucial to implement isolation of infected individuals. This paper presents the innovative repurposing of lab materials, workspace, and personnel in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown and consequential shortage of commercially made virus transport media (VTM). This method for VTM production highlights the ability of standard research labs to fulfill the needs of those affected by the pandemic and potential recurrence of outbreaks. Further, the collaboration of the various entities at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) allowed for efficient production and distribution of VTM tubes to facilitate mass COVID-19 testing. We propose that implementation of this process by university research labs would enable quicker interventions, potentially better outcomes, and prevention of further spread of disease.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly threatened the global health system and triggered the public health emergency. In order to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare and prevention information have been delivered through omni-media channels (e.g., television, radio, social platform, etc.). As a traditional outlet, the short message service (SMS) can timely provide abundant anti-epidemic alerts to mobile users. In this paper, we aim to investigate mobile users' attitudes toward COVID-19 public-interest SMS sent from government authorities and then explore the insight from messaging texts collected between January and April 2020 in China. In general, respondents show a positive attitude towards content and the necessity of public-interest SMS during the pandemic. However, we find that gender and age differences not only affect content evaluation, but also influence reading and forwarding behaviors. For the necessity of SMS, it shows significant difference between the 18-25-year-old and over 40-year-old group, with the middle and elder group showing serious attitudes and giving higher remarks than the youth due to the habits of media usage. However no significant difference is presented between females and males. In terms of content, the category of topics and releasing institutions are analyzed, respectively. Due to the centralized responses and coordination of prevention and control in China, the messages from COVID-19 disposal organizations (e.g., municipal steering group and provincial CDC) account for more than 70% among four cities.

AB  - Recent Census Bureau projections indicate that racial/ethnic minorities will comprise over 50% of the U.S. population by 2042, effectively creating a so-called majority-minority nation. Across four experiments, we explore how presenting information about these changing racial demographics influences White Americans' racial attitudes. Results reveal that exposure to the changing demographics evokes the expression of greater explicit and implicit racial bias. Specifically, Whites exposed to the racial demographic shift information preferred interactions/settings with their own ethnic group over minority ethnic groups; expressed more negative attitudes toward Latinos, Blacks, and Asian Americans; and expressed more automatic pro-White/anti-minority bias. Perceived threat to Whites' societal status mediated the effects of the racial shift information on explicit racial attitudes. These results suggest that rather than ushering in a more tolerant future, the increasing diversity of the nation may instead yield intergroup hostility. Implications for intergroup relations and media framing of the racial shift are discussed.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of cyberbullying using a mixed method approach, by combining interviews, focus groups and a survey of 7,000 students. In the inductive stage, and following an axial coding analysis, we identified 153 concepts related to conflicts, which were divided into three thematic units to explain the greater impact of cyberbullying: (1) social distance; (2) privacy exposure; and (3) range of the material. The survey concluded that: (1) the victims of bullying and cyberbullying present higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of social well-being compared to non-bullied students, and those who were bullied in both channels presented higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of social well-being than those who were bullied in only one of them; (2) the victims of cyberbullying showed lower levels of individual well-being compared with those who had never been bullied, as with those who suffered face-to-face bullying. This difference was explained by testimonies indicating that most of the cyberbullying was related to intimate content, which has a higher impact on image perception.

AB  - The quality of stockmanship has a major influence on farm animal welfare and productivity. Farmers' attitudes are reflected in their behavior toward animals which, in turn, affects animal behavior, welfare and productivity. Yet attitudes toward behaviors that are positive for the animal's welfare have been neglected in previous studies on farmers' attitudes. Our objective was to examine the relationship between farmers' attitudes toward improvement of animal welfare and productivity of the animals. In a framework of the theory of planned behavior, we used a conceptualization of the improvement of animal welfare based on an earlier on-farm interview and questionnaire studies of farmers' methods for constructing such behavior as an object of evaluation, and standardized production parameters that make farms comparable. Psycho-social, production and demographic data from 124 farms were subjected to correlation analyses. Among the farmers' attitudes and attitude-related perceptions, the significance of subjective norms, as well as perceived importance and ease of improving animal welfare, had relevant associations with piglet productivity. The most powerful factor related with several production parameters was the perceived significance of researchers and other specialists as a source of a subjective norm: appreciating researchers was associated with more piglets born, lower piglet mortality and more weaned piglets. Considering it easy to provide the animals with a favorable environment correlated negatively with piglet mortality and positively with the number of weaned piglets. The importance of humane treatment of animals was positively correlated with the number of weaned piglets, as was the perceived ease of catering for the farmer's own well-being. Studying the production parameters of the distinctively positively-oriented farmers' pigs in relation to the average production figures strengthened these results: the farmers with the most positive attitudes (except for the perceived ease of catering for own well-being) gained 0.34-0.54 piglets per litter more than average farmers. In general, farmer attitudes were more strongly correlated with production parameters of gilts and piglets in first parity litters than of multiparous sows and their piglets. Farms with good results in terms of production parameters appeared to also be farms with farmer having more positive attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in relation to practices that improve the animals' welfare. The indicated link between farmers' attitudes and production parameters warrants further studies on how farmer behavior mediates this association and on causal relationships between attitudes, animal welfare and production.

AB  - The authors focus their attention on the current regime of self-isolation, which arose in the context of the spread of a new coronavirus infection. Currently, the Russian population is forced to change their social behavior adapting to the conditions dictated by the pandemic. Within this article, based on secondary data analysis, the authors consider the transformational contradictions of social behavior, highlighting the aspect of virtuality. On the part of social institutions there are new organizational and management strategies that are implemented through social distancing of citizens and wearing masks in public places, as we as the self-isolation of the population, the transition of professional activity to the remote mode. The reaction of the population is expressed in such social practices as distrust of social institutions represented by the state and the media, denial of the coronavirus, non-compliance with the self-isolation regime, fear of the economic crisis, the transition of labor activity to a remote mode, a change in the approach to consumption and its structure.

AB  - The concern with conflict in our schools has increased in recent years. For this reason, initiatives aimed at dealing with conflicts like educational mediation have emerged. The goal of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the M-Educa programme in its student training phase via an evaluative study of the pre- and post-measures of the CUVE3-EP questionnaire on school violence administered to 118 students in the fifth and sixth grades of primary school at a public school in the region of Madrid, and to analyse the records of the mediating students and the interviews of the tutors involved. The main conclusions of this study are that administering the M-Educa programme has had positive effects on coexistence at this school and was especially useful in the perception of the overall reduction in violence in the classes where most mediations took place. Specifically, it had the greatest repercussions on lowering the levels of verbal and physical violence, as well as social exclusion.

AB  - An online diary study was performed to investigate deception across different media. One hundred and four individuals participated in the study, with 76 completing the diaries. Individuals were most likely to lie on the telephone. Planned lies, which participants also rated the most serious, were more likely told via SMS (short message service) text messaging. Most lies were told to people participants felt closest to. The feature-based model provides a better account of the deceptions reported by participants than do media richness theory or social distance theory. However, the authors propose a reworked feature-based model to explain deception across different media. They suggest that instant messaging should be treated as a near synchronous mode of communication. We suggest that the model needs to distinguish between spontaneous and planned lies.

AB  - Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disorder in work and livelihood of a majority of the modern world. In this work, we review its major impacts on procedures and workflow of clinical physics tasks, and suggest alternate pathways to avoid major disruption or discontinuity of physics tasks in the context of small, medium, and large radiation oncology clinics. We also evaluate scalability of medical physics under the stress of "social distancing".
   Methods Three models of facilities characterized by the number of clinical physicists, daily patient throughput, and equipment were identified for this purpose. For identical objectives of continuity of clinical operations, with constraints such as social distancing and unavailability of staff due to system strain, however with the possibility of remote operations, the performance of these models was investigated. General clinical tasks requiring on-site personnel presence or otherwise were evaluated to determine the scalability of the three models at this point in the course of disease spread within their surroundings.
   Results The clinical physics tasks within three models could be divided into two categories. The former, which requires individual presence, include safety-sensitive radiation delivery, high dose per fraction treatments, brachytherapy procedures, fulfilling state and nuclear regulatory commission's requirements, etc. The latter, which can be handled through remote means, include dose planning, physics plan review and supervision of quality assurance, general troubleshooting, etc.
   Conclusion At the current level of disease in the United States, all three models have sustained major system stress in continuing reduced operation. However, the small clinic model may not perform if either the current level of infections is maintained for long or staff becomes unavailable due to health issues. With abundance, and diversity of innovative resources, medium and large clinic models can sustain further for physics-related radiotherapy services.

AB  - Controversial taboo appeals as an executional cue in viral advertising have commonly been used by advertisers. In this context, the study investigates the role of medium context on the effectiveness of controversial taboo ads. By implementing a tightly controlled experiment which deals with controversial taboo ads embedded in a press article and in a viral context, the study finds that the viral medium context does not lead to a more positive attitude toward the embedded brand or to more positive purchase intentions. In addition, a viral medium context triggers `unintended consequences' that lead consumers to undermine the level of tabooness of the viral advertising and subjective norms. To increase the external validity of the research, the results were replicated for two kinds of controversial taboo appeals; one related to sexuality, and the other to death. The results provide useful implications for theory and practice. Extending viral advertising research, a different angle on controversial viral advertising has been taken, shifting from an advertiser and brand focus, to a societal and social one. The work leads to a better understanding of the ethics of controversial viral advertising, and demonstrates its role in the trivialization of taboo behaviors and imagery. The results confirm the need for more regulation of online buzz communication and encourage regulatory bodies to extend policies of viral advertising regulation.

AB  - Dadvertising-advertisements that portray dads as active caretakers-is predicted to be particularly relevant to men who are new or first-time fathers. This research tests a conceptual model for understanding the effects of anxiety, wishful identification, and emotional response on new and expectant dads' empowerment, attitude toward the dadvertisement, and attitude toward the brand. Six hypotheses were tested through a between-groups experimental design utilizing two ad stimuli-one that showed a progressive/nurturing dad and one that showed a hypermasculine/traditional dad. Findings indicate that dadvertisements depicting nurturing fathers were evaluated more positively on emotional responses, wishful identification, and progressive ad perceptions than hypermasculine/traditional portrayals. Increased anxiety was related to less positive emotions toward, and weakness perceptions of, the modern fatherhood ad stimulus, as well as less positive perceptions of, and wishful identification with, the advertisement. Finally, mediation effects were found among positive emotional responses, positive dad perceptions, and wishful identification on dadvertising outcome variables, including more positive attitudes toward the ad, brand, and empowerment. This research contributes to the understanding of consumer responses toward dadvertisements and the differing responses toward the portrayals of fatherhood in ads.

AB  - Advergames are increasingly popular for online advertising campaigns. However, few IS studies have investigated the effectiveness of this unique advertising strategy. This study sheds light on the effectiveness of advergames by studying three design factors of advergame: interactivity, fit, and expectancy. We use multiple dependent variables (e. g., attitude toward advergames, attitude toward brand, and purchase intention) to evaluate the effectiveness of advergames. Based on work from human-computer interaction research and the transportation theory, we propose two-way interaction effects of interactivity, fit, and expectancy on attitudes toward advergame, and also their main effects on attitude toward brand. A positive mediating relationship from attitude toward advergame to attitude toward brand, and to purchase intention is also hypothesized. We conducted a 2*2*2 factorial design experiment in an online 3D virtual world environment to test our hypotheses. The results show that, in the high fit condition, both high interactivity and low expectancy lead to a more favorable attitude toward advergames. However, in the low interactivity condition, low expectancy generates a more positive attitude toward advergames. Interactivity and attitude toward advergames have significant positive effects on attitude toward brand, which, in turn, positively impacts purchase intention.

AB  - Breast cancer and its treatment are particularly distressing for patients because of their potential impacts on body image. The most difficult phase of cancer treatment is usually the first year after a diagnosis. Cancer patients with strong resilience have the positive attitude, internal strength and external resources needed to cope with the disease and its treatment. This cross-sectional study investigated the mediator roles of hope and social support in the association between body image distress and resilience. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data for a convenience sample of 141 breast cancer patients undergoing treatment in southern Taiwan. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. The results showed that the final model had a good fit to the data and accounted for 51% of the total variance in resilience. The model of multiple parallel mediators of resilience revealed that hope and social support had mediator roles in the effect of body image distress on resilience. Hope had an important partial mediating role in the association between body image distress and resilience. Social support also had a partial mediating role in the relationship between body image distress and resilience. Social support did not directly affect resilience and indirectly affected resilience through hope. Psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing the impact of body image distress and increasing resilience in breast cancer patients should focus on cultivating hope and increasing social support, particularly support from family members and health professionals.</p>

AB  - This research paper aims to investigate the effect of utilizing Twitter in a foreign language classroom and how it would affect students' attitudes towards learning Arabic media related vocabulary. The researchers used qualitative and quantitative methods as a methodological approach to the study. The subjects of the study are American undergraduate students studying Arabic for their third semester, 11 participated in the study. The participants were asked to open Twitter accounts in order to practice reading up-to-date tweets from global news agencies. Participants took pre and post-tests, then were asked to take a questionnaire; a structured interview was also carried out along with reflections to have a better understanding of the students' attitude towards the use of Twitter in the classroom. The data were gathered throughout the semester and analyzed qualitatively and the participants' responses were coded for certain themes and then analyzed. The findings indicated that the students had a positive attitude towards the use of Twitter in learning vocabulary for specific topics -in this study media/political-related vocabulary- in the foreign language classroom. In addition, the quantitative data used as confirmation and showed vocabulary gains after the Twitter treatment. The study's findings can be applied to any foreign language and can have important implications and recommendations for language teachers and educators in the field. The findings will add valuable recommendations on how to integrate social media platforms in a foreign language classroom.

AB  - In this article we analyze data from high-quality surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom that included multiple symbolic and operational measures of political ideology and psychological orientations. Our overarching goal is to elucidate the nature of conceptual and empirical connections between neoliberalism and social conservatism. In so doing, we revisit three major questions about public opinion in neoliberal societies: (1) Are ordinary citizens "innocent" of ideology? (2) Are social and economic dimensions of ideology structurally and functionally independent? (3) Are support for laissez-faire capitalism and opposition to welfare-hallmarks of neoliberal ideology-unrelated or negatively related to authoritarianism? In contrast to previous investigations relying upon fewer and poorer measures, we found that ordinary citizens do indeed hold coherent political attitudes, and their attitudes about social and economic issues are closely aligned. For instance, we observed that for five previously published ideological instruments, social and economic attitudes were robustly correlated in two large U.S. samples (with rs ranging from .40 to .69)-for respondents who were relatively low (.31 <= r <= .60) as well as high in political sophistication (.50 <= r <= .77). Contradicting prior claims, we found no evidence that support for the free market was negatively associated with authoritarianism for any group of respondents or any measure of authoritarianism. On the contrary, economic conservatism and the endorsement of neoliberal attitudes were strongly associated with right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, economic system justification, and gender-specific system justification (with rs ranging from .53 to .76). We conclude that the political belief systems of ordinary citizens are coherently organized around support for versus opposition to both social and economic forms of inequality in contemporary capitalist societies.

AB  - Background Evidence so far shows that Waldorf students are characterized by average science achievement but at the same time high socioeconomic status and high science motivation. Moreover, Waldorf education is characterized by high emphasis on inquiry-based science education (IBSE). The present study investigates if the specific attitude-achievement constellation of Waldorf students in science may be explained by the high level of IBSE. Methods Propensity score matching was applied to control for Waldorf students' more advantageous social background using the Austrian PISA 2015 sample (N = 7007 15-year old students). After propensity score matching, 1107 matched controls were included alongside all 149 Waldorf students. Results The results show that Waldorf students report higher enjoyment in learning science and more interest in broad science topics than matched controls. On the other hand, they demonstrate lower science achievement. Mediation analyses show that, although Waldorf students' more positive attitudes towards science can be almost entirely attributed to their higher exposure to IBSE, their underperformance in science cannot. Conclusions These results indicate that attending a school type with a high level of IBSE (Waldorf) may have positive effects on attitudinal outcomes (enjoyment and interest in science) whereas it does not seem to have notable effects on science achievement. This indicates that IBSE could be applied in educational contexts aiming to increase students' scientific attitudes.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate radiologists' education, knowledge and skills of research, attitude toward evidence-based radiology (EBR), understanding of terms and use of related published work in clinical practice and the association between these variables and sociodemographic characteristics. We also aim to assess the availability of resources and to identify sources and the main barriers to implementing EBR.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 87 radiologists completed a questionnaire, which consisted of eight sections related to radiologists' demographic characteristics, and EBR-related questions. Descriptive statistics were used, and the association between EBR-related parts and sociodemographic characteristics was performed.
   Results: Ninety-three percent of the radiologists believed that EBR is necessary in practice. Only 40% received formal training in search strategies and 29.9% in critical appraisal of research literature during academic preparation. Moreover, 21-62% of the respondents completely understand specific terms related to EBR. Sixty-three percent stated that they can access relevant databases and the Internet at workplace. Research articles were only used by 24% to make a clinical decision. Almost 50% reported that they read or reviewed <= 1 article per month. The primary barrier to implementing EBR was the lack of colleagues' support. Understanding terms and the number of articles used in clinical decision were significantly related to education (P-value=0.001, 0.007) and hospital section (P-value=0.002, 0.027) respectively.
   Conclusion: Radiologists showed positive attitude toward EBR. However, there is a lack in information resources, colleagues' support, use of published literature, understanding of research terms and the ability of radiologists to access relevant databases at workplaces.

AB  - Adolescents spend a substantial part of their leisure time with playing games and using social media such as Facebook. The present paper examines the link between adolescents' computer and Internet activities and computer literacy (defined as the ability to work with a computer efficiently). A cross-sectional study with N = 200 adolescents, aged 17 on average, was conducted. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that an increase in time spent playing games on a PC/Mac was related to higher scores on practical and theoretical computer knowledge. Moreover, practical computer knowledge was higher for adolescents who liked playing shooters, fantasy games, or Facebook-games. Frequency of social media use was associated with higher scores in practical computer knowledge. A bootstrap analysis indicated that this relationship was mediated by a decrease in computer anxiety, not by more positive attitudes toward the computer. Gender yielded substantial main effects on the media literacy variables but the associations between the computer and Internet activities and the literacy aspects were similar for boys and girls. This study is expected to encourage future longitudinal research on adolescents' incidental learning during leisure time computer and Internet activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Social media platforms are integrated into the lives of students. Their use in education has been studied, but this research is scarce in nursing. The objective of this study was to develop and validate the questionnaire "Use and views of the social media for nursing education" through a pilot study, to describe the use and attitudes of nursing students to social media. Methods: Cross-sectional design to validate the modified scale "Students' Use and Views of the Social Media questionnaire." The sample consisted of 107 undergraduate nursing students. Results: The factor analysis extracted three main components to explain social media use for nursing education, with component 1 being the "Need to use media in my professional training," component 2-"To deepen my professional knowledge" and component 3 "Contrast information." High reliability was demonstrated with Chronbach's alpha value (0.84). Conclusion: The final tool was proven to have high validity and reliability values, so it is positioned as a viable tool to explore this reality. Students use social media for education in a high proportion and have positive attitudes regarding their education inclusion.

AB  - More research than ever before uses public opinion data to investigate society and politics in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Ethnic identities are widely theorized to mediate many of the political attitudes and behaviors that MENA surveys commonly seek to measure, but, to date, no research has systematically investigated how the observable ethnic category(s) of the interviewer may influence participation and answers given in Middle East surveys. Here we measure the impact of one highly salient and outwardly observable ascriptive attribute of interviewers-nationality-using data from an original survey experiment conducted in the Arab Gulf state of Qatar. Applying the total survey error (TSE) framework and utilizing an innovative nonparametric matching technique, we estimate treatment effects on both nonresponse error and measurement error. We find that Qatari nationals are more likely to begin and finish a survey, and respond to questions, when interviewed by a fellow national. Qataris also edit their answers to sensitive questions relating to the unequal status of citizens and noncitizens, reporting views that are more exclusionary and less positive toward out-group members, when the interviewer is a conational. The findings have direct implications for consumers and producers of a growing number of surveys conducted inside and outside the Arab world, where migration and conflict have made respondent-interviewer mismatches along national and other ethnic dimensions more salient and more common.

AB  - Grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies (GESTs) - like compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheels, lithium ion batteries, and pumped hydro storage - will play a key role in the decarbonisation of national electricity systems. While the public acceptability of energy infrastructure is important, little is known about public attitudes towards GESTs.
   This study presents the findings of an online survey (N = 2058), based upon the Comprehensive Technology Acceptance Framework, designed to provide insight into the nature of public attitudes towards GEST deployment in two Western industrialised nations, Canada (n = 1014) and the United Kingdom (n = 1044).
   We show here that public attitudes towards GESTs are positive in both countries. Participants showed a relative preference for pumped hydro (37-40% favoured this option) versus batteries (23-25%), compressed air (13-17%), flywheels (14%), or none (8-10%). Structural equation modelling was used to identify the predictors of general attitudes towards GEST deployment. General attitudes were directly predicted by positive and negative affect, perceived risks and benefits, and trust in developers. We also show that trust in developers and environmental worldviews are significant mediated predictors of general attitudes, and that our overall model of general attitudes was comparable within both countries.
   The findings hold implications for the design and delivery of public engagement and communication programmes pertaining to GESTs. They confirm the need to employ trusted communicators, reflect the potential value to using environmentally-framed messaging, and advocate in favour of approaches that both respond to the genuine concerns of citizens and are designed to promote more informed public discourse about their inclusion (or exclusion) in national electricity networks.

AB  - Starting from the intuition that people with high environmental concern have a better perception of public transport and therefore a better perception of the utility of public transport, we construct a theoretical model in which the effect of environmental concern on mode choice habits is mediated by the indirect utility of travel. Travel procures the direct utility of providing access to activities, but it also offers an indirect utility that is inherently personal and perceptual. We approach the indirect utility of public transport by measuring perceptions of time and feelings. The indirect utility of the car is approached by measuring affective and symbolic motives. Taking into account car use habits and habits of public transport use, the results show that people who have a high environmental concern perceive public transport use as easier, more useful and more pleasurable than people who do not have that environmental motivation. Such positive attitudes foster public transport use. Conversely, low environmental concern generates non-instrumental motives for car use, such as affective and symbolic motives. However, the relationship between affective and symbolic motives and car use habits is not robust. We can conclude that environmental concern influences mode choice habits and that the effect is partially mediated by perceptions and feelings towards public transport but not significantly by affective and symbolic motives for car use.

AB  - Background
   Can deliberate interaction between the public and persons affected by leprosy reduce stigmatization? The study described in this paper hypothesises that it can and assesses the effectiveness of a 'contact intervention'.
   Methods/Principal Findings
   This cluster-randomized controlled intervention study is part of the Stigma Assessment and Reduction of Impact (SARI) project conducted in Cirebon District, Indonesia. Testimonies, participatory videos and comics given or made by people affected by leprosy were used as methods to facilitate a dialogue during so-called 'contact events'. A mix of seven quantitative and qualitative methods, including two scales to assess aspects of stigma named the SDS and EMIC-CSS, were used to establish a baseline regarding stigma and knowledge of leprosy, monitor the implementation and assess the impact of the contact events. The study sample were community members selected using different sampling methods. The baseline shows a lack of knowledge about leprosy, a high level of stigma and contrasting examples of support. In total, 91 contact events were organised in 62 villages, directly reaching 4,443 community members (mean 49 per event). The interview data showed that knowledge about leprosy increased and that negative attitudes reduced. The adjusted mean total score of the EMIC-CSS reduced by 4.95 points among respondents who had attended a contact event (n = 58; p < 0.001, effect size = 0.75) compared to the score at baseline (n = 213); for the SDS this was 3.56 (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.81). About 75% of those attending a contact event said they shared the information with others (median 10 persons).
   Conclusions/Significance
   The contact intervention was effective in increasing knowledge and improving public attitudes regarding leprosy. It is relatively easy to replicate elsewhere and does not require expensive technology. More research is needed to improve scalability. The effectiveness of a contact intervention to reduce stigma against other neglected tropical diseases and conditions should be evaluated.

AB  - The ability of authoritarian regimes to maintain power hinges, in part, on how well they are able to manipulate the flow of information to the masses. While authoritarian states have had success controlling traditional media, the growth of social media over the last decade has created new challenges for such regimes. The Russian experience offers an example of how an authoritarian regime responds to this potential threat. Because of the massive demonstrations surrounding the 2011-2012 Duma elections, the ruling Russian government suspected that social media provided a significant impetus for the demonstrations. Social media, through its dissemination of opposition blogs, could have helped drive negative attitudes about the governing party. As such, the government responded by employing strategies to tighten their grip on the digital flow of information. We use survey data to demonstrate that exposure to blogs via social media at the time of the demonstrations led many to believe that the elections were fraudulent. Ultimately, we contend that Russian fears concerning the importance of social media for the fomenting of opposition movements is well grounded. Social media can drive support for opposition in an autocratic state.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6-7 days and a basic reproductive number (R-0) of 2.2-2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R-0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

AB  - Mental illness (MI) stigma has been characterized as multi-dimensional including problems of knowledge (stereotypes), attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination); however, most research practice is predominantly applying unidimensional behavioral measures such as social distance scales. Moreover, specific types of MIs and different forms of discriminatory behaviors are not being differentiated. The Stereotype Content Model predicts that group stereotypes (warmth, competence) are linked with different forms of discriminatory behaviors (harm or facilitation) via emotional prejudices (pity, envy, contempt). The present study sought to establish how differential stereotypic perceptions of MI subgroups elicit distinct forms of behavioral discrimination via emotional prejudices. A community sample (N = 60) was randomly assigned to one of three conditions representing MIs across the warmth-competence stereotype space. Patterns of self-completed measures for stereotypes, emotions and behaviors differed significantly between conditions. The association between stereotypes and behaviors were largely mediated by emotions. Systematic patterns of stereotypic perceptions, emotional prejudices and behavioral discrimination are present for individuals with different types of MIs. Hence, generic measures of discrimination, such as social distance scales, may be misleading. Intervention strategies should consider the systematic variation of the factors involved in stigma, differentiating by type of MI and discriminatory behaviors.

AB  - The existence of a gap between public preferences for more restrictive immigration policies and relatively expansive immigration policy in Western democracies has received considerable attention. Sometimes, this gap has been explained by the nature of immigration policies: dominated by elites while the public remained uninterested. In many countries, however, immigration has gained considerable salience among the public. There are competing expectations and accounts relating to whether policy-makers ignore or follow public demands on immigration. In this article we examine the potential drivers of variations in the opinion-policy gap on immigration in seven countries (1995-2010). We analyse the effect of the politicisation of immigration on this opinion-policy gap. The strength of anti-immigrant parties is unrelated to the opinion-policy gap on immigration. The salience of the issue and the intensity of the public debate are associated with the opinion-policy gap, and the combination of negative attitudes with extensive media coverage seems particularly conducive to policy congruence.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has strongly influenced teaching and learning in Vietnam's higher education institutions. Social distancing - the health care practice of increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illness due to COVID-19 has required schools to employ distance learning. As such, video conferencing tools (VCTs) have been used nationwide to ensure effective responses to the requirement. Although teaching and learning with VCTs have been proven effective by many researchers, it is not clear what benefits and challenges they bring to higher education in Vietnam, especially with respect to students' acceptance to the classroom uses of technology in the time of unexpected events. This study aims to address this gap by examining external factors that affected students' acceptance of VCTs during the COVID pandemic. Data were collected online from university students between April 14, 2020 and April 23, 2020. After this period, the research group received 294 records, in which 227 were analyzed using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The result indicated that external factors such as subject norm and computer playfulness had a significant impact on most TAM constructs. Furthermore, output quality was found to have a positive influence on students' perceived usefulness in the acceptance of VCTs in distance learning.

AB  - Introduction: Radiographs paired with clinical examination help provide an accurate diagnosis of caries, pulp, and periapical pathoses, and reveal problems related to tooth development and eruption. Although radiation dosage from dental radiograph is low, it is one of the most frequently undertaken radiographic procedure. Due to the faith entrusted by the parents on the dentists regarding their children's care, it is the moral responsibility of the dentist to inform about the biohazards associated with radiation to the parents. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge and attitude of parents toward dental radiography for children.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 450 questionnaires were distributed to the parents of children studying in 3 different schools. Children were instructed to get the questionnaires filled by their parents, which were collected after 2 days. The questionnaire included 2 sets of questions, for testing the attitude and knowledge of parents toward radiography for children. The collected data were tabulated and presented in graphical manner.
   Results: Among the 357 questionnaires returned, 54 were incomplete and 3 were further excluded. Analysis was performed on 300 questionnaires. More than half of the participants believed dental radiographs are safe and useful. Knowledge of the parents regarding radiography was relatively low. Furthermore, 92% of the parents said that the dentist explained the reasons for undertaking dental X-rays, but only 8% felt that the associated risks were explained to them.
   Conclusion: Although parents had a low level of knowledge regarding dental radiography, they had a positive attitude toward the same.

AB  - Background The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the primary causative agent of cervical cancer. HPV vaccination against human papillomavirus is more effective against cervical cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitudes toward the human papillomavirus vaccines among female high-school students. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted among female high-school students in Jimma town, Ethiopia. Study participants were selected using a simple random sampling method. Self-administered interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Data were entered using Epi-data version 3.5, exported and analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 21. The Chi-squared (chi 2) test was performed to determine the statistical significance between the outcome variable and independent variables. Results A total of 366 students participated in this study with a response rate of 94.8%. Only half (52.7%) and nearly one-third (31.4%) of the respondents had good knowledge and positive attitudes toward HPV vaccination, respectively. The predictors that included parents' educational status (chi 2 = 1.479, P = .003), students participating in school mini-media (chi 2 = 1.519, P = .036), students who had a smartphone (chi 2 = 2.118, P = .008), availability of radio or television (TV) at home (chi 2 = 2.163, P = .049), and students who received information from social-media (chi 2 = 2.15, P = .025) were significantly associated with knowledge of the HPV vaccine. Conclusion Overall knowledge and attitude toward HPV vaccination were low. All concerned bodies should work jointly to enhance the knowledge and attitudes of female students toward Human Papilloma Virus vaccination.

AB  - In Malaysian education, an approach to inculcate Environmental Citizenship (EC) comprising positive attitudes and pro-environmental behaviour is to try and improve Sustainable Development (SD) awareness based upon knowledge of the environment, social, cultural, and economic domains. However, will the increase of knowledge of these domains suffice for enhancing EC? The paper discusses a 2019-2020 nationwide survey conducted to determine the EC status and SD awareness. The study had 1976 respondents, and statistical analysis revealed that the overall self-perceived EC and SD awareness levels were high among Malaysians. However, correlational analysis between the EC and the SD knowledge component domains revealed low associations indicating a lack of interconnectedness between the domains. Environmental values, investigated as an exploratory variable in the study, appeared to have a mediating role between the EC and SD awareness component domains. Further analysis using PLS-SEM software revealed that values did play a mediating role. Based on these findings, the paper argues for an emerging model for a missing pedagogical link in transforming Malaysian EC through SD awareness education for pro-environmental behaviour. Implications for an education policy are discussed.

AB  - Adoption is not an event that ends with a child's placement, but a lifelong process that affects various dimensions of the adoptee's life. This study examines how adoption-related problems and social support affect life satisfaction among international adoptees from South Korea, and whether their attitudes toward adoption mediate these effects. Data were obtained from the 2013 Survey on International Korean Adoptees. Of the adoptees surveyed, 68.3% experienced social discrimination and 72.1% acknowledged having an identity crisis growing up. Path analysis revealed that negative experiences and social support directly and indirectly affected adoptees' life satisfaction. International adoptees who experienced identity crises and social discrimination worried more about their adoption status and felt less life satisfaction, whereas adoptees with more social support expressed positive attitudes toward adoption and felt greater life satisfaction. Adoptees' attitudes toward adoption were positively related to their life satisfaction, and this partially mediated the effects of negative experiences and social support of international adoptees. This study's results support the need for post-adoption services to address identity crises and social discrimination among international adoptees at all developmental stages and additionally emphasize the protective role of social support.

TI  - Informal Caregivers' Perspectives on the Mandated No Visitation Policy During COVID-19 Pandemic in Long-Term Care: A Qualitative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING
LA  - English
KW  - FAMILY CAREGIVERS
AB  - The current descriptive qualitative study aimed to explore how informal caregivers of persons residing in long-term care (LTC) facilities are coping with the no visitation policy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted approximately 1 month after the no visitation policy was implemented. Interview questions explored how informal caregivers are feeling, coping, and staying connected and involved with loved ones residing in LTC. Recruitment (N = 14) occurred through social media, email, and word of mouth. To maintain social distance and reduce transmission risk, interviews were conducted by phone. Through systematic data reduction, six themes emerged: (a) Reminiscing About Life Before COVID-19, (b) Feelings Related to Physical Separation, (c) Our Loved Ones Are Lonely and Don't Understand, (d) Creating Ways to Stay Connected, (e) Recognition and Concern for LTC Staff, and (f) Coping During Future No Visitation Mandates. Results of this study may assist LTC administrators and nurses if no visitation policies are required in the future.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that changes in alcohol-related attitudes and expectancies mediate the effect of alcohol advertising on youth drinking.
   Design: Longitudinal survey with a 9-month interval.
   Setting: Twenty-nine public schools in 3 German states.
   Participants: A total of 2130 sixth-to eighth-grade students (age range, 11-17 years; mean, 12.2 years) who were nondrinkers at baseline.
   Main Exposures: Exposure to alcohol and nonalcohol advertising was measured at baseline with masked images of 17 commercial advertisements with all brand information digitally removed; students indicated contact frequency and brand names.
   Outcome Measures: Positive attitudes toward alcohol, current alcohol use, lifetime binge drinking.
   Results: A total of 581 of the students (28%) started to drink alcohol during the observation period. Alcohol use initiation was positively related to baseline alcohol advertisement exposure. This effect of alcohol advertisement exposure on alcohol use was partially mediated by a change in alcohol-related attitudes, which explained about 35% of the total effect after controlling for baseline covariates and exposure to other advertising contents. The analysis revealed similar results for binge-drinking initiation.
   Conclusion: More favorable attitudes about alcohol may be one path through which alcohol advertising exerts behavioral influence.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the usability and long-term adherence to the mobile hyperacuity app Alleye in patients with retinal pathology. Methods We enroled 72 patients (95 eyes) mainly treated for wet AMD (48/95; 50.5%). We calculated changes of clinical characteristics and the System Usability Score (SUS), and personal ratings of usefulness and number of tests performed per month at a follow-up visit of eighteen months. Results At baseline, mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 74.9 letters (SD 14.8), mean age was 69.9 (SD 11.4) and 39/72 (54.2%) were female. Of included patients, 47/72 (65.2%) reported to use mobile devices daily. The retention rate until last follow-up was 73.6 % (53/72). The median SUS score at baseline was 90 (interquartile range (IQR) 82.5-95) and 92.5 (IQR 82.5-95) in the follow-up. No association between changes of SUS and clinical characteristics was seen. At baseline, 76.4% (55/72) stated that they would recommend the app to a friend, 83.3% (60/72) were very satisfied with the app and 58/72 (80.6%) of respondents said they trusted the app. These assessments remained similar among patients remaining on the program until the follow-up. Patients who dropped out of the study (n = 19) did not differ in age, gender, BCVA, and SUS at baseline, but stated that they did not use the mobile device daily (Odds Ratio 7.40 (95%CI: 2.32-23.65); p = 0.001). Conclusions The majority of users willing to perform home monitoring with the Alleye app are satisfied with the usability and have a positive attitude towards its trustworthiness and usefulness.

AB  - Objectives Adolescents tend to overestimate the extent of peers' unhealthy snacking consumption and such misperceptions have been associated with increased personal unhealthy snacking. This study aims to test whether a Social Norms Approach (SNA) intervention which challenges these misperceptions of peers' unhealthy snacking will have a positive effect on students' personal unhealthy snacking behaviours, related attitudes, and behavioural intentions. Design A quasi-experimental study tested the effectiveness of an in-school SNA intervention (n = 163) compared to a control condition (n = 95) among 11-12-year-old students. Method Both conditions received healthy eating information, while students in the SNA intervention received additional normative feedback (outlining the discrepancies between perceived and actual unhealthy snacking of the majority based on baseline data) delivered through an interactive poster-making session. Students completed self-reported measures of personal unhealthy snacking, related-attitudes, behavioural intentions, and normative perceptions (descriptive and injunctive) at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. Results Students who received SNA feedback were significantly less likely to overestimate peers' unhealthy snacking attitudes post-intervention (F(1,232) = 16.405, p < .001), and at 3-month follow-up consumed fewer unhealthy snacks (F(1,232) = 6.133, p = .014) and had less positive attitudes towards unhealthy snacking (F(1,198) = 8.779, p = .003). The changes in personal snacking attitudes at 3-month follow-up were mediated by changes in normative misperceptions about peers' unhealthy snacking attitudes post-intervention, which indicated that the reductions in normative misperceptions following SNA messages mediated the effect of the intervention. Conclusion The results indicate that in-school SNA interventions which challenge normative misperceptions constitute a promising strategy for reducing unhealthy snacking in young adolescents.

AB  - Background Mobile health (mHealth) has good potential for promoting self-care in patients suffering from chronic diseases. The patients' positive attitude toward this technology is a key factor for the successful implementation. The present study was conducted to investigate the asthma patients' use of mobile phone functionalities and their desire to receive self-care services through this technology. Methods This survey study was conducted in Iran in 2018. The study population consisted of 146 patients suffering from asthma. The data collection tool was a questionnaire containing items on the demographic characteristics of patients, current use of mobile phone functionalities, and desire to use them for receiving self-care services. Data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics. Results Out of the 160 questionnaires distributed, 146 (91.25%) were completed. The majority of the participants had smartphones (84.9%). Less than half of the participants occasionally used mobile phone functionalities including mobile phone calls (42.5%) and mobile Internet (40.4%) to receive asthma-related information. A significant number of the participants had never used smartphone applications (72.6%) and E-mail (66.4%) to receive asthma-related information. The participants had their greatest use of Internet search, followed by social media, to receive information about asthma symptoms, allergenic and irritating substances, medicinal therapy, and how to use therapy aids. The participants were most willing to use social media for receiving asthma information, communicating with other patients, receiving reminders about doctor's appointment, and receiving warnings about the lack of asthma control. Conclusion In Iran as a developing country, asthma patients use Internet search mostly to receive instructional information and are willing to use social media rather than other mobile phone functionalities to receive self-care services. These patients believe that mobile phones are appropriate for receiving instructional information and reminders.

AB  - Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common serious complications after surgery and associated with preventable morbidity, mortality, and increased health care costs. The use of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) is an effective measure that helps to protect against SSIs. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of surgical staff towards preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan.
   Methodology: An observational descriptive study was conducted among doctors in the surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan in order to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP). A four-section multiple-choice questionnaire was designed and hand-delivered to registered doctors in the surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan. The WHO guidelines were used to evaluate the answers of the participants.
   Results: Out of 56 doctors requested to participate in this study, only 49 responded and their response rate was 87.5%. Six (12.5%) surgeons had good knowledge about appropriate SAP. However, 16.3 and 24.5% of the respondents were aware of appropriate SAP in the case of Ig E-mediated reaction to penicillin and risk of Gram-negative infections, respectively. The surgeon's attitude score about the need for local and national guidelines for SAP was 98 and 100%, respectively. Accordance of the physician's practice with ASHP guidelines regarding timing of the first dosage of SAP was 35.4% while correct administration of an intraoperative dose was 42.9% in agreement with the guideline. 53.1% knows when to stop SAP after surgery correctly.
   Conclusion: Although the participants in this study showed a positive attitude towards antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines, their knowledge and strict adherence to a protocolized practice per WHO checklist should be improved in order to reduce the incidence of preventable surgical site infections.

AB  - Background: In South Africa malaria is endemic in Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the north-eastern areas of KwaZulu-Natal provinces. South Africa has set targets to eliminate malaria by 2018 and research into complementary vector control tools such as the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is ongoing. It is important to understand community perceptions regarding malaria transmission and control interventions to enable development of community awareness campaign messages appropriate to the needs of the community. We aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding malaria transmission to inform a public awareness campaign for SIT in Jozini Local Municipality, Mamfene in KwaZulu-Natal province.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in three communities in Mamfene, KwaZulu-Natal during 2015. A structured field piloted questionnaire was administered to 400 randomly selected heads of households. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data.
   Results: Of the 400 participants interviewed, 99% had heard about malaria and correctly associated it with mosquito bites. The sources of malaria information were the local health facility (53%), radio (16%) and community meetings (7%). Approximately 63% of the participants were able to identify three or four symptoms of malaria. The majority (76%) were confident that indoor residual spraying (IRS) kills mosquitoes and prevents infection. Bed nets were used by 2% of the participants. SIT knowledge was poor (9%), however 63% of the participants were supportive of mosquito releases for research purposes. The remaining 37% raised concerns and fears, including fear of the unknown and lack of information on the SIT.
   Conclusion: Appropriate knowledge, positive attitude and acceptable treatment-seeking behaviour for malaria were demonstrated by members of the community. Community involvement will be crucial in achieving success of the SIT and future studies should further investigate concerns raised by the community. The existing communication channels used by the malaria control program can be used; however additional channels should be investigated.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the prospective association between life satisfaction and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer. Previous studies suggested that psychosocial factors may affect the development of chronic diseases but the impact of positive attitudes, in particular life satisfaction, is yet to be determined.
   Methods: The analysis included 50,358 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Germany study in Potsdam and Heidelberg. Life satisfaction was assessed in a baseline interview and incident cases of chronic diseases were identified and verified during follow-up. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models that were systematically multivariable-adjusted for established risk factors and prevalent diseases.
   Results: During an average of 8 years of follow-up 2,293 cases of cancer, 1,840 cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 440 cases of stroke, and 562 cases of myocardial infarction were observed. Women who were unsatisfied with life at baseline showed in all models a significantly increased risk of cancer (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.18-1.78) and stroke (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.05-2.73) as well as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus by trend across categories (p-trend=0.04) compared to women very satisfied with life. In men, a relationship between life satisfaction and stroke was found but did not persist after consideration of lifestyle factors and prevalent diseases. No significant association was observed between life satisfaction and risk of myocardial infarction.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that reduced life satisfaction is related to the development of chronic diseases-particularly in women and partly mediated by established risk factors.

AB  - This study aimed to develop and implement a customized training program related to the delivery of an integrated human immunodeficiency virus - sexually transmitted infections (HIV-STI) risk reduction intervention for peer-facilitators and to evaluate its immediate outcome including changes in trainee knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported competence and confidence. We developed and delivered a structured training program and materials about HIV and STI prevention in a university setting. The training was offered to candidate facilitators who were planned to be involved in a larger project, known as Integrated HIV-STI Risk Reduction Program. Ten candidate facilitators participated in the training program and completed both the pretest and posttest survey questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 software package and Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to assess the impact of the training program. Overall, the trainees' performance in HIV-related and STI knowledge, attitude and stigma scores had significantly increased compared to the baseline.. The median scores for HIV and STI knowledge after the training significantly increased from 22.0 to 30.5 (p=0.007) and 8.0 to 9.5 (p=0.005), respectively, whereas the median score on the positive attitude towards HIV and STI prevention rose from 39.0 to 57.0 (p=0.011). Upon completion of the program, 80-100% of the trainees believed that they were competent and confident in performing most of the designed sexual health intervention activities. This preliminary study suggests that a customized on-site training program on sexual health intervention could significantly improve their knowledge, attitude and practice related to HIV-STI prevention.

AB  - Background: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is renovating the field of medicine as it is being acknowledged as the standard and basis of clinical judgment. As general governmental hospitals are at the forefront of health-care in Kuwait, the practice of EBM among physicians could improve the health of the population. The aim was to assess the knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers of EBM among physicians practicing in general governmental hospitals in Kuwait.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study with self-reported questionnaires was used to survey 439 physicians in Kuwait's 6 general hospitals with a response rate of 74%.
   Results: Respondent's knowledge of EBM was considerably low with a median knowledge score of 13 out of 20. Overall female physicians, undergraduates from Kuwait and Ireland, and those that received formal EBM training scored higher knowledge scores. Most respondents were unaware of well-known EBM resources, however more than half (69.3%) were aware of 'Hp-to-date' and used it for clinical decisions. Most of the respondents had positive attitudes towards EBM: 88.2% either 'strongly welcomed' or 'welcomed' the promotion of EBM. Lack of investment by health-care authorities was the main perceived barrier to EBM.
   Conclusion: Overall, even though participants were not well-informed in regards to EBM, half of them claim that their practice is EBM-based and use EBM resources to support clinical decisions. Formal EBM training and integration of EBM in undergraduate programs considerably promotes EBM practice.

AB  - Purpose This research examines the influence of the learning environment and students' attitudes towards choosing an accounting career mediated by intention to enhance the current knowledge. Design/methodology/approach The online survey is adopted to test the research model of this research. There are 503 useable responses collected with the effective response rate of 72 per cent. Data analysis and hypothesis testing use Partial Least Square as part of the Structural Equation Modelling technique. Findings The results of this research indicate that accounting students possess positive attitude both towards the intention to enhance the current knowledge and choosing their accounting career. The learning environment includes educators and friends who give significant influence on students' intention. Besides, current knowledge enhancement is also discovered to be able to mediate the link between attitude, learning environment and intention to choose accounting career. Research limitations/implications - Different generations may generate either different perception or different orientation in choosing accounting career. Therefore, future research can consider wider coverage and more updated object. Practical implications - Findings of this research suggest that periodic improvement and renewal are necessary to administer to create an optimum learning environment, in term of teachers' capacity, teaching materials and supporting social environment.
   Originality/value This research contributes to any research related to attitudes towards choosing an accounting career. This study is the leading study that combines students' attitudes, learning environment, current knowledge enhancement, and career choice in one single model.

AB  - In two cross-sectional questionnaire studies with N = 1792 German and Indian students, aged between 12 and 17 years, we investigated the relation between personal belief in a just world (BJW) and positive as well as negative dimensions of school-specific well-being. Furthermore, we considered students' personal experience of teacher justice as possible mediator in this relation and controlled for confounding effects of gender, neuroticism, and locus of control. In Study 1, we used multilevel modeling to analyze the German data and to control for class-level effects. In accordance with our hypotheses, Study 1 showed that the more students believed in a personal just world, the better their positive attitudes toward school, their academic self-esteem, and their enjoyment in school were, and the less somatic complaints in school, social problems in school, and worries toward school they experienced. These associations partly differed between classes, but generally persisted when controlled for sex, neuroticism, and locus of control. Finally, the association between personal BJW and well-being was at least partly mediated by students' personal experience of teacher justice. In Study 2, we focused on the generalizability of the pattern of results across different cultural contexts. However, we did not aim to carry out comparative research. Results from bootstrap mediation analyses were predominantly the same as in Study 1. The adaptive functions of BJW and implications for future school research are discussed.

AB  - Background: Positive affect contributes to the healthy life style, which, in turn, explains life satisfaction and psychological well-being among the elderly. Existent literature has reinforced that physical activity participation influences development of positive affect for the elderly. Because of the increased life constraints and physical problems, however, maintenance of positive affect might be challenging for elderly people. Methods: Data were drawn from a sample of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. A total sample of 3845 males and 3912 females aged between 65 and 103 years from 16 European countries was analyzed. Perception of life constraints, health problems, physical activity engagement and positive affect were measured by a structured questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis and a technique of structural equation modelling were employed using Amos 18 to examine the hypothesized relationships between study variables. Results: Perceived life constraints and physical problems significantly affected the acquisition of positive affect among the elderly. Physical activity was found to have a significant path coefficient towards the measure of positive attitude and emotion. Physical activity was also a significant mediator between physical problems and positive affect. Conclusions: This study extended our understanding of how the perception of life constraints and health problems influence the elderly's daily experience. Study finding reinforced the goodness of physical activity participation to enhance positive affect among the elderly. We should administer sustainable and evidence-based physical activity including interventions and infrastructure to improve positive affect and psychological well-bing among the elderly.

AB  - Medicinal research is exploring an increasing number of botanical substances with potentially favorable health effects, amongst others resveratrol. For marketing botanicals in consumer products, it needs to be determined which food products consumers prefer as a carrier and what kind of communication they react most favorably to. An online survey and experiment with 578 Danish respondents analyzed attitude towards a resveratrol product, varying carrier type and health information. Attitudes were more favorable for food categories perceived as natural (versus processed). Categories perceived as serving functional (versus hedonic) needs were significantly more favorably received when health information was phrased as 'natural'. Respondents expressing concerns about agricultural and food technology were more likely to state less positive attitude towards the product when the information was phrased as 'scientific'. When presented with a mock-up media report contradicting the naturally framed health information, attitude towards the product decreased more for categories perceived as natural. The same was observed for categories perceived as serving hedonic needs, but only if these had been presented with scientifically phrased health information. The results underline the crucial importance of perceived naturalness of product and information to consumer's acceptance, and the decisive role of consumer's beliefs. Food producers need to explain naturalness in marketing new health-related substances, while policy makers must ensure legislation allows and secures truthful and correct communication on naturalness.

AB  - Purpose - Consumers often discuss brands and companies online, but no research details how service providers' responses to online reviews influence other readers' perceptions of the reviews and responses. Based on justice theory and the accountability principle, both integrated in equity theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine how service providers should react to different degrees of negative reviews to enhance readers' attitudes, patronage intentions, and intentions to spread positive word of mouth.
   Design/methodology/approach - A 3 (review set balance: positive, neutral, negative) x 6 (response strategy) full-factorial between-subjects experiment included 973 respondents.
   Findings - More negative balance demands more effort from the service provider to create positive attitudes and encourage behavioural intentions. If a minority of reviewers are dissatisfied, no response is necessary; if the review set is neutral, the service provider should apologize and promise to resolve the problem; if a majority of reviewers are dissatisfied, the most effective response includes both an apology, promise and compensation. These effects are mediated by readers' perceived trust in the response. Word of mouth also requires more effort than favourable attitudes or patronage intentions.
   Research limitations/implications - This research reflects the authors' choices with regard to review set balance and managerial responses, which ensure internal validity but may limit external validity.
   Originality/value - This study applies offline service recovery strategies to an online review context. It also explicitly incorporates the bystander (potential customer) perspective.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate people's attitude towards providing symptom information electronically before a consultation. Specific areas investigated include a) attitudes and experiences with regards to acquisition of information related to symptoms, b) attitudes towards computer based communication of symptoms to the general practitioner and how they preferred to carry out such reporting, and c) attitudes towards storage, use and presentation of symptom-data in general, and particularly in a symptom based surveillance setting.
   Methods: Data was collected from 83 respondents by use of convenience sampling.
   Results: The respondents were familiar with using the Internet for health purposes, such as acquisition of information related to their symptoms prior to a consultation. The majority of respondents had a positive attitude towards providing information about their symptoms to the general practitioner's office as soon as possible after falling ill. Over half of the respondents preferred to use e-mail or a web-interface to perform this task. Eighty four percent were willing to have their symptom data stored in their EPR and 76 percent agreed that the general practitioner might access the symptoms together with the prevalence of matching diseases in order to assist the diagnostic process during the next consultation.
   Conclusions: The results of this study support the applicability of electronically mediated pre-consultation systems both for improving primary care consultation and for use in symptom based surveillance, including real-time surveillance.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted every facet of society. One of the non-pharmacological measures to contain the COVID-19 infection is social distancing. Federal, state, and local governments have placed multiple executive orders for human mobility reduction to slow down the spread of COVID-19. This paper uses geotagged tweets data to reveal the spatiotemporal human mobility patterns during this COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. With New York City open data, human mobility pattern changes were detected by different categories of land use, including residential, parks, transportation facilities, and workplaces. This study further compares human mobility patterns by land use types based on an open social media platform (Twitter) and the human mobility patterns revealed by Google Community Mobility Report cell phone location, indicating that in some applications, open-access social media data can generate similar results to private data. The results of this study can be further used for human mobility analysis and the battle against COVID-19.

AB  - Oral health and dentistry are seldom the subject of medical reality TV. This study investigates whether the dental segments within the British medical reality show, 'Embarrassing Bodies', may contribute to the anthropological understanding of oral health and social status, through semiotic and thematic analysis. This methodology involves close examination of both the visual and narrative themes within the programme. The show presents mouths afflicted by oral disease as traumascapes, the framing of which provides voyeuristic appeal. The portrayal of dental disease as negatively affecting human flourishing through shame and the inhibition of intimacy was common across the analysed cases. The key themes of intimacy and social distance; discipline, blame and personal responsibility; carnography; disciplining gaze and authority; and redemption and rebirth were identified through analysis. The cases also present a strong correlation between a lack of personal responsibility and the development of dental disease within the wider context of social class, with the dentist as a disciplining authority, enforcing professional and societal norms.

AB  - Language use is a psychologically rich, stable individual difference with well-established correlations to personality. We describe a method for assessing personality using an open-vocabulary analysis of language from social media. We compiled the written language from 66,732 Facebook users and their questionnaire-based self-reported Big Five personality traits, and then we built a predictive model of personality based on their language. We used this model to predict the 5 personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of personality at the domain-and facet-level; (b) discriminant validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends, political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test-retest reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that language-based assessments can constitute valid personality measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports of personality, added incremental validity over informant reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to those found with self-reported personality, and were stable over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with traits. This approach can complement and extend traditional methods, providing researchers with an additional measure that can quickly and cheaply assess large groups of participants with minimal burden.

AB  - Recent theoretical frameworks assume that the ideological attitudes of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) predict individuals' attitudes toward immigrant groups, and that these predictive relations are affected by contextual factors. Based on these assumptions, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relations between ideological attitudes and anti-immigrant attitudes in 155 samples from 17 countries (total N = 38,522 participants). As potential correlates of cross-national differences in these relations, socioeconomic indices, cultural worldviews, and collective perceptions of immigrants were considered. RWA was a particularly strong predictor of anti-immigrant attitudes in countries where immigrants were perceived as increasing the crime rate and as not being beneficial to the economy (e.g., Germany, Italy); and SDO was a particularly strong predictor in countries with a higher relative unemployment rate of immigrants (e.g., Belgium, Sweden). We discuss the interplay of individual and sociocultural factors and offer directions for future research.

AB  - Prior research shows that highly religious consumers are more stable through times of uncertainty, in part due to religious support networks. However, several situations (e.g., pandemics, epidemics, natural disasters, mass shootings) represent unique changes where routine large gatherings are restricted due to uncertainty. In such situations, highly religious consumers may experience the greatest disruption to life, potentially resulting in stability-seeking consumption behaviors. Three studies test and confirm this relationship in the coronavirus pandemic context. Specifically, study 1 shows that priming awareness of restricted in-person religious gatherings increases consumption in comparison to a general religious prime or control condition. Study 2 confirms that consumers with higher (lower) levels of religiosity are the most (least) likely to increase consumption, and that situational concern and stability found through purchasing sequentially mediate this relationship. Study 3 provides practical implications revealing that stability-based messaging reduces consumption in comparison to standard social distancing messaging.

AB  - Background: Collectivism has been identified as a protective factor against COVID-19 - perhaps due to increased conformity with social norms regarding prevention behaviors. Other studies have also found that individualism can inspire uptake of preventative behaviors as a means of personal protection. It is possible that these cultural orientations may promote different patterns of prevention (e.g. mask wearing vs. social distancing). Furthermore, existing studies examining the role of individualism and collectivism during the COVID-19 pandemic have frequently failed to account for other psychological processes, including differences in personality, which could help provide a better understanding of the psychological process underlying prevention behavior.
   Methods: Participants were recruited using social media advertisements. The Cultural Orientations Scale measured individualism-collectivism and hierarchism-egalitarianism. The Ten Item Personality Inventory measured the five factor model of personality. Multivariable models, dominance analyses and structural equation mediation tests were used to identify the most important predictors of COVID-19 prevention behavior (i.e. mask-wearing, hand-washing, reducing social interactions, physical distancing, staying at home and social bubbling), controlling for demographic and situational factors.
   Results: Among 774 participants, most (i.e. 60-80%) reported uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Higher vertical (hierarchical) collectivism was associated with staying at home and higher horizontal (egalitarian) individualism was associated with mask-wearing and reducing social interactions. Neither Vertical Collectivism nor Horizontal Collectivism were significantly associated with any of the prevention behaviors when controlling for personality traits and confounding variables. Agreeableness was identified as a key mediator of the correlation between these cultural orientations on general uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviors.
   Conclusions: Cultural orientations (e.g. collectivism-individualism, hierarchism-egalitarianism) and personality traits (e.g. Agreeableness) are salient correlates of COVID-19 prevention behaviors and therefore should be accounted for in the development, design and delivery of health promotion messages aiming to increase uptake of these behaviors.

AB  - This study extends current knowledge by exploring the effect of different annotation formats, namely in-text annotation, glossary annotation, and pop-up annotation, on hypertext reading comprehension in a foreign language and vocabulary acquisition across student proficiencies. User attitudes toward the annotation presentation were also investigated. Data were collected from 83 non-English-majored university students in Taiwan in a 4-week period. Each week participants read 3 passages, each with different annotation formats as a treatment condition and one passage without annotation as a control condition. Posttests of reading comprehension and vocabulary recognition followed each passage. The results indicate that, for reading comprehension, the in-text format led to the lowest performance among all types of annotation, including the control condition. The best performance was observed in the condition where annotations were presented in the pop-up format. No interaction effect between format and proficiency was detected. For vocabulary acquisition, reading passages with hypermedia annotations significantly benefit vocabulary learning for participants of medium and high proficiencies compared with the control condition. No significant differences were found among the 3 formats. The beneficial effect, however, did not extend to low-proficiency participants. Participant feedback revealed a positive attitude toward annotations. Among the 3 annotation formats, the glossary type was considered the least preferred type by participants. Findings of the research provide insights on the design and instruction for online reading. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to global human wellbeing, and the proliferation of online misinformation during this critical period amplifies the challenge. This study examines consequences of exposure to online misinformation about COVID-19 preventions. Using a three-wave panel survey involving 1,023 residents in Singapore, the study found that exposure to online misinformation prompts engagement in self-reported misinformed behaviors such as eating more garlic and regularly rinsing nose with saline, while discouraging evidence-based prevention behaviors such as social distancing. This study further identifies information overload and misperception on prevention as important mechanisms that link exposure to online misinformation and these outcomes. The effects of misinformation exposure differ by individuals' eheath literacy level, suggesting the need for a health literacy education to minimize the counterproductive effects of misinformation online. This study contributes to theory-building in misinformation by addressing potential pathways of and disparity in its possible effects on behavior.

AB  - The restriction imposed by COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great social change in the world and has affected many sectors, including the sport industry by having an impact and altering the normal development of the sport competitions and events. Therefore, it is fundamental to know sport fans' opinions about the professional championships during the confinement period. The sample is composed by 1025 professional sports leagues fans and major sporting events celebrated in Spain, with people in the age range 18-70. The instrument used to collect data was an adaptation of the American questionnaire designed by Seton Hall University. The results show that 55% of fans thought that sport leagues and events were cancelled on time. Furthermore, 92.8% of the survey respondents would not attend a live match without social distancing measures or without the existence of a vaccine; 67.4% would follow it through mass media resources with the same interest. The population group under 25 feels safe attending sports leagues or events (9.7%). These results might help to take decisions based on preventive measures to guarantee security within the sport context.

AB  - The dynamics of contention that unrolled in the French riots of 2005 in France were hardly the first of their kind, but the intensity, contagion, locations and scale of disruption that followed the horrifying deaths of two youths chased by the police in Clichy-sous-Bois were unusual and became imbued with symbolic significance. In this article, based on numerous conversations with involved participants and secondary sources, I distinguish on the one hand the interaction of active protestors, bystanders and police forces, which I call the silent riots' because so few of those actors talked during these leaderless and spontaneous events, and, on the other, a vast amount of a posteriori comment and analysis, the paper riots'. The merit of the latter was to point out that the root causes of the disorders were relative deprivation, social exclusion, heavy-handed policing, discrimination and disrespect. An alternative comprehensive framework incorporates such dimensions and I add that routine relations were modified by the operation of multiple forces that, in the course of fluid and indeterminate situations, came together to produce a certain type of public disorder. These included the media, the issue of local space, cultural and religious dimensions, and unusual forms of political expression confronting a path of dependency at work in France. Did these riots' produce change? Except for massive urban renewal operations, the inability of French elites to increase the mobility of a generation of youths from deprived urban neighbourhoods, to alleviate the banlieues' economic deterioration in terms of jobs and public services, to increase their political representation and to insert Islam's values into French core values was made possible by the stability of the regime. Nevertheless, disturbances of this type are needed to trigger a public debate, slowly leading to reforms. Other countries face similar dilemmas.

AB  - Microfinance has been addressed as a mechanism to increase financial access to the poor as one of the sustainable development goals. Accordingly, a more comprehensive understanding of the determinant factors of microfinance sustainability is necessary to implement further these financial institutions in rural areas. This research seeks to develop sustainability microfinance models and policy formulation to alleviate poverty in rural communities in East Sumba. We collect the data by distributing questionnaires to 148 stakeholders of the Tapa Walla Badi microfinance group in Mbatakapidu and the Rinjung Pahamu microfinance group in Wangga village. Focus group discussions in those locations supplement the data from the questionnaires. The endogenous and mediating variables of this study are microfinance sustainability and governance factors, respectively. Meanwhile, the exogenous variables are social, economic, and environmental factors. We then quantitatively analyze the data by using structural equation modeling (SEM) through the analysis of moment structures (AMOS). The findings show the mediating role of governance factors in microfinance sustainability. To do so, the MFIs need to maintain their positive attitudes towards the environment and implement green practices to achieve sustainability. The last but not least, this study provides empirical evidence regarding the level of adaptation of small-scale MFIs to green MFIs. Thus, the transformation process towards a green MFI can survive in the long-run through good governance support. The MFIs can oversee the process by initiating green practices and launching environment-based loan products.

AB  - Despite a steady decline in crime, CCTV usage in public areas has increased rapidly, spreading to residential areas and even non-metropolitan regions in Japan. However, few studies have focused on public attitudes toward CCTV in residential areas, and little is known about how these attitudes have changed over the years. This study examined how public attitudes toward CCTV in residential areas (i.e., neighborhood streets, parks, and shopping areas) have changed between 2008 and 2019. The study used data from two online cross-sectional questionnaires and multi-group structural equation modeling. Our results suggest that respondents were more supportive of CCTV in all sites and that the difference in attitudes between non-metropolitan and metropolitan residents decreased significantly in 2019. In particular, the percentage of respondents who focused on negative impacts (e. g., invasion of privacy) decreased, percentage who agreed with the potential of CCTV to reduce crime decreased, and percentage who believed in the ability of CCTV to reduce fear increased. Although demands for the use of CCTV data for non-security purposes would increase to create data-driven smart cities, the expansion of CCTV installation needs to be carefully considered according to the different socio-economic contexts of each region, including crime risks.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of higher education institution as a sustainability communication channel. The theory of planned behavior was used to examine the degree to which a student's tenure at a large university with active and visible sustainability initiatives is associated with changes in views about sustainability and changes in reported sustainability behaviors.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study involved a campus-wide online survey on undergraduate students at a large mid-western university. A direct measurement approach to the theory of planned behavior was used to measure changes in attitudes, normative beliefs, perceived behavioral controls and self-reported behaviors on five different environmental sustainability behaviors.
   Findings - Overall findings support the notion that higher education institutions can be effective communication channels for sustainability issues, as students who have been in college for a longer period of time reported somewhat more positive attitudes, normative and efficacy beliefs and more sustainable behaviors.
   Practical implications - By measuring specific components of the theory of planned behavior, this study provides insights on specific areas in which campaigns targeting college students in different college years could become more effective.
   Originality/value - Few studies have assessed college as an effective sustainability communication channel despite the fact that it is potentially a powerful channel to reach a large population at their critical age. This study also measures specific components to sustainability behaviors by using the theory of planned behavior as a guiding framework.

AB  - Background: Electronic health records are widely acknowledged to provide an important opportunity to anonymize patient-level health care data and collate across populations to support research. Nonetheless, in the wake of public and policy concerns about security and inappropriate use of data, conventional approaches toward data governance may no longer be sufficient to respect and protect individual privacy. One proposed solution to improve transparency and public trust is known as Dynamic Consent, which uses information technology to facilitate a more explicit and accessible opportunity to opt out. In this case, patients can tailor preferences about whom they share their data with and can change their preferences reliably at any time. Furthermore, electronic systems provide opportunities for informing patients about data recipients and the results of research to which their data have contributed.
   Objective: To explore patient perspectives on the use of anonymized health care data for research purposes. To evaluate patient perceptions of a Dynamic Consent model and electronic system to enable and implement ongoing communication and collaboration between patients and researchers.
   Methods: A total of 26 qualitative interviews and three focus groups were conducted that included a video presentation explaining the reuse of anonymized electronic patient records for research. Slides and tablet devices were used to introduce the Dynamic Consent system for discussion. A total of 35 patients with chronic rheumatic disease with varying levels of illness and social deprivation were recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic; 5 participants were recruited from a patient and public involvement health research network.
   Results: Patients were supportive of sharing their anonymized electronic patient record for research, but noted a lack of transparency and awareness around the use of data, making it difficult to secure public trust. While there were general concerns about detrimental consequences of data falling into the wrong hands, such as insurance companies, 39 out of 40 (98%) participants generally considered that the altruistic benefits of sharing health care data outweighed the risks. Views were mostly positive about the use of an electronic interface to enable greater control over consent choices, although some patients were happy to share their data without further engagement. Participants were particularly enthusiastic about the system as a means of enabling feedback regarding data recipients and associated research results, noting that this would improve trust and public engagement in research. This underlines the importance of patient and public involvement and engagement throughout the research process, including the reuse of anonymized health care data for research. More than half of patients found the touch screen interface easy to use, although a significant minority, especially those with limited access to technology, expressed some trepidation and felt they may need support to use the system.
   Conclusions: Patients from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds viewed a digital system for Dynamic Consent positively, in particular, feedback about data recipients and research results. Implementation of a digital Dynamic Consent system would require careful interface design and would need to be located within a robust data infrastructure; it has the potential to improve trust and engagement in electronic medical record research.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global health and antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are useful to limit the momentum of AMR. This study was intended to determine the attitudes of clinicians about AMR, ASP strategies, and their readiness to participate in ASPs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among clinicians working in teaching hospitals of Punjab between August and November 2018. A multistage sampling method was used. Descriptive statistics and Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed for data analysis. Results: A response rate of 77.9% (670 forward slash 859) was achieved. Most of the physicians (n = 302, 71.7%) compared to surgeons (n = 134, 70.9%) and anesthetists (n = 25, 41.7%) considered AMR as a serious health problem in Pakistani hospitals (p < 0.001). Clinicians were agreed that hospital audit and feedback (n = 434, 64.8%), restriction of certain antibiotics (n = 424, 63.3%), readily accessible microbiological data (n = 453, 67.6%), and regular educational sessions (n = 496, 74.0%) are imperative approaches to implement ASPs. Median ASP and AMR scores were significantly associated with age, experience, and types of clinicians (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite poor previous knowledge of ASPs, all clinicians showed a positive attitude towards hospital ASPs. Several approaches suggested by clinicians will be helpful to implement hospital ASPs in Pakistan.

AB  - Background: Innovative surveillance methods are needed to assess adherence to COVID-19 recommendations, especially methods that can provide near real-time or highly geographically targeted data. Use of location-based social media image data (eg, Instagram images) is one possible approach that could be explored to address this problem.
   Objective: We seek to evaluate whether publicly available near real-time social media images might be used to monitor COVID-19 health policy adherence.
   Methods: We collected a sample of 43,487 Instagram images in New York from February 7 to April 11, 2020, from the following location hashtags: #Centralpark (n=20,937), #Brooklyn Bridge (n=14,875), and #Timesquare (n=7675). After manually reviewing images for accuracy, we counted and recorded the frequency of valid daily posts at each of these hashtag locations over time, as well as rated and counted whether the individuals in the pictures at these location hashtags were social distancing (ie, whether the individuals in the images appeared to be distanced from others vs next to or touching each other). We analyzed the number of images posted over time and the correlation between trends among hashtag locations.
   Results: We found a statistically significant decline in the number of posts over time across all regions, with an approximate decline of 17% across each site (P<.001). We found a positive correlation between hashtags (#Centralpark and #Brooklynbridge: r=0.40; #BrooklynBridge and #Timesquare: r=0.41; and #Timesquare and #Centralpark: r=0.33; P<.001 for all correlations). The logistic regression analysis showed a mild statistically significant increase in the proportion of posts over time with people appearing to be social distancing at Central Park (P=.004) and Brooklyn Bridge (P=.02) but not for Times Square (P=.16).
   Conclusions: Results suggest the potential of using location-based social media image data as a method for surveillance of COVID-19 health policy adherence. Future studies should further explore the implementation and ethical issues associated with this approach.

AB  - This study examines the impact of message fatigue and what makes people fatigued in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collected with a Qualtrics panel (N = 744) showed that both active (i.e., reactance) and passive (i.e., inattention) resistance in message processing mediated the relationships between message fatigue and intentions to follow three types of preventive behaviors against COVID-19 (i.e., wearing masks, social distancing, and washing hands). The indirect effect of message fatigue on intention to seek COVID-19 information was explained by inattention but not reactance. Analyses of open-ended responses identified 18 types of COVID-related information that individuals were tired of hearing about. About 73.38% of participants (n = 546) reported that they were tired of hearing about at least one type of information about COVID-19, with mask-wearing being the most frequently mentioned (21.91%). The results extend existing research on message fatigue-evoked resistance to persuasion and provide practical implications for public health message design.

AB  - As major sport events have been cancelled and postponed in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the necessity to protect and provide a holistic approach to the professional athlete has never been greater. To do so one must understand the negative consequences for athletes in relation to the cancellation and postponement of such events caused by a communicable pandemic. The aim of this paper is to give a brief overview of how athletes were affected during the current COVID-19 pandemic. It will also discuss the role of athletes during a pandemic. Athletes like other celebrities can be role models. They can encourage appropriate behaviours including social distancing to help stall the spread of the virus through social media. The article ends with a short discussion on the resumption of sports after lockdown. In such a context of uncertainty, maximum caution is needed for resumption of sports to ensure a smooth return to previous high levels of training and fitness.

AB  - This study explores how South Korean individuals managed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their daily lives during a time of continuous and sustained social distancing using 8241 Instagram posts from May 6 to June 16, 2020. Co-word analysis found two main theme clusters highlighting individuals' endeavors in daily life management and their fear of COVID-19 infection. DMR topic modeling analysis resulted in five higher-order themes, each reflecting different aspects of people's COVID-19 experiences. Overall, the results shed light on individuals' resilience in managing their daily lives despite the fear and discomfort caused by the pandemic. Results also highlight the possibility that the discursive practices of Social Network Services (SNS) reinforce hatred against social minorities and frame otherizing COVID-19 patients as legitimate. The present study suggests the need for a range of social support to help individuals and communities during the prolonged pandemic, including a long-term, large-scale psychological quarantine system. Deliberate social measures also need to be taken to promote the process of social sharing through media texts and SNS to resist hateful frames and othering of social minorities. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - Objective Non-adherence to COVID-19 guidelines is a major public health issue. This study explored factors that explain college student party behavior (PB; defined as attending a college party wherein COVID-19 guidelines, including masks and social distancing were ignored) during the pandemic. Method Freshmen students at a northeastern university (N = 207; 72% women) responded to an online Fall 2020 semester survey. Results The percentage of students who participated in on-campus partying during past month was 11.6%, with 20.3% participating in off-campus partying. Living on campus and higher perceived norms for partying were associated with higher levels of on-campus PB, whereas higher perceived norms for partying, stronger college alcohol beliefs, and a more conservative political ideology accounted for significant variance in off-campus PB. Conclusions Efforts to reduce party behavior should target misperception of party behavior norms as well as college alcohol beliefs, and take into account students' residence and political ideology.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has profoundly changed the organization of hospital activities. We present our experience of reorganization of a nuclear medicine service settled in Northern Italy during the pandemic period of March and April 2020 characterized a government-mandated lockdown. Our service remained open during the whole period, performing approximately 80% of the routine practice, while maintaining it COVID-free despite the geographical context characterized by a high risk of infection. Reorganization involved all aspects of a nuclear medicine department, following local, national, and international guidelines for prioritizing patients, telephone and physical triages, deployment of appropriate personal protective equipment, social distancing, and logistic changes for scheduling examinations and disinfection procedures. All staff remained COVID-19-negative despite the unintentional admission of 4 patients who later turned out to be positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. These adopted measures would serve as the basis for safe nuclear medicine services in the post-lockdown phase.

AB  - Background Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, prevention behavior adoption occurred in a rapidly changing context. In contrast to expectancy-value theories, the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM) is well-suited for investigating novel and socially informed behaviors.
   Purpose We explored whether PWM social cognitions predicted coronavirus prevention behaviors.
   Method A representative sample of United States adults (N = 738; M-age = 46.8; 51.8% women; 78% white; April 2020) who had not had COVID-19 reported PWM predictor variables (perceived vulnerability, prevention descriptive norms, prototypes engaging in prevention behavior, and prevention behavioral intentions). Two weeks later, participants reported their prevention behaviors (handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, etc.) and future public health behavioral willingness (contact tracing, temperature checks, etc.).
   Results Controlling for putative demographic, past behavior, and coronavirus-contextual (e.g., local infection rates) covariates, mediation models indicated that higher norms and favorable prototypes were associated with greater prevention behavioral intentions, which in turn predicted increased prevention behavior, F(18, 705) = 92.20, p < .001, R-2 = .70. Higher norms and favorable prototypes associated both directly and indirectly (through greater prevention behavioral intention) with greater willingness to engage in emerging public health behaviors, F(15, 715) = 21.49, p < .001, R-2 = .31.
   Conclusions Greater descriptive norms and favorable prototypes for prevention behavior predicted: (a) future prevention behaviors through increases in behavioral intentions and (b) willingness to participate in emerging public health behaviors. These results held across demographic groups, political affiliation, and severity of regional outbreaks. Public health efforts to curb pandemics should highlight normative prevention participation and enhance positive prototypes.

AB  - Vaccination against COVID-19 may present the most effective strategy to control current viral pandemic. The success of delivering mass vaccination, on the scale of what would be applied to contain COVID-19, largely depends on the compliance of the public to programs mandated by public health officials. This study was aimed to evaluate the perception and possible hesitance of people in Jordan toward a tentative COVID-19 vaccine using self-administrated online survey. During the study period, a total of 1287 agreed to participate in the study. More than half of the participants (n = 734, 57%) were females and the majority (n = 893, 69%) had a University degree. Most of the participants (n = 871, 68%) believed that scientists have adequate tools to develop a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine and two-third of them (n = 861, 67%) believed that developing vaccines would end the pandemic. However, around half of them (n = 665, 52%) reported not having adequate information on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Preference of study participants to achieve immunity against COVID-19 using natural way was the most commonly reported reason to refuse vaccination (n = 826, 64%), followed by their concern about adverse effects associated with the vaccine (n = 781, 61%). In conclusion, the sampled participants showed an overall positive attitude toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Educational campaigns using television and social media are recommended to better inform the public of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccine in reaching a "herd immunity" based strategy to control the current pandemic.

AB  - To date, transport exclusion has largely been approached from an accessibility perspective, developing place- and individual-based measures. However, these measures present a weakness in that they typically capture aggregate patterns. To address this disadvantage, in this paper, social-based measures to transport exclusion from a media perspective are explored. The objective is to analyze the content of a transport-related blog initiated by a local newspaper in the city of Cali, Colombia to determine if any potential indicators of social exclusion can be gleaned from this source. A two-step content analysis is performed on the entries to determine if indicators are present that may be a current source of exclusion, or that may potentially cause individuals to exclude themselves from the system. Findings reveal that bloggers made reference to geographic, time, and fear-based exclusionary dimensions, as well as personal and societal. Such a forum thus holds the potential to inform policy makers of enhancements that can be made to the system that help make it more socially inclusive. The study is unique in its developing country setting where public participation in transport planning is rare. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Parenting Children with Disabilities in Russia: Institutions, Discourses and Identities
T2  - EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - This essay aims to understand how the complex configurations of welfare shape and change the identity of carers, and the conditions and relations in the policy and practice of social care. It is based on the analysis of interviews with mothers of children with disabilities, collected in 2006 and 2008 in Russia, as well as analysis of more recent material in the public sphere (blogs and electronic mass media). In the interviews and blogs, women tell their stories about their experience of social exclusion and choice. The analysis shows how welfare institutions and discourses work to secure the well-being of citizens, to construct social inequality, to define the ways people think about normality and shape their identities and lives.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the way Americans deal with death and dying. Social distancing restrictions prevented or delayed end of life services for families who lost loved ones to COVID-19. Alternatively, some took to the internet to express their grief through online memorialization. Using content analysis, this study analyzes 200 randomly selected online memorials from the COVID Memorial website, a website created to share the stories of those lost to COVID-19 on social media. Our findings offer insight into memorial author demographics, how memorial authors framed and understood death due to COVID-19, and the COVID-19 pandemic through online memorialization. Two major themes emerged during data analysis, "references to COVID-19 death" and "COVID-specific directives to readers." The former, details how memorial authors framed and understood the death of a loved one to COVID-19. The latter details "advice" or "directives" authors gave to readers about social distancing guidelines and other guidelines meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - Brand personality is a useful tool that forms a favorable brand image and that ultimately builds powerful brand equity. However, there has been insufficient empirical research on the brand personality of Korean dance. In the context of using culture and the arts to support national competitiveness, we examine traditional Korean dance in terms of a potential brand personality that can influence the perceptions of global consumers. We look at how this brand can affect consumer perceptions of how easy it is to learn Korean dances as well as their perceptions of the physical benefits of these dances. The respondents included global consumers who had listened to or watched Korean dance music and videos on TV and the Internet, searched for and watched Korean dance videos on YouTube, and searched for Korean dance information on social media at least once. A survey was conducted over the course of four months, from October 2020 to January 2021, in four countries: South Korea, the USA, the UK, and South Africa. Valid data were obtained from 649 individuals. We conducted an empirical study by applying and integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM) to the brand personality of Korean dance. A structural equation model was used to analyze the responses. The brand personality of Korean dance enhanced its perceived ease of use and its perceived usefulness among global consumers, which led to positive attitudes toward the dances. Furthermore, it led to a sustainable behavioral intention, that is, interest in learning traditional Korean dances. Since no studies have integrated Korean dance into a single brand personality to use it as a cultural asset, this study makes considerable contributions to the literature.</p>

AB  - There is a lively debate whether to consider vote decisions based on leader evaluations a threat to democracy, as this has long been assumed to constitute irrational decision-making behavior. Empirical evidence indicating that leader effects are not necessarily expressions of irrationality has recently mounted up, though skepticism towards leader effects remains resilient especially when considering voters being influenced through media coverage of party leaders. This paper studies some of the core assumptions of the 'irrationality of leader effects' thesis, by testing the conditionality of mediated leader effects based upon four voter characteristics: education, political interest, ideological distance to the leader's party and political cynicism. Two datasets are combined: a manual content analysis of leadership images in television coverage and a five-wave panel-dataset in the four months preceding the 2012 Parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. The results are mixed: one the one hand, being influenced by leadership images through the media is not a shortcut for voters who are incapable of understanding politics, while ideological considerations and other political attitudes are not completely excluded from the decision-making process, but, on the other hand, mediated leader effects are found to be strongest for voters who care least about politics. Thus, the empirical evidence can be brought to bear on both sides of the discussion, and, hence, does not conclusively settle the issue how mediated leader effects must be considered in relation to the irrationality of the vote decision.

AB  - An interview survey of 51 members of Russian-speaking groups in the Salou area of southern Catalonia indicates the use of several modes of mediation to solve language problems. Professional written translators tend to be employed for official documents and high-risk situations only, whereas professional interpreters tend not to be used; family members and friends are usually preferred. There is widespread learning of Spanish, which is seen as the "host" language and offers independence, but very limited engagement with Catalan, which nevertheless remains a strong language of identification for much of the host society. In this multilingual context, Spanish, Russian, and English can all function as lingua francas depending on the situation. Russian, however, is only taught by private associations, even though its presence in the public school system could conceivably help address the diffuse sense of social exclusion felt by these groups and would be to the long-term benefit of the area's economy, which partly depends on Russian tourism.

AB  - Two experimental studies were carried out to investigate the effect of company size and cause proximity on consumer response to CSR initiatives. Findings from Study 1 demonstrated that, for a large company, the national cause led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially responsible corporate image than the local cause. By comparison, for a small company, the local cause produced more positive attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially conscious corporate image than the national cause. Further delving into the cognitive mechanism of this fit effect, Study 2 investigated the mediating role of message credibility and explored how the mediation varied with consumers' level of cause involvement. A series of moderated mediation analyses showed that when company size and cause proximity were congruent, participants displayed higher message credibility, which led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company and a better corporate image than in an incongruent condition. This research suggests that company size does matter in consumer response to CSR engagement and offers initial explanations for it. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - The achievement of innovation performance by means of open innovation (OI) is not automatic and intellectual capital (IC) can play a pivotal role. In 2020, COVID-19 challenged the sanitary systems and required to rapidly introduce innovative health technologies. By unleashing multitudes of brains, OI may help. However, the pandemic introduced social distancing that acted to the detriment of firms' IC, which should guarantee OI successfulness. This tension pushed us to investigate how OI affects IC to provide effective and timely innovative solutions during crises. We studied a company that rapidly modified its telemedicine product to provide a Local Health District (LHD) with an effective solution for monitoring COVID-19 patients. By distinguishing between OI developed prior to (ex-ante) and post (ex-post) the COVID-19 outbreak, we show that ex-post OI can build on IC strengthened by ex-ante OI and hence allow higher performance needed to combat the pandemic.

AB  - Orientation: Scholars long debated the importance of transformational leadership, talent acquisition and talent retention.
   Research purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyse transformational leadership, talent acquisition and talent retention of engineers at Eskom by investigating the demographic differences, relationships and transformational leadership as the mediating variable.
   Motivation for the study: Eskom has improved the remuneration of engineers over the years but continued encountering challenges to attract and retain them. The researcher investigated whether the perceived lack of transformational leadership caused the challenges experienced by the organisation.
   Research approach/design and method: This was quantitative study, which used convenience-sampling method to obtain 585 completed questionnaires from the engineers.
   Main findings: The researcher performed a one-way Anova test to establish if engineers from a gender and educational qualification perspectives were different from each other on the eight sub-factors identified through exploratory factor analysis. The p-values were greater than 0.05, meant that there was no statistical difference between genders and between engineers with different educational qualifications. The researcher conducted a post-hoc pairwise test (p-values < 0.05) on different age groups and results revealed that older respondents (31 - 40 years of age) had greater positive attitude on the perception of before-selection, during-selection and development than the younger group (18 - 30 years of age). In addition, the study revealed that transformational leadership mediated the relationship between talent acquisition and retention of engineers.
   Practical/managerial implications: The study emphasises that not only salaries are important to attract and retain engineers, but also effective leadership is essential, especially the transformational leadership philosophy.
   Contribution/value-add: South Africa has a dearth of engineers. The study results illustrates the importance of transformational leadership philosophy in addressing the challenge the organisation faces. Therefore, the organisation must consider designing programmes to help leaders embrace the transformational leadership philosophy.

AB  - The objective of the following study was to analyze the associations of caregivers' literacy practices and beliefs, and children exposure to screen media with lexical density and syntax development during the first three years. A total of 136 primary caregivers of infants between 12 to 40 months of age (M= 26.34, SD = 7.55) were evaluated. The participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, a reading comprehension test, a literacy practices and beliefs survey and the CDI (McArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory) part II (words and sentences). In addition, children's daycare attendance was considered. After controlling for age, gender, parent's education level and daycare attendance, positive attitudes towards literacy and frequency of PC use contributed to CDI vocabulary scores, while shared reading frequency was associated with CDI syntax scores. These results indicate that both parent-child shared reading and PC use provide a context for verbal interaction and joint attention that stimulates language development.
   Impact Summary
   Prior State of Knowledge: There are contradictory results about the relations between home literacy, screen media exposure and language development during the first years of life. Also, most of this research has been conducted in WEIRD countries.
   Novel Contributions: Parents attitudes about reading and shared reading were more important in explaining language development than books quantity, caregiver's reading comprehension and self-reading practices. Regarding screen exposure, only frequency of PC use was a significant predictor of children's vocabulary scores.
   Practical Implications: The positive associations of literacy beliefs, practices and screen times with vocabulary might indicate that both shared reading and screen coviewing provide a context for parent-child joint attention and verbal interaction that promotes word learning.

AB  - Purpose To examine the relationship between parenting styles and parental attitudes towards oral health practices in children. Methods Parents of children aged 4-6 years presenting to four public dental clinics completed the Parenting Styles Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) and a questionnaire on parental attitudes, child diet and oral hygiene practices. Child oral health was evaluated using Plaque Index (PI) and dmft-Index. Results Three hundred and eighty-nine children (mean age: 62.3 +/- 9.8 months) were recruited. The median dmft was 4 (IQR = 9) and median PI was 1.5 (IQR = 0.8). An authoritative parenting style was observed in 95.1% of parents. Authoritative parents were more likely to monitor sweets/snacks intake (P = 0.004) and less inclined to offer sweets/snacks in exchange for good behaviour (P = 0.04) than permissive parents. However, actual between-meal snacking frequency did not differ between styles (P = 0.43). Permissive parents were less likely to ensure bedtime toothbrushing (P = 0.001) or brush thoroughly when busy or tired (P = 0.03) compared to authoritative parents; these attitudes were associated with higher frequencies of actual omission of bedtime toothbrushing (P = 0.006) in their children. A higher frequency of omitting bedtime toothbrushing significantly predicted a permissive parenting style (OR = 12.1, P = 0.009). Parenting styles were not associated with dmft (P = 0.72) and/or PI (P = 0.34). Conclusions Authoritative parenting was associated with positive attitudes regarding both preventive dietary and oral hygiene practices. Actual oral hygiene practices were more ideal in children with authoritative parents, but parenting styles had no impact on actual dietary habits.

AB  - Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapy for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Stool donors are essential, but difficult to recruit and retain. We aimed to identify factors influencing willingness to donate stool. This multi-center study with a 32-item questionnaire targeted young adults and health care workers via social media and university email lists in Edmonton and Kingston, Canada; London and Nottingham, England; and Indianapolis and Boston, USA. Items included baseline demographics and FMT knowledge and perception. Investigated motivators and deterrents included economic compensation, screening process, time commitment, and stool donation logistics. Logistic regression and linear regression models estimated associations of study variables with self-assessed willingness to donate stool. 802 respondents completed our questionnaire: 387 (48.3%) age 21-30 years, 573 (71.4%) female, 323 (40%) health care workers. Country of residence, age and occupation were not associated with willingness to donate stool. Factors increasing willingness to donate were: already a blood donor (OR 1.64), male, altruism, economic benefit, knowledge of how FMT can help patients (OR 1.32), and positive attitudes towards FMT (OR 1.39). Factors decreasing willingness to donate were: stool collection unpleasant (OR 0.92), screening process invasive (OR 0.92), higher stool donation frequency, negative social perception of stool, and logistics of collection/transporting feces. We conclude that 1) blood donors and males are more willing to consider stool donation; 2) altruism, economic compensation, and positive feedback are motivators; and 3) screening process, high donation frequency, logistics of collection/transporting feces, lack of public awareness, and negative social perception are deterrents. Considering these variables could maximize donor recruitment and retention.

AB  - Functional foods which enhance satiety and hence offer appetite control can support weight loss efforts, but consumers' perceptions of such products are not fully understood. Urban-dwelling Australian consumers (n = 1629) trying to lose or to maintain weight rated written product concepts offering appetite control benefits for purchase intent and believability. In general, all product concepts were rated moderately for purchase intent, although products that were more likely to be commonly consumed, and that were a solid format received significantly higher ratings. Believability of product concept statements was found to vary significantly depending on product category. Compared to consumers trying to maintain their weight, consumers actively trying to lose weight tended to rate product concepts higher for purchase intent, despite similar scores for believability of concept. Age, gender and a sceptical attitude towards functional foods did not tend to strongly influence purchase intent and believability of product concepts offering appetite control. Actively trying to lose or maintain weight also had little influence over the degree to which consumers believed the product concept would deliver the benefits it was claiming. The association between a positive attitude towards functional foods and both purchase intent and believability was significant across all product concept categories, although the impact on purchase intent was largely mediated through believability. In assessing information provided about the active ingredients and functionality of the products, consumers rated as the two most important attributes that the products were clinically tested and that the active ingredient was derived from fruits and vegetables. In a broader perspective, careful communication of the clinical efficacy and effective consumption of appetite control products to assist with weight loss seems warranted.

AB  - Despite the widespread application of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) to various services, there has been relatively little research carried out on pedestrian-AV interaction and trust within the context of service provided by AV. This study explores the communication design strategy promoting a pedestrian's trust and positive attitude to driverless services within the context of pedestrian-AV interaction using non-verbal social cues. An empirical study was conducted with an experimental VR environment to measure participants' intimacy, trust, and brand attitude toward AV. Further understanding of their social interaction experiences was explored through semi-structured interviews. As a result of the study, the interaction effect of social cues was found, and it was revealed that brand attitude was formed by the direct effects of intimacy and trust as well as the indirect effects of intimacy through trust's mediation. Furthermore, 'Conceptual Definition of Space' was identified to generate differences in the interplay among intimacy, trust, and brand attitude according to social cues. Quantitative and qualitative results were synthesized to discuss implications considering the service context. Practical implications were also addressed suggesting specific design strategies for utilizing the sociality of AV.

AB  - We investigated the triggers and functions of nostalgia in consumers' processing of television advertisements in relation to aging. Study 1 explored the contents and triggers of nostalgic experiences by requesting 451 undergraduates to write four different nostalgic descriptions (of scenes, songs, events, and commercials). An analysis of the descriptions using text mining revealed that nostalgic reactions occur in response to events that had been frequently repeated in the past and were separated from the present by a long time interval. Study 2 explored the functions of nostalgia among 737 consumers (15-65 years old) using a survey. Structural equation modeling revealed five steps in the processing of nostalgic advertisements. Aging facilitates a predisposition toward nostalgia. Highly nostalgic consumers are more sensitive to nostalgic triggers. Nostalgic triggers facilitate the retrieval of past events and memorization of advertisements that evoke familiarity and positive attitudes, which, in turn, facilitates the intention to purchase. Nostalgic predispositions and sensitivity to nostalgic triggers increase with age. This tendency was higher among men than among women. We proposed a model of nostalgia based on frequent repetition in the past and a long time-lag between the nostalgia-inducing event and the present.

AB  - Muslim Americans are increasingly stigmatized and may be experiencing a backlash in the American news media and by the public. No study to date, however, has empirically assessed the sentiment of Muslim American cable news coverage over an extended period of time and evaluated its effects on mass attitudes. I address the following questions: How has the US news media portrayed Muslim Americans in its coverage? And, to what extent do these media portrayals affect American public opinion? I demonstrate that the media coverage of Muslims and Muslim Americans is negative and has increased over time. Compared to that of Blacks, Latinos, and Asian Americans, I find that Muslim American coverage is more negative. In a series of survey experiments, I find that negative news portrayals of Muslims and Muslim Americans increase hostility toward Muslim Americans and increase support for stringent policies targeting them, while positive portrayals have relatively weaker effects.

AB  - Introduction Hospital and ambulatory care systems are rapidly building their virtual care capacity in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The use of resident trainees in telemedicine is one area of potential development and expansion. To date, however, training opportunities in this field have been limited, and residents may not be adequately prepared to provide high-quality telemedicine care. Aim This study evaluates the impact of an adapted telemedicine Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) on telemedicine-specific training competencies of residents. Setting Primary Care Internal Medicine residents at a large urban academic hospital. Program Description In March 2020, the New York University Grossman School of Medicine Primary Care program adapted its annual comprehensive OSCE to a telemedicine-based platform, to comply with distance learning and social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. A previously deployed in-person OSCE on the subject of a medical error was adapted to a telemedicine environment and deployed to 23 primary care residents. Both case-specific and core learning competencies were assessed, and additional observations were conducted on the impact of the telemedicine context on the encounter. Program Evaluation Three areas of telemedicine competency need were identified in the OSCE case: technical proficiency; virtual information gathering, including history, collateral information collection, and physical exam; and interpersonal communication skills, both verbal and nonverbal. Residents expressed enthusiasm for telemedicine training, but had concerns about their preparedness for telemedicine practice and the need for further competency and curricular development. Discussion Programs interested in building capacity among residents to perform telemedicine, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, can make significant impact in their trainees' comfort and preparedness by addressing key issues in technical proficiency, history and exam skills, and communication. Further research and curricular development in digital professionalism and digital empathy for trainees may also be beneficial.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic spread catastrophically over the world since the spring of 2020. In this paper, a heterogeneous branching process with immigration is established to quantify the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 in local communities, based on the temporal and structural transmission patterns extracted from public case disclosures by four provincial Health Commissions in China. With proper parameter settings, our branching model matches the actual transmission chains satisfactorily and, therefore, sheds light on the underlying COVID-19 spreading mechanism. Moreover, based on our branching model, the efficacy of home quarantine and social distancing are explored, providing a reference for the effective prevention of COVID-19 worldwide.

AB  - Objectives
   Older adults have been identified as a high-risk population for COVID-19, therefore it is crucial to understand how they perceived and reacted to the emergency. We examined age-related differences in emotions, cognitive attitudes, and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, we expected to find a positive approach in older adults, which may translate into lower compliance with restrictive measures.
   Methods: We analyzed data (n = 306) from a nation-wide online survey conducted between April 1st and April 16th, 2020. We compared young (18-29 years), middle-aged (30-50 years), and older (65-85 years) adults' self-reported emotions, attitudes toward the emergency, and compliance with governmental rules.
   Results: Older adults showed lower negative emotions than young and middle-aged adults. Also, older adults were more confident about COVID-related information received, more favorable toward the restrictive measures, and perceived lower underestimation of the emergency compared to the other age groups. However, older people anticipated a longer time for the emergency to resolve. No age-related differences in compliance with the rules emerged.
   Conclusion: Older people showed a positive attitude toward the emergency. This attitude was confined in the here and now and did not extend to expectations for the future. Compliance with rules was high across our sample. However, less compliant individuals were also less confident in COVID-related information received by the media and official sources, suggesting the importance of providing precise and reliable information to promote adherence to restrictive measures.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata. If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.

AB  - Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one's group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents' feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.

AB  - This article examines the reception and dissemination of 'malign information influence' (MII) in a liberal democracy; information sponsored by authoritarian regimes or other hostile actors and projected through international broadcasting outlets across borders. The study contributes to the scarce research on the reception of narratives transmitted by the Russian state-supported media platforms RT and Sputnik, exposing characteristics, political attitudes, and sharing behaviors of RT/Sputnik consumers. A nationwide, representative survey (n: 3033) from November 2020 revealed a surprisingly high number of Swedish RT/Sputnik consumers (7%), with an overrepresentation of young, men and supports of non-parliamentarian parties and the right wing, nationalist Sweden Democratic Party. These consumers are somewhat more willing than non-consumers to disseminate news on social media and in real life despite being distrustful of the sources. The findings strengthen previous research in demonstrating the attractiveness of identity grievance narratives among alternative media consumers, yet the results show that RT/Sputnik consumers also aligned with narratives that contrasts with national security policy. They state less trust in politicians, institutions, the media, news, and journalism, yet are comparatively prone to share unreliable or untrue news content on social media and in real life. The analysis thus identified a section of media consumers who can function as vehicles for the dissemination of MII. The article contributes to the under-researched problem of the potential of MII to take root and provides a basis for future qualitative research that can refine and provide nuance to the knowledge of reception of MII.

AB  - The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia forced a temporary closure of BreastScreen Australia services. Now reopened, the BreastScreen experience has been redefined for both staff and clients and the journey to the 'new BreastScreen normal' is continually evolving in response to the ongoing threat of COVID-19 and government directives on health policy. Many changes mirror those undertaken in the wider community and emphasise wellness to attend, hygiene and social distancing. Importantly, radiographers have been identified as having a high-risk role and have had to modify positioning techniques and cleaning regimes accordingly. Beyond the pandemic, the 'new normal' needs to be one which enables well women to continue screening with a visible sense of reassurance that all that can be done is being done to ensure the safe and continued early detection of breast cancer.

AB  - In recent years, there has been much conceptual work calling for research on transformative service, and service inclusion in particular. However, quantitative studies focusing on service inclusion are scant, and little is known about customer responses to the opposite of service inclusion, i.e. service exclusion. Taking a transformative research perspective, this study advances the service inclusion literature by focusing on service exclusion and its downstream consequences. We first build the causal link between service exclusion (vs. inclusion) and customer indirect misbehavior, reveal the underlying mechanism, and further identify negative reciprocity beliefs as a boundary condition. The results of three studies suggest that customers who experience service exclusion (vs. inclusion) are more likely to engage in indirect misbehavior (Study 1), and that this effect is mediated by perceived need threat (Study 2). Moreover, the basic effect holds true only for customers with strong negative reciprocity beliefs (Study 3). The findings of this research not only contribute to the literature on transformative services, service inclusion, and social exclusion, but also have managerial implications for marketing practitioners in terms of creating an inclusive service system.

AB  - The concept of fame has been associated with celebrities, wealth, attractiveness, and social recognition. Nevertheless, people have admiration for the famous who may not be celebrities. Admiration is regarded as one of the emotions of appreciation, or moral emotions, triggered by positive appraisals of excellence. It is present when seeing extraordinary displays of skills talent or achievement. However, theoretical and empirical research on admiration and its psychological effects on people are scarce. In this article, we discuss a qualitative study that explores a collection of experiences of admiration for the famous. Based on 26 in-depth interviews with residents in southern England, we explored why people admire famous individuals and how the experience may produce positive attitudes and behaviors. We found that through admiring famous individuals who are perceived to share similar interests and attributes, people may develop positive thinking about their own lives and may be more active in seeking new opportunities or engaging in self-growth. We also discuss the potential problems of admiration. This exploratory research contributes to the literature of positive psychology and has implications for furthering the understanding of people's well-being.

AB  - Immigrants to the United States face rejection from other Americans on the basis of their ethnic group membership. Among members of ethnic minority groups who were born in the United States, rejection is tied to higher ethnic identification and less positive attitudes toward the national majority. Relatively little research has examined this relationship among fast-generation immigrants (i.e., people who were born in another country but who migrated to the United States) or has considered political engagement on behalf of one's ethnic group as an outcome. In this study we examined the relationship among ethnic-based rejection, ethnic and national identification, and ethnic political engagement among first-generation Latino immigrants in the northeastern United States. We found that first-generation Latino immigrants who perceived ethnic-based rejection were less likely to identify with Americans and less likely to report willingness to engage politically on behalf of their ethnic group in the United States. Perceived rejection was not significantly associated with ethnic identification, which was not related to ethnic political engagement. The study demonstrates that ethnic-based rejection has unique implications for identification and ethnic political engagement among first-generation Latino immigrants.

AB  - Objective Prostate cancer survivors are increasingly turning to online communities for support. This study explored predictors of and barriers to use. Methods A prospective survey of 141 Australian prostate cancer survivors assessed sociodemographic, clinical, psychosocial, and attitudinal characteristics associated with intention to use, and subsequent use of online communities. Results The sample was divided into current, past, and non-user groups. Current users reported more intent to use online communities and had higher levels of social support. Current and past users, and their close contacts, held a more positive attitude towards use. Non-users experienced more barriers to use, fewer life impacts due to health changes, and were more likely to live in rural or remote regions. According to current users online prostate cancer communities are too informal, to past users they are too time intensive, and non-users believe they are too shallow. The most critical barriers to use were finding a suitable community, time to use them, and being capable of talking about or articulating their illness on the Internet. While these forums allow men to share experiences, gain recognition and understanding, and receive information, they may lead men to becoming too preoccupied with their illness and feeling more concerned about the consequences of their disease. Conclusion Improving attitudes towards online communities and reducing barriers to use may help better encourage men with unmet supportive care needs to seek help from these groups. Future research exploring supporter attitudes towards use and explicating how men are supported online is needed.

AB  - Despite popular claims that the United States has reached a "post-racial" era-one in which race no longer matters for determining one's life chances-college students continue to have strong views toward whether or not racial discrimination is still a major problem in this country. Utilizing multilevel modeling on data merged from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program's (CIRP) 2005 Freshman Survey (TFS) and 2009 College Senior Survey (CSS), as well as the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS) and the Office of Postsecondary Education Campus Safety and Security database, this study examined individual and institutional predictors of white male and female college students' senior-year views on whether racial discrimination is still a major problem in the United States, with a particular focus on campus racially biased incidents and hate crimes. Results show that having a reported hate crime on campus did not have a significant association with white students' senior-year views, while a higher level of news coverage of campus racially biased incidents significantly predicted white women's senior-year views on racial discrimination. Implications of the findings with respect to higher education research, policy, and practice are discussed.

KW  - SAMPLES
AB  - This paper reports survey findings on the Swiss public's willingness, attitudes, and concerns regarding personalized health research participation by providing health information and biological material. The survey reached a sample of 15,106 Swiss residents, from which we received 5,156 responses (34.1% response rate). The majority of respondents were aware of research using human biological samples (71.0%) and held a positive opinion towards this type of research (62.4%). Of all respondents, 53.6% indicated that they would be willing to participate in a personalized health research project. Willingness to participate was higher in younger, higher educated, non-religious respondents with a background in the health sector. Respondents were more willing to provide 'traditional' types of health data, such as health questionnaires, blood or biological samples, as opposed to social media or app-related data. All respondents valued the return of individual research results, including risk for diseases for which no treatment is available. Our findings highlight that alongside general positive attitudes towards personalized health research using data and samples, respondents have concerns about data privacy and re-use. Concerns included potential discrimination, confidentiality breaches, and misuse of data for commercial or marketing purposes. The findings of this large-scale survey can inform Swiss research institutions and assist policymakers with adjusting practices and developing policies to better meet the needs and preferences of the public. Efforts in this direction could focus on research initiatives engaging in transparent communication, education, and engagement activities, to increase public understanding and insight into data sharing activities, and ultimately strengthen personalized health research efforts.

AB  - Introduction:
   In Onondaga County, New York, around half of all births to Black and Hispanic teenage girls are unintended. The Layla's Got You campaign consists of a chatbot and social media campaign designed to increase contraception knowledge among 16- to 25-year-old Black and Hispanic women in Onondaga County.
   Methods:
   The campaign was co-created with local women in the target audience and employed digital and grassroots community building strategies. Focus groups were conducted among 31 women, during which participants selected the campaign's logo and chatbot name and created the tagline. Participants reviewed chatbot responses and designed Layla's appearance and features, and Black/Hispanic women are featured in website and promotional photos. A community campaign manager pairs digital strategies with grassroots partnerships among a diverse group of stakeholders, including social media influencers, hair salons and health clinics.
   Results:
   Since implementation, the chatbot has received 4,390 messages related to contraception or sexual health. Across social media accounts, the campaign has showed 2,483,683 impressions, average daily reach of 1,710 for Facebook and 943 for Instagram, and 32,816 total engagements across all platforms.
   Conclusion:
   Layla's Got You provides young women with a confidential place in which to find locally tailored and trustworthy information about contraception. By merging innovative technology-driven strategies, participatory creation techniques and grassroots community building, the initiative delivers impactful, easily updated health information on a large scale. This strategy has promising implications for increasing knowledge and positive attitudes towards contraception among specific at-risk audiences.

AB  - This article introduces a special issue critically investigating contemporary formations of digital game labor, with a focus on the political-economic forces, social inequalities, and technological dynamics mutually shaping these formations. Accounts of game industry practices have been at the forefront of efforts within media studies to document and theorize conditions and transformations of labor under digital capitalism. The study of digital game labor has tended to cluster around four areas of inquiry: below-the-line labor, the creative labor of game development, player-production, and game labor politics. Providing empirically informed portraits of diverse contexts and experiences of gamework, this issue interrogates multiple dimensions of precarious work and social exclusion within an industry whose playful self-image can make it a resistant object of labor-centered analysis. The contributors to this issue promote a research orientation that is attentive to how work in the digital game industry might be made more accessible and sustainable.

AB  - BackgroundHousehold contract tracing (HHCT) is an important strategy for active tuberculosis case finding and offers an opportunity for testing of other diseases such as HIV. However, there is limited data on the patient-centered approach to HHCT. Our study aimed to describe experiences and preferences of household contacts (HHCs) for HHCT.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study in Rustenburg, South Africa from September 2013 to March 2015. Twenty-four HHCs (>= 18years) had audio-recorded in-depth interviews. We used an inductive thematic analysis approach to develop themes. We made an a priori assumption that we would reach saturation with at least 20 interviews.ResultsThere were 16 (66.7%) females (median age=36years) and eight (33.3%) males (median age=34years). Two themes developed: (i) Positive attitude of HHCs towards TB services provided at home and (ii) HHCs relationship to and acceptance of people living with TB (PLTB). The first main theme emphasized that HHCs appreciated the home visits. Participants preferred home visits because they had negative experiences at the clinic such as delayed waiting times and long queues. HHCs supported the screening of children for TB at home. Participants suggested that the research staff could expand their services by screening for diabetes and hypertension alongside TB screening. In the second main theme, there was a sense of responsibility from the HHCs towards accepting the diagnosis of PLTB and caring for them. A sub-theme that emerged was that as their knowledge on TB disease improved, they accepted the TB status of the PLTB empowering them to take care of the PLTB.ConclusionsHHCs are supportive of HHCT and felt empowered by receiving TB education that ultimately allowed them to better understand and care for PLTB. HHCs were supportive of screening children for TB at home. Future HHCT activities should consider raising community awareness on the benefits of TB contact tracing at households.

AB  - Purpose This research aims to examine the effect of spokesperson facial symmetry on advertisement attitude, brand attitude and purchase intention and the mediating role of source authenticity on attitudinal and behavioral judgments.
   Design/methodology/approach Two studies were undertaken. Study 1 examined the effect of facial symmetry on source authenticity and endorsement effectiveness. Study 2 investigated the influence of the authentic facial cues of freckles and moles on source authenticity and advertisement attitude, brand attitude and purchase intention.
   Findings Findings indicate that source authenticity is the mechanism that explains attitudinal and behavioral judgments toward advertisements featuring asymmetrical spokespeople. The phenomenon observed is due to a proposed source authenticity overgeneralization effect, whereby spokespeople with asymmetrical faces are perceived as more genuine and real which, subsequently, results in more positive attitude toward the advertisement, attitude toward the brand and greater purchase intention than advertisements featuring spokespeople with symmetrical faces. The addition of authentic (biological) facial cues (i.e. freckles and moles) on spokespeople with a symmetrical facial structure, however, can heighten perceptions of source authenticity and the manifestation of the source authenticity overgeneralization effect.
   Research limitations/implications This research has implications for marketing managers in the selection and depiction of spokespeople in their advertisements. However, this research is limited, as it only examines the facial feature characteristics of symmetry, freckles, and moles.
   Originality/value This research shows that an asymmetrical facial structure can positively influence source, attitudinal and behavioral judgments. This research also identifies that although symmetrical facial structures dilute source- and endorsement-based judgments, the addition of authentic facial cues, freckles and moles, can reverse the negative effects and enhance perceptions of source authenticity, attitude toward the advertisement, attitude toward the brand and purchase intentions.

AB  - Background: Individuals with physical disabilities face many challenges, especially with mobility. Transportation plays a key role in an individual's health as it provides the access to critical services such as medical visits. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can be one possible solution to increase transportation accessibility. However, there is currently limited information detailing the obstacles individuals with disabilities face when it comes to mobility, or research regarding perceptions of this population toward autonomous vehicles. Objective: The goals of this study were twofold: 1) to identify the accessibility needs associated with transportation for individuals with a physical disability and 2) to understand the initial perceptions of this population towards autonomous vehicles to meet these needs. Methods: A survey with multiple choice and short-answer questions was developed to gather data on transportation issues and experiences from individuals with physical disabilities. This survey was distributed to disability networks. Results: Our results illustrate the many challenges that individuals with physical disabilities experience related to transportation, such as cost, time for planning, and convenience of use. We also found that individuals with physical disabilities had an overall positive attitude towards AVs and would be willing to pay the same price as private transportation or possibly more to use AVs if it had the proper accessibility and safety features. Conclusions: Overall, this work can be used to inform decisions surrounding accessibility of current transportation as well as guide the planning and design of autonomous vehicles for a population with physical disabilities.

AB  - Over the past three decades, several studies have explored the concept of Musical Fit in audio-visual advertising. However, a central problem is the inconsistency of the results derived from these studies. The current level of knowledge does not make it possible to safely predict whether and how Musical Fit influences recipients' attention, brand and product recall, and positive attitudes toward commercials, including purchase intentions. One origin of this problem is the lack of a coherent definition and operationalization of Musical Fit. Therefore, this article describes the development of a transparent and applicable instrument to identify and determine Musical Fit in audio-visual advertising. Starting from music's function of transporting and inducing emotions and its ability to communicate referential meaning, we designed a classification system for relating music to the three most important reference points of a commercial: the narration, the product, and/or the target group. Accordingly, Single, Double, and Perfect Musical Fit can be distinguished and classified into different types. To test whether the developed instrument is applicable in practice, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of 594 German TV commercials. After two pilot tests, the inter-coder reliability of two different coders improved to an average of .80, providing an indication of the instrument's practicability. Surprisingly, the most common Musical Fit types were a Single Fit to Narration (50%), a matching largely unaddressed in studies to date, a Double Fit to Narration and Product (21%), and a Perfect Fit (15%), the type that is most difficult to create.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused both physical and psychological changes in the general public. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between well-being and coping strategies in response to the pandemic. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the mediational role of benefit finding. A total of 521 participants aged 18-65 years were recruited from 29 regions of mainland China. Situation-specific coping strategies, including support seeking, personal hygiene practice and social distancing, were measured at Time 1. Benefit finding and well-being were assessed 1 month later. A multilevel mediation model was conducted with region included in level 2 as cluster ID. Support seeking and personal hygiene practice were positive predictors of benefit finding, which further mediated their relationships with well-being, while social distancing negatively predicted well-being. These results highlight the relationships of support seeking, personal hygiene practice and benefit finding with well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that besides adopting adaptive coping strategies to prevent infection by COVID-19, individuals should be encouraged to recognize benefits associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.

TI  - International citizen project to assess early stage adherence to public health measures for COVID-19 in South Africa
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction
   With over 500 000 infections and nearly 12 000 deaths, South Africa (SA) is the African epicenter of the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. SA has implemented a 5-stage Risk-Adjusted Strategy which includes a phased national lockdown, requiring social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing face masks. Strict adherence to this strategy is crucial to reducing COVID-19 transmission, flattening the curve, and preventing resurgence. As part of the 22-country International Citizens Project COVID-19 (ICPcovid), this study aimed to describe the SA adherence to the Risk-Adjusted Strategy and identify determinants of adherence.
   Method
   During 24 April-15 May 2020, people were electronically invited, through social media platforms and a text blast, to complete an online survey, accessible via www.icpcovid.com. The survey investigated COVID-19 testing and preventative adherence measures, then used logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of adherence.
   Results
   There were 951 participants, with 731(76.9%) 25 to 54 years. Most (672;70.7%) were female, and 705(74.1%) had a university degree. Since the epidemic started, 529(55.6%) and 436(45.9%) participants stated they were eating healthier and taking more vitamins, respectively. Only 82(8.6%) had been COVID-19 tested, and 1(1.2%) tested positive. In public, 905(95.2%) socially distanced, however 99(10.4%) participants had recently attended meetings with over ten people. Regular hand washing was practiced by 907 (95.4%) participants, 774(81.4%) wore face masks and 854(89.8%) stayed home when they experienced flu-like symptoms. The odds of adhering to the guidelines were lower among men versus women (AOR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.528, 0.971) and those who had flu-like symptoms (AOR 0.42, 95% CI = 0.277, 0.628). In contrast, increased odds were reported for those who reported increased vitamin intake (AOR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.044,1.798), and were either cohabiting or married (AOR 1.39, 95% CI = 1.042,1.847).
   Conclusion
   Despite high reported adherence, face mask use and symptomatic individuals not self-isolating, were areas for improvement. However, these factors cannot solely account for SA's increasing COVID-19 cases. Larger general population studies are needed to identify other adherence predictors for a strengthened SA COVID-19 response. While the government must continue to educate the entire population on preventative measures, provide personal protective equipment and stress the importance of adherence, there also needs to be implementation of prioritised prevention strategies for men and single individuals to address their demonstrated lower adherence.

AB  - A laboratory experiment, funded by the U. S. National Institutes of Health, involved 243 U. S. undergraduate students and employed a 2 (gain-framed vs. loss-framed) x 2 (high vs. low threat) plus control group pretest-posttest experimental design to assess the combined effects of frame (gain vs. loss) and level of threat of public service announcements (PSAs) about marijuana on attitudes, beliefs, and intentions related to marijuana, as well as the relationship of message condition to ratings of PSAs. Results suggest that loss-framed messages may lead to greater perceived threat, as well as reactance, and gain-framed messages may lead to a greater reduction in positive attitudes toward marijuana than loss-framed messages. Finally, frame and threat may interact in a complex way. Further research is suggested to replicate these findings. A substantial body of carefully crafted and systematic research studies examining both content and features of messages increasingly informs mass media prevention efforts, including the development of public service announcements (PSAs). Although the significance of messages on commercial broadcast stations may be diminishing with the increasing role and impact of new media, many of the basic questions addressed by this research are likely to apply across media channels. Nonetheless, important questions about what makes a message effective in changing an individual's attitudes or behavior remain to be answered. In this paper, the authors focus on two theoretically derived strategies that offer possibilities for developing persuasive messages: framing and threat.

AB  - The rapid spread of infectious diseases is a major public health problem. Recent developments in fighting these diseases have heightened the need for a contact tracing process. Contact tracing can be considered an ideal method for controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. The result of the contact tracing process is performing diagnostic tests, treating for suspected cases or self-isolation, and then treating for infected persons; this eventually results in limiting the spread of diseases. This paper proposes a technique named TraceAll that traces all contacts exposed to the infected patient and produces a list of these contacts to be considered potentially infected patients. Initially, it considers the infected patient as the querying user and starts to fetch the contacts exposed to him. Secondly, it obtains all the trajectories that belong to the objects moved nearby the querying user. Next, it investigates these trajectories by considering the social distance and exposure period to identify if these objects have become infected or not. The experimental evaluation of the proposed technique with real data sets illustrates the effectiveness of this solution. Comparative analysis experiments confirm that TraceAll outperforms baseline methods by 40% regarding the efficiency of answering contact tracing queries.

AB  - Global attitude certainty consists of two subconstructs: attitude clarity-certainty that one is aware of one's true attitudes-and attitude correctness, certainty that one's attitudes are morally correct and valid. Attitude correctness is more often associated with group-related psychological and behavioral outcomes than attitude clarity. As such, we expected that attitude correctness, but not attitude clarity, would be associated with more negative attitudes toward outgroups when group boundaries are defined by attitudes. Across four studies, greater attitude correctness related to more negative attitudes toward attitudinal outgroups regardless of context (e.g., political, religious); attitude clarity's relationship to prejudice was inconsistent (Studies 1a and 2: positive or no relationship; Study 3: negative; Studies 1b and 4: no relationship). In Studies 2 and 3, mediational analyses showed that greater attitude correctness was associated with stronger beliefs that group boundaries are sharp and distinct (i.e., discreteness beliefs), which in turn was associated with greater prejudice. Finally, Study 4 demonstrated that the attitude correctness-prejudice link was associated with greater intention to engage in competitive behaviors in a conflict resolution scenario with an outgroup member.

AB  - Around the globe, many families are experiencing significant anxieties linked to COVID-19. These include health concerns and economic pressures, both of which are frequently taking place against a backdrop of various levels of social isolation. In addition, many parents have been juggling home schooling requirements in the face of radically different work arrangements including the loss of employment altogether. Unsurprisingly, additional challenges and stresses are emerging for separated families, family law professionals, and family courts. In this article - written at a point-in-time in a rapidly evolving COVID-19 context - we reflect on key challenges for separated families in Australia, and some of the emerging professional responses.
   Key Points for the Family Court Community:
   center dot In the context of COVID-19, new challenges and stresses are emerging in Australia for separated families, family law professionals, and family law courts.
   center dot Post-separation family relationship services and the courts are attempting to assist parents to manage problems that have emerged in the wake of the pandemic; in the context of social distancing, they are under pressure to deliver responses that are safe and are perceived to be safe.
   center dot While all aspects of the Australian family law system were ill prepared for the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, both services and courts have been quick to respond and adapt.
   center dot The need for rapid adaptation in response to social distancing has required embracing `virtual' service delivery and `virtual' court hearings. These largely untested processes require evaluation.
   center dot Though there are obvious and less obvious dangers, we argue that the need to adapt service delivery in the context of a global pandemic is creating unanticipated opportunities for separated parents, family and relationship support services, and family courts.
   center dot These opportunities and challenges need to be better understood and managed as we move beyond the necessarily immediate responses to the pandemic.

AB  - Haiti has the highest number of individuals living with HIV in the Caribbean. Due to Haiti's resource-poor environment and inadequate mental health and substance abuse services, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be especially difficult. This study examined associations among demographics, maladaptive coping, partner conflict, alcohol problems, depression, and negative attitudes about medications and their impact on adherence among 194 HIV-positive Haitians. In a mediated directional structural equation model, depression and negative attitudes about ART directly predicted poorer adherence. Greater partner conflict, maladaptive coping and alcohol problems predicted more depression. Maladaptive coping predicted a negative attitude about ART. Alcohol problems predicted partner conflict and maladaptive coping. Significant indirect effects on adherence mediated through both depression and negative attitudes about ART include negative effects of female gender, alcohol problems and maladaptive coping. Results highlight the importance of integrated care for depression, alcohol use and other psychosocial problems to increase ART adherence.

AB  - Products such as vegetables and fruits in markets in Taiwan have small green labels denoting that they are traceable agricultural products. This study investigated the effect of social influence and system characteristics on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) regarding the Taiwan Agricultural and Food Traceability (TAFT) system. This study also examined the effects of PU and PEOU on attitudes and reuse intention, and employed confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Questionnaires were developed and the measurement items were based on an extensive review of related studies to ensure content validity in addition to items from an original scale. Four hundred questionnaires from older adults were collected through a quantitative survey. The respondents were all aged between 50 and 90 years, with an average age of 57.61 years. Almost one quarter (21.8%) of respondents had experiences of using traceability quick response (QR) codes in 2016. Regarding purchase experience, 59% of the respondents had experiences of purchasing agricultural products using traceability QR codes. The results revealed that whereas subjective norms, image, and visibility have a positive effect on PU, information quality and system quality affected the PEOU of the TAFT system. Moreover, trust has a positive influence on reuse intention. A healthy diet plays a crucial role in the health promotion activities of elderly people. The findings could help those involved in the TAFT system improve their understanding of the attendant factors of PU and PEOU and promote positive attitudes in elderly people about this system, thereby increasing their reuse intentions.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore informetrics researchers' use of social media for academic activities, their attitudes to the applicability of altmetrics in research evaluation, the factors influencing their attitudes, and the main opportunities and weaknesses of using altmetrics. Design/methodology/approach A survey using a questionnaire was conducted with researchers who participated in the 16th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics ISSI 2017 and a sample of 125 respondents was obtained. Findings Progressively more researchers are using social media for different types of academic activities. The study found that many factors affect informetrics researchers' attitudes in different application scenarios with respect to research evaluation. Researchers who have studied altmetrics and who began using social media platforms recently or frequently have more positive attitudes. Academic users and social users have statistically significantly disparate attitudes toward altmetrics in different disciplines and different application scenarios. Research limitations/implications Our study only focused on 125 informetrics researchers, who participated in ISSI 2017. We mainly used the questionnaire method, but did not conduct in-depth interviews with the researcher's views. Originality/value Informetrics researchers are participants in social media and major researchers of altmetrics. Previous research has examined their use of social media, and this study combines this use of social media with their attitudes to altmetrics to explore the value of altmetrics from a particular perspective. The paper also provides suggestions for the application of altmetrics in research evaluation.

AB  - The number of publications on live online teaching and distance learning has significantly increased over the past two years since the outbreak and worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but more research is needed on effective methodologies and their impact on the learning process. This research aimed to analyze student interaction and multimodal communication through Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) in a Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC) environment. For this purpose, 90 teacher candidates enrolled in the subject Applied Linguistics at a university were randomly assigned in different teams to create collaboratively digital infographics based on different language teaching methods. Then, all the teams explained their projects online and the classmates completed two multimedia activities based on each method. Finally, the participants discussed the self-perceived benefits (relevance, enjoyment, interest) and limitations (connectivity, distraction) of SCMC in language learning. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through pre- and post-tests, class observation and online discussion. The statistical data and research findings revealed a positive attitude towards the integration of TBLT in an SCMC environment and a high level of satisfaction with multimodal communication (written, verbal, visual) and student interaction. However, the language teacher candidates complained about the low quality of the digital materials, the use of technology just for substitution, and the lack of peer-to-peer interaction in their live online classes during the pandemic.

AB  - Introduction In healthcare, there is ongoing flux in expectations for students and practitioners. Establishing integrated systems of monitoring and evidencing students' development is imperative. With current trends towards the use of technology in tertiary education, online learning environments (OLEs) could constitute more effective evidencing of student progress in the clinical environment. However, there is little research exploring clinical educators' experiences with implementing technology in clinical education. The research aimed to: Examine clinical educators' attitudes towards technology and its use in clinical education. Explore clinical educators' experiences of implementing technologies in a clinical environment. Methods A mixed methods approach was taken to explore the aims. A previously validated technology attitude survey (TAS) was used with slight modifications, as well as open-ended qualitative responses. These explored clinical educators' experiences of the implementation of one specific OLE (PebblePad (TM)) in their clinical environments. The survey was sent to clinical educators involved in the supervision of Medical Imaging students on clinical placement. Results Clinical educators play pivotal roles in students' professional development and, given current trends in tertiary education, are under increasing pressure to utilise OLEs. This poses particular challenges in clinical environments. Irrespective of the challenges, successful implementation of technology in any environment is dependent on the attitudes of the users. Conclusions Clinical environments have specific challenges when implementing technology such as access to computers and time constraints on practitioners. Even with positive attitudes towards technology, a change in pedagogical outlook when using technology in clinical teaching is necessary.

AB  - Based on 29 Armed Forces' statements produced on the Comprehensive Counterterrorism Operation of Sinai 2018, this case study argues a consequential faculty and a constitutive functionality of war on terror discourse in reproducing social national identity. Examining an under researched discourse, this paper claims an underlying 'crowd discursive manipulation' as a function of this discourse. In doing so, it contends a delicate reformulation in the compositional perspective of a terrorist using dialectical formation of a fellow-citizen/kindred enemy who is combated rationally, ethically, and emotionally. This paper proposes an additional dimension of the terrorist's social identity which may render a consequential restructure of the dynamics of social context. Informed by a fuse of Reisigl and Wodak's Theory of Argumentative Topoi (2001) and Van Dijk's Ideology Square (1998) in Critical Discourse Analysis, this paper critically analyses the dialectical and the discursive construction of ideology, and the reformation of identity deploying new socio-political realities. It conceives at least three cardinal dialectal strategies: conflict, fear, and legitimacy which work consecutively to sell 'noble war'. The results suggest that war on terror discourse relies on constructive, transformative, destructive, exclusionary, and justificatory meso-strategies. This marks the discursive reconstruction of nationalism instantiating social exclusion, impersonalisation and Otherness.

AB  - Low organ donation rates are a major obstacle to the expansion of transplant opportunities in the Middle East. Awareness and opinion about organ donation affect willingness to donate. This study aims to evaluate public attitudes and knowledge about deceased organ donation (DOD) in Jordan in support of larger efforts to increase donor rates. A mixed qualitative and quantitative approach was used. Qualitative, one-on-one interviews were used to create a quantitative survey, which was administered to randomly-selected individuals over a 5-month period. The questionnaire used series of statements to evaluate knowledge and attitude about DOD on a scaling system and converted to scores (0-4). A total of 15 qualitative interviews and 500 quantitative surveys (78.4% response rate) were completed. Only 78 (15.6%) knew they could donate their organs after death. Only 49 (9.8%) were registered as donors, although 373 (74.6%) knew about the registration process. Internet (52.2%) and social media (51.0%) were the most common sources of information. The overall knowledge score was moderately high at 68.8% (2.75 +/- 1.31). Misconceptions persisted about body disfigurement, diagnostic accuracy of brain-death, and waiting list equity. The total attitude score was moderately positive at 65.8% (2.63 +/- 0.02). Public awareness campaigns (85.3%, 3.42 +/- 0.95) and regulatory legislation (78.8%, 3.15 +/- 0.99) were considered especially positive, while negative attitudes about religious importance of educational campaigns and regulatory legislation and would likely benefit from information from health-care providers and religious leaders.

AB  - Celebrities who use Instagram can influence their female followers in many ways, for instance, in influencing their perceptions on body image, adoption of healthy eating lifestyles, and persuading them to purchase products or services endorsed by these celebrities. Accordingly, this study aims to examine the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on Instagram on hijab culture among Muslim women in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among female university students from the International Islamic University of Malaysia (N = 630). In order to participate in the study, respondents completed an online survey and are instructed to think about a favourite female Muslim celebrity they follow on Instagram while completing the research instrument. Results indicate that almost one-third of the most popular Muslim celebrities among females Instagram users are non-traditional celebrities (i.e. bloggers/vloggers, YouTube personalities and social media influencers). Furthermore, attitude homophily and parasocial interaction with said celebrity may significantly influence the likelihood that the celebrity's profile will be visited, and the number of likes on their photos. Finally, after controlling for the respondents' religious educational background, this study found that those who had positive attitude and behaviour towards the hijab, and perceived a higher degree of parasocial bond with Muslim celebrities on Instagram tended to have a more positive perception towards the hijab culture. The repercussions of these findings on the parasocial interaction theory, and the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on social media over hijab culture are discussed.

AB  - Social media platforms archive the content and flow of social exchange across communication networks. This may present challenges for individuals because using these platforms increases the probability of observing exchanges among their friends in which they were unintentionally excluded. This study randomly assigned 194 participants to conditions where they were presented with written scenarios describing hypothetical online conversations between their close friends in which they were excluded or included. Results suggest that participants in the excluded condition experienced the most negative and least positive emotional responses. Further, participants with the tendency to devote cognitive resources to understanding their social networks-a construct we call network attention-were particularly sensitive to the stimuli. Network attention predicted negative emotional responses in the excluded condition and positive emotional responses in the included condition. Results are discussed in the context of communication and cognition via social media.

AB  - Various intelligent technologies have been applied during COVID-19, which has become a worldwide public health emergency and brought significant challenges to the medical systems around the world. Notably, the application of robots has played a role in hospitals, quarantine facilities and public spaces and has attracted much attention from the media and the public. This study is based on a questionnaire survey on the perception and reception of robots used for medical care in the pandemic among the Chinese population. A total of 1667 people participated in the survey, 93.6% of respondents were pursuing or had completed a bachelor, master or even doctorate degree. The results show that Chinese people generally held positive attitudes towards "anti-pandemic robots " and affirmed their contribution to reducing the burden of medical care and virus transmission. A few respondents were concerned about the issues of robots replacing humans and it was apparent that their ethical views on robots were not completely consistent across their demographics (e.g., age, industry). Nevertheless, most respondents tended to be optimistic about robot applications and dialectical about the ethical issues involved. This is related to the prominent role robots played during the pandemic, the Chinese public's expectations of new technologies and technology-friendly public opinion in China. Exploring the perception and reception of anti-pandemic robots in different countries or cultures is important because it can shed some light on the future applications of robots, especially in the field of infectious disease control.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding Understanding how medical students view the Specialty of Emergency Medicine is important. The knowledge helps the leaders in Emergency Medicine better plan the development of the specialty. In the medical literature, few studies primarily investigated this subject. Most were on the career choice of medical students. This study aimed at addressing this knowledge gap. Methods: It was a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of the year 3 to 5 medical students studying at the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong. The questionnaire measuring their attitude consisted of 16 items in 3 domains: overall merits of Emergency Medicine, the role and function of emergency physicians and the career prospect in Emergency Medicine. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Their attitude was represented by an attitude score with 80 being most positive and 16 most negative. Results: A total of 298 students participated in the survey. The response rate was 64.5%. The overall median attitude score was 59. Year 5 students had a statistically significant higher score. Emergency Medicine ranked third in their first specialty choice after qualification. There was no statistical relationship between a student's attitude score and the specialty choice. Conclusion: The students' overall attitude towards Emergency Medicine was positive. Senior students held a more positive attitude. A student's specialty choice after qualification did not seem to relate to their attitude towards the specialty.

AB  - In modern educational practices, the issue of dependence on the experience of using multimedia by students and the adoption of technologies in education, the perception of their benefits and effectiveness in blended learning is little covered. The purpose of the academic paper lies in assessing the audiovisual context of multimedia technologies, its acceptance by students in practice on the example of using video lectures in blended learning. The methodology is based on an online survey of 120 students of Ukrainian universities who have assessed the experience level in using video lectures, as well as the constructs as follows: Technology Characteristics, Fit, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Attitude, Intention to Use, Actual Use. The results show that the majority of students use video lectures to a certain extent in their training (20,8% have used technology to a certain extent, 49,2% have often used technology in training, 20% are regular users of technology). It has been revealed that most students agree with the relevance of video lectures, the accuracy of lectures, the brevity of lectures, the clarity of lectures, as well as the high quality of lecture videos. It has been estimated that 42,5% believe that lecture videos are an effective tool towards supporting students in hybrid learning. 26,7% of students consider video lectures to be appropriate technologies for online / hybrid courses. In general, 37,5% of respondents find video lectures useful; however, 35,0% do not agree with this statement. 83,3% of students have rated the high level of ease of access to video. In total, 95% of students find lecture videos easy to use. In general, positive attitude of students to video lectures has been revealed.

AB  - Purpose: The main aim of this article is to verify by applied field research the relationship between the e-service quality provided by the travel youtubers and the e-relationship quality with the users, formed by trust, satisfaction and commitment.
   Design/methodology/approach: For the theoretical framework and the creation of the hypothesis there was used a literature review that is focused on travel youtubers, relationship marketing and service quality online. For confirmation of the hypothesis there was applied a quantitative survey technique to 1245 sample units.
   Findings: Dimensions of information and communication, that are part of the quality of the service, are the ones that affect the most in the development of the quality of the relation. As a consequence, travel youtubers have to develop a strategy that includes all kinds of actions of content creation in order to grow their notoriety while not selling any sort of product or service. Hence, the quality of the relation must be defined as a multi-dimensional construct with a superior order formed by trust, satisfaction and commitment as main dimensions that may be influenced (antecedent) or may be admitted of other dimensions (consequents), having them put through clients and users. Therefore, travel youtubers must create among their followers a positive attitude towards themselves. Attitude is formed by cognitive elements (trust), affective elements (satisfaction) and conative elements (commitment).
   Originality/value: This research paper offers theoretical framework confirmed by a field study for measuring quality relationship online by users and travel youtubers and identifies which are the dimensions that form the user's attitude. These attitudes will be transformed into behaviors such as the repetition of purchase and the development of positive word-of-mouth communication.

AB  - Objective The effectiveness of the national drug safety monitoring program directly depends on the active participation of healthcare professionals in reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The aim of the study was to explore community pharmacists' comprehension of pharmacovigilance, their perspectives toward reporting ADRs and investigate the current practice of ADR reporting among pharmacists in Serbia. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of pharmacists in Serbia between November 2019 and March 2020 using a pre-tested questionnaire distributed online. Eligible participants were community pharmacists in Serbia who were willing to participate in the study during the data collection period. Non-parametric statistical tests were performed in the analysis of knowledge, perspectives and ADR reporting. The validity and reliability of the survey were measured by exploratory factor analysis. Results The median knowledge score was 6 out of 10 (interquartile range 5-7, range 2-10). No significant differences in the knowledge scores of pharmacists were found based on weekly working hours (U = 24,805, p = .374), working experience (chi(2) = 4.011, DF = 2, p = .135), being a member of a professional organization (U = 24,312, p = .209), or highest level of pharmacy qualification obtained (chi(2) = 3.233, DF = 3, p = .506). Only 28.8% of pharmacists reported ADR at least once a year, while the majority of them have never reported any ADRs. Conclusions Despite the community pharmacists' positive attitude toward adverse drug reporting and their role in the process, they show limited knowledge regarding the issue and highly prevalent under-reporting of ADRs. Educational programs are necessary to increase ADRs reporting.

AB  - Purpose Outsourcing of accounting increasingly attracts research interest, but research concerning the impact of the benefits of outsourcing on firm capabilities and performance across firms remains limited. This paper aims to reveal the unobservable latent classes of firms that outsource their accounting functions by testing a research model concerning the topic. Design/methodology/approach The authors build on accounting outsourcing research and adapt a research model from the literature on business services outsourcing. The authors analyze the data from 261 small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe using finite mixture structural equation modeling (FMSEM) and additional methods. Findings The authors reveal three latent classes with different research models. Thriving outsourcers (N = 103) have a positive attitude toward accounting outsourcing and associate competitive capabilities with mediating the relationship from outsourcing benefits to firm performance. Annoyed outsourcers (N = 143) are dissatisfied with their accounting service provider and only associate outsourcing benefits with competitive capabilities. Convenient outsourcers (N = 15) feel comfortable with their current accounting service provider and associate outsourcing benefits with neither capabilities nor with firm performance. Research limitations/implications The study initiates the discussion about the unobservable heterogeneity among accounting outsourcers. The study introduces the use of the FMSEM method in accounting outsourcing research. Practical implications The study offers novel insights concerning accounting outsourcers and proposes original explanations for their outsourcing decisions that would help both the outsourcers and accounting service providers. Originality/value The study might be the first to categorize accounting outsourcers using FMSEM.

TI  - Mobile phone applications use while driving in Ukraine: Self-reported frequencies and psychosocial factors underpinning this risky behaviour
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the fact that mobile phones have been transformed over the last decade into information and communication hubs that are fundamental to modern life, there is little information on how this has impacted on mobile phone use while driving. The present study was conducted in Ukraine, where this risky behaviour remains a common driving practice, despite legislative bans. A total of 220 (male = 82%; mean age = 35.53; SD = 10.54) drivers completed an online survey assessing frequency of engaging in a range of mobile phone applications while driving. Four variables of the theory of planned behaviour (general attitude and intention towards phone use while driving, social norms towards mobile phone use, perceived behavioural control, the specific beliefs about being able to engage in distracting activities and drive safely), and type A behaviour pattern were also collected. The results showed that, during the last year, 65% of drivers had read a text message and 49% had written a text using mobile phone applications. Likewise, a substantial proportion of the sample reported using social media while driving, by checking (34%), sending or typing a post (25%) on social network applications. Hierarchical stepwise regressions showed that a positive attitude towards mobile phone use while driving and beliefs about being able to drive safely and write or read a text message were significantly associated with the mobile phone applications use while driving. No associations were found between the type A behaviour pattern and mobile phone applications use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition of the role of mobile learning (M-learning) for undergraduate (UG) academic education and teaching purposes, but teacher attitudes toward it can be variable.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the attitudes toward the incorporation of M-learning methods for UG medical education among resident doctors at a government medical college in Delhi, India.\
   METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted for 3-months duration (2019) among 60 final year junior and senior resident doctors. The participants were selected from all the preclinical and paraclinical department, and one clinical department selected randomly based on the probability proportion to size method. The data was collected using self-administered instruments including the modified 20-item M-learning Perception Scale (MLPS).
   RESULTS: Social media (36.7%) and instant messaging platforms (85%) were routinely used by the participants for exchanging academic (medical) and health-related information. The mean score for all the MLPS item responses was >3, indicating positive attitudes toward M-Learning. The participants expressed maximum agreement with the views stating M-Learning can "supplement traditional teaching," was "reliable for personal use," and "improves the quality of lessons." The responses of those participants having preexisting familiarity with health information and education portals, and those aware of massive open online courses correlated significantly with higher MLPS scores.
   CONCLUSION: M-learning is visualized as an increasingly relevant teaching and learning medium by early-career resident doctors involved in UG medical education in India.

AB  - Extreme partisan animosity has been on the rise in the US and is prevalent around the world. This hostility is typically attributed to social group identity, motivated reasoning, or a combination thereof. In this paper, I empirically examine a novel contributing factor: the "unmotivated" cognitive bias of overprecision (over-confidence in precision of beliefs). Overprecision could cause partisan hostility indirectly via inflated confidence in one's own ideology, partisan identity, or perceptions of social distance between the parties. Overprecision could also cause this hostility directly by causing excessively strong inferences from observed information that is either skewed against the out-party or simply misunderstood. Using a nationally representative sample, I find consistent support for direct effects of overprecision and mixed support for indirect effects. The point estimates imply a one standard deviation increase in a respondent's overprecision predicts as much as a 0.71 standard deviation decline in relative out-party favorability.

AB  - Background Virtual reality (VR) has several applications in the medical domain and also generates a secure environment to carry out activities. Evaluation of the effectiveness of VR among older populations revealed positive effects of VR as a tool to reduce risks of falls and also improve the social and emotional well-being of older adults. The decline in physical and mental health, the loss of functional capabilities, and a weakening of social ties represent obstacles towards active aging among older adults and indicate a need for support. Existing research focused on the effects of VR among older populations, and its uses and benefits. Our study investigated the acceptance and use of VR by the elderly. Methods This pilot study was conducted on 30 older adults who voluntarily participated during March to May 2018. Nine VR applications that promote physical activities, motivate users, and provide entertainment were chosen for this study. Participants were asked to use any one of the applications of their choice for 15 min twice a week for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model and a literature review, to evaluate their acceptance of VR technology. Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis was used to test the internal consistency of the questionnaire items. Pearson's product moment correlation was used to examine the validity of the questionnaire. A linear regression and mediation analysis were utilized to identify relationships among the variables of the questionnaire. Results In total, six male and 24 female participants aged 6095 years volunteered to participate in the study. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social norms, and perceived enjoyment were seen to have had significant effects on the intention to use VR. Participants agreed to a large extent regarding the perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and their experience of using VR. Thus, VR was seen to have high acceptance among this elderly population. Conclusions Older people have positive perceptions towards accepting and using VR to support active aging. They perceived VR to be useful, easy to use, and an enjoyable experience, implying positive attitudes toward adopting this new technology.

AB  - The aim of this study is to identify combinations of different personality traits among teaching faculty and explore for which combinations college managers should use change leadership to mediate their cognition in a motivation mechanism and for which combinations doing so is not necessary. In this study, two-stage cluster analysis and partial least squares are the methods for identifying different combinations of personality traits and test mediation. This study uses 350 samples for analysis. From the test results, this study first identifies three combinations of personality traits, including "high central force but outgoing", "middle-high central force but outgoing and a little nervousness", and "synthesizing type". The "highly central force but outgoing" and "middle-high central force but outgoing and a little nervousness" do not need to be mediated by change leadership, and teaching faculty who have these two combinations of personality traits will have positive attitudes or thoughts towards the motivation mechanism. Regarding the "synthesizing type", those with this combination of personality traits will demonstrate complex attitudes, reactions, or thinking, and therefore, college managers should think about how to change their attitudes or behaviour through change leadership to communicate and guide them to accept the motivation mechanism.

AB  - COVID-19 has required researchers to change methods to better reflect the new realities of social distancing, sheltering in place, and the use of extended quarantines to isolate from the community. The paper illustrates the implications of shifting recruitment strategies midstream with populations that are already normally considered 'hard-to-reach'. The population in this illustration involves mothers with young children in shared parenting arrangements across three Canadian provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario) who have experienced domestic violence. Due to public health protocols that required social distancing, strategies typically used to engage vulnerable populations in research, including collaborating with community service providers and face-to-face contact were no longer possible. With limited knowledge and resources, we pivoted our recruitment strategy from the use of posters in agencies to a paid Facebook advertisement strategy. Prior to our social media campaign, our time-intensive recruitment efforts had produced very few responses to our online survey. Our advertisement ran from March 13 to 12 July 2020 and Facebook reported that it 'reached' an approximate 42,488 viewers Through Facebook, we discovered a number of support groups for mothers with young children that only exist online. Rather than putting up posters in their settings, community service providers became online recruiters through their 'tweets', 'likes', and 'sharing' of our study. The impact of COVID-19 on our research has taught us about the power of social media as a recruitment strategy. Facebook is a useful tool to enhance research awareness and engagement with hard-to-reach populations even post COVID-19.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of in-store private label marketing to impact the attitude of consumers towards private label brands (PLBs) by influencing consumers' perceived quality variations between the PLBs and national brands. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on "Cue utilisation theory" and focusses on how retailers can influence consumers' perception of quality variations by providing them in-store marketing cues. Data was collected through the mall intercept method in New Delhi, India. Data analysis was done using AMOS 25 and the PROCESS SPSS macro. Findings This study establishes the effect of in-store private label marketing in improving consumers' quality perception of PLBs vis-a-vis national brands and thereby leading to a positive attitude towards PLBs. Further, the national brand promotions attitude is found to moderate the relationship between private label marketing and attitude towards PLBs. However, contrary to the authors' expectations, it has a positive effect on this relationship. The study found an insignificant moderation influence of price consciousness. Originality/value This study complements existing literature on "Cue utilisation theory" by demonstrating the importance of in-store private label marketing in improving consumers' attitudes towards PLBs. It also extends to fill some gaps in the literature by studying the direct, mediating and moderating relationship among in-store private label marketing, perceived quality variations, price consciousness, national brand promotion attitude and attitude towards PLBs, especially in an emerging market such as India.

AB  - Dynamic assessment has been widely used in educational literature over the past two decades. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of using dynamic assessment on teaching the rhythm of English to Iranian EFL learners and scrutinizing their attitudes towards it. The participants of the study were 30 Iranian EFL leaners at the intermediate level of proficiency, who were conveniently selected from a foreign language institute in Isfahan, Iran. In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the participants were divided into two homogenous groups, including the experimental group and control group. In this quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest-control-group-design research study, the control group followed traditional method of learning pronunciation and rhythm, while dynamic assessment approach was used to teach the same materials to the experimental group. In contrast to the control group, the experimental group took an active role in the classroom by having more interaction and using the ongoing hints and prompts provided by the teacher. The result of the posttest unfolded that there was a significant difference between the performances of the two groups, and that the experimental group participants managed to outperform the control group members on the pronunciation posttest. Moreover, based on the attitude questionnaire, EFL learners had grown a positive attitude towards the use of dynamic assessment to learn rhythm. The results of this study demonstrated that through the implementation of DA, the proper form of mediation could be provided to the learners regarding their ZPD.

Results: Compared with women who did not attend the screening service (n = 195), women who attended (n = 105) were older (OR 4.29; 95% Cl, 1.61-11.48, age 40-49 years versus 20-29 years), listened regularly to the radio (OR 24.76; 95% CI, 11.49-53.33, listened to radio 1-3 times per week versus not at all), had a poorer quality of life (OR 4.91; CI, 1.96-12.32, lowest versus highest score), had faced cost barriers to obtaining health care in the preceding year (OR 2.24; 95% CI, 1.11-4.53, yes versus no), and held a more positive attitude toward cervical cancer screening (OR 4.64; 95% Cl, 1.39-15.55, least versus most averse). Conclusion: Efforts aimed at improving screening rates in rural Tanzania need to address both structural and individual-level barriers, including knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer prevention, cost barriers to care, and access to health information.

AB  - Romantic relationship satisfaction (RRS) is important for mental/physical health but varies greatly across individuals. To date, we have known little about the biological (genetic and neural) correlates of RRS. We tested the hypothesis that the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), the promoter region of the gene SLC6A4 that codes for the serotonin transporter protein, is associated with individuals' RRS. Moreover, we investigated neural activity that mediates 5-HTTLPR association with RRS by scanning short-short (s/s) and long-long (l/l) homozygotes of 5-HTTLPR, using functional MRI, during a Cyberball game that resulted in social exclusion. l/l compared with s/s allele carriers reported higher RRS but lower social interaction anxiety. l/l compared with s/s carriers showed stronger activity in the right ventral prefrontal cortex (RVPFC) and stronger functional connectivity between the dorsal and rostral ACC when being excluded from the Cyberball game. Moreover, the 5-HTTLPR association with RRS was mediated by the RVPFC activity and the 5-HTTLPR association with social interaction anxiety was mediated by both the dorsal-rostral ACC connectivity and RVPFC activity. Our findings suggest that 5-HTTLPR is associated with satisfaction of one's own romantic relationships and this association is mediated by the neural activity in the brain region related to emotion regulation.

T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - BELIEFS
AB  - Past research suggests that religion and science may conflict on which is a better tool for explaining the world. This conflict implies that religiosity might negatively impact both attitudes toward science and science knowledge. However, past research has focused mostly on religious affiliation and has not consistently identified such a relation using a general religiosity measure that assesses religious beliefs and religious practice. Using two large, nationally representative datasets as well as two original datasets, and controlling for relevant demographic variables, four studies (N = 9,205) showed that general measures of religiosity are negatively associated with science knowledge, a relation that was partially mediated by an association between religiosity and negative attitudes toward science. Study 2 also showed that parents' reports about their religiosity and its role in their children's upbringing predicted, some 20 years later, their children's attitudes toward science. The studies are correlational but the longitudinal relations in Study 2 suggests that religiosity might undermine science literacy.

AB  - Background: Dental professionals can play a pivotal role in educating the public about the harmful effects of smoking and encouraging them to quit the habit. Aim: This study assesses the attitudes and practices of tobacco cessation counseling (TCC) among dental professionals in Saudi Arabia. Patients and Methods: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study targeted dentists and dental interns working in government and private sectors in Saudi Arabia. We conducted a descriptive analysis by using SPSS Statistics, version 25.0. Results: A total of 895 respondents (314 interns and 581 dentists) participated in this survey. Although the majority of respondents (93%) reported that they always ask patients about tobacco habits, only 59% reported recording tobacco habits in patients' files, and only 55% of the respondents reported explaining to patients the harmful effects of tobacco. Around 91% of the participants believe that a dental clinic is an appropriate place for TCC, and 22% believe that TCC has a negative impact on dental practice. Smoking status, work setting, and the number of years since graduation were found to be significantly associated with the respondents' attitudes and practices. Lack of training, time limitations, and lack of confidence were barriers for TCC. Conclusions: Dental professionals in Saudi Arabia demonstrated relatively positive attitudes but weak practices of TCC. Continuous education and motivation are needed to improve dentists' confidence, attitudes, and willingness for TCC. Integration of tobacco control education in undergraduate curricula is recommended.

AB  - MorphoDent, a computer-assisted learning program designed to teach the anatomy of the adult dentition, was introduced into the curriculum of dentistry at the University of Saarland in Homburg, Germany. Thirty-six second-year students of the School of Dentistry were introduced to morphoDent alongside the traditional lectures of dental anatomy. Questionnaires that evaluated the students' perceptions of virtual learning as well as aspects of the functionality of the program educational objectives were developed and distributed to the students. Online tests were performed and compared with a traditional examination. All questionnaires were returned. A wide variety of aspects dealing the pedagogic implications of e-learning were evaluated by the students, with the overall result being that students are aware of the needed hardware and technical skills and expect the quality of their studies to improve by implementation of e-learning. All sophomores except one felt that morphoDent had helped them in learning dental morphology and reported enjoying the virtual anatomical examination. One-third reported technical difficulties in operating the program. The average exam score was 2.53 (SD: 0.66) for the traditional and 2.23 (SD: 0.59) for the online dental anatomy test. Students expressed their positive attitude towards e-learning in general and indicated that the use of photorealistic 3D models of human teeth supported the process of individual learning of dental anatomy. The online test could be rated as a good option for students' self-performance rating.

AB  - Heavy dependence on fossil fuels among rural households contributes to GHG emissions and air pollution while increasing landfill loads in Poland. This study examines benefits from the renewable energy utilization support program that subsidized household purchase and installation of thermal solar panels. This review of synergy between energy, climate, and air quality policies focuses on solar panel subsidies funded through the European Union and county governments in Mazowieckie Voivodship in Poland. County government offices, using the unpublished list of households receiving subsidies for thermal solar panel installation, mediated in the implementation of the survey and collected 123 completed questionnaires in May and June 2015. The heteroscedasticity-corrected OLS estimates two equations identifying and quantifying factors influencing the purchase price of solar panels and rural household monthly energy bill savings after installation using the gathered data. Among sociodemographic variables, increasing age was associated with an increasing price paid for the panels, but education was associated with paying a lower price for solar panels and lower self-reported energy bill savings. Panel purchase price increased if the respondent was a farmer, viewed subsidies as important, and preferred domestically manufactured panels. Location of household increased the price as compared to the reference county. Savings on monthly energy bills increased if respondent had a positive view of solar energy, expected a decrease in the bill following the purchase of panels, and heated large areas in the house. Subsidy programs have been important in increased household solar energy utilization, especially among farm households, while self-reported energy bill savings increased with positive attitudes towards renewable energy and the larger heated areas in rural residences.

AB  - There is increasing opportunity and support for occupational therapists to expand their scope of practice in community settings. However, evidence is needed to increase occupational therapists' knowledge, confidence, and capacity with building community participation and adopting community-centered practice roles. The purpose of this study is to improve occupational therapists' understanding of an approach to building community participation, through case study of a network of Canadian food security programs. Qualitative case study was utilized. Data were semistructured interviews, field observations, documents, and online social media. Thematic analysis was used to identify and describe four themes that relate to processes used to build community participation. The four themes were use of multiple methods, good leaders are fundamental, growing participation via social media, and leveraging outcomes. Occupational therapists can utilize an approach for building community participation that incorporates resource mobilization. Challenges of sustainability and social exclusion must be addressed.

AB  - Purpose - In the past two decades, the problem of gender disparities in the use of internet has attracted a remarkable interest of researchers. Several studies revealed that female internet users were the disadvantaged group than males, because they had not the same access, experience and use frequency regarding the internet use. Moreover, the negative attitude of the society towards the females' internet use also made them disadvantaged group. Prompted by these observations, this paper aims to examine gender differences in the use of internet among graduate students of a developing society - in public sector universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
   Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative research design using a questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were analyzed through SPSS version 20.0 by using descriptive and inferential statistics.
   Findings - The findings of this study, similar to previous studies, revealed differences among men and women. Majority of men possessed PCs and were more experienced than women. In addition, they were more skilled and faced problems of computer anxiety and distance with less intensity than women. In addition, women used internet mainly for social interaction, communication, entertainment and were more satisfied with some of the educational resources than men. However, men were more satisfied than women regarding the use of most educational internet resources and spent more time on these than women.
   Originality/value - This is the first study in Pakistan that deals with gender differences in the use of internet among graduate students of a developing society - in public sector universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

AB  - Recent work has suggested that media reporting about the public's policy preferences may be self-reinforcing, contributing to greater policy conformity. This article presents additional evidence in support of this theory and adds new detail about the conditionality of these effects. Results from two experiments are described in which respondents are presented with excerpted news stories containing varying polling information about six separate issues. Findings indicate that (a) exposure to such poll results can elicit differences in support for the issue by as much as 10-15 percentage points; (b) the magnitude of these effects varies systematically and inversely in relation to overall attitudinal intensity levels for each issue; and (c) the opinions of specific subgroups referenced in polls matter, producing larger or smaller effects depending on how salient the group is to receivers of the information. Taken together, these results underscore why news reporting about public attitudes deserves greater attention as an important factor in the policy process.

AB  - This paper aims at investigating military and demographic inter-linkages in the context of the Lithuanian sustainability. The investigation combines three important economic aspects such as demographic, military and sustainable development. The authors have revealed that demographic trends should be seen as a necessary conditions for ensuring the functioning of the military sector contributes to public security and sustainable development in general. Correlation and stepwise regression analysis, also Monte Carlo forecasting method have been applied for this purpose. Research results have revealed statistically significant interrelationship between military personnel as a share of total labour force and population growth rate, population median age, total fertility rate as well as birth rate. Moreover, Monte Carlo forecasting method allowed revealing for the next 10 years a steady slight increase in armed forces personnel, stable population growth rates, a rapid aging process and a slight decline of total fertility rate. Military and demographic estimations and future projections allow government to incorporate information into planning and sustainable development policy. The insights from this research may contribute to implementing the goals of sustainable development related to eradication of poverty, inequality, social exclusion, improvement in education, well-being and employment and tackling climate change.

AB  - The first case of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was diagnosed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. By the end of March 2020, 136 countries had positive COVID-19 cases. Meanwhile, in response to the virus, countries instigated various forms of 'lock-downs' and social distancing measures. Globally, children and adolescents could not meet and play or hang out with their friends as they did pre-pandemic. These changes essentially drove children (4-18 years) indoors for their play and recreation needs, instigating significant changes in the lives and day-to-day routines of children almost simultaneously in and across national borders. To understand the impact of these changes to children's play worlds and friendship groups, an online questionnaire was developed for children and parents and rolled out in Ireland, Italy, the United States, and England during the summer of 2020 following ethical approvals. The questionnaire consisted of qualitative (open ended) and quantitative (closed) questions and this paper focuses on the changes to children's (4-18 years) indoor play. We found that the various 'lock-downs' and social distancing measures created largely similar impacts on play behaviors and activities in each developed country, irrespective of culture, the globally did indeed become 'local'. Moreover, playing in 'safe settings' such as the home environment, may have helped to build resilience and to enhance protective factors in children's lives as opposed to a demonstration of global homogeneity [merriam-webster.com]. The impact of 'lock-downs' may counter-intuitively have reduced opportunities for cooperative play and parents' mediation of play due to increased parental responsibilities (working from home, home schooling) which reduced the time available to spend with children in non-school activities, including play.

AB  - Individuals' attitudes toward evidence-based practices (EBP) are critical in adopting, implementing and maintaining the EBP in clinical settings. Multiple empirical studies have examined how work context may shape perceptions and attitudes towards EBP. The current study aims to further explore how both work and family contexts, as assessed by three psychosocial indicators (i.e., occupational stress, work-related social support from coworkers, and work-related social support from family), may affect attitudes toward EBP among health care providers in HIV clinics in China. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from 357 health care providers recruited from 40 HIV clinics across 16 cities/counties in Guangxi China. Structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to test the hypothesized relationships among key study variables. Occupational stress was negatively associated with workrelated social support from coworkers (beta = -.19, 95%CI = [-.31 ,-.12]), which in turn was positively associated with attitudes toward EBP (beta = .17, 95%CI = [.04, .30]). Similarly, occupational stress was negatively related to work-related social support from family (beta = -.34, 95% CI = [-.42,-.25]), which in turn was positively related to attitudes toward EBP (beta = .23, 95%CI = [.12, .35]). Occupational stress was negatively associated with attitudes toward EBP, but the magnitude of association did not reach statistical significance at alpha = .05. Work-related social support from family partially mediated the association between occupational stress and attitudes toward EBP (Sobel's z = 3.27, p < .05). Our findings suggest the importance of integrating work and family contexts, especially family support into the strategies of facilitating the adoption and implementation of EBP. The current study also underscores the needs to reduce occupational stress and enhance work-related social support among health care providers who are in frequent contact with HIV patients. In addition, lack of work-related family support may be a main barrier preventing health care providers from developing a positive attitude toward EBP. Therefore, the interventions aiming for promoting adoption and utilization of EBP need to involve specific strategies to resolve work-family conflicts and improve family members' understanding and support for health care providers in China, especially those who work in a stressful work context such as HIV care.

AB  - This research investigated judgements of moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination, testing whether a wrongdoer's mental states - awareness and foresight - are central determinants of culpability. Participants read about and judged a target person who was described as consciously egalitarian, but harbouring negative attitudes that lead him to treat African Americans unfairly. Two studies showed that participants ascribed greater moral responsibility for discrimination when the target was aware of having negative attitudes than when he was unaware. Surprisingly, moral judgements were equally harsh towards a target who was explicitly aware that his bias could influence his behaviour as a target who was not. To explain this result, a second study showed that the path from awareness to moral responsibility was mediated by perceptions that the target had an obligation to foresee his discriminatory behaviour, but not by perceptions of the target's actual foresight. These results suggest that bias awareness influences moral judgements of those who engage in attitude-based discrimination because it obligates them to foresee harmful consequences. The current findings demonstrate that moral judges consider not just descriptive facts, but also normative standards regarding a wrongdoer's mental states.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to understand how perceived micro-celebrity-product image congruency and product type affect native advertising effectiveness on Instagram. Additionally, the study aims to understand how advertising skepticism and persuasion knowledge affect the effectiveness of native advertising featuring micro-celebrity.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study was administered online using a 2 (product type: high self-expressive vs low self-expressive) x 2 (micro-celebrity and product congruity: congruent vs incongruent) between-subjects factorial design to test the hypotheses. A total of 186 participants, all Instagram users living in the USA, were recruited using an Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). After screening out 14 respondents who were not Instagram users or did not fully answer the questions, a total sample of 172 valid and complete responses were included for hypotheses testing.
   Findings
   The results revealed that when native advertising featured highly self-expressive products and micro-celebrities with good product image fit, consumers had a more positive attitude toward the ad and the brand, higher source credibility and higher electronic word-of-mouth intention. In addition, advertising skepticism was found to moderate the effect of micro-celebrity-product fit on source credibility.
   Originality/value
   This study is the first to examine the effect of micro-celebrity and product congruence on native advertising effectiveness. Moreover, the study provides a better understanding of the advertising skepticism and its influence on source credibility. It discusses why a micro-celebrity's image is a critical factor in shaping attitudes toward native advertising. This study contributes to both the native adverting and influencer marketing literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease primarily spreading through droplet infection which require significant restriction and modification in dental treatment. This study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude of adult population toward COVID-19 and dental treatment and to assess the availability of dental treatment and patient satisfaction during the time of pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted using self-designed electronic questionnaire consisting knowledge and attitude about COVID-19 and dental scenario and questions regarding availability of dental treatment received during the time of pandemic. Knowledge scores were assessed on a maximum total score ranged from 0 to 8, and descriptive statistics were done for questions related to attitudes and dental treatment availability. RESULTS: A total of 495 participants with mean age of 36.6 years participated in the study. The mean knowledge score was 7.12 +/- 0.99 and the participants were found to have good awareness and positive attitude regarding COVID-19 were as considerable number of participants were unaware about the risk associated with dental treatment as well as restrictions imposed on dental procedures. About 18% of participants experienced one or other form of dental complaints during the lockdown period. 4% of participants had no accessibility to any form of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Public awareness is to be improved regarding risk of cross infection that can be associated with dental treatment and public should be motivated to use virtual facilities like tele-dentistry so that no dental emergencies is left untreated, at the same time avoiding any sort of unnecessary hospital visit during the pandemic time.

AB  - Recent studies regarding digital game-based learning (DGBL) are increasing, having the potential to enable new forms of learning, however, it remains unclear how DGBL applications can impact young students' creativity. The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether DGBL application technologies (tablets and smart-phones), can improve creativity skills in preschool children (aged 3-6) and "what the main components effective of creative skills are to enhance learning for young children in DGBL". In this study, the procedure is a case study and the researcher used a sample of apps that were preloaded onto one tablet for seven children aged 3-6 years old in grade Foundation Stage 1 and 2 in a selected Montessori pre-school in Malaysia. In the present study, during using educational digital games by young children, the students' creative thinking process and the relationship between these components based on Analyzing Children's Creative Thinking framework (ACCT) are investigated in order to understand perceptions of creativity skills involved in the learning approach. The findings suggest that DGBL can potentially affect students' ability to develop creative skills and critical thinking, knowledge transfer, acquisition of skills in digital experience, and a positive attitude toward learning as well as provide for deep, insightful learning. The students experienced opportunities for engaging the creative thinking process in their activity and thinking issue understanding and learning in educational digital games. This study provides an outlook for researchers, game designers, developers in the field of DGBL, and creativity. This research provides new insights, advice, and effective suggestions on how to increase creative skills, motivate, and improve learning outcomes and demonstrate learning with DGBL composition in teaching young students.

AB  - A substantial body of research suggests that some news media outlets depict certain social groups stereotypically. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to such news influences viewers' automatically activated gut feelings (i.e., implicit attitudes) toward this social group, which, in turn, may be used as a basis for overtly expressed evaluations (i.e., explicit attitudes). This prediction was investigated in three empirical studies in two cultural contexts. In the United States and Austria, results suggest that regular exposure to stereotypical news coverage creates negative implicit attitudes, which, in turn, alter explicit attitudes. A better understanding of the news stereotype effects will allow us to develop strategies to reduce prejudice, which may contribute to the improvement of a humane and open society.

AB  - This paper examines the differential impact of Chinese citizens' use of traditional media and Internet sources on their political views about the country's territorial dispute with Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Chinese citizens can utilize a variety of conduits of information that allow varying degrees of government control over the way foreign affairs and other controversies are presented. Those who rely on mainstream, state-controlled television, radio, and printed media for information on the disputes, and those who turn to less-prescriptive sources on the Internet, can be expected to have distinctive political attitudes. We use original 2013 Chinese survey data to explore patterns of media consumption and citizens' attention levels towards the Sino-Japanese island dispute, and views regarding the government's performance in handling the issue and appropriate policy responses. Those who derive their information from traditional media tend to view the government's performance more positively, and are more likely both to favour compromise and to oppose the use of military force. By comparison, information from Internet sources, which is more user selfselective, sustains a wider range of attitudes about the Sino-Japanese island dispute and the appropriate policies for dealing with it, including both militaristic and moderate stances. All told, we find that Chinese citizens bring distinctive predispositions to their consumption of media information on this issue, but our results also clearly reflect an ongoing, pervasive influence for China's state-run traditional media. These findings have important implications for considering the resilience of authoritarian systems in the Internet era.

AB  - The precautionary measures taken against COVID-19 in hotel businesses are important in terms of providing the perception of safe tourism to tourists during the pandemic. Thus, this study aims to determine the dimensional structure of the precautionary measures taken against the pandemic in hotel businesses, and to understand if these measures contribute to tourists' satisfaction and their dissatisfaction. In this context, through content analysis 1418 online reviews were examined on TripAdvisor between June and August 2020. Ten main categories and twenty eight subcategories were determined as a result of the analysis. While the safety perceptions of tourists regarding the measures taken were high in Disinfection and Hygiene, Temperature Measurement, it was observed that it was low in Social Distance and Mask Usage. The study offers clear theoretical and managerial implications for tourism literature and hotelier.

AB  - To date, little research has investigated how public perceptions of policies to ban or restrict fossil-fuel extraction change over time; yet this topic is of crucial importance as countries worldwide seek to transition towards 'net zero' economies. This study addresses this gap by focusing on public responses to the 2019 moratorium on shale gas extraction in England, using an analytical framework comprising awareness, interpretations and opinions, and a mixed-method approach combining national survey, social media and local case interviews. Findings show high levels of awareness and support for the moratorium, yet differences between coalitions of interest based on ideology, scale and demographics. Social media analyses reveal a peak in public response across several days during a general election campaign in which different parties took divergent positions on shale gas. Public support for the moratorium - and induced seismicity as the primary reason for its introduction - was evidenced by the national survey, yet coincided with scepticism about its timing, extent and motivation, as indicated by social media activity and local case interviews. For some publics, the moratorium was a ploy to ensure electoral support, embedded in public distrust. This study indicates the merits of a mixed-method approach to understand the psychological and institutional context of public responses to policy change as it unfolds over time, and discusses the longer term implications of politicised attitudes for energy transitions.

AB  - - President Donald Trump (4/18/2018), Twitter- In three studies, we demonstrate that common metaphors used to describe immigrants in news media interact with national, but not political, identity to lead to feelings of disgust as well as anti-immigrant attitudes. The first study demonstrates that the current discourse in the U.S. surrounding unauthorized immigrants includes metaphors that readily activate thoughts of vermin (e.g., rodents). The second study shows that when these metaphors are present in a news article about immigrants, the more participants identify as American the more disgust they experience reading the article. The final study further shows that after reading a news article in which the vermin metaphors are present, the more participants identify as American the more likely they are to support stringent immigration policies. This research shows the power of metaphor to shape intergroup attitudes and support for government policies.

AB  - In the context of globalization, the Project "REviver na Rede" emerged as a response to a specific problem (unemployment) felt within a regional community (audience). Our threefold theoretical framework covers the perspectives drawn from a literature review on: networked society; social networks; unemployment and sociability. These theories sustain the practices put forward, taking advantage of the digital tools and features provided by Facebook. The impact of involving local audiences helped us achieve a valuable engagement, for instance through a prompt and assertive interaction, or a pedagogical moderation. Content curation and motivational communication also proved to be successful strategies to meet those aims. In short, the implementation of the project highlighted the fact that Facebook can contribute to manage employability factors, like the isolation and social exclusion in unemployment. We conclude, therefore, that this digital online social network is a valid tool for the integration, socialization and active job search, helping to improve employability. Ultimately, Facebook can act as a local and community digital media, facilitating experiences impacting on its audiences, among which the unemployed members of the online "REviver na Rede" page and group.

AB  - The world has been experiencing an unprecedented global pandemic since December 2019. Lockdowns, restrictions in daily life, and social distancing characterize the new environment in which the world population finds itself, with minor variations depending on the country of residence. Television, social media, and other sources of information tend to influence and provide information about COVID-19 with varying tones. This study investigated the impact of alerts, news, and information about COVID-19 from social and mass media on the emotional state of the people a year and a half after the start of the pandemic. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 63 participants to assess the relationships between factors such as social media experience, perceived hope, worry, anxiety/depression, attentiveness, trust, health care, health risk, health safety, irritability, mental balance, and emotional state/distress. With the resulting information, a four-factor model was developed to demonstrate the relationships between social media experience, perceived hope, worry, and emotional state/distress. Additionally, a short interview was conducted among the participants in order to collect their opinions and qualitatively analyze them. The developed model demonstrates satisfactory performance characteristics and allows assessment of the delayed influence of incoming information on the people during this unprecedented pandemic.

AB  - A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted during the first COVID-19 wave, to examine the impact of COVID-19 on mental health using an anonymous online survey, enrolling 9565 individuals in 78 countries. The current sub-study examined the impact of the pandemic and the associated lockdown measures on the mental health, and protective behaviors of cancer patients in comparison to non-cancer participants. Furthermore, 264 participants from 30 different countries reported being cancer patients. The median age was 51.5 years, 79.9% were female, and 28% had breast cancer. Cancer participants reported higher self-efficacy to follow recommended national guidelines regarding COVID-19 protective behaviors compared to non-cancer participants (p < 0.01). They were less stressed (p < 0.01), more psychologically flexible (p < 0.01), and had higher levels of positive affect compared to non-cancer participants. Amongst cancer participants, the majority (80.3%) reported COVID-19, not their cancer, as their priority during the first wave of the pandemic and females reported higher levels of stress compared to males. In conclusion, cancer participants appeared to have handled the unpredictable nature of the first wave of the pandemic efficiently, with a positive attitude towards an unknown and otherwise frightening situation. Larger, cancer population specific and longitudinal studies are warranted to ensure adequate medical and psychological care for cancer patients.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the most useful preventive interventions in healthcare. The purpose of our study was to gain overview of the opinions, knowledge, and engagement in vaccination practices among medical students (MS) and junior doctors (JD) in Europe. The survey was distributed from March 2016 until August 2016 via the e-mail and social media of the European Medical Students' Association. In total, 1821 responses from MS and JD from 34 countries in the European region were analysed. The majority of respondents agreed that vaccines are useful (98.7%) and effective (97.2%). Although the necessity of revaccination was supported by 99.2%, only 68.0% of the respondents went through with it. Even though the potential benefit of the flu vaccination seems to be acknowledged by our participants, only 22.1% of MS and JD declared getting the flu shot every or every other season. MS and JD were in favour of specific mandatory vaccination for medical staff (86.0%) and medical students (82.7%). Furthermore, we analysed the self-reported vaccination coverage of our participants regarding 19 vaccines. Of the respondents, 89.5% claimed to provide advice about vaccination to their friends and family. In conclusion, European MS and JD have a very positive attitude towards vaccination. However, their behaviour and knowledge demonstrate certain gaps which should be further addressed in medical education.

TI  - Stigma and Whistleblowing: Should Punitive Damages be Available in Retaliation Cases?
T2  - INDUSTRIAL LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - CONSEQUENCES
KW  - TIME
AB  - This article uses a range of disciplinary perspectives to examine what is meant by stigma and explains that it is a relational concept. It argues that there has been a shift from attributing social stigma to whistleblowing, to regarding whistleblowing as a form of prosocial behaviour, that is, something which contributes to the well-being of others. This shift is evidenced by the attempts to establish supportive organisational cultures through the introduction of specialist employer policies and procedures, the existence of protective legislation and the coverage of whistleblowing in the media. Although it is questioned why stigma should still attach to whistleblowing, it is acknowledged that those who suffer reprisals may well seek stigma damages. Thus the article traces the common law and statutory origins of stigma awards and discusses the appropriateness of exemplary/punitive damages in the employment field. In the conclusion, it is advocated that Parliament expressly provide for exemplary/punitive damages to be awarded in employment cases. In addition, practical suggestions are made about how a more positive attitude to whistleblowing can be achieved, including a possible role for criminal sanctions. The author asserts that a more punitive approach is justified because whistleblowing is an important aspect of the human right to freedom of expression which must be fully protected in order to ensure the proper functioning of a democratic society.

AB  - Objective: To differentiate the burden of caregivers of patients in a vegetative state (VS) on the basis of different coping strategies and prolonged grief.
   Methods: An observational multi-centre study was conducted with 61 caregivers of VS patients hospitalized in specialized units in Italy. The Anxiety and Depression Short Scale, the Prolonged Grief 12 and Family Strain Questionnaire were used to measure caregivers' burden and the Coping Orientations to Problem Experiences to identify the coping strategies used by caregivers. A hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to group the data and a comparison between clusters was conducted.
   Results: Caregivers were grouped in two clusters defined by the major proximity among the cases of the same group and the major distance from the cases of the other group. The first group was characterized by lower levels of anxiety, depression, family strain and prolonged grief. This group mainly used coping strategies referring to three factors: Social Support, Positive Attitude and Problem Oriented. The second group showed higher levels of anxiety, depression, family strain and prolonged grief and used the Avoidance strategies more than the first group.
   Conclusions: The burden of providing care to a VS patient is mediated by a range of factors including the different coping strategies adopted by caregivers. Support for these caregivers should take this consideration into account and should be subsequently personalized.

AB  - Background: Acceptance by citizens seems to be crucial for the future success of an electronic health record (EHR) in Germany and Austria. We analyzed citizens' knowledge and expectations about the concept and contents of an EHR. We also addressed possible fears and barriers, and we investigated desired EHR functionalities relevant to citizens in the Austrian and German population.
   Methods: Standardized interviews of a convenience sample of 203 Austrian and 293 German citizens recruited in two metropolises.
   Results: Up to three-quarter of the interviewed citizens already collect and store medical documents at home, mostly in paper-based form. No respondents had already used an Internet-based personal health record. Between 80% and 90% of respondents were supportive of the idea of an electronic exchange of health-related data between health care providers as core functionality of an EHR. However, many respondents formulated concerns with regard to data protection and data security within an EHR. The EHR functionalities most supported by respondents included the electronic vaccination record, online information on doctors and hospitals, and the administration of appointments and reminders.
   Conclusion: The results indicate a generally positive attitude towards the EHR. However, the study shows that data protection is an issue for many citizens, and that despite strong media discussion, there are information deficits with regard to the national EHR initiatives.

AB  - IMPORTANCE As society is increasingly becoming more networked, researchers are beginning to explore how social media can be used to study person-to-person communication about health and health care use. Twitter is an online messaging platform used by more than 300 million people who have generated several billion Tweets, yet little work has focused on the potential applications of these data for studying public attitudes and behaviors associated with cardiovascular health.
   OBJECTIVE To describe the volume and content of Tweets associated with cardiovascular disease as well as the characteristics of Twitter users.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used Twitter to access a random sample of approximately 10 billion English-language Tweets originating from US counties from July 23, 2009, to February 5, 2015, associated with cardiovascular disease. We characterized each Tweet relative to estimated user demographics. A random subset of 2500 Tweets was hand-coded for content and modifiers.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The volume of Tweets about cardiovascular disease and the content of these Tweets.
   RESULTS Of 550 338 Tweets associated with cardiovascular disease, the terms diabetes (n = 239 989) and myocardial infarction (n = 269 907) were used more frequently than heart failure (n = 9414). Users who Tweeted about cardiovascular disease were more likely to be older than the general population of Twitter users (mean age, 28.7 vs 25.4 years; P < .01) and less likely to be male (59 082 of 124 896 [47.3%] vs 8433 of 17 270 [48.8%]; P < .01). Most Tweets (2338 of 2500 [93.5%]) were associated with a health topic; common themes of Tweets included risk factors (1048 of 2500 [41.9%]), awareness (585 of 2500 [23.4%]), and management (541 of 2500 [21.6%]) of cardiovascular disease.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Twitter offers promise for studying public communication about cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Capturing public perceptions regarding transit systems is an essential part of creating a just and equitable service. Gathering such perceptions also holds the potential for identifying ways of increasing ridership and for identifying sources of transport-related social exclusion. Traditionally, these perceptions have been obtained from public participatory forums or via surveys on users' opinions. However, increasingly, the use of alternative methods of obtaining public perceptions has included media and social media sources. Twitter is one such social media source and it is used in this research to obtain public opinions regarding a bus rapid transit system (BRT). Rather than relying upon purely automated data mining techniques for analyzing Twitter feeds, a traditional qualitative research design is used featuring a two-step process. First, a text mining procedure is used on the Twitter feeds filtered out by keywords relevant to the transit system, and secondly, a structured content analysis is applied to the entries. This method is applied to a case study on a Bus Rapid Transit system in Cali, Colombia. The results highlight concerns with safety, problems with the system's infrastructure, and behavioral issues on the bus as primary points of discussion.

AB  - Cultured meat can be produced from growing animal cells in-vitro rather than as part of a living animal. This technology has the potential to address several of the major ethical, environmental, and public health concerns associated with conventional meat production. However, research has highlighted some consumer uncertainty regarding the concept. Although several studies have examined the media coverage of this new food technology, research linking different frames to differences in consumer attitudes is lacking. In an experimental study, we expose U.S. adults (n = 480) to one of three different frames on cultured meat: "societal benefits," "high tech," and "same meat." We demonstrate that those who encounter cultured meat through the "high tech" frame have significantly more negative attitudes toward the concept, and are significantly less likely to consume it. Worryingly, this has been a very dominant frame in early media coverage of cultured meat. Whilst this is arguably inevitable, since its technologically advanced nature is what makes it newsworthy, we argue that this high tech framing may be causing consumers to develop more negative attitudes toward cultured meat than they otherwise might. Implications for producers and researchers are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the effects of ad prominence and persuasion knowledge (PK) priming on game users' responses to in-game ads, the advertised brands, and the game. The experimental results suggested that game players showed more negative attitudes toward the brand and the game in response to high prominence ads. In addition, there was a significant interaction between ad prominence and PK priming on recall and attitudes. High prominence ads resulted in better product recall, only when PK was not primed. In contrast, high prominence ads resulted in more negative attitudes toward the game and game players' lower intention to play the game in the future, only when PK was primed. These results suggest that high prominence ads might be preferred when PK is not primed, whereas low prominence ads might be preferred when PK is primed. This study contributes to research on the effects of in-game ads in mobile games and provides practical implications for advertisers and game developers.

AB  - Digital media have enabled people with disabilities (PWDs) to connect with each other, but online relations and gaming have been found escapist. We propose the analytical lens of social access to examine how the role of digital media in PWDs' social relations is shaped by (1) affordances of digital media, (2) mixedness of relations and (3) interaction of online and offline worlds. This article presents an ethnographic study in a school for young PWDs and highlights two observations. First, visual profiles on social media platforms could aggravate the social exclusion of young PWDs online and offline, marked by intra-disability and intersectional differences. Second, the co-presence afforded by digital media enabled young PWDs to resort to digital interactions in unwelcoming offline environments without changing the latter. Social access underlines the importance of studying how digital media interweave with offline social relations and inequalities, rarely altering but sometimes augmenting and ameliorating them.

AB  - Recent research suggests that women react to idealized female models in advertising as they would react to real-life sexual rivals. Across four studies, we investigate the negative consequences of this imaginary competition on consumers' mate-guarding jealousy, indirect aggression, and drive for thinness. A meta-analysis of studies 1-3 shows that women exposed to an idealized model report more mate-guarding jealousy and show increased indirect aggression (i.e., derogation and social exclusion), but do not report a higher desire for thinness. Study 4 replicates these findings and reveals that the main driver of aggression is the sexually provocative attitude of the model (a signal of a flirting behavior and of sexual availability), rather than her thin body size. The ethical implications of these findings for advertising are discussed in light of recent concerns about female bullying, online, and in the workplace.

AB  - These days, advertisers make every effort to attract users through coercive exposure, so as to achieve web-advertisement performance. However, the validity of crediting actual performances through forced exposure is a moot point, because accompanied unwanted digressive advertisements and unintended mouse clicks imposed on the user, are nuisance factors that can culminate in a negative way. Hence, this study investigates advertisement performance in an elaborate way by focusing on varying effects of coercive exposures. Moreover, when considering advertisement performance, it is appropriate to examine advertisement fit, that is, whether the advertising contents match with services provided by the host website. The results showed that, when subjectively forced to frequent unsolicited advertisement, a user's negative attitude to the respective advertisement greatly impacts on advertisement performance. Furthermore, if the level of advertisement fit is low, negative attitude is strengthened. This study provides guidelines on more appropriate ways for performing web advertisement, to achieve a genuine performance of advertisement and provide practical web-advertisement strategies for advertisers.

AB  - The relationship between religion and happiness has been seriously understudied in non-Western and non-Islamic societies. Taking religious identity and religious practice as strata, the 2015 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) data were used to examine the predicting power of health, politics, and social relationships with regard to happiness in four different groups, as follows: People with a religious identity and practice, people with no religious identity but with a practice, people with a religious identity but no practice, and people with neither a religious identity nor practice. Multiple regression analyses were conducted using the Ordinary Least Squares method. The results demonstrate the influence of the independent variables in the four groups, thus confirming the expectation that different religious practices, as well as identities, play a vital role in moderating the degree of happiness. Physical and mental health are significant predictors of happiness regardless of different religious situations, with the effect of mental health here found to be greater in magnitude on happiness than that of physical health. Political participation was not found to be related to happiness, but having a left-wing political attitude did emerge as strongly predicting happiness. The results concerning social relationships further consolidate the hypothesis that religious practice should be taken into consideration separately from religious identity. This study indicates the importance of further investigating religious practice as an independent factor in religious studies in the context of Chinese society.

AB  - Public Significance Statement COVID-19 and associated social distancing measures have resulted in income loss and change to family routines and family health. The negative effects on families can reduce health resources, which may be associated with more anxiety and depression among adults.
   Background: The objective of the study was to examine the association of COVID-19 with family well-being and adult mental health 1 month into the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Prior pandemics have had long-term effects on mental health. COVID-19 and its related stressors, such as loss of work and social distancing requirements, may have a profound impact on short-term and long-term mental health. Family stress theory indicates that subjective family meaning making and family resources affect how stressors lead to outcomes. Method: Participants, adults ages 18 years and older (N = 416), completed a cross-sectional online survey measuring depressive and anxiety symptoms, family health, subjective family meaning making, and loss of work resulting from COVID-19. Data were analyzed using a structural equation modeling framework. Results: Results indicated that subjective negative family meaning and effects were associated with more depression and anxiety. Higher family health resources were associated with less depression and anxiety. Family health resources mediated the relationships between COVID-19 loss of work with depression and anxiety. Conclusion: COVID-19 associated stressors 1 month into the pandemic had modest effects on family meaning making and family health resources. Individuals from families whose health resources were negatively impacted by COVID-19 reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Health care and public health systems should consider family health resources to help reduce the negative effects of COVID-19 on mental health. Longitudinal research is needed to examine the accumulation of stressors over time and the directionality of relationships.

AB  - "The contact hypothesis" refers to the value of heterosexuals' interpersonal contact with gay men and lesbians in lowering negative attitudes toward them. With the increasing number of same-sex parented families worldwide, in spite of a generalized lack of appropriate social and legal protection, the issue of attitudes toward gay and lesbian parents gains special relevance. A sample of 1690 Portuguese heterosexual individuals were asked about their interpersonal contact experiences with gay men and lesbians, their attitudes toward them and toward same-sex parenting. Results revealed that women and non-religious participants were significantly more likely to have gay and lesbian acquaintances and friends, feel more comfortable in their company, and hold less negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, and gay and lesbian parenting. A path analysis model revealed that interpersonal contact experiences were not directly linked to attitudes toward same-sex families, but were mediated by homonegativity and comfort with gay men and lesbians. These findings extend previous knowledge about the value of interpersonal contact, by highlighting the roles of homonegativity and positive affect as mediators of contact experiences on attitudes toward same-sex parented families.

AB  - Given the disparities in professional help-seeking of Asian Americans, continued empirical effort to identify the predictors, mediators, and moderators of help-seeking attitudes is needed. Although cultural values such as emotional self-control in relation to help-seeking attitudes have received empirical attention, self-compassion in the Asian American help-seeking literature remains unexplored. Thus, we examined the mediating and moderating role of self-compassion on the relationship between the Asian cultural value of emotional self-control and help-seeking attitudes in a sample of 257 Asian American college students. An online questionnaire containing the study measures was used to collect data. Emotional self-control was significantly associated with unfavorable help-seeking attitudes. Moreover, self-compassion was a significant mediator of the relation. Specifically, an increase in emotional self-control was associated with a decrease in self-compassion, which in turn was associated with favorable help-seeking attitudes. Self-compassion was a nonsignificant moderator. We discuss potential explanations for the indirect effect of emotional self-control on help-seeking attitudes through self-compassion, and we address implications of these findings for practice when working with Asian American college students.
   What is the public significance of this article? This study suggests that having compassion on oneself can aid in developing a positive attitude toward professional counseling among Asian American college students. Helping people increase their self-compassion holds much promise for addressing the problem of Asian Americans not seeking professional services because of cultural influences.

Our framework considers that activity-travel choices are consequences of individual, household, and work characteristics that are mediated by virtual accessibility and physical accessibility. As part of our analysis, we also analyze activity chaining characteristics during travel to study any fragmentation impacts caused by ICT use on activity engagement and scheduling. We use data from the 2011 and 2012 National Travel Survey in Great Britain and apply Bhat's (2015) generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) to jointly model multiple activity and travel outcomes. Our results provide important insights for social welfare, work-life balance, and equity policies, and suggest that decisions regarding virtual activity participations and in-person out-of-home activity participations are determined as a package. Ignoring this package nature of choices can lead to misleading inferences about the effects of virtual activity participations on in-person out-of-home activity participations.

AB  - Objective. A school-based vaccination programme to prevent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes cervical cancer, began in October 2008 in England. The present study evaluated the role of temporal perspective in the formation of attitudes and intentions towards the vaccine.
   Design. A cross-sectional correlational survey of 245 parents of 11-12-year-old girls.
   Methods. Parents read a passage about the HPV vaccine containing information about benefits and concerns parents might have about the vaccine. They then completed a thought listing task and measures of attitude, vaccine efficacy, anticipated regret, intention, and consideration of future consequences.
   Results. Parents with higher consideration of future consequences generated more positive relative to negative thoughts, held more positive attitudes, higher response efficacy, reported higher anticipated regret about not vaccinating their daughters and held more positive intentions. Mediation analyses suggested that the influence of thoughts generated on intention to vaccinate was partially mediated by attitude, perceived vaccine efficacy, and anticipated regret if the vaccine were not taken up.
   Conclusion. Messages emphasizing efficacy of vaccination and anticipated regret are likely to promote vaccination uptake.

AB  - Background: Despite their potential benefits, many electronic health (eHealth) innovations evaluated in major studies fail to integrate into organizational routines, and the implementation of these innovations remains problematic.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe health care professionals' self-identified perceived barriers and facilitators for the implementation of a Web-based portal to monitor asthmatic children as a substitution for routine outpatient care. Also, we assessed patients' (or their parents) satisfaction with this eHealth innovation.
   Methods: Between April and November 2015, we recruited 76 health care professionals (from 14 hospitals). During a period of 6 months, participants received 3 questionnaires to identify factors that facilitated or impeded the use of this eHealth innovation. Questionnaires for patients (or parents) were completed after the 6-month virtual asthma clinic (VAC) implementation period.
   Results: Major perceived barriers included concerns about the lack of structural financial reimbursement for Web-based monitoring, lack of integration of this eHealth innovation with electronic medical records, the burden of Web-based portal use on clinician workload, and altered patient-professional relationship (due to fewer face-to-face contacts). Major perceived facilitators included enthusiastic and active initiators, a positive attitude of professionals toward eHealth, the possibility to tailor care to individual patients ("personalized eHealth"), easily deliverable care according to current guidelines using the VAC, and long-term profit and efficiency.
   Conclusions: The implementation of Web-based disease monitoring and management in children is complex and dynamic and is influenced by multiple factors at the levels of the innovation itself, individual professionals, patients, social context, organizational context, and economic and political context. Understanding and defining the barriers and facilitators that influence the context is crucial for the successful implementation and sustainability of eHealth innovations.

AB  - As COVID-19 lockdowns force most sport leagues into hiatus, engaging fans has emerged as a key challenge confronting the sport industry. While navigating social distancing protocols, athletes are experimenting with new ways to connect with their fans. Alongside established social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram), TikTok, a short-form video-sharing platform, has gained prominence in terms of registered users and shared content. Yet, little is known about the utility of TikTok as an athlete branding tool. This study uses a netnographic approach to explore the use of TikTok among athletes (N = 10) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings reveal that athlete-generated TikTok videos are characterized as playful and authentic. While athletes are recent adopters of TikTok, this emerging social media platform can be profitably integrated into their online branding strategies. Communicating via TikTok presents opportunities for athletes to foster existing fan relationships, promote branded content, and appeal to new fan segments. Overall, athletes and sport practitioners can leverage these findings to create content for an audience that is attracted to novelty and the activities of athletes extending beyond game highlights or interviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual meetings have been widely utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of organizational commitment on the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting by Filipino professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   METHODS: A total of 513 Filipino professionals answered an online questionnaire which covered four latent variables: organizational commitment to virtual meetings, attitude toward virtual meetings, perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as collaboration tool, and perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as a social tool. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to analyze the causal relationships between the latent variables construct.
   RESULTS: SEM showed that organizational commitment to virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the positive attitude of the employees which subsequently led to the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as a collaboration and social tool.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first study that analyzed the influence of organizational commitment on the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Our SEM construct can be applied and extended further, particularly in analyzing factors influencing the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

T2  - BMC RESEARCH NOTES
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: The aim of our study was to assess the knowledge and attitude and to find out the statistics regarding public awareness of organ donation in Karachi. This convenient based, cross-sectional study was conducted from the general population of Karachi, Pakistan from December 2015 to December 2016. The respondents were evaluated through a face to face questionnaire. The questionnaire contained variables regarding knowledge and attitude towards organ donation.
   Result: 420 people were approached; amongst them 25 refused to participate, so a total number of 395 respondents consented in the research. The mean age of about 77.5% of the population was in the 18-27 range. More than half of the respondents happened to be students and female (51.1%) (55%) respectively. Our results indicate that there was inadequate knowledge among the general population (25.8%). There was a positive attitude regarding organ donation (75.2%). Television was a popular source of information (27%). 29.90% respondents knew that "Kidney" can be donated. 43.80% of the respondents were oblivious to the allowance of organ donation in their religion. More than half (57.2%) were in favor of the promotion of organ donation.

AB  - Objective: In this postmodern society, people tend to abandon conventional medicine for alternative medical systems, such as acupuncture. What are the reasons for this defiance regarding modern rationality and individualist success? Who turns to acupuncture? Methods: This study (n=89) examined whether world views opposed to the predominance of rationality (i.e., mistrust of science, spirituality, paranormal beliefs) and individualist success or consumerism (i.e., power, achievement, and materialism), typically associated with the postmodern era, might explain this attraction toward acupuncture. Participants were recruited through Internet forums interested in complementary and alternative medicine and completed the questionnaire voluntarily. Results: Attraction to acupuncture related negatively with materialism and achievement as well as positively with spirituality, paranormal beliefs, and mistrust in science. Spirituality, paranormal beliefs, and low achievement were the main predictors of attraction to acupuncture and explained 44% of the variance. The mistrust in science mediated the relationship between spiritual and paranormal beliefs and the attraction toward acupuncture. Low achievement explained the link between low materialism and positive attitudes toward acupuncture. Conclusion: The general mistrust of our rational and individualist modern society is indeed an important predictor of attraction toward acupuncture, in addition to demographic variables.

AB  - Purpose Despite the increasing prevalence of obesity in Italy, it remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. We aimed to identify the perceptions, attitudes, behaviours and barriers to effective obesity care among people with obesity (PwO) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Italy. Methods The ACTION-IO study was an online cross-sectional survey conducted in 11 countries from June to October 2018. Findings from the Italian cohort are reported here. Results The survey was completed by 1501 PwO and 302 HCPs in Italy. Most PwO (84%) and HCPs (77%) acknowledged the large impact of obesity on overall health. However, fewer PwO (62%) than HCPs (91%) perceived obesity as a chronic disease. Most PwO (84%) assumed full responsibility for their weight loss. A median of 3 (mean 6) years elapsed between when PwO started struggling with obesity and when they first discussed their weight with an HCP. Many PwO expressed that they liked (80%) or would like (74%) their HCPs to initiate weight management conversations, and only 3% were offended by such a conversation. For 77% of HCPs, perceiving their patients as unmotivated or disinterested in losing weight prevented them from initiating these conversations. Short appointment times were also considered a limiting factor for 40% of HCPs. Conclusions Most PwO took complete responsibility for their own weight loss and waited considerable time before seeking help from an HCP. There is a need for improved education of both PwO and HCPs and for a more positive attitude from HCPs towards initiating weight discussions with PwO.

AB  - As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population.

AB  - We are spending our days today in a nationwide lockdown. The government should be lauded for taking a firm stand and announcing this lockdown well in time. Perhaps the benefits of social distancing cannot be more emphasized to prevent the spread of the dreaded coronavirus as witnessed by some of the developed nations who missed out by announcing it very late. In this lockdown period when we are primarily confined to our home, people face this dilemma of what to do and what lies ahead. Suddenly people find themselves in a situation where they are forced to stay at home and there is fear and turmoil all around. The mindset in this situation quickly becomes negative and as is well known "empty mind is devil's workshop." The need of the hour is to get constructively active and keep the positive vibes going.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This study aimed to reveal the effect of the previous Internet-based education (IBE) experiences of the students' readiness, attitude, and self-control / self-management variables towards the e-learning process, and also to determine their opinions.
   Background The institutions have made efforts to ensure the continuity of education through their learning management systems and the necessity of addressing the e-learning process from the perspective of students once again showed itself as an undeniable fact. Accordingly, the necessity to consider holistically the variables of readiness, attitude, and self-control/self-management, which affect students' adaptation to e-learning process, has once again emerged based on the relevant literature.
   Methodology This research based on the simultaneous mixed method considering the previous IBE experiences of 75 Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CEIT) students taking part in the study in Turkey. The quantitative results of the study were analyzed based on the single-group pretest-posttest weak experimental design. Qualitative results were obtained through the structured interview form and set an example for the case study.
   Contribution The results showed that regardless of students' previous Internet-based education (IBE) experience, it is seen that increasing and continuous experience has a significant effect on the readiness, attitude and self-control/self-management variables towards the e-learning process. The main contribution of experimental results showed that IBE experience is effective on individuals' perceptions of internet self-efficacy, and has an impact on the self-learning skills of individuals. In addition to this, the e-learning experience has an impact on individuals' self-evaluation. It is also seen that the certificate presented to learners in the e-learning environment has a positive effect on students' attitudes towards e-learning processes. Finally, the experiences of e-learning processes, the methods used to transfer the content in the learning environment, the motivation and feedback provided to the learner also support the significant difference obtained in terms of readiness, attitude and self-control/self-management.
   Findings After the findings were analyzed holistically in depth, it has been observed that; if the contents offered to students in e-learning environments support their professional development, in this case, their attitudes, readiness (excluding the sub-dimension of learner control), and self-control/self-management skills for these environments differ significantly in the posttest. It is also among the results that students having previous IBE experience have not higher awareness levels on online communication self-efficacy, technology use self-efficacy, readiness for e-learning, e-learning predisposition, self-reinforcement, self-control management, although significantly found. The findings regarding the effectiveness of the experimental process are as follows: Although it is possible for the students having previous IBE experience to use these experiences within the course for their personal development, it has been seen that the observed differences regarding students' readiness, attitude, and self-control/self-management towards e-learning processes arise from the experimental operation.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers It is recommended for the policy-makers and practitioners that while e-learning platforms were designing, using different methods for delivering the content is as important as making the interaction meaningful and sustainable. In addition to this, to develop a positive attitude it is recommended that individuals' participation of an e-learning platform should be supported with a certificate.
   Researchers should test the obtained results by a well-structured e-learning platform with their recorded activities on the platform (e.g. in which section was used mostly by a learner etc.). Hence, the impact of IBE experiences might be discussed in an up level framework.
   Impact on Society Actually, this study is based on a mix design and the results were also meaningful especially considering the implacable global pandemic. It is clearly understood by this process that e-learning is very important. In line with this, to support the e-learning process (e.g. with the method while delivering the content, well-structured feedback, motivation strategies etc.) and make it sustainable, the increasing of individual's readiness, attitude, and self-control through the IBE would be indispensable.
   Future Research Future studies might focus on the longitudinal methods. It is worth to find out how the students experiences affect the sustainability of the course content, and what should the program developer make to improve their course content in line with the findings of longitudinal studies.

KW  - North America
AB  - Purpose Anchored in a social control theory framework, this study aims to investigate the mediating effect of defensive silence in the relationship between employees' perception of supervisor ostracism and their creative performance, as well as the buffering role of proactivity in this process. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses were tested using three-wave survey data collected from employees in North American organizations. Findings The authors found that an important reason for supervisor ostracism adversely affecting employee creativity is their observance of defensive silence. This mechanism, in turn, is less prominent among employees who show agency and change-oriented behavior (i.e. proactivity). Practical implications For practitioners, this study identifies defensive silence as a key mechanism through which supervisor ostracism hinders employee creativity. Further, this process is less likely to escalate when their proactivity makes them less vulnerable to experience such social exclusion. Originality/value This study establishes a more complete understanding of the connection between supervisor ostracism and employee creativity, with particular attention to mediating mechanism of defensive silence and the moderating role of proactivity in this relationship.

AB  - This contribution to the symposium on Michael Young's article Overcoming the crisis in curriculum theory: a knowledge based approach', supports his contention that curriculum theory has lost sight of its objectwhat is taught and learned in schools', and argues that this has particularly deleterious consequences for vocational education and training (VET). VET is unproblematically positioned as applied, experiential and work-focused learning, and it is seen as a solution for those who are alienated from or unsuccessful in more traditional forms of academic education. This article argues that rather than being a mechanism for social inclusion, VET is instead a key way in which social inequality is mediated and reproduced because it excludes students from accessing the theoretical knowledge they need to participate in debates and controversies in society and in their occupational field of practice. It presents a social realist analysis to argue why VET students need access to theoretical knowledge, how a focus on experiential and applied learning constitutes a mechanism for social exclusion and what a knowledge rich' VET curriculum would look like.

AB  - Humans tend to construct their worldview via binaries, that is, two distinct, nonoverlapping elements, such as the juxtapositions of human-animal, human-machine, or male-female. Our research focuses on the binary categories of "heterosexuality-homosexuality" and explores how stable or malleable they are. For this, the authors analyze newspaper coverage of sexuality concepts in the United Kingdom from 1995 to 2010 and quantify if and how tolerance toward ambiguous concepts including "bisexuality" vary across time as well as with gender, political opinion, and expertise. Our findings indicate a distinct "millennial effect" of intolerance toward sexual ambiguity, suggesting that resistance against ambiguity rears up during periods of instability. Conversely, we found higher levels of ambiguity tolerance in left-wing newspapers, broadsheet publications, female journalists, and expert writers, as opposed to right-wing newspapers, tabloid publications, male journalists, and novice writers. Our results can help to better understand to what degree concepts related to human sexuality are relatively hard-wired or rather fluid social categories.

AB  - Background: The I-Change Model for explaining motivational and behavioral change postulates that an awareness phase precedes the motivation phase of a person, and that effects of pre-motivational factors on behavior are partially mediated by motivational factors. This study tests this assumption with regard to physical activity.
   Methods: Observational longitudinal survey study (baseline, three months, six months) amongst Dutch adults (N=2434). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate whether the influence of (1) knowledge, (2) cognizance, (3) cues, and (4) risk perception separately on intention and physical activity were mediated by motivational factors (i.e. attitudes, self-efficacy and social influence). Subsequently, a comprehensive model including all pre-motivational factors was estimated to test the same assumption for all pre-motivational factors simultaneously.
   Results: The results indicate that the associations of cognizance, risk perception and cues with behavior were fully mediated by motivational factors when tested separately. When tested simultaneously only the effect of cognizance remained. Cognizance was most strongly associated with positive attitudes beta=.13, p<.01, self-efficacy beta=.13, p<.01, and intention beta=.14, p<.01. No direct link with behavior was found.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that pre-motivational factors are important to form a motivation; however, they do not directly influence behavior. The inclusion of factors such as risk perception and cognizance would help to get a better understanding of motivation formation and behavior.

AB  - Advertisements featuring celebrities have increased over the years. While we know that the effectiveness of celebrities stems from a transfer of positive affect from celebrity to product, it is still unclear whether celebrities are also able to improve product favorableness in commercials. In the current study, by employing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment that presented subjects with a combination of a celebrity face and a car that was familiar to their culture, we investigated the neural correlates of celebrity power on car favorableness in advertising. The results showed that neural activity in brain areas associated with reward, memory, semantics, and attention was higher when viewing a combination of a celebrity face and a car compared to viewing a combination of a non-celebrity face and a car. Furthermore, it was found that the scores of car favorableness were positively correlated with neural activity of left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left anterior insula and left higher-order visual cortex in the occipital lobe. This suggests a possible "transfer effect" of positive attitude, and a feeling for the celebrity, while making a preference-judgment for car.

AB  - Background The prevalence of breast cancer in Iran has increased. An effective approach to decrease the burden of breast cancer is prevention. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an educational model, called the ASSISTS, for promoting breast cancer-preventive behaviors in women. Methods A multiphase method was used to develop the model designed to promote breast cancer prevention behaviors. A conceptual model was generated based on a secondary analysis of qualitative data. Then, a structural equation model technique was used to test the relationships among the model constructs. Results The analysis revealed that 7 constructs could be extracted, namely, perceived social support, attitude, motivation, self-efficacy, information seeking, stress management, and self-care. Based on these constructs, a conceptual model was built and tested using structural equation modeling. The model fit was good, and the model confirmed significant relationships among the 7 constructs of breast cancer prevention. Conclusion Findings revealed that self-care behavior and stress management are influenced directly by attitude, motivation, self-efficacy, information seeking, and social support. In addition, women seek more information when they are motivated, have more self-efficacy, have a more positive attitude toward breast cancer prevention, and experience more social support. Implication for Practice Cancer nurses can be at the forefront of breast cancer prevention. Because they can play a pivotal role in providing information, they can reduce women's stress and increase their self-care behavior. In addition, their social support can positively influence Iranian women's attitude, motivation, and self-care behavior. Furthermore, implementing educational programs based on this model might encourage women to practice preventive behaviors.

AB  - Background: A concerted effort has been made by the Government of India and the Armed Forces to train all health-care workers (HCWs) in various aspects of the prevention and management of COVID-19. This study was conducted to evaluate the efforts by assessing their knowledge, attitudes, practice, and behavior regarding COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A quick online survey, using a web portal and social media platform with a pretested questionnaire, was conducted. Responses were collected for 3 days and analyzed. Results: A total of 988 HCWs participated, including 61 (6.17%) specialist officers, 98 (9.91%) medical officers, 17 (1.72%) dental officers, 135 (13.66%) nursing officers, 518 (52.4%) paramedical staff, and 159 (16.09%) supporting staff. There was a high prevalence (>90%) of knowledge related to symptoms and transmission of the disease with no statistically significant difference in knowledge based on the category of HCW except for bleaching powder requirement (0.001) and chemoprophylaxis (0.001). The majority of the participants (>95%) agreed that lockdown, infection control programs, and repeated training of HCWs are good measures to control COVID-19 spread. Observing full precaution while handling personal protective equipment was the only practice which demonstrated a significant association with increasing qualification of the participant (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Levels of knowledge, positive attitude, and good practices are high among HCWs in the Armed Forces, however, feeling of anxiousness and worry prevail being frontline workers with maximum proximity toward patients. Aggressive, continuous, relevant target population-oriented information, education, and communication is the need of the hour, with structured and programmed interventions for positive mental health during course of the pandemic.

AB  - This article examines how music and mass media contribute to the production of the northeast region of Brazil as a nostalgic space in the national imaginary that is distanced from modern national identities. It focuses on the televised images and sounds of two groups from the semi-arid interior city of Arcoverde, Pernambuco: Samba de Coco Razes de Arcoverde, marked as traditional, and Cordel do Fogo Encantado, marketed as a rooted cosmopolitan sound. It traces how both groups face an idiosyncratic play of social inclusion and social exclusion, as being celebrated as the symbolic essence of a region does not necessarily translate into the material benefits of full cultural citizenship. Cordel and Coco Raizes have made progress in their efforts to proliferate more nuanced contemporary narratives of the music of the northeast Yet, as their audience broadens, both continue to find themselves ensnared in the very discourses of folkloric tradition that they seek to transform.

AB  - Background The world guidance on the measures of social distancing for prevention of COVID-19 has changed the daily habits of great part of the population, and this could influence the care and resilience with diabetes during situations of adversity. This study aimed at assessing the characteristics of diabetic individuals and self-care practices and resilience with diabetes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Methods This is a cross-sectional web survey study carried out among adults with diabetes, in which a structured 43-item questionnaire was conducted on the REDCap plataform, including the Diabetes Self-Care Activities Questionnaire and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, to measure socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The web survey was disseminated through the main social media and data were collected from September 1st to October 19th, 2020. Data analysis was performed according to type of diabetes mellitus (DM) and at a significance level of 5% (p < 0.05). Results Of the 1633 participants, 67.5% were women, 43.2% aged between 35 and 59 years old, 68.0% lived in the south-eastern region of Brazil, 57.1% had a high education level, 49% reported to have DM1 and 140 participants reported to have had COVID-19. Diabetes care mostly involved the use of medications (93%), whereas the least used ones were physical activity (24.6%) and examination of the shoes (35.7%). About 40% of the participants reported to be followed up by telemedicine, 61.5% monitored the glycaemic levels, 61.2% followed a healthy diet and 43.4% left home only to go to the supermarket and drugstore. The mean resilience was 25.4 (SD = 7.7). Conclusions In Brazil, individuals with diabetes followed social distancing and maintained their medication treatment for DM. However, practice of physical activity and foot examination was little followed by the participants, who also had a low level of resilience. These findings showed the importance of patient follow-up in the healthcare services, meaning that telemedicine should be improved and support provided for adaptation in view of the therapeutic setbacks.

TI  - Has loneliness and poor resilient coping influenced the magnitude of psychological distress among apparently healthy Indian adults during the lockdown? Evidence from a rapid online nation-wide cross-sectional survey
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - CARE
AB  - Background
   The burden of psychological distress is increasing with the spread of the pandemic and also with the enforcement of its containment measures. The aim of this research was to determine the proportion of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and degrees of resilient coping, and to also investigate the relationship of loneliness, coping and other variables with psychological distress among apparently healthy Indians during nation-wide lockdown period.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey using pre-designed pre-tested Google form disseminated via different social media platforms was conducted. A total of 1249 responses were analysed all over India. The form enquired about Socio-demographic profile, awareness on COVID pandemic and cases in the surroundings. UCLA Loneliness scale, Brief resilience and coping scale (BRCS) and Psychological distress scale (K6) assessed self-reported loneliness, coping and psychological distress, respectively. Special regressor technique adjusting for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity was used to extract the average marginal effects.
   Results
   Majority of the respondents were 18-35 years old, male, single and urban residents. News media, social media mostly acted as sources of information regarding COVID related news. Overall, 54.47% (95% CI: 51.39-57.53%) and 38.39% (95% CI: 35.57-41.29%) were reported to be lonely and had low resilient coping ability respectively. Around 44.68% had high risk of developing psychological distress. Being a student (average marginal effect coefficient (AME(Coef))(.): -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.12, -0.01]) and perceiving lockdown as an effective measure (AME(Coef): -0.11, 95% CI: [-0.19, -0.03]) were protective against psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with male respondents (AME(Coef) 0.07, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.11]), low or medium resilient copers (AME(Coef) 0.89, 95% CI: [0.17, 1.61]), and perceiving a serious impact of social distancing measures (AME(Coef) 0.17, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.26]).
   Conclusions
   Psychological distress among Indian population during lockdown was prevalent. Poor coping ability and perceiving social distancing to have a serious impact was found to be significantly contributing to psychological distress. Appropriate measures to address these issues would be beneficial for the community mental health.

AB  - This article is a reflective consolidation of our practice experience in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 period, in which social work educators and practitioners needed to work online in a prolonged period of social distancing. It illustrates in what ways online practices may denote emerging knowledge and skills that are worth further discussion. These reflections have been consolidated as four knowledge/skill domains in our afterthoughts: i) Context, ii) Conversation, iii) Communication-Modality, and iv) Circulation. These insights may inspire social work educators and practitioners to comprehend the potential of media technologies more fully.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine when and how the number of "likes" can exert significant influence on consumer evaluations of social media advertising. It sheds a novel perspective on how social media "likes", advertising disclosures and the presence of firm-serving motives influence advertising effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach Study 1 examines how the number of "likes" influences consumer attitudes towards the sponsoring brand by strengthening advertising credibility, when social media ads are effectively (vs non-effectively) disclosed. Study 2 further establishes how the influence of the number of "likes" for effectively disclosed ads varies depending on whether the company states (vs does not state) its firm-serving motives. Findings The authors found that a social media ad displayed with a higher number of "likes" is perceived to be more credible, which can then yield more positive attitudes towards the brand. However, the use of effective disclosures moderates this relationship. To offset this effect, companies can restore the value of "likes" by stating their firm-serving motives openly when they develop social media advertising messages.
   Originality/value The study illustrates a novel mechanism behind how and when the number of "likes" can influence the effectiveness of social media advertising.

AB  - This study presents a careful understanding of the impact of information dependence on public attitudes (PAs) towards genetically modified (GM) technology in China by employing a structural equation modelling approach. Results in this study provide further empirical evidence to support the point of view that PAs towards GM technology vary with their information dependence. Information evaluation is the reasoning mechanism between information dependence and the perception of risks and benefits, ultimately determining PAs towards GM technology. Empirical results can serve as the basis for risk communication, suggesting that the public sector, scientific institutions, scientists, and officials must be more active in sharing scientific knowledge about GM technology with the public by developing more open channels for the dissemination of authoritative information, and public education is also needed. On the other hand, the medias' discourse system on GM technology should return to the scientific field for inspiring a rational attitude towards GM technology.

AB  - Cervical cancer is still a major public health problem worldwide. However, the uptake of human papillomavirus vaccine remains low among college women in Thailand. A cross-sectional and structural equation model to predict the intention to obtain human papillomavirus vaccine by young college women in Thailand was developed and tested. Data were collected from 191 college women aged 18-26 from the non-health sciences who were enrolled in two universities in Southern Thailand. Data collection involved the use of a structured questionnaire, which included demographic information, human papillomavirus and vaccine awareness, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, perceived susceptibility, perceived effectiveness, cost, knowledge of HPV and cervical cancer, and intention to obtain HPV vaccination. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling.
   The results showed that, in the modified Model of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Intention among Young Women, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived susceptibility of HPV-related disease all had significant and direct effects on the intention to obtain HPV vaccine, and able to explain 38% of the variance. Attitude was found to be the mediator of knowledge about human papillomavirus and cervical cancer, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and the perceived effectiveness toward the intention to obtain human papillomavirus vaccination. Thus, nurses should take the initiative and make college women more familiar with the human papillomavirus vaccine, promote positive attitudes towards human papillomavirus vaccination and empower college women to take control of their vaccination decision-making.

AB  - Despite the increasing prevalence of methamphetamine use among the young population in Iran, the body of literature on their methamphetamine use remains slim. This study was designed to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of Iranian youth about methamphetamine to help inform harm reduction policies catered towards young men and women. In a cross-sectional study using multistage sampling in 13 provinces, 4868 participants aged 15-29 years old were recruited. Knowledge, attitude and practices of youth about methamphetamine were assessed through a pilot-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were presented and potential associations were assessed using Chi-square test and independent samples t-test. Mean age +/- SD of the participants was 21.8 +/- 5.6 years, and 49.5% were women. Overall, 21.7% and 37.7% of the participants had high knowledge scores and positive attitudes, respectively. Among the 19-29 years old participants, ever methamphetamine use and injection was estimated at 5.74% (95% CI: 4.21, 7.90) and 1.8% (95% CI: 1.13, 2.83), respectively. Most (44.3%) had started methamphetamine use for fun and media (69.1%) was reported as their main source of information on methamphetamine use. Methamphetamine use is a concerning health problem among Iranian youth. Comprehensive multi-sectoral downstream and upstream interventions that involve educational settings, as well as media, are urgently needed to help reduce the burden of methamphetamine use among Iranian youth.

AB  - Latina/o youth lag behind Asian American and non-Latina/o White youth in many academic areas. Previous research has taken a deficit approach to understand the factors that affect academic outcomes for Latina/o youth often neglecting to highlight both the potential positive and negative contributions of gender role values. The present study took a holistic perspective to understand the affect of traditional Latina/o gender role values (i.e., marianismo, machismo, and caballerismo) on the academic attitudes and educational goals of Mexican descent youth. Structural equation models were tested to examine the associations of "positive" and "negative" gender role values on educational goals using 524 Mexican descent adolescents from a mid-sized city in southern Texas. We hypothesized that positive aspects of traditional Latina/o gender role values (i.e., "positive marianismo" and caballerismo) would be associated with more positive attitudes toward academics and higher educational goals. We further expected negative gender role values (i.e., "negative marianismo" and machismo) to have the opposite effect. Additionally, based on the theory of planned behavior and gender schema theory, academic attitudes were hypothesized to mediate the relation between gender role values and educational goals. An alternative model was tested in which educational goals mediated the relation between gender roles and academic attitudes. Results indicated that both models fit the data well, and recommendations are made for future longitudinal research aimed at disentangling the directionality of the relations in the model. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify social and organizational antecedents of stress. This paper also investigates whether attitudes toward organizational changes and reforms might explain stress perception (SP) and mediate the relationships between social and organizational job characteristics and SP.
   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach is used to identify the relationships between the research variables. The investigated population is composed of middle managers working in Swiss public hospitals (n = 720), which are currently being confronted by major reforms.
   Findings - The findings show that perceived social support (work relationships with and support from colleagues), as well as several job characteristics (autonomy in performing tasks, flexibility in the organization of working time, degree of conflict) are significantly related to SP. Moreover, positive attitudes toward change are negatively related to stress, and mediate the relationships between perceived social support as well as job characteristics and SP.
   Practical implications - This paper sheds light on several job characteristics which could contribute to mitigating SP among middle managers. The findings could therefore guide HRM specialists in their efforts to create a favorable work environment so as to facilitate middle managers' activities.
   Originality/value - The innovation of this paper is grounded in the specific population the author investigate, as the empirical inquiry concerns middle managers working in public hospitals. Moreover, this research highlights the central role of job characteristics and attitudes toward change in explaining SP.

AB  - This study evaluates empirically the proposition implicit in much recent gender and CMC research that expressions of gender distinctness among teens in online environments are becoming less frequent and less traditional. Gender preferences were analyzed in linguistic features and communication styles in synchronous text messages, along with self-presentation in user profile pictures, drawing on data from popular English-language teen chat sites collected in 2010. Significant differences were found in speech acts, message tone, and in physical stance, dress, and social distance in profile pictures that generally conform to traditional gender stereotypes. These findings are interpreted in light of previous gender and teen CMC research, adolescent development and socialization patterns, mass media representations, and trends towards media convergence in chat platforms.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique global challenge. To deter its spread, several countries have put lockdown and physical distancing measures in place that could have potentially harmful consequences on people's mental health. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the relationship between anxiety and perceived stress in individuals who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures, while also analyzing the impact of coping strategies interacting with defence mechanisms. A sample of 1408 individuals (M-age = 34.69; SD = 11.87) completed the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form X3, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire, after providing written informed consent. Results highlighted the significant impact of state anxiety levels on perceived stress, both directly and indirectly. The indirect pathways have been explored by performing three mixed serial-parallel mediation analyses, where significant associations between coping strategies (Social Support, Avoidance Strategies, Positive Attitude, Problem-solving and Turning to Religion) and mature, neurotic, or immature defences have been found. These findings may contribute to orientate prevention and intervention activity during the several management phases of COVID-19.

AB  - Even though the rapid aging of the population is a global phenomenon, reducing negative stereotypes of the elderly and building harmonious relationships between young and old generations have been critical steps to solving ageism issues worldwide. To contribute to these efforts, this paper examined the role of vivid images of people's future self via an age-morphing technology in communication strategies to address the issue of ageism. An online survey with 324 young participants who saw images of the future self was conducted. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the proposed relationships among psychological continuity, group identification, empathy, sympathy, ageism, psychological proximity, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Results revealed that psychological continuity created through a vivid image of one's future self can lead to group identification with the elderly, influencing one's psychological proximity to issues of the elderly. This relationship is positively mediated by empathy and sympathy, and ageism negatively mediates the relationship. The close feelings to issues relevant to the elderly are likely to elicit a positive attitude toward the efforts of addressing the issues as well as greater participation in relevant social media campaigns for the elderly.

AB  - Research has shown that the mere presence of stimuli that resemble eyes is sufficient to attract attention, elicit aesthetic responses, and can even enhance prosocial behavior. However, it is less clear whether eye-like stimuli could also be used as a tool for nature conservation. Several animal species, including butterflies, develop eye-like markings that are known as eyespots. In the present research, we explored whether the mere display of eyespots on butterfly wings can enhance: (a) liking for a butterfly species, and (b) attitudes and behaviors towards conservation of a butterfly species. Four online experimental studies, involving 613 participants, demonstrated that eyespots significantly increased liking for a butterfly species. Furthermore, eyespots significantly increased positive attitudes towards conservation of a butterfly species (Studies 1, 2 and 4), whereas liking mediated the eyespot effect on conservation attitudes (Study 2). However, we also found some mixed evidence for an association between eyespots and actual conservation behavior (Studies 3 and 4). Overall, these findings suggest that eyespots may increase liking for an animal and sensitize humans to conservation. We discuss possible implications for biodiversity conservation and future research directions.

AB  - Objective: Within the school context, the need to belong is a fundamental psychological construct associated with a variety of important adolescent school-based and quality-of-life outcomes. The objective of the present study is to investigate the mediating effect of loneliness on the association between school belonging constructs (i.e., social inclusion and exclusion) and subjective well-being and mental health problems among adolescents.
   Method: Participants of this study included 244 adolescents in grades 9-12 attending a high school in a city of Turkey. They were comprised of 52.5% female and 47.5% male and ranged in age between 14 and 18-years (M = 16.27, SD = .1.02).
   Results: Findings of the study indicated that school-based social inclusion and exclusion significantly predicted loneliness, mental health problems, and subjective well-being. Mediation analyses showed that loneliness partially mediated the relationship of social inclusion with mental health problems and subjective well-being. Thereafter, loneliness had a full mediating effect on the association between social exclusion and subjective well-being and partially mediated the effect of social exclusion on adolescent mental health problems. Social inclusion and exclusion also indirectly predicted mental health problems through subjective well-being.
   Conclusion: Findings of this study suggest that loneliness is an important mechanism that may help to explain the effect of school belongingness on adolescent well-being and mental health. The results highlight the importance of school belongingness-based preventions and interventions targeting to promote mental health and well-being in school settings.
   What is already known about this topic:
   Belongingness is an important psychological construct for mental health and well-being, not only at an empirical level but also at a theoretical level.
   A satisfied need for belonging improves youth well-being and mental health, whereas unsatisfied or lack of this need can lead to a variety of psychosocial problems, such as loneliness.
   Loneliness has adverse impacts on adolescent well-being and is a risk factor for developing emotional and behavioural problems
   What this topic adds:
   The present study highlights the importance of school belongingness-based preventions and interventions targeting to promote mental health and well-being in school settings.
   Loneliness is an important mechanism that may help to explain the effect of school belongingness on well-being and mental health of adolescents.
   The study outcomes suggest there is a need to design a more comprehensive prevention and intervention approach for improving adolescent mental health and well-being.

AB  - Background
   Protection motivation to practice preventive behaviors is necessary for sustained mitigation during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, limited research exists on the ecological sources of influence for COVID-19 protection motivation.
   Aim
   To explore sources of influence (family health, media consumption, and loss of work hours) on COVID-19 protection motivation.
   Method
   An online quantitative survey of U.S. adults (N = 501) aged 18 years or older was administered using Qualtrics with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data were collected on constructs related to the protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior as well as sources of influence and intention to socially distance and socially isolate during COVID-19. Constructs were further defined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling was used to determine relationships between constructs.
   Results
   A two-factor model was identified with threat appraisal as one factor and subjective norms appraisal, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention loading as another factor. Higher news media consumption and loss of work hours due to COVID-19 were both significant predictors of increased threat appraisal. Family healthy lifestyle and family health resources were significantly related to increases in the subjective norms, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention appraisal factor.
   Conclusions
   Family health, news media consumption, and loss of work hours are associated with COVID-19 protection motivation. COVID-19 protection motivation might be enhanced through policies and messaging that can affect ecological sources of influence.

AB  - Being Human was a British television series broadcast by BBC Three between 2008 and 2013. Its main characters are a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf, who live together and try to lead a normal life among humans; however, their integration into society is a constant struggle. Since Being Human is centred on inclusion, exclusion and belonging, the story evokes real-life situations of marginalisation; following Lampert-Weissig's suggestion about the relevance of the characters' ethnicity (an Irish, a Jewish and a mixed-race person), which makes them "double outsiders" (65), my essay proposes an analysis of the three main characters in seasons 1-3 of Being Human as tropes for ethnic outsiders, migrants and asylum seekers in the UK.
   I will first consider each character individually, because each one of the three tropes (werewolf, vampire, ghost) has its own history and evolution in folklore, literature and cinema and, therefore, each one of the three protagonists is particularly suited for introducing different perspectives on foreignness and marginalisation. I will then discuss how Being Human addresses the issue of social exclusion and how the show's final message, while progressive at first sight, is actually problematic and ambiguous.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop an effective health communication strategy to guide the decision-making process of parents considering getting their children HPV vaccines. Using inoculation theory and findings on tone of voice as theoretical frameworks, the present study conducted a 2 (message type: inoculation vs. supportive) x 2 (tone of voice: human voice vs. organizational voice) mixed experiment with a total of 231 U.S. parents (either mother or father of a child eligible for the HPV vaccine). The results revealed that HPV vaccination promotions based on the inoculation message were more likely to generate positive attitudes toward the vaccination, higher intention to vaccinate their children, and higher intention to spread positive word of mouth (WOM) about HPV vaccination. Also, HPV vaccination promotions in the human voice were likely to increase the WOM intention more than those in the organizational voice. In regard to an interaction effect, human voice turned out to be more effective than organizational voice to generate the WOM intention when it comes to supportive messages; inoculation-based messages were similarly effective across the human and the organizational voice condition.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered the way of life around the world. Due to social distancing measures, contact restrictions and fears of infection, social life has changed significantly. These measures along with the stressors associated with the current worldwide situation, will inevitably have an effect on people's interpersonal and personal behaviors.
   Aim: This study evaluates the effect the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide German lockdown had on the sexual behavior of cis men.
   Methods: An anonymous nationwide web-based questionnaire was conducted among cis men in Germany during the first COVID-19 home isolation (April 20, 2020-July 20, 2020). The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail, online chats and social-media platforms.
   Main Outcome Measures: Data was collected on general characteristics including demographics and socio-economic backgrounds. To evaluate sexual health, questions from the Sexual Behavior Questionnaire were included.
   Results: 523 cis male participated. 414 met the inclusion criteria. Most were heterosexual (n = 248, 59.9%; vs homosexual n = 97, 23.4%; vs bisexual n = 69, 16.7%). 243 (59%) were employed, 153 (37.1%) were students and 16 (3.9%) were unemployed. Most of the participants reported an annual income lower than 75.000 euro . During the lockdown, average weekly frequency of sexual intercourse and masturbation was increased in all groups. Consistently, a significant rise of higher satisfaction with the frequency of sexual contacts during the quarantine was observed (P < .05). Furthermore, the level of sexual arousal increased significantly in all groups (P < .0005). Capability to enjoy sexual intercourse or masturbation increased significantly in heterosexual (P < .0005) and homosexual men (P < .005). Bisexual participants showed a significant increase in general satisfaction with sexual life (P < .05) and a significant decrease in satisfaction in relationship or single life (P < .05). Positive confounders in the changing of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic were: Being in a relationship or being single, parenthood and being employed.
   Conclusion: Our study firstly describes how COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions and social distancing measurements altered sexual behavior amongst cis male in Germany. Further studies, including sexual minorities specifically, are needed to clarify if the behavior in the first German nationwide quarantine has persisted or transformed as the pandemic proceeded.

AB  - Fear of evaluation and a negative view of the self are the core aspects of social anxiety. Self-compassion and self-esteem are two distinct positive attitudes toward the self, which are positively related to each other, well-being and good psychological functioning. It is less clear, however, how they interplay in socially anxious individuals and if self-compassion may reduce the negative effect of low self-esteem on social anxiety. The current research aimed at evaluating the directional links between those constructs to check if self-compassion mediates the effect of self-esteem on social anxiety. In this study, 388 adult participants with elevated social anxiety completed measures of self-compassion, self-esteem and social anxiety. As expected, both self-esteem and self-compassion correlated negatively with social anxiety and positively with one another, with lower self-esteem being a stronger predictor of social anxiety. Importantly, self-compassion partially mediated the relationship between self-esteem and social anxiety. These findings suggest that self-compassion partially explains the negative effects of deficits in self-esteem on social anxiety. Practical implications of the research are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: Our study aims to test the effectiveness of binding communication based interventions (vs classical persuasive communication based ones) inciting non-donors to act in favour of blood donation.
   Background: The implementation of effective communication interventions represents a major public health issue. Nevertheless, persuasive media campaigns appear to have little effect on behaviours. Even though non-donors hold a positive attitude towards blood donation, they are not inclined to donate. As an alternative to producing behavioural changes, many recent studies have shown the superiority of binding communication over persuasive communication.
   Methods: All participants, non-donors, were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions of a 2 (type of communication: persuasive vs binding) x 2 (source credibility: low vs high) factorial design. Then, they were asked to report their intention to donate blood, and their intention to distribute leaflets regarding blood donation.
   Results: Binding communication is a more effective strategy for increasing intention towards blood donation compared with persuasive communication, especially when combined with high credibility source.
   Discussion: Accordingly this study calls for more consideration of knowledge of social psychology to design effective communication interventions and increase the number of donations.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is a major challenge requiring urgent measures. Cancer care in LMICs, including Ghana, is faced with inadequate numbers of skilled healthcare professionals and essential material resources which negatively impacts the quality of healthcare and wellbeing of patients. In the face of COVID-19, cancer patients are likely to be affected in three key ways: access to healthcare, increased financial toxicity and increased mental health burden as a consequence of strict measures being implemented to contain the virus in Ghana, including partial lockdowns and social distancing. Some cultural beliefs regarding COVID-19 and its influence on the health and wellbeing of cancer patients have also been discussed. Measures by the government to lessen the burden on citizens and health workers are highlighted with possible recommendations for improvement in cancer care in Ghana and other LMICs during this pandemic.

AB  - Aims
   Time to Change, an anti-stigma programme in England, has worked to reduce stigma relating to mental illness in many facets of life. Newspaper reports are an important factor in shaping public attitudes towards mental illnesses, as well as working as a barometer reflecting public opinion. This study aims to assess the way that coverage of mental health topics and different mental illnesses has changed since 2008.
   Method
   Articles covering mental health in 18 different newspapers were retrieved using keyword searches on two randomly chosen days of each month in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019. A content analysis approach using a structured coding framework was used to extract information from the articles. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the change in odds of each hypothesised stigmatising or anti-stigmatising element occurring in 2019 compared to 2008 and 2016 with a Wald test to assess the overall significance of year as a predictor in the model. Further logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the diagnosis that an article was about and the odds that it was stigmatising, and whether this relationship is moderated by year of publication.
   Results
   A total of 6731 articles were analysed, and there was a significant increase in anti-stigmatising articles in 2019 compared to 2008 (OR 3.16 (2.60-3.84), p < 0.001) and 2016 (OR 1.40 (1.16-1.69), p < 0.001). Of the 5142 articles that specified a diagnosis, articles about schizophrenia were 6.37 times more likely to be stigmatising than articles about other diagnoses (OR 6.37 (3.05-13.29) p < 0.001), and there was evidence that the strength of this relationship significantly interacted with the year an article was published (p = 0.010). Articles about depression were significantly less likely to be stigmatising (OR 0.59 (0.69-0.85) p = 0.018) than those about other diagnoses, while there was no difference in coverage of eating disorders v. other diagnoses (OR 1.37 (0.67-2.80) p = 0.386); neither of these relationships showed an interaction with the year of publication.
   Conclusion
   Anti-stigma programmes should continue to work with newspapers to improve coverage of mental illness. However, interventions should consider providing specific guidance and promote awareness of rarer mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, and evaluation should examine whether reductions in stigma extend to people with all mental illness diagnoses.

AB  - Ebola emerged on U.S. soil during the 2014 midterm election campaign, and the threat of infectious disease became prominent in political rhetoric. African immigrant communities experienced stigma and suspicion during the outbreak. This study investigates the implications of this epidemic on immigration attitudes. We fielded a survey experiment during the Ebola crisis with a sample of 3881 adults in the United States to examine the conditions under which global health threats affect domestic attitudes on immigration. Contrary to expectations, we find that the mere mention of Ebola has no effect on immigration attitudes, even when the identity of the Ebola carrier is described as an African traveler into the United States. Our results show, however, that politicizing the crisis can lead to more exclusionary attitudes toward immigrants. This finding is driven by partisanship: views of immigration were significantly more negative when Republican participants read a statement by a Republican politician critical of President Obama's Ebola response. The study has implications for future epidemics, including the important role political entrepreneurs can play in shaping public perceptions during a disease outbreak. The results raise concerns about how political rhetoric surrounding disease can have both short-term and longer term consequences for vulnerable populations.

AB  - This article examines the implementation problems of media-text discursive positions in the digital context, the means of strategies and scenarios for presenting and evaluating information, and image creation. The literal content of a media text often does not consist of a set of separate meanings of such a statement's components. Such a meanings' asymmetry of assessments can lead to ambiguity and cultural misunderstandings of the media content. All this makes it vital to create effective teaching techniques and modern courses in the media field. This study aims to establish the effectiveness of the training course "Media text creation technologies in the digital context" using a cognitive-pragmatic approach to the presentation of complex material; to show the relevance of pragmatic theories that form a positive attitude to the study of linguistic theory and its use in the digital media environment. The main one in the research methods' complex is the method of an experiment; analysis and synthesis are used to analyze theoretical material; during the pedagogical experiment, methods of observation, questionnaires, statistical methods are used. The hypothesis is that the cognitively and pragmatically oriented approach to media text are balancing the perception and retranslation of the message and its quality in digital media. The result indicates the determination of the "Media text creation technologies in the digital context" training course importance, which is aimed at the study of text-forming technologies in the digital context in a cognitively and pragmatically oriented way. The students' results show that the increase in performance and general satisfaction with the applying innovation in teaching complex and new material indicates that respondents felt a significant improvement in understanding and perception of the texts' pragmatics. The development and implementation of innovative pedagogical technologies that improve and facilitate the learning of the theory and practice of working with media-text in the digital context remain promising.

AB  - Social distancing measures against COVID-19 imposed restrictions on students that may have affected their physical health and fitness. The objective of this study was to investigate the change in physical fitness of primary school students across the coronavirus outbreaks from 2019 to 2021. This was a retrospective repeated cross-sectional study. We obtained the annual physical and fitness assessment data measured every November for all students at the same primary school in Guangzhou, China. There was a total of 6371 observations in the dataset for three years. The physical fitness of the students was evaluated with an overall physical fitness score, body mass index (BMI), lung vital capacity, physical flexibility (via a sit-and-reach test) and sports task performances (sprint, shuttle run, rope-jumping, and sit-up). Generalised estimating equations were used to determine any significant changes from 2019 to 2021, adjusted for confounders. After the COVID-19 outbreak in 2021, there was a significant elevation in BMI of 0.64 kg/m(2) in 2020 and 0.39 kg/m(2) in 2021 (p < 0.001). The overall physical fitness score was significantly increased by 2.1 and 4.1 points, respectively, in 2020 and 2021 (p < 0.001). Lung vital capacity and rope-jumping performance were significantly improved in both 2020 and 2021 compared with 2019, and sit-up performance was marginally significantly improved in 2020 and significantly improved in 2021. However, students demonstrated poorer flexibility and sprint and shuttle run performance in 2021 compared with 2019. A health promotion programme during and after COVID-19, including online physical education classes, television broadcasts, and a rope-jumping campaign, could account for these positive outcomes, along with the ease of administering rope-jumping and sit-ups at home.

AB  - Objective: Nurse shortage is a critical problem for global healthcare services. It impacts the quality of clinical care. Work engagement is the core competence of hospitals, which indicates employee's positive attitude toward organization and work. This study aimed to explore the relationships among calling, organizational commitment, and work engagement.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed, and 320 nurses from tertiary hospitals in China completed the questionnaires that included demographic information, calling scale, employee engagement scale, and organizational commitment scale. Pearson correlation was performed to test the correlations among calling, organizational commitment, and work engagement. Stepwise regression analyses were performed to explore the mediating role of organizational commitment. The bootstrap method was employed to confirm the mediating effect.
   Results: Nurses' work engagement score was at the medium degree, whereas calling and organizational commitment were in the medium to high level. The results revealed that calling, organizational commitment, work engagement, and each dimension were positively correlated with one another (r = 0.145-0.922, P < 0.01). The organizational commitment plays a partially mediating effect between calling and work engagement (beta = 0.603 to 0.333, P <0.01).
   Conclusions: The mediation effect of organizational commitment was verified, which provided a comprehensive understanding of how calling impacted work engagement. Moreover, administrators should not only promote interventions to increase work engagement but also pay attention to calling and organizational commitment so as to improve their work engagement. Taken together, increased level of work engagement is required in the current nursing field. (C) 2019 Chinese Nursing Association. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: There has been some ground-breaking research on self-directed learning (SDL) in nursing education which reveals the superiority of SDL to traditional learning methods in terms of students' academic performance and the development of positive attitudes toward the learning process on the part of both students and teachers.
   Objectives: The relationship between students' self-directed learning readiness (SDLR) and students' academic performance, and the mediating role of students' perceptions of the learning environment needs further investigation. In this study, it is proposed that students' perceptions of their learning environment could enhance their SDLR and thus boost their academic performance (in terms of their GPA).
   Design: A descriptive design was used to examine the relationships between the domains of SDLR, which are self-management, desire to learn and self-control and students' perceptions of the learning environment (SPLE) and students' GPA.
   Data source: A survey involving 142 Saudi students from nursing and emergency medical services undergraduate programs in King Saud University was used for this research.
   Results: The results showed that SDLR level positively influenced students' academic performance positively, and that students' perceptions of their learning environment played a significant role in determining their level of SDLR and academic performance.
   Conclusion: It is recommended that nursing and emergency medical services educators provide a supportive learning environment in terms of good teaching, clear goals and standards, appropriate assessment, appropriate workload, and emphasis on independence to encourage students to engage in the process of SDL which can, in turn, enhance their academic performance.

AB  - Background: The present study examined whether there are differences in job-related attitudes and well-being among physicians working in private sector and public sector. In addition, we examined whether psychosocial factors (organizational justice and job control) could mediate these possible differences in different sectors. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data from the Finnish Health Professional Study was used. A random sample of Finnish physicians included 1522 women and 1047 men aged 25-65 years. Outcome variables were job satisfaction, organizational commitment, psychological distress, work ability and sleeping problems. Job control and organizational justice were measured using established questionnaires. Series of regression analyses were performed and the mediational effects were tested following the procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny. Results: Physicians working in private sector had higher levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment and lower levels of psychological distress and sleeping problems when compared with physicians working in public sector. Private physicians also had higher levels of organizational justice, which acted as a mediator behind more positive attitudes and better well-being in private sector. Private physicians had higher levels of job control but it did not act as a mediator. Conclusions: Private physicians feel better than public physicians and this is partly due to higher organizational justice in private sector. Public health care organizations should invest effort to increase the fairness in their organizations and management and pay more attention in improving the well-being of their employees, which could possibly increase the attractiveness of public sector as a career option.

AB  - An experiment aimed at developing creative thinking and emotional literacy in adolescents was carried out. The study involved 25 adolescents aged 14-16 years and their parents-37 people (37-45 years old). Based on the use of the NanoStudio application, a creative improvisation training session was conducted among adolescents in the context of educational cases. The methodology for the development of creative skill turned out to be interesting, exciting, and effective; collaboration with children, according to parents, created an atmosphere of community and promoted an active and passionate desire for joint creative actions. The results of the survey of adolescents demonstrated a positive attitude to the implementation of creative practices which was accompanied by interest, enthusiasm, joy, trust, admiration, delight, and optimism. Since adolescence is a period of increased emotionality, which is characterized by risky behavior associated with the formation of new views, values, and interests, the need of young people for psychological adaptation, the practical value of the study lies in demonstrating the practical experience of transforming the emotional experiences of adolescents into a creative musical product, as an alternative behavior, in terms of interaction of personal, parental, and pedagogical contexts.

AB  - Turkey hosts the largest Syrian refugee population in the world. As an attempt to understand antecedents of residents attitudes towards Syrian refugees, the present study aimed to investigate the relationships between contact experience, perception of threat, and the attitudes. Specifically, we hypothesized that perception of threat would mediate the relationship between contact experience and the attitudes. Frequency of different contact types, threats associated with economic, cultural, and criminal risks, and attitudes towards male or female targets based on preferred social distance were subjected to analyses in an adult sample of 170 women and 183 men. Results revealed a full mediation effect both for female and male Syrian refugee targets. We discussed the findings referring the observed nature of contact as mostly being casual, threat level being high, and attitudes being relatively negative within a specific media-effects framework.

AB  - An online experiment examined the effects of Instagram posts' source types and product-placement types on brand attitude and credibility perception. A 2 (source: brand versus Instagram influencer) x 2 (product placement: product-only [explicit product placement] versus influencer-with-product [moderate product placement]) between-subjects factorial experiment (N = 304) tested the effects of the two manipulated factors on source credibility, corporate credibility, and attitude toward brand posts. Two-way ANOVAs indicate a main effect of source types on perceived trustworthiness and interaction effects of product-placement and source types on perceived expertise, corporate credibility, and attitude toward brand posts. Consumers exposed to brand as the source conditions indicated no difference in corporate credibility and brand attitude regardless of product-placement types. In contrast, consumers exposed to Instagram influencer as the source conditions indicated higher corporate credibility and more positive attitude toward brand posts when exposed to the influencer-with-product conditions than when exposed to the product-only conditions. Consumers differently react to product placement on Instagram influencers' accounts depending on whether the influencers are present versus absent. Consumers react negatively to influencers' posts when they do not appear with the products they endorse. Parasocial interaction mediates the relationship between product/brand placement types and corporate credibility.

AB  - Amongst medical undergraduates, the perception of educational environment (EE) has been associated with academic achievement and positive attitude toward the course. Nonetheless, there are sparse data on how it influences various learning processes and outcomes especially within psychiatry training. Consistent with situativity and self-determination learning theories, we hypothesized that a positive perception of the EE within psychiatry postings will be beneficial for the learning process, specifically pertaining to greater motivation to learn, better engagement, allowing them to feel more equipped, and greater appreciation of the subject. The DREEM (Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure) was administered to fourth-year medical undergraduate students from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore, undergoing psychiatry rotations from 2015 to 2019. The students also completed five additional items evaluating the specific learning processes (motivation to learn, engagement, equipping, and appreciation of the subject) and overall rating of the posting. We examined the relationship between DREEM domains and learning processes using correlation analysis. We explored learning processes as mediators of the relationship between total DREEM scores and overall rating of the posting. Altogether, 1343 (response rate 89.5%) medical undergraduates participated in the study. The overall DREEM score was 157.01 +/- 15.86. Overall DREEM and subdomain scores were significantly correlated with several learning processes (r = 0.354 to 0.558, all p < .001). Motivation and engagement were significant mediators of the relationship between total DREEM scores and overall rating of the psychiatry posting. Our results highlighted that a positive perception of EE was associated with the specific learning processes that mediated the overall rating of the posting. In the context of relevant learning theories and our study findings, improvement of the EE within undergraduate psychiatry training can potentially enhance overall learning experience through better motivation and engagement of our learners.

AB  - ObjectiveThe study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the public in Malaysia. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted online among the general public in Malaysia from June 2020 to August 2020 between the second and third wave (Phase 3 of the Recovery Movement Control Order). Participants were conveniently recruited through multiple social media platforms to encourage nationwide participation. A patient-administered questionnaire was used to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward the prevention of COVID-19. For descriptive analysis, percentage, mean, and standard deviation (SD) were used to report demographic characteristics and knowledge, attitude, and practice scores. For inferential analysis, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, Chi-square test, and Binary Logistic Regression was used to analyze the study variables' differentiation, association, and correlations. The confidence interval selected for this study was 95%. ResultsA total of 420 respondents participated in this survey. The majority of the participants (n = 412, 98%) were aware of COVID-19. Most participants (60%) learned about the pandemic through social media. About half of the participants had poor knowledge (45.5%) and a negative attitude (43.3%). Participants residing in urban areas showed good preventive practices as compared to those residing in rural areas (P < 0.05). There was a significant association between participants' attitudes and preventive practices toward COVID-19, where the majority of the participants (57.4%) who showed negative attitudes were more likely to follow poor preventive practices. ConclusionDespite having good knowledge, participants with a negative attitude toward COVID-19 were less likely to follow the preventive practices of COVID-19. People's mindset and willingness may play an important role to influence their practices. Thus, these are the vulnerable groups, and strategies should be made to change their mindset through proper counseling and education.

AB  - This study aims to assess the effectiveness of immersive environments that have been implemented by museums to attract new visitors. Based on the frameworks introduced by telepresence and media richness theories, and following a constructivist-based learning approach, we argue that the greater the similarity of an online museum experience is to its physical counterpart, the more positive will be the observer's perception of the collection. We reason that the similarity would lead online visitors to develop greater cognitive involvement which in turn will produce more positive attitudes toward the collection. In support of this argument, we present the results of a comparative study in which 565 participants were exposed randomly to four different exhibitions: two-dimensional collections of art and aircraft museums and three-dimensional tours of similar museums. Results indicate that whereas 3D tours have a strong effect on users' intentions to visit the real museum, cognitive involvement and sense of presence mediate the association between these variables. In terms of managerial implications, our study shows that if educational professionals want to stimulate their students to visit museums, 3D tours appear to be more effective for engaging learners through a realistic-looking environment. By offering richer perceptual cues and multimodal feedback (e.g., users can view 3D objects from multiple viewpoints or zoom in/out the objects), the study suggests that participants may increase their reasoning process and become more interested in cultural content.

AB  - Caste system, still widely prevalent in various spheres of Indian social life, perpetuates social, economic and educational deprivation amongst Dalits, leading to their marginalization and social exclusion. The article is based on an intervention to address caste-based discrimination that was resulting in abject poverty, malnutrition and hunger deaths among Dalits in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Health care staff such as ANMs and Anganwadi workers practice untouchability by not touching Dalits and consequently they could not access health care services and other general civic and pro-poor schemes and programmes.
   Adhering to Freire's conscientization model People's Vigilance Committee on Human Rights (PVCHR), a Civil Society Organization (CSO), carried out interventions by mobilizing Dalits, using media and administrative advocacy, collaborating with national and international human rights organizations, and creating pressure on the government to respond. With consistent collaborative efforts and social action, rural Dalits could ensure healthy living as their access to food security services improved. The success story presented in the article provides insight to learn and theorize working models of Dalit empowerment and checking caste-based discrimination.

AB  - The aim of this research is to examine the extent to which certain sociodemographic characteristics of students and teachers, along with computer self-efficacy, attitudes towards the new media and the frequency of using the new media in instruction, can be regarded as predictors of constructivist teaching. The research was carried out on a sample of a group (N=1528) of eighth-grade students (n=1026) and class and subject teachers (n=502) in primary and lower secondary school (ISCED level 1 and 2). Data was collected through survey questionnaires with relevant instruments. The results show that, in terms of students, their sociodemographic characteristics, a higher level of computer self-efficacy, more positive attitudes towards new media and more frequent use of new media, as separate factors, are significant predictors of constructivist learning. In terms of teachers, their attitudes and computer self-efficacy are significant, but their sociodemographic characteristics and the use of new media are not. The entire final series, both in terms of teachers and students, is a significant predictor of constructivist learning, where certain separate dimensions of predictor factors are more significant than others. The greatest variance of constructivist teaching, both in terms of students and teachers, can be explained by the attitude towards new media and computer self-efficacy rather than the use of new media in instruction, as confirmed by some previous theoretical assumptions. Although significant correlations were obtained, the results point to an occasional organisation of constructivist teaching. The possible reasons and implications of such results are explained in this paper.

AB  - Intense concern about obesity in the public imagination and in political, academic and media discourses has catalysed advocacy efforts to implement regulatory measures to reduce the occurrence of obesity in Australia and elsewhere. This article explores public attitudes towards the possible implementation of regulations to address obesity by analysing emotions within popular discourses. Drawing on reader comments attached to obesity-relevant news articles published on Australian news and current affairs websites, we examine how popular anxieties about the 'obesity crisis' and vitriol directed at obese individuals circulate alongside understandings of the appropriate role of government to legitimise regulatory reform to address obesity. Employing Ahmed's theorisation of 'affective economies' and broader literature on emotional cultures, we argue that obesity regulations achieve popular support within affective economies oriented to neoliberal and individualist constructions of obesity. These economies preclude constructions of obesity as a structural problem in popular discourse; instead positioning anti-obesity regulations as a government-endorsed vehicle for discrimination directed at obese people. Findings implicate a new set of ethical challenges for those championing regulatory reform for obesity prevention.

AB  - Teachers' belief toward students with special educational needs (SEN) in the regular classroom is a condition that may influence the implementation of inclusive education. Nevertheless, some studies suggest that teachers' attitudes or self-efficacy beliefs toward students with behavioral difficulties (BD) are quite negative, but much less emphasis has been placed on the factors and mechanisms contributing to these attitudes. This study investigates associations between pre-service teachers' (PT) attitudes toward students with BD, PT's individual characteristics including self-efficacy beliefs, and PT's education program characteristics. Participants surveyed were 1,499 PT enrolled in a 4-year teacher education program (bachelor's degree) in Quebec Province, Canada. Descriptive analysis showed that PT's report generally positive attitudes toward students with BD on the three components of attitudes, while behavioral components were significantly more positive than the affective and cognitive components. Among the individual characteristics of PTs, the more advanced their academic level, the more negative their attitudes were on all three components. The characteristics related to the teacher education program (general vs. special) and the number of hours of courses on the BD revealed significant differences only on the cognitive component. Results of the mediation analysis further revealed that the association between the PT's characteristics and the three components of attitudes was mediated by PT's self-efficacy beliefs. Results are discussed considering their implications for the field of teacher education.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic will have long-term consequences due to social and economic disruption. This study aimed to understand the contextual, media, and economic factors associated with anticipated mental health consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans. A nationally representative survey of 1001 respondents was conducted in April 2020. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions examined anticipated emotional or psychological effects on respondents or members of their households should social distancing measures continue. Specific analyses focused on: 1) COVID-19 experience -knowing someone or being infected; living in a state with a high death rate; or state social distancing policies; 2) media exposure -source of coronavirus information and time spent on coronavirus news; and 3) economics -current economic effects; and anticipated longterm financial effects. 41% of respondents anticipated mental health consequences. Living in a state with a greater COVID-19 death rate (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.10, 2.72) and anticipating long-term financial difficulties (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.93, 4.60) were both associated with greater likelihood of anticipated mental health consequences. Those whose primary news source was television, as opposed to print or online, were almost 50% less likely to anticipate mental health challenges (OR 0.52 CI 0.33, 0.81), while those who reported spending two or more hours daily on COVID-19 news were 90% more likely (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.27, 2.85). Aspects of community health, media consumption, and economic impacts influence anticipated poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting each domain is relevant to interventions to address the consequences.

A sample of 480 students, between 16 and 24 years of age, was randomly selected from four universities located in Lahore, Pakistan using multistage sampling method. Descriptive statistics of demographic variables were generated to see patterns of Facebook usage. Simple linear regression and multivariate regression analysis was carried out to see the association between independent and dependent variables. The findings of the present study validated the efficacy of standard as well as extended model of TPB by identifying tendencies that can help explain an individual's usage of SNWs in societies like Pakistan. The analysis suggest that an individual's positive attitude towards Facebook, the approval of its usage by significant others' and perceived control over the usage increases the intention to use it. Additionally, higher the intentions to use Facebook, higher will be the actual usage. The intention to continue using Facebook was further strengthened by perceived manifest and latent functions of Facebook. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction and AimsMass media education campaigns targeting parents may influence parent factors that reduce adolescent drinking; however few such campaigns have been evaluated.
   Design and MethodsThe Parents, Young People and Alcohol campaign included two phases of mass media advertising, Cogs and I See, to deliver consistent messages across multiple media channels. The campaign targeted Western Australian parents of 12-17year olds with messages describing alcohol's effect on the developing brain and adolescent physical and mental health. The campaign reinforced the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Guideline that for under 18s, not drinking is the safest option. Parent knowledge, attitudes and behaviours were assessed via cross-sectional surveys administered before the campaign (Time 1) and at two post-tests (Time 2; Time 3). Post-test campaign awareness and perceptions were also assessed.
   ResultsCampaign awareness was high (48% Time 2; 80% Time 3) and over 86% of parents found the campaign believable and relevant at both post-tests. Increased knowledge of the NHMRC guideline and lower belief in alcohol myths were found at both post-tests compared to Time 1. Less positive attitudes to parental supply were found at Time 2, but were not sustained at Time 3. Parents were more likely to have discussed alcohol risks and limiting drinking with their child at Time 3, but parent-to-child alcohol supply did not change significantly.
   Discussion and ConclusionsThe campaign achieved high awareness and positively influenced parental outcomes. Longer term campaign implementation supported by policy and environmental measures may be required to change parental supply.

AB  - Domestic violence is a worldwide epidemic. This study examines the effects of narrative exemplars and a celebrity spokesperson in anti-domestic violence ads on Lebanese college students' attitudes and beliefs towards domestic violence and whether these effects are impacted by personal experience. The practical significance is derived from the high prevalence of domestic violence internationally, making it important to find ways to effectively use media to address this health-related issue that has huge consequences for the individual and society. This study adds to the theoretical understanding of narrative persuasion and media effects. Results indicated that narrative exemplars in anti-domestic violence ads promoting bystander awareness and intervention were more beneficial for people without relevant experience compared to people who know someone affected by domestic violence. Anti-domestic violence ads without narrative exemplars, but that also featured an emotional self-efficacy appeal targeting bystanders, were more effective for participants who know someone who had experienced domestic violence compared to participants without relevant experience. The presence of a celebrity spokesperson elicited more positive attitudes about the ad than a noncelebrity, but failed to directly affect relevant anti-domestic violence attitudes or beliefs. These results highlight the significance of formative audience research in health communication message design.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly escalated in early 2020 and shelter-at-home orders cascaded around the world, celebrities streamed live performances from living rooms, home studios, and empty opera houses. Social media buzzed with gratitude for the entertainment, inspiration, and camaraderie that developed between ordinary citizens and celebrities sharing music from isolation via media technology. Celebrities also called upon their industry connections and friendships to create collaborative fundraising events, support working musicians whose tours were cancelled, and highlight amateur performers. Musicians who streamed simple performances from relatively modest homes and provided glimpses of their 'real lives' - their talents, personalities, homes, friendships, and families - won praise from audiences. Touring musicians and theatre performers in particular provide fascinating moments of empowered participatory citizenship during the pandemic. Beloved by relatively small, active fandoms but not widely popular outside their specific genres, these celebrities are positioned to provide meaningful social media connections with their devoted fans while not necessarily garnering high-profile media attention for their efforts. My critical analysis explores how musicians and theatre performers have responded to social distancing by sharing their music and fostering moments of connection with audiences who were seeking comfort during a global crisis.

AB  - The development of organic food products has proliferated over the past few decades, alongside the use of "white" space on products' packaging as an element that communicates quality and sustainability values. Despite a growing interest towards green products, sustainable business practices and aesthetics, there is not enough evidence on how specific design elements (i.e., "white" space) of organic food packaging could affect consumers' brand perceptions, attitude towards the brand (Abr) and purchase intentions (PI). The present study seeks to unveil the role of "white" space as a packaging design element on the effectiveness of organic food products. Based on a content analysis of 406 international packaging designs it establishes the widespread coexistence of organic products with extended, in shades of gray "white" space. A between-subjects experiment with 305 young adults builds on the associations between "white" space and sustainability, and provides evidence on the proposed serial mediation model with perceived naturalness, quality and trustworthiness, and Abr as mediators in the relationship between organic food products and PI, especially when the packaging uses extended "white" space. Pertinent managerial implications with respect to effective packaging design that promotes sustainability values and generates positive attitudes and behaviors towards organic foods are underlined.

AB  - Recent worldwide growing awareness of the global climate changes stressed the importance of developing and supporting the renewable energy sources (RES). However, the public support for RES varies across various countries and regions, especially those abundant in traditional fossil fuels. This paper presents the analysis of the public views of the economics of the renewable energy using the results of the online survey (N = 750) conducted in several regions of the Russian Federa-tion, a country abundant in natural gas and oil. Our results indicate that there is a mixed opinion on trust in RES as opposed to the traditional energy sources. Even though we found some sup-port for the renewable energy technologies, it appears that it is correlated with the respondents ' concerns about the environmental protection and sustainable development as well as with some demographic variables. The outcomes of the regression analysis confirmed that positive attitudes towards climate protection predetermined the support for various types of RES, while the financial or political gains did not come through as significant. The results indicate that public views on the renewable energy sources could and should be shaped by the information campaigns and presen-tations in mass media conducted by relevant policymakers and public authorities.

AB  - Purpose-The aim of this study is to assess the direct and indirect impact of the prominence dimensions of fit between a brand and a cause on consumer intentions to purchase cause-related products by considering cases with more versus less positive attitudes towards a brand and a higher versus lower social cause affinity.
   Design/methodology/approach-The study is based on data obtained via a survey of 403 respondents in Lithuania. A between-subjects study design with different brands and causes was used to identify the role of the differences in brand attitude and cause affinity on the message strength.
   Findings-The data analysis has revealed that the specific prominence dimensions of fit (relationship visibility, relationship explicitness, visuals/colours, local attributes) have a direct and indirect impact, via the message strength, on consumer intentions to purchase cause-related products. Additionally, the mediation of the message strength was dependent on attitudes towards a brand but not on cause affinity.
   Originality/value-This is the first attempt to contribute to filling the research gap regarding the impact of the prominence dimensions of fit on the intention to purchase a cause-related product. Paying special attention to message strength mediation allowed for the assessment of both the direct and indirect effects of the individual dimensions of fit.

AB  - Objective:To assess healthcare workers' knowledge and attitudes about human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, related diseases, and prevention.Methods:A cross-sectional multicenter survey about HPV and its prevention, targeted to healthcare workers involved in HPV vaccine counseling, was performed from May 2017 to December 2018.Results:The overall median knowledge and attitude scores were 69.2% (25-75,p= 61.5-84.6) and 5 (25-75,p= 4-5), respectively. Both knowledge and attitudes statistically significantly differ between physicians and healthcare professions. The median propensity score before and after the educational intervention was stable and high, at 10 (25-75,p= 9-10). The predictors of statistically significantly high knowledge scores are to be a physician, general practitioner, or pediatrician, attending courses/congresses, and consulting technical product characteristics and scientific literature to obtain information about the HPV vaccine. Being a physician and consulting scientific literature to obtain information about the HPV vaccine were found also as predictors of statistically significantly different attitude scores among study participants.Conclusions:Although healthcare workers showed overall positive attitudes towards the relevance of HPV burden and prevention tools, demonstrated knowledge was largely suboptimal, particularly that shown by healthcare professions. Obtained results allow highlighting knowledge gaps, and thus improving counselling to HPV vaccine targets.

AB  - In vitro meat (IVM) grown from animal cells is approaching commercial viability. This technology could enable consumers to circumvent the ethical and environmental issues associated with meat-eating. However, consumer acceptance of IVM is uncertain, and is partly dependent on how the product is framed. This study investigated the effect of different names for IVM on measures of consumer acceptance. Participants (N = 185) were allocated to one of four conditions in an experimental design in which the product name was manipulated to be 'clean meat', 'cultured meat', 'animal free meat', or 'lab grown meat'. Participants gave word associations and measures of their attitudes and behavioural intentions towards the product. The results indicated that those in the 'clean meat' and 'animal free meat' conditions had significantly more positive attitudes towards IVM than those in the lab grown meat' condition, and those in the 'clean meat' condition had significantly more positive behavioural intentions towards IVM compared to those in the 'lab grown meat' condition. Mediation analyses indicated that the valence of associations accounted for a significant amount of the observed differences, suggesting that anchoring can explain these differences. We discuss these results in the context of social representations theory and give recommendations for future research.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practice of self-medication in medical undergraduate students.
   Method: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted from January to June, 2017, among undergraduate students of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Women Medical College, International Medical College and Frontier Medical College in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The sample comprised students of first, second, third, fourth and fifth professional year. Data was collected using self-generated questionnaire.
   Results: Of the 400 subjects approached, 300(75%) returned the questionnaire fully completed. Of them, 208(69.3%) were females and 92(30.66%) were males. The most common age group was 22-25 years 182(60.7%). Self-medication was found to be prevalent among 297(99%) subjects and 139(46.3%) respondents had practised self-medication in the preceding 6 months more than two times. Over-the-counter drugs were commonly used for the self-medication in 295(98.3%) cases. Overall, 285(95%) respondents had a positive attitude towards self-medication. Media was found to be the most common source of information for 93(31%) cases.
   Conclusion: High prevalence of self-medication was noticed, with over-the-counter drugs being the most commonly used. Proper educational awareness programmes about self-medication can control the issue.

   To investigate Australian urologists' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, and the association of these with treatment preferences relating to guideline-recommended adjuvant radiotherapy for men with adverse pathologic features following radical prostatectomy.
   Subjects and methods
   A nationwide mailed and web-based survey of Australian urologist members of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand (USANZ).
   Results
   157 surveys were included in the analysis (45% response rate). Just over half of respondents (54%) were aware of national clinical practice guidelines for the management of prostate cancer. Urologists' attitudes and beliefs towards the specific recommendation for post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy for men with locally advanced prostate cancer were mixed. Just over half agreed the recommendation is based on a valid interpretation of the underpinning evidence (54.1%, 95% CI [46%, 62.2%]) but less than one third agreed adjuvant radiotherapy will lead to improved patient outcomes (30.2%, 95% CI [22.8%, 37.6%]). Treatment preferences were varied, demonstrating clinical equipoise. A positive attitude towards the clinical practice recommendation was significantly associated with treatment preference for adjuvant radiotherapy (rho = 0.520, P < 0.0001). There was stronger preference for adjuvant radiotherapy in more recently trained urologists (registrars) while preference for watchful waiting was greater in more experienced urologists (consultants) (b = 0.156, P = 0.034; 95% CI [0.048, 1.24]). Urologists' attitudes towards clinical practice guidelines in general were positive.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the normal life of people around the world and has forced them to maintain social distance, self-quarantine and closing of many businesses. So, the people wish to share the information regarding the pandemic through social media e.g. Twitter. The key objective of this paper is to identify the sentiment associated with the pandemic by utilizing the tweets regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and by using the python libraries to perform the task. We analyze the sentiment of people when Coronavirus has attained a peak level using the machine, deep learning techniques and TextBlob. We have classified the sentiments into positive and negative classes using the Machine Learning (NB, SVM, Logistic regression) approaches and deep learning-based Bi-LSTM model. The Bi-LSTM approach has achieved better accuracy (0.87) compared to the traditional machine learning models for Twitter sentiment classification. From the overall analysis, we could conclude that people are confident and they express more positivity towards the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an analysis will help the policy and decision-makers to address the needs of the public appropriately.

AB  - Creativity is a commonly assumed characteristic of entrepreneurs. It is proposed to be a necessary, although not sufficient, prerequisite for entrepreneurship. This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the relationship between self-perceived creativity and entrepreneurial intentions. To do so, we conducted a cross-sectional survey study among 559 university students. We tested an expanded model based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which included self-perceived creativity as a distal antecedent of entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, we examined both the role of perceived family and university support for creativity, as well as taking a creativity course, in boosting self-perceived creativity. While some empirical evidence has indicated a direct link between (perceived) creativity and entrepreneurial intentions, the TPB posits that three antecedents (attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control/self-efficacy) would be the only direct determinants of intentions. All other factors are theorized to indirectly influence intentions through one or more of these components. The results of partial least squares structural modelling refuted this assumption. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy and positive attitudes did indeed mediate the self-perceived creativity - entrepreneurial intentions link, but self-perceived creativity explained additional variance in entrepreneurial intentions, beyond these TPB components. In addition, our results showed that family and university support for creativity, as well as taking a creativity course, were significant predictors of self-perceived creativity. Postgraduate students, and particularly male students, perceived greater university and family support and reported greater self-perceived creativity than did undergraduate students. We conclude that teaching creativity contents and practice are a useful way to enrich entrepreneurship programmes.

AB  - Aim - This study was aimed to investigate knowledge and attitudes of H1N1 influenza among pharmacy students.
   Material and Methods - A cross-sectional study was carried out among undergraduate and postgraduate students of the Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore from February-May 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge and attitudes of H1N1 influenza. All data were analyzed using SPSS 22.
   Results - The median age of study participants (N=420) was 20 years, with majority of females (72.4%), undergraduate students (96.7%) belonging to middle economic class (89.8%). The median knowledge score was 18, with 38.1% having poor, 55.7% moderate and 6.2% excellent knowledge score (score <17, 17-25, and 26-34, respectively). The median attitude score was 47 (9); around 52% of the participants were found to have positive attitudes. Initially, there was a significant difference of knowledge score, not attitude, among age categories. However, in post hoc analysis, after Bonferroni adjustment (P<0.017), individuals > 26 years of age had better knowledge scores than 21-25 years (p=0.015) and <= 20 years (p=0.005) age categories. Gender had no significant influence on the knowledge as well as attitude score. Futhermore, postgraduate students had signifcanlty better knowledge scores, not attitude, than undergraduates (p=0.002).
   Conclusions - Our findings highlight the need to equip pharmacy students with comprehensive knowledge of H1N1 influenza so that in future they can help increase the public awareness at community pharmacies, hospitals or the communities they reside.

AB  - An online cross-sectional study was carried out to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among primary health care providers (PHPs) at three tertiary care hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. Data was collected via email and online social media platforms. Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 was used for data analysis. Among the total participants (n = 114), 74 (66.7%) were male and 37 (33.3%) were female. The mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 12.7 +/- 0.89, 8.9 +/- 4.1 and 7.3 +/- 1.2, respectively. Most of the participants knew the term COVID-19 and its mode of transmission (90%), signs and symptoms (84%) and risk factors (72%) associated with it. Most of the participants agreed that COVID-19 can be transmitted through coughing and sneezing (74.3%) and 84.6% were in favor that COVID-19 can be prevented by adopting preventive measures. Around 68.8% of the participants disagreed with the use of antibiotics in the prevention of COVID-19. Ninety percent of the respondents were avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu-like symptoms. Most PHPs had good knowledge, positive attitude and reasonable practices regarding COVID-19. Moreover, focused training programs for PHPs at the Government level can further improve their understanding of risks and preventive strategies related to COVID-19, which will help them to provide appropriate care to their patients as well as to protect themselves from this infection.

KW  - CORONAVIRUS
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices of two Pakistani university populations.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among students and employees of two higher education institutions in Lahore, Pakistan, namely the University of Lahore and the Gulab Devi Educational Complex. Participants were recruited using a convenient sampling method. A validated 45-item, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Total possible scores were 0-14 for knowledge (scores < 7, 7-10 and > 10 were considered to indicate poor, moderate and good knowledge, respectively); 0- 7 for attitude (scores > 5 were considered to indicate a good attitude); and 0-18 for COVID-19 preventative practices (scores > 12 were considered to indicate good preventative practices).
   Results Of the 417 enrolled participants, 416 reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source of their information. Mean scores were 10.12 +/- 2.20 for knowledge (good, moderate and poor knowledge in 50.2%, 42.8% and 7.0% of participants, respectively); 5.74 +/- 1.28 for attitude (65.4% of individuals had a positive attitude); and 11.04 +/- 3.34 for COVID-19 preventative practices (only 36.5% of participants had good preventive practices).
   Conclusion Pakistani university students and employees have good knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19, but unsatisfactory preventive practices. Therefore, health regulators should use multiple communication approaches, such as electronic, print and social media, phone messages, etc., to increase awareness and improve practices related to COVID-19.

AB  - Background. Exercise is considered to be the most effective strategy to treat, prevent and delay frailty, a prevalent geriatric syndrome observed in clinical practice. Encouraging frail older people to take up exercise is crucial in the management of this condition. The study aimed to explore pre-frail and frail older peoples' perspectives in relation to being advised about exercise and their perceptions of the general practitioners' (GPs) role in promoting exercise for older people.
   Methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 community-dwelling older (median age 83 years) participants screened pre-frail or frail using the FRAIL Screen. Their attitudes towards exercise, the advice received, their access to relevant information and their perceptions of the GP's role in promoting exercise were explored. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyse data.
   Results. The majority of participants had a positive attitude towards exercise, and many participants indicated a preference for being advised firstly by their GPs and then other healthcare professionals. Participants living in the community reported difficulties in accessing information on exercise and indicated that local governments and GP practices should promote exercise for older people more actively. Participants living in retirement villages, however, reported having access to relevant information and being encouraged to participate in exercise.
   Conclusion. This research identified a gap in current practice, demonstrating that GPs, healthcare providers and local governments should promote exercise for older people more actively. Convincing health professionals to encourage regular exercise among their older patients would provide an opportunity to avoid and manage frailty in this population.

AB  - Background : Chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnancy may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In the Netherlands, testing for C. trachomatis is based on risk assessment. We assessed midwives 'knowledge, test practices, assessment of risk behavior, and attitudes regarding testing for C. trachomatis infection during pregnancy. We evaluated the association between midwives 'characteristics and their knowledge of C. trachomatis infection in terms of symptomatology and outcomes. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among primary care midwives in the Netherlands. Between September and November 2011, midwives from all Dutch primary care midwifery practices were invited to complete a questionnaire about C. trachomatis infection. Results: Of the 518 midwives invited to participate in this study, 331 (63.9%) responded. The overall median knowledge score for questions about symptomatology and outcomes was 10 out of a maximum score of 15. The median knowledge score was higher among midwives in urban areas. In total, 239 (72.2%) midwives reported testing pregnant women for C. trachomatis. The primary reason for testing was a request by the woman herself (96.2%), followed by symptoms of infection (89.1%), risk behavior (59.3%), and risk factors for infection (7.3%). Almost 25% of midwives showed positive attitudes towards universal screening for C. trachomatis. Conclusions: Midwives were knowledgeable about symptoms of infection, but less about outcomes. Midwives test pregnant women for C. trachomatis mainly on the women's request. Otherwise, testing is based on symptoms of infection rather than on known risk factors. This may contribute to under-diagnosis and under-treatment, leading to maternal, perinatal, and neonatal morbidity.

AB  - The relation of mothers' attitudes on the effects of maternal employment on children, psychological well-being, sensitivity of the mother, and children's socioemotional development were examined in mothers who worked full time (consistently) and mothers who were unemployed during their children's early years of growth from 6 months of age. Longitudinal observations of 1,213 mothers and children from age 1 to 36 months from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care were analyzed using structural equation models. Mothers and children benefited when maternal attitudes were consistent with the mothers' actual employment status. Among consistently employed mothers, those with positive attitudes about employment had better psychological well-being. When mothers who were unemployed, they believed that maternal employment would have positive consequences for their children's development, they preferred working outside home and they were more likely to show a low level of psychological well-being and poor quality of mother-child relation. Additionally, maternal well-being mediated the relation between a mother's attitudes and a child's social competence. For both groups, better psychological well-being of mothers was positively related to better child's socioemotional outcome. Maternal sensitivity, however, did not mediate the relation between maternal attitudes and child's social outcomes. The findings shed light on the need for a sensitive measure of characterizing mothers who work versus those who stay at home in order to better understand the effects on a child's development.

AB  - Background: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease of public health importance and one of the leading causes of permanent physical disability. Nevertheless, the drop in prevalence following multidrug therapy has resulted in the neglect of leprosy. The annual incidence of leprosy has remained the same in Ethiopia since decades with more than 76 % of the reported new cases coming from Oromia and Amhara Regional States. This study was aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and skill of general health workers in leprosy control activities at public health facilities in Oromia and Amhara Regional States.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2011 to February 2012 at different public health facilities in selected eight zones in Oromia and Amhara Regional States. A multistage sampling method was used to obtain representative samples. High and low endemic zones for leprosy were included in the study in both regional states. Data were collected from general health workers through a structured self-administered questionnaire and at on-site assessment of their performance. Baseline socio-demographic data, health workers' attitude towards leprosy and their knowledge and skill in the management of leprosy were assessed. Bloom's cut off point was used to describe the knowledge and practical skills of the respondents while Likert's scale was used for attitude assessment.
   Result: A total of 601 general health workers responsible for leprosy control activities at public health facilities were included in knowledge and attitude assessment and 83 of them were subjected to practical evaluation, with on-site observation of how they handle leprosy patients. These included medical doctors (4 %), health officers and nurses with Bachelor degree in Science (27 %), clinical nurses with diploma (66 %) and health assistants (2.8 %). The median age of the respondents was 26.0 years and females made up of 45 %. Generally the knowledge and skills of the respondents were found to be poor while attitude towards leprosy was positive for the majority of the respondents. The result showed that 519 (86.3 %) had poor knowledge. Overall 155 (25.8 %) of the respondents had positive attitude towards leprosy while 205 (34.1 %) had intermediate (mixed) attitude and 241 (40.1 %) had negative attitude to the disease. Among 83 respondents assessed for diagnosis of leprosy only 15(18.0 %) diagnosed leprosy correctly. Variation in knowledge and attitude indicated a significant difference (p < 0.05) among different health institutions, professions, gender, in-service training and years of experience.
   Conclusion: The current finding underlines that although leprosy control activities are integrated to the general health services in the country, the knowledge and skills of leprosy diagnosis, treatment and management by health workers was unsatisfactory. Hence, attention should be given to develop training strategies that can improve health worker knowledge and promote better leprosy management at public health facilities. This could be achieved through pre-service and in-service training and giving adequate emphasis to leprosy related practical work and continuous follow-up.

AB  - This paper examines the compliance of Spanish crime reporting with the principles of the 2016 EU Directive on presumption of innocence, which aims at preventing the publication of information that might bias the public and the jurors against the suspect. A content analysis applied to a sample of 200 crime news stories published by eleven of the most popular print and online news platforms in 2018 reveals that the Spanish press coverage of crime is centered around the pre-trial and sentence stages, with little attention to the oral trial. The full name and the face portrait of the suspect appear in roughly one-third of the stories, but this overwhelmingly happens in news stories reporting on the court's decision, so that the presumption of innocence is generally protected. Interestingly, the legacy media are more likely to report on the victim's full name and the crime details that online digital media. One-fourth of the stories include accusations of guilt, as prosecutor attorneys and other officials are more frequently cited than defense lawyers. Although the Spanish press is largely compliant with the recommendations of the EU Directive, the lack of attention to the oral phase, where the arguments of both parts are deployed and contrasted, leads to a bias in the coverage against the suspect.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate disciplinary differences in the use of networked information for research and scholarly communication at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), Oman. The paper produced quantitative data on how and why academics within different disciplines utilise networked information either made available internally through the university library, or externally through services accessed by the internet.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted with academic staff at SQU.
   Findings - Statistical analysis found a number of significant differences between respondents in the science disciplines and those in the social sciences and humanities with regard to their use of, and attitudes towards, digital information services. While respondents from science disciplines show overall longer and more frequent use of networked information, respondents from humanities and social sciences indicated more positive attitudes towards library networked services.
   Research limitations/implications - The Arab country context presents a challenge in determining the degree to which results can be extrapolated to other environments, in that disciplines are also divided by language. Science disciplines teach in English, and the social science and humanities in Arabic.
   Originality/value - While similar studies have been undertaken in developed countries, this study is an attempt to establish some data for a developing Arab country.

AB  - Among minority members, positive contact with the majority was previously found to improve not only the attitudes toward the majority but also the attitudes toward minority outgroups (the secondary transfer effect; STE). However, the roles of negative intergroup contact and minority groups' social status in the STE have not been yet examined. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the association between both positive and negative contact with the national majority group (Finns) and mutual attitudes among high-status Estonian (n = 171) and low-status Russian (n = 180) immigrants in Finland. Two mediators of the STE were tested: attitudes toward the majority (attitude generalization) and public collective self-esteem (diagonal hostility). While positive and negative STEs emerging via attitude generalization were expected to occur among both immigrant groups, the mediating effect of public collective self-esteem was assumed only for members of the low-status group. In both immigrant groups, the relationship between positive contact with the majority group and attitudes toward the other immigrant group was positive and indirect through more favorable attitudes toward majority group members. The same mechanism characterized negative contact, where the indirect effect was mediated by less positive attitudes toward Finns. As predicted, public collective self-esteem mediated the effects of positive and negative contact with majority group members on attitudes toward the other minority only among low-status Russian immigrants. The results call for the acknowledgement of different mechanisms explaining the STE among minority groups enjoying different social statuses in host society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Interpersonal trust and distrust are important components of human social interaction. Although several studies have shown that brain function is associated with either trusting or distrusting others, very little is known regarding brain function during the control of social attitudes, including trust and distrust. This study was designed to investigate the neural mechanisms involved when people attempt to control their attitudes of trust or distrust toward another person. We used a novel control-of-attitudes fMRI task, which involved explicit instructions to control attitudes of interpersonal trust and distrust. Control of trust or distrust was operationally defined as changes in trustworthiness evaluations of neutral faces before and after the control-of-attitudes fMRI task. Overall, participants (n = 60) evaluated faces paired with the distrust instruction as being less trustworthy than faces paired with the trust instruction following the control-of-distrust task. Within the brain, both the control-of-trust and control-of-distrust conditions were associated with increased temporoparietal junction, precuneus (PrC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and medial prefrontal cortex activity. Individual differences in the control of trust were associated with PrC activity, and individual differences in the control of distrust were associated with IFG activity. Together, these findings identify a brain network involved in the explicit control of distrust and trust and indicate that the PrC and IFG may serve to consolidate interpersonal social attitudes.

AB  - The COVID-19 crisis highlighted issues of trust in government and experts, as citizens were asked to accept restrictions on liberties in order to slow the spread of the virus. Based on a survey of 1992 Australians conducted in May 2020, this paper reports on the attitudes of Australians toward the responses of their State and Federal governments to the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, we found support for government responses differed with partisan alignment. However, when we controlled for values differences, we found that values predicted social distancing attitudes and behaviour. This oppugns the common conclusion in political psychology that party alignment is a proxy for values. Scientists were trusted more than political institutions or actors for accurate COVID-19 information, and likewise, traditional media were preferred to online sources. These findings have implications for policy communication when individual action is required to address collective goals.

AB  - Three studies investigated how politicized collective identification affects individuals' reactions towards others. We hypothesized that a strong politicized identity tends to be accompanied by a moral conviction about the politicized cause, which in turn determines how the politicized respond to those less committed to their cause. Consistent with this, Study 1 showed that politicized (feminist) identification is associated with lower identification with women who place moderate (vs. high) moral value on gender equality. Study 2 showed that politicized identification was associated with negative emotions towards people who disagree with this cause and this was mediated by the extent to which participants saw supporting the activist goal as morally obligatory. Study 3 showed that politicized identification, to the extent to which it implied holding a moral conviction about the activist cause, is associated with a desire for more social distance to an attitudinally dissimilar other, but not from an attitudinally similar other.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic burdens forensic practice worldwide. The experience of crisis management is a lesson learned that guides future preparedness for similar casualties. Thus, the present study takes an in-depth look at the knowledge, attitude, and practice of forensic practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Arab world. A comprehensive questionnaire was adopted in compliance with optimum international standards for the management of deaths during the pandemic. The survey was electronically distributed in 13 Arab countries. The responses were received from 29 forensic practitioners from 11 countries. Total median knowledge, attitude, and practice scores of respondents constituted 37.9%, 74%, and 36.8% of optimum scores respectively. Regarding knowledge, better scores are related to risk assessment and routes of exposure to Coronavirus, whereas, least scores were related to ventilation and negative pressure system. Most of the participants had a positive attitude, 85.2% were concerned about proper management of COVID-19 deaths, and 77.8% trusted the decisions of their teams. Considering practice, better scores are related to forensic staff competence, whereas, least scores were related to the implementation of ideal safety measures. Participants described the management process as useful (52%), reliable (35%), high quality (21%), and cost-effective (17%), however, they expressed challenges as staff infection, limited resources, and infrastructure issues. This survey guides readjusting of procedures and future preparedness for similar disasters in the Arab world. This research adopted a questionnaire that could be used in initial and periodic assessments in any medicolegal institute worldwide. Also, it could support infrastructure projects and disaster management plans.

AB  - Objectives: To share the experience of study skill module development and implementation for first year MBBS students at Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College (LNH&MC). To compare the change in students' selfassessment of their knowledge of study skills before and after the course.
   Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted from November 2019 to April 2020. A structured study skills course was offered to 100 first year MBBS students of Liaquat National Hospital & Medical College, Karachi. Steps involved in the development included identification of outcomes, instructional objectives, content and instructional strategies. Students were given two questionnaires. In the first questionnaire, students rated their interest in implementing the learning techniques learnt. In the second questionnaire, students rated their level of knowledge of effective study skills before and after the course. Analysis included computing percentages for students' preferred study skill technique. Change in knowledge was assessed by comparing retrospective pre-post self-rating using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test (two-tailed).
   Results: Analysis of survey forms showed that more than 50% of the students were willing to implement active listening techniques, metacognitive note taking and writing reflections in their future study practice. There was also a statistically significant change in students' self-rating of their knowledge about study skills (pre-test median 3, post-test median 4, p0.00).
   Conclusion: This study provides an insight of structured study skills course development and implementation in early medical college studies that could help them in combating academic stress. In addition, students' response about their preferred technique and their feedback comparison concluded their positive attitude towards the course.

AB  - Awareness and comprehension of disease origin, transmission, and control in a health crisis are mainly affected by the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of the general public. We conducted the current study to assess KAP among the general population of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, based on an online cross-sectional survey. Participants completed a questionnaire we developed consisting of KAP questions. We also collected sociodemographic information and source of information about disease awareness. The main source of information regarding COVID-19 was Internet social media (66.3%) followed by TV (17.4%). We conducted nonparametric analyses on KAP scores using a Mann-Whitney U and Kruskall-Wallis H tests (P< .05) to find out the association with sociodemographic characteristics. The overall knowledge score (correct answer) was 88.9%, which was significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, and occupation. The positive attitude score was 73.3%, which was significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, marital status, and geographic area. Overall, 93.0% positive practices were observed in the general population based on asked questions. These scores were significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, marital status, area, and occupation. On the basis of the Spearmen correlation test (P< .01), a significant correlation was observed between scores of knowledge and attitude, withr(s)= +0.28,P= .000, knowledge and practices scores asr(s)= +0.24,P= .000, and attitude and practices scores asr(s)= +0.24,P= .000. However, due to the limited sample presentation in the survey, the study is unable to generalize to lower socioeconomic communities.

AB  - Background. Peer crowds are macro-level, reputation-based subcultures with shared preferences, values, and behavior. The Country peer crowd has been the focus of tobacco industry research and marketing but has yet to be the primary focus of public health research. The current study explores the utility of Down and Dirty, a Social Branding tobacco education campaign, in changing Virginia Country teens' chewing tobacco-related attitudes and behavior. The relationship between chew use and Country peer crowd identification was also explored. Method. To evaluate the campaign, a cross-sectional survey was administered online for 3 years from 2014 to 2016. Responses were collected via social media advertisements targeting 13- to 18-year-old Country youth from Virginia (total n = 1,264). Participants reported peer crowd identification, chew-related attitudes and behavior, and campaign engagement and appeal. Results. Compared with Wave 1, Waves 2 and 3 Country teens who engaged with Down and Dirty had greater odds of holding strong attitudes against chew. Among campaign-engaged Country teens, odds of chew use were lower at Waves 2 and 3, and lower odds were associated with liking the campaign. Related to chew prevalence, Country teens demonstrated greater odds of past 30-day chew use compared to non-Country teens, and higher Country identification was associated with greater odds of chew use. Discussion. Down and Dirty is a promising intervention associated with positive attitudinal and behavioral outcomes for high-risk Country teens. Additionally, this study helps document tobacco-related behavioral patterns of the Country peer crowd, a priority for ongoing tobacco education, especially around chew.

AB  - Scientific research on leisure has proven its contribution to physical and psychological well-being in adolescents, especially regarding the practice of structured leisure activities. Leisure is considered a privileged context for adolescents to develop and learn several developmental skills, such as emotion regulation (ER). Nevertheless, the relationship between leisure and ER has been under-researched in adolescents. The present cross-sectional study aims to test a conceptual model concerning the relationship of leisure attitudes and leisure satisfaction with adolescents' positive functioning and to explore the role of emotion self-regulation strategies in that relationship. Thus, we hypothesized that leisure attitudes would be a predictor of leisure satisfaction; leisure satisfaction would be a predictor of positive functioning dimensions (self-esteem; satisfaction with life; psychological well-being); and the relationship between leisure satisfaction and positive functioning dimensions would be mediated by emotion self-regulation strategies [cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES)]. The participants in this study were 654 adolescents from 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, aged between 14 and 19 years old. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. The structural equation analysis showed that leisure attitudes are a significant predictor of leisure satisfaction, and that leisure satisfaction significantly predicts all positive functioning dimensions. CR mediated the relationship between leisure satisfaction and self-esteem. These findings highlight the importance of developing positive attitudes toward leisure to increase adolescents' levels of leisure satisfaction. This study also supports the importance of leisure satisfaction for achieving adolescents' positive functioning. Future studies should continue to examine the role of emotion self-regulation strategies on leisure, especially regarding CR.

AB  - Social support plays a key role in well-being, yet one of the major preventative efforts for reducing the spread of COVID-19 involves social distancing. During times of crisis, social support is emphasized as a coping mechanism. This requires many people to change their typical ways of connectedness and assumes that people have existing healthy relationships or access to technology. The purpose of this article was to explore the potential impact of COVID-19 on loneliness and well-being. Social support is an important consideration for understanding the impact of COVID-19 Psychological First Aid and Skills for Psychological Recovery, which are tools used to inform response methods to help people connect '5 during isolation and are interventions that could be adapted to COVID-specific needs for what may be a prolonged isolation and postisolation. Given the many unknowns of COVID-19, studies are needed to understand the larger behavioral health impact to ensure resources are available, current, and evidence informed. Future studies are also needed to understand how access to technology may help buffer loneliness and isolation and thus improve the social outcomes of the current pandemic.

AB  - BackgroundSpontaneous reporting (SR) of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from patients can be considered as a valuable activity providing both objective and subjective data. However, improving the rate of under-reporting has been a major challenge to ensure successful operation of the SR system. This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and intent to report ADRs and explore the factors contributing to consumers' reporting intent in South Korea.MethodsSelf-administered questionnaire was collected from a sex-, age-, and regionally stratified nationwide convenience sample of consumers using a commercial panel in December 2018. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors contributing to the intent to report ADRs by consumers.ResultsA total of 1000 respondents were enrolled in the survey; 50.9% were males and the mean age was 44.4 (standard deviation, 13.3) years. While less than 15% of the respondents were aware of the SR system and even fewer (3.4%) had actual experience of SR, however, 59.2% expressed their intent to report ADRs. The positive attitude (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.972, p<0.001), awareness of the SR system (aOR 2.102, p<0.01), self-efficacy for SR (aOR 1.956, p<0.001), and experiences related to ADR counselling with healthcare professionals (OR 2.318, p<0.001) are the significant factors contributing to reporting intent.ConclusionsFindings of this study highlight the need for increasing the awareness of the SR system among consumers and empowering them to report ADRs by themselves, which would ultimately improve the drug-safety environment.

AB  - Rationale, aims and objectives To bridge the gap between theory and practice, methods are needed that promote a positive attitude to change among health care professionals and facilitate the incorporation of new research findings. In this context, communication plays a significant role. The aim of this study was to analyse primary care staff members' readiness to adopt new ways of thinking and willingness to change their work practices by means of strategic communication. Method An evaluative design was used to study a primary care staff cohort for 7 years. The study population comprised all primary care staff in a region of Sweden (n = 1206). The strategic communication encompassed managerial impact, planning and implementation of reflexive communication processes, in addition to activities in three established communication channels (oral, written and digital). A questionnaire was used, and bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. Results A total of 846 individuals participated in the evaluation (70%). Strategic communication had a significant effect on staff members' new way of thinking (61%) and willingness to change daily work practices (33%). The communication channels had a significant synergy effect on the adoption of new ideas and willingness to change attitudes. Oral and digital communication had a significant impact on staff members' readiness to change. Conclusions Strategic communication plays an important role in the process of creating innovative attitudes and behaviour among primary care professionals. The willingness to change attitudes enhances primary care staff's readiness to change everyday practices, thus facilitating the implementation of evidence-based care.

AB  - Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) status is far from the national target in China. To identify the modifiable factors associated with EBF of infants aged under 6 months in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 provinces/municipalities across China in 2017-2018. We used multistage stratified cluster sampling and collected data through face-to-face interviews with mothers using an electronic questionnaire. Totally, 5287 pairs of mother-infant aged <6 months were investigated. The EBF prevalence was 29.2% (1544/5287). Mothers with correct knowledge of colostrum (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.62), EBF (AOR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.81) and the highest scores of perceptions for breastfeeding benefits (AOR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.61) were more likely to exclusively breastfeed. However, mothers with more frequent unwillingness of breastfeeding during the first month postpartum were less likely to practice EBF (AOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.90). Infants having their first breast milk within 24 h of birth increased the odds of EBF (AOR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.86, 3.13). Infants were less likely to be exclusively breastfed in the families in which the main caregiver was the grandmothers. Mothers without receiving infant formula feeding suggestions via the health facilities, media, or the Internet (AOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.85) or without the experience of infant formula feeding in public (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.72) might more likely to practice EBF. To acquire comprehensively correct knowledge and keep a positive attitude of breastfeeding for the mothers are crucial for improving the EBF prevalence. Family supports are potential interventions worth focusing on. Infant formula promotion remains a great barrier for EBF in China.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   This survey was done to evaluate awareness of various treatment modalities for replacing single missing tooth among the people of western Maharashtra. We wanted to assess gender wise awareness of patients regarding fixed dental prosthesis as a treatment modality for replacement of missing tooth.
   METHODS
   This cross-sectional study was done on 150 subjects visiting the dental college using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was pre-tested through a pilot survey. Data was evaluated using version 16.0 of the SPSS. Chi Square test and ANOVA were used as test of significance at p < 0.05.
   RESULTS
   Out of 150 subjects, 87 were males and 63 females. Around 64% of the subjects wanted to replace missing tooth due to difficulty in masticatory function; yet 14% knew the importance of aesthetic and speech as well. All subjects preferred fixed prosthesis for replacement of missing tooth, but higher cost of the procedure and fear of surgical trauma were the main factors for not undergoing implant treatment. Dental professionals were the main source of information about different treatment procedures followed by media.
   CONCLUSIONS
   There is a strong level of awareness among the subjects about the fixed treatment procedure, but more than half of the subjects did not have knowledge about the implants. It also revealed the need to provide the subjects with more knowledge about this treatment modality. Dental awareness is therefore necessary in order to cultivate a positive attitude towards dental implants amongst the community.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has promoted a big change in the educational sector. Suddenly, teachers, professors, and students had to migrate from presential classes to the online system without prior notice or a training course. This paper aimed to verify how the need of a rapid change to the online system in response to the impossibility of keeping the presential system due to the mandatory social distancing imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic has affected relationships and performance of teachers, professors, and students, as well as review the technologies and procedures adopted by them to innovate and achieve sustainable education. To address the empirical side of this exploratory research, the authors of this paper sent an email questionnaire to kindergarten, elementary and high school teachers in the City of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), as well as to professors of the top 197 Brazilian universities. To address theoretical side of this exploratory research, an investigation was carried out through scientific databases. The data were analyzed with SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 22.0, and with Microsoft Excel 2007. As a result, this paper showed that social isolation and transition to the online system greatly affected the work conditions of teachers and professors, as well as the learning process of students. Anyway, sustainable actions were taken to overcome these challenges. Furthermore, this paper proposed a framework that might support the development of new studies, filling the literature gap on the subject.

AB  - The year 2020 has marked the spread of a global pandemic, COVID-19, challenging many aspects of our daily lives. Different organizations have been involved in controlling this outbreak. The social distancing intervention is deemed to be the most effective policy in reducing face-to-face contact and slowing down the rate of infections. Stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders have been implemented in different states and cities, affecting daily traffic patterns. Social distancing interventions and fear of the disease resulted in a traffic decline in cities and counties. However, after stay-at-home orders ended and some public places reopened, traffic gradually started to revert to pre-pandemic levels. It can be shown that counties have diverse patterns in the decline and recovery phases. This study analyzes county-level mobility change after the pandemic, explores the contributing factors, and identifies possible spatial heterogeneity. To this end, 95 counties in Tennessee have been selected as the study area to perform geographically weighted regressions (GWR) models. The results show that density on non-freeway roads, median household income, percent of unemployment, population density, percent of people over age 65, percent of people under age 18, percent of work from home, and mean time to work are significantly correlated with vehicle miles traveled change magnitude in both decline and recovery phases. Also, the GWR estimation captures the spatial heterogeneity and local variation in coefficients among counties. Finally, the results imply that the recovery phase could be estimated depending on the identified spatial attributes. The proposed model can help agencies and researchers estimate and manage decline and recovery based on spatial factors in similar events in the future.

AB  - Background Patient safety is regarded as a global problem by which both developed and developing worlds are affected. It is defined as avoidance and prevention of patient injuries or adverse events, which could result during health care delivery. This study aimed to identify physicians' knowledge, influence, and attitude toward patient's safety in the faculty of medicine, Cairo university. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 187 postgraduate physicians of different specialties working in the faculty of medicine, Cairo University. Anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed. The questionnaire is one of a series of tools designed for evaluation of the pilot implementation of the World Health Organization patient safety curriculum for medical schools. Results Calculated attitude score was relatively higher than influence, then knowledge score (median scores were 4.25, 3.1, and 2.5 respectively). There was no difference in knowledge, attitude, and influence scores by different personal characteristics as gender, specialty, workplace, graduation year except for higher influence score among physician who received in patient safety (p = 0.016). There was a weak positive significant correlation between knowledge and influence scores and between influence and attitude scores (r = 0.25, p = 0.002; r = 0.27, p < 0.001 respectively). Conclusion Higher patient safety positive attitude than influence and knowledge is pinpointed in physicians of different specialties in the faculty of medicine, Cairo University. This raises the attention to the importance of implementation of continuing patient safety education programs.

AB  - The objectives of this investigation were to determine general background of farmers, their existing rice seed production condition, their perception of rice seed production standard, and constraints on farmers' rice seed production. The sample of 66 selected rice farmers in Thamai Sub-District, Chumsaeng District, Nakhon Sawan Province was estimated using the formula developed by Arkin (1974) through multistage sampling technique. Data was obtained by interview schedule under close observation and in-depth discussion with key persons in the research site. The results revealed that average age of respondent was 48.09 years. Average year of rice seed cultivation experience was 4.36 years. The average size of owned land for seed cultivation was 3.36 hectares. Total seed cultivation land, accounting for 74.88%, was farmers' owned land that they inherited from their parents. These can reduce the risk in farming because it is their own land. The results of assessment of farmers' perception indicated that most of respondents had the required knowledge in seed production standard. They could answer correctly questions regarding rice seed production technology. Most of them had positive attitude toward the proposed standard practice. Nearly 60% of the respondents followed the right production practices. Farmers' characteristics factors affecting seed yield were number of extension contact, farm media perception, and participation in community intervention program, respectively. The constraints in rice seed production improvement were high cost of inputs, high cost of fertilizer, low rice price, and climate variability, respectively.

AB  - Introduction: Smoking causes substantial preventable morbidity, mortality and financial burdens. It is the main risk factor for many diseases and a significant cause of death. Smoking prevalence is high internationally and in Malaysia, especially among males. Smoking cessation is essential to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.
   Aim: To evaluate knowledge, attitude towards and practice of smoking among pharmacy students in the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM).
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated structured self-administered questionnaire among a sample of IIUM pharmacy students (n=251) from November 2012 to December 2012. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarise data and to examine the relationship between variables.
   Results: A total of 251 IIUM pharmacy students have participated in the survey. The median age of the participants was 21-23 years; 23.9% of them were males and 76.1% were females. The percentage of current smokers and ex-smokers was 0.4%, 0.8%, respectively. About 43% of the respondents had a good knowledge (score >16), more than half of them had a positive attitude (score >17), and about 38.4% had a good practice (score >11).
   Conclusion: Smoking prevalence among pharmacy students in IIUM is very low. However, conducting training and educational programs to improve knowledge, attitudes and practice of pharmacy students is highly recommended to assist their contribution to smoking cessation interventions in the future.

AB  - The ideal stage to learn about and foster positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship is believed to be during childhood and adolescence. However, most entrepreneurial studies examine college rather than secondary school students (SSS). Based on a modified theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study used stratified cluster sampling and a questionnaire to review current entrepreneurship education in secondary schools. In addition, the effects of entrepreneurship education, personal traits, and demographics on attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and entrepreneurial intentions (EI) on 1018 SSS in China were studied. Differences, correlations, and structural equation modeling analysis indicated the following. (1) Most SSS had never received entrepreneurship education, likely resulting in lowered entrepreneurial intention and perception of entrepreneurial behavioral performance as unrealistically easy. (2) Cognitive bias existed in SSS's perceptions of entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial behaviors were regarded as external cause-oriented activities. (3) Gender and entrepreneurial experience of family member also influenced EI and related variables. (4) Entrepreneurship education and personal traits (locus of control and innovativeness) were significantly positive predictors of EI, and (5) their effects on EI were completely mediated by PBC. The findings supported the TPB predictions, and the results offered some implications for entrepreneurship education in Chinese secondary schools: (1) developing entrepreneurial personal traits while eliminating examination-oriented education, (2) enhancing SSS's entrepreneurial confidence so entrepreneurial behaviors are perceived as easier and more achievable, and (3) constructing systematic entrepreneurship courses to guarantee transition from secondary to higher education.

AB  - The authors combined the 2-step flow of communication model and the theory of planned behavior to create a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of a set of advertisements from the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign promoting parent-child drug communication. The sample consisted of 1,349 pairs of parents and children who responded to the first and second annual rounds of the National Survey of Parents and Youth, and 1,276 pairs from Rounds 3 and 4. Parents' exposure to the campaign reported at Round 1 was indirectly associated with youth's lowered intentions to use marijuana at Round 2. Ad exposure was associated with positive changes in parental attitudes toward drug communication and perceived social approval of antidrug communications. These two beliefs, along with perceived behavioral control, predicted parents' intentions to discuss drugs with their children. Parental intentions to discuss drugs reported at Round 1 were associated with youth's report of actual drug communication with their parents at Round 2. Frequency and breadth of the topics in parent-child drug communication were associated with less positive attitudes toward marijuana use among youth who spoke with their parents. Together, the child's attitudes toward marijuana use and perceived ability to refuse marijuana use predicted youth's intentions to use marijuana. The proposed model fit well with the data and was replicated in a parallel analysis of the data from Rounds 3 and 4. Implications for future antidrug media campaign efforts are discussed.

AB  - While the selfie has come to symbolize notions of selfhood in the age of social media, the photograph that has become a visual trope across the Facebook accounts of lower-middle-class young men in the western Indian city of Pune offers a different reading of online selfhood. In this article, I discuss the creation of a localized selfie-the "professional selfie"-in which young men stage their masculinity by engaging in a mimetic economy of exchanging characteristics with film heroes. In contrast to Susan Sontag's (2003) theorization of the intimate photograph, the professional selfie is devoid of interiority. Far from unaware of the camera in the manner described by Sontag, young men in Pune utilize the services of photographers to capture them at a distance and conceal their surroundings, thereby creating relations of social distance and distinction with their peers on Facebook.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential to improve diagnostics of various diseases, especially for early detection of skin cancer. Studies have yet to investigate the clear application of AI technology in clinical practice or determine the added value for younger user groups. Translation of AI-based diagnostic tools can only be successful if they are accepted by potential users. Young adults as digital natives may offer the greatest potential for successful implementation of AI into clinical practice, while at the same time, representing the future generation of skin cancer screening participants.
   Objective: We conducted an anonymous online survey to examine how and to what extent individuals are willing to accept AI-based mobile apps for skin cancer diagnostics. We evaluated preferences and relative influences of concerns, with a focus on younger age groups.
   Methods: We recruited participants below 35 years of age using three social media channels-Facebook, LinkedIn, and Xing. Descriptive analysis and statistical tests were performed to evaluate participants' attitudes toward mobile apps for skin examination. We integrated an adaptive choice-based conjoint to assess participants' preferences. We evaluated potential concerns using maximum difference scaling.
   Results: We included 728 participants in the analysis. The majority of participants (66.5%, 484/728; 95% CI 0.631-0.699) expressed a positive attitude toward the use of AI-based apps. In particular, participants residing in big cities or small towns (P=.02) and individuals that were familiar with the use of health or fitness apps (P=.02) were significantly more open to mobile diagnostic systems. Hierarchical Bayes estimation of the preferences of participants with a positive attitude (n=484) revealed that the use of mobile apps as an assistance system was preferred. Participants ruled out app versions with an accuracy of <= 65%, apps using data storage without encryption, and systems that did not provide background information about the decision-making process. However, participants did not mind their data being used anonymously for research purposes, nor did they object to the inclusion of clinical patient information in the decision-making process. Maximum difference scaling analysis for the negative-minded participant group (n=244) showed that data security, insufficient trust in the app, and lack of personal interaction represented the dominant concerns with respect to app use.
   Conclusions: The majority of potential future users below 35 years of age were ready to accept AI-based diagnostic solutions for early detection of skin cancer. However, for translation into clinical practice, the participants'demands for increased transparency and explainability of AI-based tools seem to be critical. Altogether, digital natives between 18 and 24 years and between 25 and 34 years of age expressed similar preferences and concerns when compared both to each other and to results obtained by previous studies that included other age groups.

AB  - Although past work suggests that having a parasocial relationship with a celebrity can affect attitudes toward that celebrity, no work has yet examined if people are consciously aware that this is occurring and if this can explain the effects of Twitter on attitudes about Donald Trump. The current research examined the psychological mechanisms and attitudinal consequences of engaging with Donald Trump on Twitter and the degree to which people were consciously aware of the effects of their parasocial bond on their attitudes. Across an experiment (N = 243) and two correlational studies (N = 373; N = 384), we found that participants with preexisting political attitudes similar to Trump's showed increased liking of Trump with exposure to his Twitter feed. Those effects were mediated by a parasocial bond. In other words, when people with a political ideology similar to Trump's read his Twitter feed, they felt like they knew him personally (i.e., formed a parasocial relationship with him), which predicted them liking him even more. Conversely, people with political ideologies not similar to Trump's liked him less when exposed to his tweets. Importantly, individuals were unaware that engaging with Trump on Twitter was affecting their views of him. Implications for how the unconscious formation of parasocial relationships may affect attitude polarization and political processes in the modem world are discussed.

AB  - Digital technologies and social media platforms have been used in museum communication for over a decade now, and Holocaust museums have increasingly adopted them in their modes of commemoration and provision of educational content. Nevertheless, very limited research has been conducted into the potential of social media as new memory ecologies. In this exploratory study, we conceive social media platforms as socio-technicalecological systems whereby users develop and engage with memory practices of the Holocaust. We adopt a networked socio-ecological approach to analyse how a sample of Holocaust museums (N = 69) develop practices of digital Holocaust memory in social media. The institutions are analysed in terms of "size " (small, medium, or large), how they differ in their attitudes towards these practices, and to what extent they circulate Holocaust memory on social media. The study adopts multiple quantitative approaches and combines the results of a survey with a set of social media metrics analysing how museums engage on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube in terms of generated content, interactivity, popularity, and type of content. Results show that museums have an overall positive attitude towards social media although some concerns were expressed, mostly by smaller institutions; they tend to use mostly Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, and to share educational content and information about the museum's activities. However, despite a tendency to aggregate a large number of fans and followers, especially in the case of larger institutions, interaction with users remains limited. Prospects for more interactive participation and its implications are also discussed.

AB  - Objectives Handwashing is known as the most preventive method for various infectious diseases. Health authorities have conducted various campaigns and public relations targeting the general population but few evaluations of these long-term interventions. This study aimed to investigate the association between experience of educational events or public relations (EXEP), attitude towards the effectiveness of handwashing (AEHW) and handwashing practice (HWP). Setting Using a population-based cross-sectional study with a complex sample design, we explored the response outcomes of handwashing. Those outcomes were collected biennially using Community Health Survey among the years 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. We applied multivariate logistic regression for the association among sociodemographic factors, health conditions, EXEP, AEHW and HWP. Participants Total participants residing in Seoul were 23 139 (men 44.2%), 23 004 (men 44.4%), 22 955 (men 44.8%) and 22 930 (men 43.9%), in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019, respectively. Results Overall, participants with EXEP are more likely to be women, aged between the 30s and 60s, and with a higher educational level. Particularly, participants with EXEP had an increased association with HWP (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.33) and AEHW (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.63). In addition, AEHW also had an increased association with HWP (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.81). The mediated effect of AEHW to HWP is not determined evidently. Conclusion The results showed that EXEP is positively associated with HWP and AEHW among community-dwelling people. Our results confirm that educational activity can lead to more pronounced behavioural changes only when it forms a positive attitude.

AB  - This study assessed factors that determine farm hygiene practices towards preventing and controlling poultry diseases among poultry entrepreneurs in Lagos State, Nigeria. Structured questionnaire was used to obtain data from 148 respondents selected using multistage sampling technique. Results show that respondents' mean age was 48.5years, majority (68.2%) were male, 95.3% were married, 59.5% had secondary education and mean years of farming experience was 18.8years. All the respondents sourced information on hygiene practices from extension agents, family, friends and cooperatives. Electronic media and prints were also used by 96.6%, 47.9%, respectively. The majority (81.8%) of the respondents operate on a government owned land while 10.1% operate on personal land. Majority (77%) periodically clean their poultry pen, 72.9% agreed that quarantine services is of necessity, 80.4% periodically administer vaccines and drugs to prevent diseases in their poultry farms. More so, 98.7% disinfect poultry kits/equipment after use and 91.9% agreed that raw/uncooked poultry products are not good for consumption. Test of significance indicated that respondents' farm hygiene practices was related to educational level (chi(2)=7.96, P <=.05), years of farming experience (beta=-0.87, P <=.05), sources of information (r=-0.21, P <=.05), land ownership type (r=-0.22, P <=.05). It was recommended that public enlightenment and campaign should be strengthened to generally enlighten the public and poultry entrepreneurs specifically towards positive attitudes and handling of poultry products through routine management like regular sanitation, periodic vaccination, poultry house entrance' dips, drug administration and quarantine services towards developing the poultry enterprise.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims at examining the impact that COVID-19 pandemic and its related work implications have on the relationship between lean implementation and service performance. Design/methodology/approach The author surveyed service organizations that have been implementing lean for at least two years and remotely maintained their activities during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate data techniques were applied to analyze the dataset. This study was grounded on sociotechnical systems theory. Findings The findings indicate that organizations that have been implementing lean services more extensively are also more likely to benefit from the effects that the COVID-19 had on work environments, especially in the case of home office. Nevertheless, social distancing does not appear to mediate the effects of lean services on both quality and delivery performances. Originality/value Since the pandemic is a recent phenomenon with unprecedented effects, this research is an initial effort to determine the effect the pandemic has on lean implementation and services' performance, providing both theoretical and practical contributions to the field.

AB  - Introduction: Most children with haemophilia in Japan study in mainstream schools. However, many mothers have difficulty deciding whether to inform teachers of their child's haemophilia because of the accompanying potential discrimination and prejudice, particularly after the press coverage on the HIV scandal in the 1980s. Aims: We therefore aim to explore and describe disclosure strategies of mothers of children with haemophilia. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using the modified grounded theory approach to explore disclosure strategies of mothers of children with haemophilia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 selected mothers (12 children were HIV positive and 7 were HIV-negative). Results: In the pre-HIV/AIDS crisis period, the kind of strategy employed -full disclosure, conditional full disclosure and partial disclosure - depended on the extent of mothers' fears about mainstream schools refusing admission because of their child's haemophilia. After the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s in Japan, the three categories of strategies employed by mothers of children with haemophilia were limited disclosure, non-disclosure and full disclosure. These depended on mothers' expectations of discrimination towards their child because of the social stigma around haemophilia and being HIV-positive. Conclusion: For children with haemophilia to feel safe attending school, public schools must establish care management and anti-discrimination systems for children with chronic diseases, thus assuring parents of their children's welfare at school.

AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n = 115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n = 74), Hispanic/Latina (n = 52), and African American (n = 42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.

AB  - Evaluating spatial inequalities using a single walking accessibility measure is quite challenging. In response, the paper proposes combining two accessibility measures (real and potential) to provide additional insights into the identification and mapping of spatial inequalities. The municipality of Getafe in the Madrid Metropolitan Area, Spain serves as a case study. A questionnaire, administered via face-to-face interviews, recorded the resident's walking preferences for reaching in-store retail. A gravity-based model was used to calculate real and potential accessibilities, which were combined to map four accessibility places that originate spatial inequalities: advantageous, moderately advantageous, moderately disadvantageous, and disadvantageous. The results suggest that potential accessibility values are higher than real accessibility values, and the final map shows the city centre residents (mostly seniors) benefit from the advantageous accessibility places. Disadvantageous places are mainly found in the city's periphery, where younger people live.

AB  - Selective exposure to likeminded political viewpoints on algorithmic social media platforms is considered a potential source of polarization of public opinion. We still know little about the proposed mechanism or how potential reinforcement of specific attitudes affects citizens' political behavior, especially in a nonelectoral context. Focusing on the issue of immigration during the refugee influx to Europe in autumn 2015, this study investigates the effects of social media usage on attitude reinforcement, connecting it to political participation in refugee-related activities. A panel study conducted among Danish citizens (n= 847) reveals that frequent social media usage reinforces existing attitudes and mobilizes political participation. However, citizens who become more extreme in their attitude toward immigration over time are found to be less likely to become politically active regarding this specific issue.

AB  - In early 2020, the unforeseen COVID-19 has brought the art world to its knees, particularly the contemporary art scene needs viewers and feedback to survive. Artists require new channels connecting them with their audiences, while artists' work needs to be seen and appreciated by the public to sustain its value. In the face of social distancing restrictions and limited visitors, however, many international exhibitions are forced to cancel or postponed. With less to no patronage, will the global pandemic bring the end of the art world? As the global pandemic has forced most social and cultural events moving online, the art biennials are no exception. This article examines the art biennial, the Olympics of the art world, to rediscover the meaning of 'art' before and after COVID-19. Integrating virtual presenta-tion and digital campaign between the Taipei Biennial and the Shanghai Biennale, the first running art biennials across the Taiwan Strait, this article analyses and presents the art world's potential shifts in the post-pandemic future.

AB  - Breastfeeding is the optimal source of infant nutrition, yet the motherModified Letter Turned Commas decision to breastfeed is complex and influenced by factors including social support and breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes. This study employed a two-group pretest-posttest design to examine whether brief, online video presentations (<2.5 minutes in length) could improve breastfeeding knowledge and attitude among males and compare the outcomes between a knowledge-based and attitude-based intervention. Collegiate male participants (N = 213, 18-40 years of age) demonstrated high breastfeeding exposure (90.1% had friends/family breastfeed) and positive attitudes (89.2% accepted women could breastfeed and work outside home) yet knowledge deficits concerning breastfeeding health benefits were identified. Breastfeeding exposure was positively associated with baseline attitude (r(212)=.186, p = .006 and knowledge (r(212)=.229, p = .001. Both intervention groups reported similar gains in attitude scores; only the knowledge-based intervention reported significant gains in knowledge (M = 1.5, SD = 2.63 vs M = -.07, SD = 1.44, (t = -5.496, df = 211, p < .05). Brief online video presentations may constitute an additional exposure to or nudging toward breastfeeding, and breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes can be positively influenced in young adult males with similar interventions that are affordable and require a minimal time commitment.

AB  - Introduction: Sub-Saharan Africa has a high burden of breast cancer and very low rates of breast reconstruction. This study aimed to determine the awareness of and attitude to breast reconstruction among women with breast cancer who had mastectomy. Methods: A cross-sectional study of women with breast cancer who underwent mastectomy was done. Participants were recruited from September 2020 to January 2021 from the surgical oncology and radio-oncology outpatient clinics of the University College Hospital, Ibadan. A multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of awareness and attitudes to breast reconstruction. P <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Fifty-one women participated in the study. The mean age was 54.76 (+9.94) years. Most, 30 (58.8%) of them had tertiary level of education, were working, 39 (76.5%) and were married, 41 (80%). Funding for the mastectomies was mainly out-of-pocket 34 (66.7%). Most 37 (72.5%) were not aware that the breast could be reconstructed before their surgery and only one (1.96%) of the women had breast reconstruction. The reason most proffered for declining breast reconstruction was not wanting another surgery 13 (33.3%). The age (odds ratio [OR] 0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.001-0.33), P = 0.006 of the participants and the educational status (OR 12.50, 95% CI 1.86-84.26), P = 0.009 were significant predictors of awareness of breast reconstruction. None of the variables were significant predictors of positive attitudes to breast reconstruction. Conclusion: There is a very low level of awareness of breast reconstruction. Younger age and tertiary education were significant predictors of awareness of breast reconstruction.

AB  - Background: Birth of a child is of great importance in a family. Child health depends upon the fulfillment of nutritional needs that includes breast feeding and weaning. Weaning is the beginning of semisolid food in infant's diet who is consuming milk to meet his nutritional needs. Breast milk is a good source of nutrition for the first six months of child's life, but then again weaning is also essential as the child is in the growing stage.
   Methods: Descriptive analytical design was used in this study. The study was conducted in the area of Mohnalwal Lahore. All mothers in the reproductive age group 18-49 year were the source population. Data was collected through the administration of self-administered close ended questionnaire. Regression analysis through SPSS was applied to find out the association between variables.
   Results: The Majority (85.7%) of the mother's of the community were educated and only 14.3% of mothers had no formal education. 81.9% of the husbands were educated whereas 18% had no formal education. The main source of this knowledge was friends and family with 27.8% and Health worker / Hospitals with 21.8% whereas, 16.5% of the mother's had knowledge of weaning from TV and media and only 7 mothers had the knowledge of weaning
   Conclusions: Majority of the mothers had knowledge about weaning and was practicing correct weaning practices. Majority of the mothers started weaning at the recommended age of 4 to 6 months and the commonly used weaning diet was rice, rusk / biscuits or mashed fruits / veg. most of the mothers of Mohnalwal show a positive attitude towards weaning.

AB  - International crises often influence consumers to reject offerings associated with a hostile country. While research has shown that negative emotions mediate the influence of animosity beliefs on consumer behavior, scholars do not examine the specific influence of different discrete emotions. This study extends prior research by demonstrating that extreme negative emotions of contempt and disgust play a key role in explaining the effects of animosity beliefs on behavior. The strength of these emotions results in a degraded image of the target country that is associated with social exclusion and intergroup hatred. In such circumstances, animosity also reduces product quality perceptions and is extremely difficult to manage. The best strategy is to eliminate any connection between the country of origin and the relevant offering. The findings of this study suggest that rather than assessing negative emotions in general, managers should consider the specific emotional reactions elicited by the country under examination.

AB  - One of the biggest barriers in treating adolescents with mental health problems is their refusing to seek psychological help. This study was designed to examine the relationships between two forms of perfectionism, self-concealment and attitudes toward seeking psychological help and to test the mediating role of self-concealment in the relationship between perfectionism and attitudes toward seeking psychological help among Malaysian high school students. The participants were 475 Malaysian high school students from four high schools in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Structural equation modelling results indicated that high school students with high levels of socially prescribed perfectionism, high levels of self-concealment, and low levels of self-oriented perfectionism reported negative attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Bootstrapping analysis showed that self-concealment emerged as a significant, full mediator in the link between socially prescribed perfectionism and attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Moderated mediation analysis also examined whether the results generalized across men and women. The results revealed that male students with socially prescribed perfectionism are more likely to engage in self-concealment, which in turn, leads to negative attitudes toward seeking psychological help more than their female counterparts. The results suggested that students high in socially prescribed perfectionism were more likely to engage in self-concealment and be less inclined to seek psychological help.

AB  - In pandemic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals' behavior has a strong impact on epidemiological processes. Compliance with prevention guidelines, such as social distancing, is critical to avoid further spreading an infectious disease or to slow down its spread. However, some individuals also or instead engage in panic behavior, such as hoarding. We investigate how education prepares individuals to respond adequately by modelling the path from seeking information about COVID-19 to eventual behavior. Based on a sample of N = 1182 adult Americans, gathered at the pandemic's onset (March 2020), we conclude that science knowledge helps individuals convert information into coronavirus knowledge. This knowledge then helps individuals avoid panic behavior. Individuals lacking coronavirus knowledge and science knowledge still comply with prevention guidelines when they have a general trust in medicine. Individuals lacking knowledge still follow prevention guidelines when they trust in medicine. Facilitating science knowledge and trust in science through education and targeted public health messaging are likely to be of fundamental importance for bringing crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic under control.

KW  - CONFLICT
AB  - Oxytocin (OT) is known for facilitating interpersonal interactions in favorable conditions. Humor, on the other hand, is an interpersonal phenomenon that reduces social distance. In this study, we investigated whether OT would increase laughing and smiling in a favorable environment. Therefore, participants were asked to view a brief video clip of a comedy television program in the presence of an ingroup member after administration of either OT or a placebo. Results demonstrated that participants in the OT condition exhibited more laughing and smiling behavior over the course of viewing the video compared to participants in the placebo condition. OT, however, neither affected self-reported affect nor perceived funniness of the clip. These findings indicate that OT, a hormone that can bolster attachment, also has the power to facilitate implicit social interactions by promoting visible and audible social signals, but does not affect the socially irrelevant inner cheerfulness.

AB  - Ageism has been generally defined as a prejudice people from a certain age group hold towards other age groups (Butler, 1969; 1975). Although such definitions do not restrict the use of the term to researching prejudices regarding a certain age group, currently ageism is deployed in studies concerning prejudices regarding older people and includes cognitive evaluations (negative stereotypes people might have regarding older people) as well as affective - emotional reactions towards older people, in different instances of daily life. Researchers admit the fact that some of the ageist reactions (both cognitive and emotional) could be captured by implicit measures. Implicit association tests have been used to measure subtle cues of ageism (see Levy & Banaji, 2002) and the validity of these measurements are largely discussed in the international psychological literature (see Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz, 1998; Rudman et al., 1999, for a review). Drawing could also be used as a tool to research implicit ageism, though it has been approached to a lesser extend to research on ageism (see for example Barrett & Cantwell, 2007). In the current research, we employ the drawing technique on a sample of undergraduate students from a public university (N-165) to assess their visual representations of older people. Examining the features of the drawing allows us to talk about implicit ageism and the way the drawing tool could be a valid tool to examine implicit ageism.

AB  - Fictional narratives can have strong effects on people's real world opinions, attitudes, and behavior. Given the far-reaching implications these effects may have, understanding when and how narratives can have such effects is important. One frequent claim about narrative impact is that stories can disable people's ability to critically evaluate the issue. In an experiment, optimal conditions were created to assess whether readers came up with issue-relevant thoughts and to what extent such thoughts influenced the participants' attitude. The impact of issue-relevant thoughts was compared to that of another mechanism of narrative persuasion: identification. Participants (N=138) read a story including a discussion scene on a personally relevant issue. The manipulation consisted of the main character being in favor of or against a certain issue. Participants identified more strongly with the main character than with the antagonist A mediation analysis revealed that identifying with the character being in favor of the issue yielded a more positive attitude toward the issue. A considerable number of participants generated issue-relevant thoughts that proved predictive of the attitude. The experiment provides further evidence for the identification mechanism while revealing insights into how integration of explicit argumentative content into a narrative can influence issue-relevant thinking.

KW  - NAMAQUALAND
AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the debates on communal rangelands and analyses the gendered dimension of land rights and land access in the rural areas of Namaqualand. The actual gender relations within rural communities and the emergence of strategies that are being pursued in communal land processes are obscured and often ignored in policies about communal rangelands, which overemphasise 'the ecological and economic impact' and the balancing of these dimensions. As active, primary users, women play a central role in livelihoods supported by communal rangelands yet their access to land is mediated through their relationships with men, effectively circumventing women's land autonomy. A wider debate is necessary to advance the largely superficial policy considerations of women's position in relation to communal rangelands land and their social exclusion on the basis of traditional control of land, forms of access and claiming of use rights. The paper discusses the complexity of land rights under communal land tenure and argues that, despite traditional and policy barriers, women in traditional systems of male-dominated land rights have had some success in accessing communal rangelands. Greater policy impetus is necessary to leverage equitable and independent land access for women amidst debates about management of communal rangelands.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic, social distancing, and lockdown measures have had an impact on employee well-being. This study uses Latent Profile Analysis to examine subjective well-being among employees during the first lockdown based on a cross-national survey in UK and France (n = 652). We identify five distinct well-being profiles, namely Moderately positive (67%), Languishing (18%), Flourishing (8%), Mixed feelings (4%), and Apathetic (3%). The results showed that while some employees were suffering, others managed to thrive and cope with the stresses of the lockdown. We also found that the profiles could be distinguished by perceived changes in financial situation and physical health as well as experienced boredom. Our study complements prior studies that examine the relations between individual characteristics and well-being during the pandemic on a general level by showing that employee well-being under lockdown is not the same across the board.

AB  - Research Aims - This study proposes to fill the gap in entrepreneurship literature by focusing on the relationship between entrepreneurs' psychological capital and growth intention mediated by their work performance.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - This research used cross-sectional quantitative research and employed convenience sampling technique. A total of 275 Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) entrepreneurs participated and answered the survey questionnaires.
   Research Findings - The findings confirmed the direct relationships between psychological capital and work performance; and psychological capital and growth intention of entrepreneurs. However, this study found no mediating effect of work performance in the relationship between psychological capital and growth intention of the entrepreneurs.
   Theoretical Contribution/Originality - This study enhanced the understanding on the importance of psychological capital as influential psychological resource for entrepreneurs as it has positive effects on attitudes and their work performance. These findings advocate the inclusion of psychological capital in entrepreneurial studies as important resource for work performance improvement and positive attitudes.
   Managerial Implications in the Southeast Asian Context - The government and SMEs supporting agencies need to give attention to psychological capital in their entrepreneurship development policy and programmes. Further, universities and training providers should also focus on psychological capital resources in entrepreneurial education and training modules.
   Research Limitations and Implications - This study is confined to Malaysian SME entrepreneurs only and uses convenient sampling technique. Therefore, generalization of the findings is limited. Future research can investigate the related variables in different countries and contexts to examine the importance of psychological capital in entrepreneurial setting.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has become a world problem now. The pandemic has affeected a lot of core sectors including the education sector. Students are not able to go to school to study and have to do a social distancing by staying at home. What the government did so that students will still be able to study at home is by developing a long-distance learning media. In this research, we will get to know more about how students in China learn mathematics at home and their learning attitude towards the learning video. This research will use a qualitative and quantitative research method. The researchers gave out questionnaires to 408 students in Guangxi province, China. The researchers also did an interview on the parents and students to know the advantages and disadvantages of using the learning video during this covid-19 pandemic. The research result shows that there is a good student learning attidude towards the learning video. Students feel that the learning video is very interesting yet effective as they were able to understand the concept taught.

AB  - To date, adolescents have occupied prominent positions in all three of Alice Rohrwacher's feature films - from her debut Corpo celeste (Heavenly Bodies) (2011a), to the critically acclaimed Le meraviglie (The Wonders) (2014) and, finally, to her latest work Lazzaro felice (Happy as Lazzaro) (2018). Being neither children nor adults, teenagers inhabit a biologically and ideologically ambiguous position within society, a precarious collocation that has often been referred to as 'liminal'. In her films, Rohrwacher enhances her characters' inherent liminality by (dis-)placing them, both physically and metaphorically, at the margins of society. However, it is their spatial and social exclusion and their position of subordination to power that allows them to identify alternative behaviours that oppose the dominant ideology within their social environments. Making use of the notions of marginality and liminality, this article explores the implications of the director's employment of adolescent characters to critique Italian mainstream society.

AB  - Background The frequency of self-reported food sensitivity (SFS) is increasing, and has a negative impact on the well-being and everyday functioning of the affected people. A considerable proportion of SFS cannot be medically explained. The lack of knowledge of its origin and treatment causes further stress in those affected.
   Purpose This study aims to get a better understanding of the psychological background of the condition.
   Methods A non-representative community sample (N=335; age: 35.1 +/- 13.18 yrs; 75.8% female) completed an English on-line questionnaire assessing somatosensory amplification, health anxiety, modern health worries (MHWs), beliefs concerning the scientific validity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), holistic beliefs on health and illness.
   Results In multiple binary logistic regression analyses, SFS were associated with CAM related beliefs, somatosensory amplification, and health anxiety after controlling for age and gender. The connection between somatosensory amplification and SFS were completely mediated by health anxiety. No differences between the two groups were found with respect to MHWs, worries about the harmful effects of various artificial components in food, and holistic health beliefs. Discussion: More positive attitudes toward CAM might be based on the lack of conventional treatment, rather than on higher levels of MHWs or a more holistic worldview. Both the existence of symptoms and the presence of health anxiety might be needed for the development and maintenance of SFS.
   Conclusions The findings support the notion that somatosensory amplification and health anxiety might play a role in the development and maintenance of SFS.

AB  - Background Events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as physical distancing, closure of community services, postponement of health appointments, and loss of employment can lead to social isolation, financial uncertainty, and interruption of antiretroviral adherence, resulting in additional health-related challenges (disability) experienced among adults living with chronic illness such as HIV. 'Living strategies' is a concept derived from the perspectives of people living with HIV, defined as behaviors, attitudes and beliefs adopted by people living with HIV to help deal with disability associated with HIV and multi-morbidity. Our aim was to describe disability among adults living with HIV and self-care living strategies used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Adults living with HIV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, including some with pre-pandemic HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) data, completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between June-August 2020. The survey included the HDQ and questions about self-care living strategy use during the pandemic. We compared disability (HDQ) scores prior to versus during the pandemic using paired t-tests. We reported the proportion of participants who engaged in various living strategies at least 'a few times a week' or 'everyday' during the pandemic. Results Of the 63 respondents, 84% were men, median age 57 years, and 62% lived alone. During the pandemic the greatest disability severity was in the uncertainty [median 30; Interquartile range (IQR): 16, 43] and mental-emotional (25; IQR: 14, 41) domains. Among the 51 participants with pre-pandemic data, HDQ severity scores were significantly greater (worse) during the pandemic (vs prior) in all domains. Greatest change from prior to during the pandemic was in the mental-emotional domain for presence (17.7; p < 0.001), severity (11.4; p < 0.001), and episodic nature (9.3; p < 0.05) of disability. Most participants (> 60%) reported engaging a 'few times a week' or 'everyday' in self-care strategies associated with maintaining sense of control and adopting positive attitudes and beliefs. Conclusions People living with HIV reported high levels of uncertainty and mental-emotional health challenges during the pandemic. Disability increased across all HDQ dimensions, with the greatest worsening in the mental-emotional health domain. Results provide an understanding of disability and self-care strategy use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Introduction: For ophthalmologic research, the systematic correlation of clinical data with data obtained from postmortem tissue donation is of great benefit. In this respect, the establishment of an eye donation registry represents a prerequisite for the acquisition of such data. Methods: A total of 300 patients were interviewed at a tertiary referral center in Germany by means of a standardized questionnaire. Binary questions were evaluated by percentage; Likert-scaled questions (1 = does apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the median and 25th (Q(25)) and 75th (Q(75)) percentiles. Results: The majority of patients (77.0%) would agree to donate their eyes for research purposes. When asked about reasons against an eye donation, 60.9% of all patients only stated reasons in the category "addressable" (e.g., not enough awareness of the topic). The vast majority of patients considered it appropriate for an ophthalmologist to approach them on the issue of postmortem eye donation (median 1, Q(25) 1, Q(75) 1). Conclusion: Overall, patients had a positive attitude towards postmortem eye donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons given against postmortem eye donation were often related to misconceptions and were potentially addressable. These results underline the fundamental willingness of ophthalmological patients in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research purposes.

AB  - Background Complementary and alternative veterinary medicine (CAVM) is becoming increasingly popular in horses.
   Methods Online, cross-sectional survey in 1532 horse owners. Attitude towards CAVM, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention for future CAVM use were measured based on the theory of planned behaviour. Structural equation modelling was performed to characterize factors influencing intention to use CAVM.
   Results Past use of CAVM, predominantly manual therapies and herbal supplements, was reported by 72.5% of all participants. Frequently reported indications were improving horse's well-being, illness which did not resolve after conventional treatment and chronic illness. The attitude towards CAVM was positive with a median (interquartile range) score of 6 of 7 (4.75-7.00). Predictors for past CAVM use were higher owner age, alternative medicine self-use and higher education (non-university). The strongest predictor of future CAVM usage was perceived behavioural control and perceived CAVM efficacy, as well as positive attitude towards and perceived knowledge about CAVM. The veterinarian was reported as a source of information about CAVM by 86.4% of all participants.
   Conclusions Horse owners showed a high intention to use CAVM with the owners' perceived behavioural control and perceived CAVM efficacy as the strongest predictor. Veterinarian-client communication is important to inform horse owners correctly.

AB  - Despite the rise of interest in nonprofit organizations' (NPOs) retention strategies and organizational behaviour micro-mechanisms, little research has specifically addressed volunteers' religiosity and attitude towards the organization, and their links to motivation and intention to stay with NPOs. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of religiosity as an antecedent of volunteers' intention to stay with the organization, and the mediating role of both volunteers' motivation and attitude towards the organization in such a relationship. Building on motivational functions theory and the theory of planned behaviour, a conceptual model is proposed and empirically tested using bootstrapped multiple mediation analysis on a sample of 379 volunteers of NPOs located in Italy. The results support the role of religiosity as a significant predictor of volunteer intentions, and the mediating role of motivation and attitude on this relationship. Volunteers who are driven by their religious values are likely to develop a stronger motivation to volunteering and a positive attitude towards NPOs' activities, and consequently a stronger willingness to stay with the organization. The study contributes to the literature on NPOs by stressing the role of antecedents and underlying mechanisms affecting volunteers' motivation and, in turn, their intention to stay with the organization.

AB  - Mobile touch screen device (MTSDs) use is becoming widespread in children and has negative and positive consequences. Yet, factors associated with greater use remain unexplored, despite the importance of their identification for intervention purposes. It stands to reason that parents can influence child MTSD use, via their attitudes, beliefs, role-modelling, and style of parenting. Here, we examined the associations between these parental characteristics and child MTSD use and whether parenting styles specifically with regard to child MTSD use exist. Hungarian parents (N = 1283) were surveyed about their children's digital activities, their own attitudes and beliefs regarding the child's MTSD use, and their own attachment to- and use of mobile phones. Taking a data-driven approach, distinct "digital parenting styles" were identified and these resembled general parenting styles. Findings further suggested that children spent more time with MTSD use if their parents: were more permissive, more authoritative and less authoritarian; had a lower educational level; exhibited greater attachment to their mobile phones; and had more positive attitudes towards, and attributed less harm and more benefits to, early device use. These results are the first evidence for existence of digital parenting styles and suggest that parental characteristics are potential prevention and treatment targets.

AB  - Little is known about the extent to which evidence-based prevention topics are taught in medical school. All class of 2003 medical students (n = 2316) at 16 US schools were eligible to complete three questionnaires: at the beginning of first and third years and in their senior year, with 80.3% responding. We queried these students about 21 preventive medicine topics, concerning the extent of their training and their patient counseling frequency at some of these time points. At the beginning of the third year, self-reported extensive training was low for all preventive medicine topics (range 7-26%). USPSTF-recommended topics received more curricular time (median for topics: 36% if recommended versus 24.5% if not, P = 0.025), as did topics addressed through testing rather than through discussion (median for topics: 37% for testing and 25% for discussion, P = 0.005). Extensive training was always associated with higher counseling frequency, and intention to go into primary care, female gender, a positive attitude toward prevention and positive personal health habits were associated with higher counseling frequency. Although some bemoan the overall low levels of US medical students' prevention-related training and practice, we demonstrate that at least they are preferentially evidence-based, a novel and encouraging finding for preventionists.

AB  - (T)here is a paucity of research exploring patients' and their informal carers' experience of coping with and factors impacting on the lung cancer experience. This study aims to explore how patients and their informal carers cope with a diagnosis of lung cancer and describe the key factors that mediate distress in this population in order that they may be better supported in the future. This was a qualitative study employing semi-structured interviews and framework analysis to elicit the experience of 37 patients with lung cancer and 23 primary carers regarding their coping with and factors influencing patient/carer distress. The findings illustrate that participants used both emotional-and problem-focused coping strategies, including accepting the reality of lung cancer, adopting a positive attitude/fighting spirit, denial, avoidance and distraction and information seeking. Maintaining normality was also important. Key factors that mediate the lung cancer experience were also identified including hope, social network, prior experience of cancer and other chronic illnesses, the competing coping strategies of patients and their primary carers, the unpredictable nature of patients' behaviour, changing symptomatology, the perceived attitudes of health professionals and the impact of perceived delays in diagnosis. This study provides important insights into how patients with lung cancer and their primary carers might be better supported.

AB  - This article examines how specialist music secondary schools in England present themselves on their websites and social media platforms. We consider visual communication codes and how such patterns reflect cultural distinctions and social boundaries. Multimodal critical discourse analysis is used to demonstrate how the choice of semiotic resources convey the meaning of specialisation in a socially exclusive manner. Although the schools in question use different resources, similarities in function can be noted in their self-promotion. A school's social matrix and use of classical aesthetics are conveyed through non-verbal, visual communication. An elite code associates advanced musical training with certain principles of behaviour and social values. Those, in turn, represent class-based distinctions, cultural boundaries, and characteristics of privileged education.

AB  - Background: Students need to practice their hands-on skills when they are young to develop confidence for their future careers. Nowadays, iSTEAM (integrated science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) contests provide opportunities for participants to experience meaningful and challenging hands-on tasks that may foster learning, and to generate positive attitudes that may enhance their self-confidence in their ability to make miniature models.
   Purpose: To understand the relations between mastery orientation of hands-on tasks, hands-on making interest, engagement, and self-confidence enhancement in an iSTEAM (integrated science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) contest.
   Sample: The sample consisted of 212 junior high students including 131 males and 81 females who were preparing to join the iSTEAM contest.
   Design and Method: Data were collected from 212 questionnaires and subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling using AMOS 20.
   Results: The results indicated that mastery orientation of hands-on tasks was positively related to hands-on making interest and engagement. Engagement was positively related to hands-on making interest, and hands-on making interest and engagement were positively related to self-confidence enhancement.
   Conclusions: Students with high levels of mastery orientation might gain higher self-confidence, mediated by their interest and engagement in a science and technology hands-on making contest.

AB  - This study addresses, on the basis of ethnographic, folkloric, linguistic, and field data, the role of cattle in Buryat myths and rites, with reference to their economic significance. Buryat words relating to the exteriors of animals, sex differences, etc. are listed The bull image features in traditional Buryat systems of time calculation and in the tradition olgiving protective names homonymical to words denoting the bull are described Mythological beliefs concerning the cattle are analyzed. The Bulagats, a major Buryat subgroup, practiced the tribal cult ofBukha-noyon, to whom the bull alluded. This practice was connected with the idea of shape-shilling, whereby the bull symbolized the male principle. In terms of cosmogony, the bull was part of habitation spheres such as sky, earth, and water, and their elements such as celestial bodies and mountains, and fire. The positive attitude to the bull and the cow was mirrored by views regarding supernatural properties ofbull hair and urine, cow's milk and placenta, and devices used for managing draft bulls (the yoke and the hair rope zele). At the same time, the cattle were associated with the Lower World and its inhabitants; they functioned as mediators and could symbolize death. A detailed description of the bull image in traditional Buryat ritualism is provided.

AB  - Several studies have shed light on factors that contribute to radicalization. However, fewer studies have addressed the factors that contribute to deradicalization, especially with terrorist detainees as participants. The present study investigates the role of attitudes toward rehabilitation in deradicalization programs, and its role in predicting the outcome for these programs. We hypothesized that when terrorist detainees adopt alternative identities (identities alternative to their jihadist identity), their support for jihad as war will be lessened, even when they still hold jihadist ideology as their source of significance. To test this hypothesis, we obtained 89 interview profiles of actual terrorist detainees across 35 Indonesian prisons. We found that lesser support for jihad as war was predicted by a more positive attitude toward the deradicalization program, and this was mediated by the adoption of alternative identities. Further, the effect of the mediator on support for jihad as war was neither weakened nor strengthened by perceived significance of jihadist ideology. These findings suggest that even when a person possesses a strong ideological commitment to jihad, this may not manifest into violence when they adopt alternative identities and goals. These results were interpreted and discussed through goal systems theory and the multifinality account of radical behavior.

AB  - Background: Sexuality in later life may be compromised by restrictive attitudes, and lack of knowledge among professionals. This study examined social work students' attitudes and knowledge towards sexuality and sexual expression in later life and investigated associated factors.
   Method: Undergraduate social work students from Israel (n = 375) completed the Attitudes and Knowledge towards Older Adult's Sexuality Scale and questionnaires regarding contacts and exposure to older adults, prior sexual education and sociodemographic.
   Results: Attitudes and knowledge were correlated. First year students were the most conservative and demonstrated the least knowledge. No differences were found between men and women regarding attitude. However, men and married students had greater knowledge regarding older adults' sexuality than women or non-married students did. Increased religious observance predicted more conservative attitudes. Age predicted more permissive attitudes and greater knowledge about sexuality in later life. A mediating process examined, suggested knowledge is a mediator variable between age and attitudes towards older adults' sexuality.
   Conclusion: As the population in Israel and in Western countries ages, it is important to examine the knowledge and attitudes of social work students regarding older adults' sexuality and to develop educational and interventional programs aimed at increasing awareness, knowledge, and positive attitudes in this area.

AB  - In recent years, digital health care and social welfare services have been spreading rapidly and partly replacing face-to-face services, particularly in developed countries. This may lead to a pronounced digital inequality. This population-based study of Finnish adults (N = 4495) examined the associations of offline resources with perceived benefits from online services and the mediating effects of access, skills and attitudes in these associations. The results indicated that those with lower personal, economic and social offline resources perceived online services as less beneficial. This was largely explained by poor access to the services, poor digital skills and negative attitudes towards online services. To increase equality, it would be important to improve Internet access and digital skills and implement means to address negative attitudes, especially among vulnerable groups. Moreover, online health and social welfare services should be designed to be more inclusive.

AB  - Social media influencers are increasingly employed as product endorsers, and a growing body of academic research confirms that influencers are an effective advertising instrument. However, more research is needed on the specific influencer characteristics driving this success, and the processes responsible for these effects. In this study, we investigated to what extent product-influencer fit and number of followers interact in contributing to positive advertising outcomes and influencer evaluations. Moreover, we investigated to what extent perceived credibility of the influencer and identification with the influencer mediate these relationships. We conducted a 2 (poor vs. good product-influencer fit) X 2 (moderate vs. high number of followers) between-subjects experiment among 432 Dutch Instagram users. Participants were exposed to Instagram posts of health and fitness influencers who endorsed either a protein shake (good-fit) or ice cream (poor-fit). Results showed that fit and number of followers seem to work in tandem: although influencers with a high number of followers are liked more, and their endorsements result in a more positive attitude toward both the ad and product, and a greater likelihood to buy the advertised product as compared to influencers with a moderate number of followers, the endorsed product should fit the influencer's self-branded image for these positive effects to occur. Moreover, effects were all mediated by perceived credibility and identification, which appear to be important drivers of influencer endorsement effects. Together, our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the processes driving audience responses to influencer marketing, and provide clear guidelines for practitioners.

AB  - Our study evaluates the role of exposure to COVID-19 messaging in negativity towards COVID-19 and the intentions to engage in protective behaviors. Building on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), we derive a mediation model and test it in a sample of 737 participants (556 Romanians and 181 Kazakhs). The exposure to general information concerning COVID-19 positively predicts negative attitudes, negative emotions and the emergence of subjective norms in relation to COVID-19, as well as the likelihood of engaging in protective behavioral intentions. The exposure to humoristic communication, however, diluted the positive association between exposure to general information and negative attitudes, as well as negative emotions. The results support the overall predictions of the TPB and report positive associations between negative attitudes towards COVID-19, subjective norms and behavioral control on the one hand, and protective behavioral intentions on the other. Negative emotions significantly predict the likelihood of engaging in protective behaviors. Our results also show that older respondents tend to develop more negative attitudes towards COVID-19, yet they do not report stronger intentions to engage in protective behaviors than younger respondents. An important emergent result shows that time lapse seems to increase negativity towards COVID-19, yet it does not directly increase the likelihood of engaging in protective behaviors. Implications for public health communication related to COVID-19 are discussed.

AB  - The Trojan Hose Affair scandal alleged that there was a hardline extremist Islamism plot to take over British state schools in Birmingham. While community groups and government officials battled to take control of the narrative, the pupils who were ultimately at the center of the scandal, were not considered. This paper is based on research conducted in 2015, with students at one of the schools implicated in the Trojan Horse Affair. Through seven one-to-one interviews and a group discussion, the research finds that students portrayed their selves in a state of constant psychological reconciliation due to the heightened mediatization, racialization, and securitization of Islam and Muslims, during and after the Trojan Horse affair. This caused increased levels of anxiety in students, which peaked around the constant surveillance through the gaze of the media, teachers, and Ofsted inspectors, creating a double-edged Panopticon. The paper particularly underscores student concerns for potential social exclusion and discrimination they may experience as a result of the school affiliation.

AB  - The coronavirus disease Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is exacting a huge toll on individuals, families, communities, and societies across the world. The study of public communication is a key aspect for slowing the spread of the virus and therefore reducing the death rate. This article analyses political leaders' crisis communication during the Covid-19 pandemic of the most affected European countries, Boris Johnson (United Kingdom), Emmanuel Macron (France), Pedro Sanchez (Spain) and Giuseppe Conte (Italy), in addition to Tedros Adhanom as a representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Ursula Von der Leyen President of the European Union (EU). The study focuses on the visual information (images and videos) published in their Twitter profiles, with the aim of highlighting the strategies of recommendations by health authorities during the first 40 days of the pandemic. After analysis of the visual content of 634 tweets, the results show significant differences amongst the preventative measures recommended (social distancing, use of masks, hand washing, etc.) and the public image projected by the leaders in their Twitter profiles.

AB  - Online media offer unprecedented access to digital public spheres, largely enhancing users' opportunities for participation and providing new means for strengthening democratic discourse. At the same time, the last decades have demonstrated that online discourses are often characterised by so-called 'dark participation' the spreading of lies and incivility. Using 'problematic behaviour theory' as framework and focusing on incivility as a specific form of dark participation, this article investigates the role of users' personal characteristics, media use, and online experiences in relation to offensive and hateful online behaviour. Using a random-quota survey of the German population, we explored how dark personality traits, political attitudes and emotions, the frequency and spaces of online-media use, and users' experiences with both civil and uncivil online discourses predicted participants own uncivil behaviour, such as posting, sharing, or liking uncivil content. We found that 46% of the participants who had witnessed incivility in the last three months also engaged in uncivil participation. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that incivility was associated with manipulative personality traits as measured by the dark triad, right-wing populist voting intentions, and frequent social-media use. Experiences with both civil comments and hate speech predicted higher levels of uncivil participation. The strongest predictor was participants' personal experiences with online victimisation. Overall, the results confirmed that dark participation in the sense of uncivil engagement results from the interplay of personality traits, an online environment that allows for deviant engagement, and, most importantly, participants' experiences in said environment.

AB  - There is much discussion about the potential negative effects of social media use on people?s political attitudes. But, does social media use shape trust in government? We use evidence from the 2012 and 2016 ANES as well as the 2018 American Institutional Confidence Poll to test competing expectations regarding this question: that social media polarizes versus de-polarizes trust judgments across partisan lines. Our analyses provide greater support for the expectation of polarization. We then unpack the potential mechanisms behind these findings. We use the number of ?stealth? issue campaigns targeted to the respondent?s state in 2016 as a proxy for the amount of political conflict the respondent was likely to have experienced when using social media during the 2016 Presidential election. Notably, we find that polarization is substantially impacted by the nature of the voter?s broader political environment. These findings are consequential for our understanding of how social media influences public opinion and draws attention to the role of the broader political context for this relationship.

AB  - Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilised in medical imaging systems and processes, and radiographers must embrace this advancement. This study aimed to investigate perceptions, knowledge, and expectations towards integrating AI into medical imaging amongst a sample of radiographers and determine the current state of AI education within the community. Methods: A cross-sectional online quantitative study targeting radiographers based in Europe was conducted over ten weeks. Captured data included demographical information, participants' perceptions and understanding of AI, expectations of AI and AI-related educational backgrounds. Both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used to analyse the obtained data. Results: A total of 96 valid responses were collected. Of these, 64% correctly identified the true definition of AI from a range of options, but fewer (37%) fully understood the difference between AI, machine learning and deep learning. The majority of participants (83%) agreed they were excited about the advancement of AI, though a level of apprehensiveness remained amongst 29%. A severe lack of education on AI was noted, with only 8% of participants having received AI teachings in their pre-registration qualification. Conclusion: Overall positive attitudes towards AI implementation were observed. The slight apprehension may stem from the lack of technical understanding of AI technologies and AI training within the community. Greater educational programs focusing on AI principles are required to help increase European radiography workforce engagement and involvement in AI technologies. Implications for practice: This study offers insight into the current perspectives of European based radiographers on AI in radiography to help facilitate the embracement of AI technology and convey the need for AI-focused education within the profession.

AB  - Purpose Social media and sustainability are changing Chinese consumers' consumption behavior in notable ways. Few apparel industry sustainability efforts are enforced or well known in China. As China operates its own social media sites, it is necessary to study Chinese social media, rather than Western types, in order to understand its influence on Chinese consumer behavior with regard to sustainability. By extending the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and the prototype willingness model, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how Chinese consumers were taught their environmentally sustainable apparel (ESA) consumption behavior through social media, and also how the influence of peers affected their purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach A total of 238 survey responses were collected and analyzed from a Chinese research firm in 2016. In accord with the study objectives, an exploratory factor analysis was first conducted, and then a two-step analysis of a structural equation model was employed for hypothesis testing. To test the significance of hypothesized mediated effects, a bootstrap procedure with 2,000 bootstrap samples from the original data was used to compute bias-corrected 95% CI for indirect effects. Moreover, hierarchical regressions were demonstrated to verify the unique contribution of social media influence. Findings The study findings support the previous literature that indicated positive attitudes toward environmentally sustainable purchasing behavior increased as Chinese consumers learned about social and environmental issues. Also, results of the analysis revealed that Chinese consumers' engagement with social media and their peers were important social influences that were directly tied to increasing sustainable apparel purchase intentions. Originality/value By extending two grand theories of the prototype willingness model theory and the TRA, this study underlines a novel link between the influence of social media and ESA purchase intentions among Chinese consumers. Results are valuable in a global context as it is one of only a few studies to explore Chinese consumers' purchase intentions of ESA through an exclusive social media platform - WeChat - in China.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine parental attitudes regarding engagement with video games by their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and whether attitudes vary based on ASD symptom severity.
   Method: Online survey methodology was used to gather information from parents of children with ASD between the ages of 8 and 12 years. The finalized data set included 152 cases. Descriptive statistics and frequency analyses were used to examine participant demographics and video game play. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate questions on the theory of planned behavior. Regression analyses determined the predictive ability of the theory of planned behavior constructs, and t tests provided additional descriptive information about between-group differences.
   Results: Children with ASD play video games. There are no significant differences in the time, intensity, or types of games played based on severity of ASD symptoms (mild vs. moderate). Parents of children with ASD had positive attitudes about video game play.
   Conclusions: Parents of children with ASD appear to support video game play. On average, parents indicated video game play was positive for their children with ASD, particularly if they believed the games were having a positive impact on their child's development.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined the need for public communication about nanotechnologies and nanoparticles by providing a comparative analysis of the differences in risk awareness of nanotechnologies and nanoparticles between consumers and experts.
   Methods: A total of 1,007 consumers and 150 experts participated in this study. A questionnaire was prepared examining their awareness of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials and their view of the necessity for information and education about the latest nanotechnologies and nanomaterials.
   Results: Our results indicated that the expert group recognized that they knew more than consumers about nanotechnology and that there was a need for relevant education in nanotechnology and nanomaterials among consumers. We found that the consumer group had a more positive attitude toward nanotechnology, even though they did not know much about it. Moreover, the consumer group was inconclusive about the type of information on nanotechnology deemed necessary for the public, as well as the suitable party to be responsible for education and for delivering the information.
   Conclusion: An education and promotion program targeting consumers should be established to overcome the differences between consumers and experts in their awareness of nanotechnology. Specifically, the establishment of concepts for nanomaterials or nanoproducts is required immediately. With clear standards on nanomaterials, consumers can make informed decisions in selecting nanoproducts in the market.

KW  - virtual activities
AB  - In early 2020, the world was taken aback with the spread of the Covid-19 disease by an unknown coronavirus. Months later, the World Health Organization characterised this outbreak as a pandemic, urging decision makers to take actions to slow down the infection rate. Science communicators had to adapt their activities in support of recommendations for social distancing. In this article, we describe the mobilisation of astronomy communicators in Brazil, one of the most affected countries, as a consequence of social inequality, cuts in science funding and science denialism by the government. Practitioners filled out a survey, and the results showed that the amount and diversity of online activities increased considerably. Initiatives such as virtual exhibitions, transmission of sky observations and collective planetary sessions engaged thousands of people. Discussions about the pandemic and how science works were also present in several activities. The pandemic forced the community of astronomy communicators in Brazil to adapt to the situation, and motivated many of them to offer online activities. The diversity of those who communicate astronomy is extensive and appears to be increasing.

AB  - Cultural diversity is increasing in the US, which is likely to have an impact on preferences toward future energy policy.
   This research investigates people's lived experience and preferences through a nationally representative survey (n = 3000) regarding the energy system, and how these relate to cultural group and other demographics.
   Our study highlights the influence of cultural background in the US, alongside educational achievement and income level on perceptions toward the energy system and energy policy.
   Through rigorous multivariate statistical evaluation of cultural groupings, income and education on energy system preferences and lived experience, we identified cultural groups that experience energy affordability differently, irrespective of income or educational achievement.
   For energy policy issue and factor importance, we identify a positive link with educational achievement and income, varying across cultural grouping.
   Overall, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Alaskans had a muted response to energy policy issues and energy system factors compared to their peers.
   Our findings identified a need to enhance overall educational outcomes to engender more positive attitudes toward improving the environment, and the need for policy makers to be aware of cultural group preferences to enable development of energy policies which improve recognition justice outcomes.

AB  - Purpose - Entrepreneurial intention is regarded as a useful and practical approach to understanding actual entrepreneurial behavior. Planned behavior has been widely applied to examine entrepreneurial intention. Nevertheless, how risk aversion affects entrepreneurial intention using the model of planned behavior is not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated model based on planned behavior to examine the direct and indirect effect of risk aversion on entrepreneurial intention concurrently.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper first uses factor analysis to study the latent constructs underlying determinants of planned behavior, risk aversion, and entrepreneurial intention. Then, it applies the technique of structural equation modeling to explore relationships among latent constructs. There are 306 survey responses collected from dental school students to run the analysis.
   Findings - The determinants of planned behavior are positively associated with entrepreneurial intention. There is no direct relationship between risk aversion and entrepreneurial intention. Risk aversion only indirectly reduces entrepreneurial intention through determinants of planned behavior.
   Research limitations/implications - The results of the integrated model may be constrained by the sample context of dental students. Replicating the model by using other samples with various educational backgrounds can strengthen the implication of the study. Another limitation is the weakness of the cross-sectional study design, leaving room for improvement by using longitudinal data in the future.
   Practical implications - Risk aversion only indirectly reduces entrepreneurial intention. To establish an environment with a strong entrepreneurial intention, a focus on developing a positive attitude and strengthening entrepreneurial skills are perhaps more fruitful than lowering risk aversion. This study also suggests that non-business students may need additional business education to improve the perception of self-efficacy.
   Originality/value - The integrated model of this paper is original. The development of the model draws support from planned behavior adjusted to the context of starting a business.

AB  - Public stigma associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly stems from judgments surrounding sensory overload symptoms. As individuals try and make sense of observed disordered behaviors of those with ASD, they are quick to develop dispositional attributions instead of acknowledging situational instigators. Interventions aimed at educating the lay public that disordered actions are a result of a biological causes have been successful in lessening perceptions of responsibility, yet foster an out-group perspective allowing prejudice attitudes and discriminatory behaviors to persist. The present study examines the short-term effectiveness of engagement with a virtual simulation, Auti-Sim, to combat stigma by giving lay people a first-person experience of sensory overload. To assess Auti-Sim, a between-subject, in-laboratory experimental design was employed. A total of 123 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions (virtual simulation engagement, observation of simulation engagement, or reading text vignettes). Participants completed a brief pretest questionnaire, encountered the intervention, and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Engagement with the virtual simulation resulted in heightened perspective taking, which subsequently increased emotional concern, helping intentions, and willingness to volunteer compared with the observation only or text vignette intervention. Positive attitudes toward those with ASD did not differ across interventions. Fostering a different understanding of disordered action through a virtual simulation has the potential to elicit perspective taking and subsequent empathetic outcomes. Perspective taking seems to encourage perceptions of in-group belonging rather than out-group categorization and thus might be a desired outcome for stigma-reducing efforts.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading in all the areas of the world. This ongoing pandemic has clear impacts in terms of the relevance of psychological needs. Psychological needs such as self-esteem, self-actualization, and relatedness only become relevant once basic physiological needs and safety and survivor needs have been satisfied. Because psychological constructs are not objectively existing constituents of reality but rather efforts to represent it, they tend to become more or less relevant and salient as a function of prevailing conditions. Starting from this premise, the current paper focuses on the relevance that fears with an interpersonal basis (i.e. the fear of missing out and the fear of not mattering) have during a period in which physical distancing or "social distancing" has been implicated as a crucial important public health intervention that can help stop transmission of the coronavirus. We underscore how the current health crisis impacts the self and identity of people who are confronted with the discrepancy between their usual psychological needs and current realities.

AB  - The present study (N=1074) examined the impact of a theory-driven media intervention aimed at violence prevention and intergroup reconciliation in Burundi. We used a novel methodology utilizing audio-based surveys to assess attitudes related to intergroup conflict and reconciliation among community members. We conducted a propensity score analysis to estimate the causal effects of the intervention by examining differences between listeners and non-listeners of the radio dramas. The results indicated a positive effect of the intervention on several social psychological outcomes (tolerance, in-group superiority, social distance, intergroup trust, responsibility attributions, trauma disclosure and competitive victimhood). However, listeners and non-listeners did not differ in obedience toward leaders or historical perspective taking; and the results for active bystandership, one of the main foci of the intervention, were mixed. Furthermore, the results show that the impact of the intervention sometimes depends on listeners' personal experiences of victimization. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - BackgroundHealthcare services are being increasingly digitalised in European countries. However, in studies evaluating digital health technology, some people are less likely to participate than others, e.g. those who are older, those with a lower level of education and those with poorer digital skills. Such non-participation in research - deriving from the processes of non-recruitment of targeted individuals and self-selection - can be a driver of old-age exclusion from new digital health technologies. We aim to introduce, discuss and test an instrument to measure non-participation in digital health studies, in particular, the process of self-selection.MethodsBased on a review of the relevant literature, we designed an instrument - the NPART survey questionnaire - for the analysis of self-selection, covering five thematic areas: socioeconomic factors, self-rated health and subjective overall quality of life, social participation, time resources, and digital skills and use of technology. The instrument was piloted on 70 older study persons in Sweden, approached during the recruitment process for a trial study.ResultsResults indicated that participants, as compared to decliners, were on average slightly younger and more educated, and reported better memory, higher social participation, and higher familiarity with and greater use of digital technologies. Overall, the survey questionnaire was able to discriminate between participants and decliners on the key aspects investigated, along the lines of the relevant literature.ConclusionsThe NPART survey questionnaire can be applied to characterise non-participation in digital health research, in particular, the process of self-selection. It helps to identify underrepresented groups and their needs. Data generated from such an investigation, combined with hospital registry data on non-recruitment, allows for the implementation of improved sampling strategies, e.g. focused recruitment of underrepresented groups, and for the post hoc adjustment of results generated from biased samples, e.g. weighting procedures.

AB  - Dengue fever is a major public health problem in Malaysia. This study aimed to assess factors affecting knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding dengue fever among a selected population in Malaysia. A descriptive, community-based, cross sectional study was conducted with 300 participants from three different geographical settings in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas within the states of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. The questionnaire included questions on demographic data, knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding dengue fever. Mean age of respondents was 34.4 (+/- 5.7) years, and the age ranged from 18 to 65 years. The majority of respondents were married (54.7%), Malays (72.7%) and heard about dengue fever (89.7%). Television was the common source of information about dengue fever (97.0%). Participants answered 4 out of 15 items of knowledge incorrectly There was no significant association between knowledge score and socio-demographic factors. About one-fifth of the respondents (24%) believed that immediate treatment is not necessary for dengue fever, and the majority of them were not afraid of the disease (96.0%). Attitudes toward dengue fever were significantly associated with the level of education and employment status (p<0.05). Practice was associated significantly with age, marital status, and geographic area (p<0.05) and knowledge on dengue fever (p=0.030). There is a need to increase health promotion activities through campaigns and social mobilization to increase knowledge regarding dengue fever. This would help to mold positive attitudes and cultivate better preventive practices among the public to eliminate dengue in the country

AB  - Background: Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) gives a view to improved education. However, there is a need to clarify how TEL can be used effectively. The study compared students' attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face course on theoretical radiological science and a TEL course where students could combine face-to-face lectures and e-learning modules at their best convenience.
   Methods: 42 third-year dental students were randomly assigned to the traditional face-to-face group and the TEL group. Both groups completed questionnaires before the beginning and after completion of the course on attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face lectures and technology-enhanced learning. After completion of the course both groups also filled in the validated German-language TRIL (Trierer Inventar zur Lehrevaluation) questionnaire for the evaluation of courses given at universities.
   Results: Both groups had a positive attitude towards e-learning that did not change over time. The TEL group attended significantly less face-to-face lectures than the traditional group. However, both groups stated that face-to-face lectures were the basis for education in a theoretical radiological science course.
   The members of the TEL group rated e-mail reminders significantly more important when they filled in the questionnaire on attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face lectures and technology-enhanced learning for the second time after completion of the course.
   The members of the technology-enhanced learning group were significantly less confident in passing the exam compared to the members of the traditional group. However, examination results did not differ significantly for traditional and the TEL group.
   Conclusions: It seems that technology-enhanced learning in a theoretical radiological science course has the potential to reduce the need for face-to-face lectures. At the same time examination results are not impaired. However, technology-enhanced learning cannot completely replace traditional face-to-face lectures, because students indicate that they consider traditional teaching as the basis of their education.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a media literacy intervention targeting, for the first time, the specific topic of Performance and Appearance Enhancing Substances (PAESs) use in high-school students. Overall, 389 students (52% male) aged between 13 and 19 years (mean = 16.56 year; SD = 1.26) participated to a media literacy intervention (i.e., "intervention group") while 103 students aged between 14 and 19 year (mean = 16.10 year; SD = 1.38) were considered as the control group (i.e., "control group"). In two separate occasions over the course of six consecutive months, students in both groups filled out a set of questionnaires which included measures of social-cognitive beliefs (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, intentions) and a self-reported measure of retrospective use of doping (Yes/No) and supplements (Yes/No). Compared to students in the control group (Mean((time1)) = 1.96; SD(time1) = 0.85; and Mean((time2)) = 2.09; SD(time2) = 0.94), intervention students on average expressed relatively stronger attitudes against doping use over time (Mean((time1)) = 2.2; SD(time1) = 0.85; and Mean((time2)) = 2.05; SD(time2) = 0.82). Students in the latter group also showed a statistically significant decrease in self-reported supplement use (Use((time1)) = 6.7%; Use((time2)) = 3.8%; p = 0.05, McNemar Test). Interestingly, albeit marginally significant, students in the control group showed a relative increment in the self-reported use of supplements over time (Use((time1)) = 4.9%; Use((time2)) = 8.7%; p = 0.22, McNemar Test). Overall, the media literacy intervention investigated in the present study was effective in decreasing adolescent student's positive attitudes toward doping use and in reducing the use of legal PAES. These findings supported the generalizability and the usefulness of a media literacy approach in the specific field of PAES.

AB  - Purpose Mixed products, while presenting new business opportunities, raise considerable concerns among managers and researchers. However, whether mixed products (functionally vs culturally) trigger positive or negative consumer reactions is controversial. Hereby, the present research seeks to resolve the conflicting effects by examining the moderating role of service provider type (humanoid service robot vs human employee) in the impact of mixed products on consumer reactions. Design/methodology/approach Two studies were conducted to explore the effect of mixed products on consumer reactions. Specifically, study 1 was developed to examine the interplay of mixed products and service provider type in shaping consumers' product attitudes and purchase intentions under an offline shopping scenario; study 2 further provided evidence for the mediating roles of perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment in the above processes under an online-shopping context. Findings The convergent findings of two studies conclude that, when served by a humanoid service robot (vs human employee), consumers exhibit more positive attitudes and higher purchase intentions toward functionally (vs culturally) mixed products. Furthermore, such effect is driven by the perceived usefulness (vs perceived enjoyment) when served by humanoid robot (vs human employee). Originality/value First, this is one of the first studies to conceptualize mixed products as the two-dimensional construct (i.e. functionally mixed and culturally mixed), and the findings sheds light on the mixed products literature. Second, this paper introduces service provider type as the boundary condition for the impact of mixed products on consumers' product attitudes and purchase intentions, which expands the match-up hypothesis and schema theory in service marketing. Third, the current research explores the mediating roles of perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment in the above effects, which could make significant contribution to the motivation theory.

AB  - Introduction: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of sudden cardiac death which can be prevented by early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). International bodies recommend that basic life support (BLS) skills be taught in schools in order to increase the rate of bystander CPR and reduce mortality from OHCA. We are not aware of any BLS education program for non-healthcare students in Nigeria. This study was to assess the awareness and attitude to acquiring BLS skills among university students.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among final year university undergraduates using a questionnaire that assessed students' sociodemographic characteristics, awareness of CPR, previous experiences, and attitude to basic life support (BLS). Counts and proportions were compared for the demographic characteristics using Chisquared and Fisher's exact tests.
   Results: Four hundred and seventy-five students from 15 faculties participated in this study, median age was 22.8 years (interquartile range: 21.2-24.5 years). Majority (82.5%) have heard of CPR, 29.7% have undergone CPR training; 77.3% of those who had been trained were confident that they could perform CPR. Previous CPR training was significantly associated with faculty, year of study and age. Eighty-nine (18.7%) students have witnessed someone die from a trauma. Four hundred and fifty (94.7%) respondents would like to get BLS training, 440 (92.6%) think that CPR training should be included in the school curriculum.
   Conclusion: There is good awareness and positive attitude to the acquisition and practice of cardiopulmonary resuscitation among university students in Nigeria. Few students however, have been trained to administer bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Therefore, there is a need to implement university wide BLS education in Nigeria.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether a social exchange relationship between temporary workers and organizations is possible. The authors aim to consider whether, when training is perceived by an employee as an organizational practice that promotes his or her employability, this entails a social exchange relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach - Surveys from 240 call centre workers were analyzed using correlation and multiple regression to explore relationships between training to promote employability, perceived organizational support (PUS) and affective commitment.
   Findings - The data support the idea that social exchange theories are useful frameworks in explaining temporary workers' affective commitment towards organisations. Organisational investment in training was positively related to the affective commitment of these temporary workers. However, employees attributed greater importance to the fact that training increased their employability than to the number of training hours received. The relationship between this human resource management practice and affective commitment partly occurred through the perceived organisational support. Such perception partially mediates the relationship between training as a promoter of employability and this positive attitude.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is limited due to sample nature and the lack of longitudinal design. It does not provide implications for other types of commitment that may be relevant for temporary workers (continuance commitment, for example).
   Practical implications - An important implication from this research is that employers should not assume that training is an investment without return from temporary workers. Developmental opportunities, while important to all employees, did make temporary workers more committed to organizations.
   Originality/value - The paper is the first, to the authors' knowledge, to assess training as promoting employability with a specific measure. While the results are simple, they refute many stereotypes of temporary workers and add an important perspective to the human resource management literature.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the structural processes that lead citizens to escape their common social circles when talking about politics and public affairs (e.g. "filter bubbles"). To do so, this study tests to what extent political attitudes, political behavior, news media consumption and discussion frequency affect discussion network heterogeneity among US citizens. Design/methodology/approach Supported by the polling group Nielsen, this study uses a two-wave panel online survey to study the antecedents and mechanisms of discussion network heterogeneity among US citizens. To test the hypotheses and answer the research questions, ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions (cross-sectional, lagged and autoregressive) and mediation analyses were conducted. Findings The findings imply that political discussion frequency functions as the key element in explaining the mechanism that leads politically interested and participatory citizens (online) as well as news consumers of traditional and online media to seek a more heterogeneous discussion network, disrupting the so-called "filter bubbles." However, mediation analyses also showed that discussion frequency can lead to more homogenous discussion networks if people score high on political knowledge, possibly reflecting the formation of a close network of political-savvy individuals. Originality/value The survey data give important insights into the 2016 pre-election situation, trying to explain why US citizens were more likely to remain in homogenous discussion networks when talking about politics and public affairs. By using two-wave panel data, the analyses allow to draw tentative conclusions about the influential and inhibiting factors and mechanisms that lead individuals to seek/avoid a more heterogeneous discussion network.

AB  - Cultural diversity due to immigration has become a key topic in many societies today. The question of how the native population experiences these developments is of prime importance for intercultural relations and sets the base for acculturation of immigrants. Drawing on attachment and multiculturalism research, we supposed here that general and specific feelings of security might be related to more positive attitudes toward cultural diversity, whereas feelings of threat might be related to less openness. More precisely, the present study investigated how natives' general attachment (secure or fearful) as well as their specific feelings of (cultural or economic) security might be related to their expectations about acculturation of immigrants in the multicultural context of Luxembourg. The sample included N = 134 Luxembourg nationals with an average age of M = 45.02 (SD = 17.41) who filled out an online questionnaire. Results revealed that self-reported fearful general attachment was positively related to more unwelcoming acculturation orientations. Relations between general attachment and acculturation orientations were mediated by feelings of cultural security, which had strong effects on host nationals' (un) welcoming acculturation orientations over and above general attachment. Findings suggest that (un)welcoming orientations toward immigrants, entailing openness for cultural contact and exchange, are related to feelings of cultural and economic security which are partly biased by a general secure or fearful attachment. Feelings of security seem thus to provide a secure base for tolerance and openness to cultural diversity which are needed in order to deal successfully with the challenges of today's multicultural societies.

AB  - Weight stigma is pervasive and has profound negative consequences for obese individuals. The attribution-emotion approach of stigmatization holds that blame attributions relate to derogation stigmatized groups indirectly through anger and pity. Other research suggests that disgust is related to weight stigma. In the present studies, we investigate whether contempt is a reliable predictor of biases against obese individuals. Study 1 (N = 297) shows that contempt partially mediates the relation between blame and both prejudice and support for weight related discrimination policies. Studies 2 and 3 (total N = 406) added disgust and show that both contempt and disgust relate to social distance and prejudice. Contempt mediated the relation between blame and negative reactions toward obese individuals, even after controlling for other emotions, while disgust only mediated these relations in Study 2. Anger and pity did not show this mediating role, but pity was moderately associated with weight bias. Contempt is likely to play an important role in how people react to members of this stigmatized group.

AB  - Research on effects of message repetition suggested an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of message repetitions and the attitude toward the message content. Furthermore, it was indicated that when people are processing persuasive health messages, they use source credibility as a cue for judgments about the message. Built on that, repetition of an antismoking advertisement should initially increase source credibility and negative attitudes toward smoking. But when repetition rises to an excessive level, source credibility decreases, what in turn should decrease negative attitudes toward smoking. This study (N=276) provided strong support for the hypothesized inverted U-shaped relationship. This effect was mediated by perceived source credibility and remained unaffected by smoking behavior. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the knowledge, attitude. and practice regarding evidence-based medicine (EBM) among hospital physicians in Qassim region of Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: It is a cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire survey was done among 288 physicians working in secondary and tertiary care centers. The study was conducted between June and September 2015.
   Results: The overall response rate for the survey was 72%. Majority of the respondents had a positive attitude toward EBM and welcomed the concept. A total of 83% respondents stated that they used EBM in their daily practice and 93.5% agreed that practicing EBM improves patient care. There was a moderate level of awareness regarding extracting information from journals and clinical evidence databases. Although the respondents were aware and demonstrated familiarity with the process of knowledge extraction procedures to determine the best care, as many as 40% did not use them. The respondents had a poor overall understanding of the technical terms used in EBM. Among the respondents, 38.5% thought that the best way to move from opinion-based medicine to EBM was through learning the skills of EBM. The factors that positively affected physician awareness included: Academic qualification and professional title. Knowledge and attitude were affected by qualification, professional title and specialty.
   Conclusion: The attitude of most physician practitioners in this study is favorable toward EBM, but this was not correlated with knowledge and awareness. The inclusion of physician training courses in EBM concepts, technical terms and applied practice is highly recommended.

AB  - Simple Summary
   On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic and an ongoing public health emergency. In the United Kingdom, quarantine and social distancing measures were implemented with immediate effect on 17 March 2020, resulting in a rapid change to the way owners managed and interacted with their horses. We surveyed 6259 horse owners to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on themselves and their horses. The majority of horse owners were visiting and riding their horses less, with increased restrictions experienced by owners who kept their horse at private livery yards. Whilst social distancing and visiting restrictions were in place at livery yards, nearly half were not providing hand sanitization or disinfection protocols for shared areas/equipment to prevent the spread of the virus between owners. Horse owners expressed concern that equine health and welfare would be negatively affected by the restrictions put in place and of financial consequences as a result of the pandemic. The majority of respondents also felt their own mental health and wellbeing was being adversely affected by not being able to visit/interact as they normally would with their horses. Equestrian influencers and national bodies should engage with increased communication and education to support horse owners through the pandemic in the short, medium, and long-term.
   COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020; the United Kingdom (UK) implemented quarantine measures shortly afterward, resulting in rapid changes in how owners managed and interacted with their horses. This study provides a rapid analysis of the initial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the management of UK leisure and competition horses. A 17 question online survey was distributed via equestrian social media sites to ascertain the impact of COVID-19 on horse and yard management and on human-horse interactions. Frequency analysis combined with Chi-squared and thematic analyses identified the impact of COVID-19 on UK horse owners. Major changes within horse management and horse-human interactions were reported for the majority of horse owners (>65%), regardless of the establishment type or region. Social distancing and visiting restrictions were implemented at most yards, but nearly half were not providing hand sanitization or disinfection protocols for the shared areas/equipment to prevent cross-contamination between users. The financial impact of the pandemic combined with restricted access to veterinary professionals resulted in owners expressing concerns that horse health and welfare may be compromised as a result. Horse owners also felt that the reduced opportunities for horse-human interactions were negatively affecting their mental health and wellbeing.

AB  - Chinese people's pornography use is increasing and condomless sex is prevalent in pornography. However, both the relationship between pornography and condom use among Chinese adults and the mechanisms underlying this relationship are underexplored. This study examined how perceptions of pornography were associated with attitudes toward condom use through the mediating effect of gratification of sexual pleasure and safer sex communication apprehension, and how shared pornography use with a partner during sex moderated these relationships. A total of 658 participants (391 women and 267 men) aged 18-65 years and involved in a romantic relationship completed an online survey assessing pornography consumption, condom use, gratification of sexual pleasure, and safer sex communication apprehension. Results showed that expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography were associated with higher levels of gratification of sexual pleasure, which were, in turn, associated with more negative attitudes toward condom use. Expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography were also associated with lower levels of safer sex communication apprehension and lower levels of negative attitudes toward condom use. Higher levels of shared pornography use with a partner during sex strengthened the direct positive relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and negative attitudes toward condom use. Higher levels of shared pornography use during sex also strengthened the positive relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and gratification of sexual pleasure, and the negative relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and safer sex communication apprehension, which in turn, were significantly associated with attitudes toward condom use. Implications for sexual health education and limitations are discussed.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, minimizing exposure risk for patients with cancer and health care personnel was of utmost importance. Here, we present steps taken to date to flatten the curve at the radiation oncology division of a tertiary cancer center with the goal of mitigating risk of exposure among patients and staff, and optimizing resource utilization. Response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in this large tertiary referral center included volume reduction, personal protective equipment recommendations, flexible clinic visit interaction types dictated by need and risk reduction, and numerous social distancing strategies. We hope these outlined considerations can assist the wider radiation oncology community as we collectively face this ongoing challenge. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence-based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines.
   Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.
   Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.
   Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.

AB  - A layoff is a threatening yet common event which employees might face at some point in their working lives. In two scenario-based experiments (total N=344), we investigated which actions of a layoff agent (i.e., who delivers the layoff notice) during a dismissal notification meeting may contribute to laid-off employees' fairness judgments and negative attitudes toward the employer. In general, the extent to which layoff victims were treated with respect was consistently found to increase perceptions of interpersonal and procedural fairness and to mitigate negative attitudes toward the employer. Further results showed that layoff victims preferred to be given an adequate (vs. inadequate) explanation of the reasons for the layoff and to receive notice from the direct supervisor (vs. an external consultant). Relationships between the layoff agent's actions and layoff victims' negative attitudes toward the employer were mediated by perceptions of procedural fairness. In addition, delegating the layoff agent's task to an external consultant increased perceived psychological contract breach. Our findings have important implications for organizational justice research and for the managerial practice of implementing fair layoffs. In particular, small actions, such as treating employees with respect, might be of benefit both to humans and organizations.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the release of cardiac damage biomarkers jointly with cardiac autonomic modulation after a mountain ultramarathon. Such knowledge and the possible relationship of these markers with race time is of primary interest to establish possible recommendations upon athletes' recovery and return to training following these competitions. Forty six athletes enrolled in the Penyagolosa Trails CSP115 race (118 km and a total positive elevation of 5439 m) took part in the study. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-TNT) concentrations as well as linear and nonlinear heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated before and after the race. NT-proBNP and hs-TNT significantly increased post-race; fifty percent of the finishers surpassed the Upper Reference Limit (URL) for hs-TNT while 87% exceeded the URL for NT-proBNP. Overall and vagally-mediated HRV were diminished and cardiac autonomic modulation became less complex and more predictable following the race. More pronounced vagal modulation decreases were associated with higher levels of postexertional NT-proBNP. Moreover, rise in hs-TNT and NT-proBNP was greater among faster runners, while pre-race overall and vagally-mediated HRV were correlated with finishing time. Participation in a 118-km ultratrail induces an acute release of cardiac damage biomarkers and a large alteration of cardiac autonomic modulation. Furthermore, faster runners were those who exhibited a greater rise in those cardiac damage biomarkers. In light of these findings, an appropriate recovery period after ultraendurance races appears prudent and particularly important among better performing athletes. At the same time, HRV analysis is shown as a promising tool to assess athletes' readiness to perform at their maximum level in an ultraendurance race.

AB  - This study examined the relationships between media salience of presidential candidate images, perceived candidate salience, and public attitude strength using media and public opinion data from six US presidential elections. The results indicate that media salience is positively related to both public salience and attitude strength. In addition, the findings offer modest evidence suggesting that the sequence of influence among these variables entails media salience leading to stronger attitudes, which subsequently results in increased public salience. The implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Correctional facilities offer opportunities to provide comprehensive HIV services including education, testing, treatment, and coordination of post-release care. However, these services may be undermined by unaddressed HIV stigma. As part of a prison-based HIV testing study, we interviewed 76 incarcerated men and women from the North Carolina State prison system. The sample was 72% men, median age 31.5 years (range: 19 to 60). Thematic analysis revealed high levels of HIV-related fear and stigma, homophobia, incomplete HIV transmission knowledge, beliefs that HIV is highly contagious within prisons ("HIV miasma"), and the view of HIV testing as protective. Interviewees described social distancing behaviors and coping mechanisms they perceived to be protective, including knowing their HIV status and avoiding contact with others and shared objects. Interviewees endorsed universal testing, public HIV status disclosure, and segregation of HIV-positive inmates. Intensified education and counseling efforts are needed to ameliorate entrenched HIV-transmission fears and stigmatizing beliefs.

AB  - This paper aims to replicate previous findings regarding the differential impact of TV advertising and advergames on children's brand attitudes and pester intentions. Using a large data-set (N = 940, M-age = 9.8, SD = 2.4), with children ranging between 6 and 14years old, the influence of passive exposure to TV advertising is compared to active exposure to an advergame. In addition, the potential moderating effect of age is explored. In a between-participants experiment, Flemish children were randomly assigned to watch a TV ad, play an advergame, or a no marketing control condition. Results revealed that children who had played the advergame reported significantly more positive brand attitudes compared to children who had watched the TV ad and children in the no advertising exposure control group. Children's pester intent was significantly higher for the advergame compared to the TV ad, but not compared to the no advertising exposure control group. The findings further showed that children's attitudes towards the ad format mediate the impact of the advertising format on pester intent. The advergame was indirectly more persuasive than the TV ad since children reported more positive attitudes towards the advergame compared to the TV advertisement. Moreover, this mediation effect did not differ by children's age. Persuasion knowledge did not mediate the influence of the advertising format on pester intent since children's persuasion knowledge was not significantly related to pester intentions regardless of children's age.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is an emerging global threat to public health. Substantial evidence has indicated that community pharmacists (CPs) can play a critical role in managing the ever-increasing threat of antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practices of CPs (n = 180) towards antibiotics and antibiotic resistance as well as to improve the rational use of antibiotics. A two-phase mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) online study was conducted in Pakistan from August 2019 to March 2020 by using validated questionnaires and semi-structured interview data. Different statistical methods were used to tabulate the quantitative data, whereas inductive thematic analysis was conducted to categorize themes from the qualitative data and to draw conclusions. Approximately 64.4% of the CPs were male (mean: 29-33 years old). Overall, CPs had good knowledge of and were familiar with multidrug-resistant organisms and their roles in ABR (65.6%, median = 1, and IQR = 1), although their knowledge was poor in differentiating some antibiotic groups with their respective ABR patterns (31.1%, median = 1, and IQR = 1). Most CPs have a positive attitude towards antibiotics, with most (90.0%) identifying ABR as a critical issue in public health (median = 1 and IQR = 0). Overall, CPs' practices towards antibiotics were somewhat acceptable, where they leaned towards educating patients about the rational use of antibiotics (52.8%, median = 1, and IQR = 1). The two main themes discovered (antibiotics and counseling of patients) were related to self-medication, while educational intervention is the main subtheme. ABR is multifactorial, with subthemes related to budget, time constraints, incompetent staff, the absence of CPs, the lack of training, and the enforcement of laws and regulations being the needs of the hour in Pakistan. Effective antibiotic stewardship programs, patient education, and awareness campaigns about antibiotics and ABR along with training of the CPs are important factors that have to be addressed in a timely manner.

AB  - Background and purpose In multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-related factors and dysfunctional coping might favor the development of mental distress induced by COVID-19 containment measures. Aim of this study was exploring the relationship between disability, coping strategies, daily life reorganization and neuropsychiatric symptoms in an Italian MS population during the COVID-19 lockdown, in order to identify potentially modifiable factors that could inform clinical management of mental distress in people with MS.
   Methods We explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown. Structural equation modeling was applied to information collected via web survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress.
   Results A total of 845 participants (497 with MS and 348 controls) were included in the study. The MS group had higher scores than the control group for depression (P = 0.005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances. The structural equation modeling explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score. Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (beta = 0.509 and beta = 0.836; P < 0.001); positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (beta = 0.386 and beta = 0.297; P < 0.001); and avoidance, social support and watching television contributed to passive attitude (beta = 0.301, beta = 0.243 and beta = 0.212; P < 0.001). With regard to the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (beta = 0.855; P < 0.001), while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (beta = 0.729 and beta = -0.456; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion As a practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool in facing COVID-19-related mental distress.

AB  - A growing body of research documents the crucial role played by moral concerns in the formation of attitudes and a wide range of political behaviors. Yet extant models of moral judgment portray a direct linkage between moral intuitions and policy attitudes, leaving little room for the influence of political context. In this article, we argue that political rhetoric plays an important role in facilitating the connection between moral intuitions and political attitudes. Using a unique combination of media content analysis of the stem cell debate and individual-level measures of the public's moral foundations, we examine the role of rhetoric in linking a person's moral foundations to his or her attitudes. Our results show that individuals who are the most likely to have been exposed to political rhetoric have the strongest connection between their moral foundations and their attitudes on the issue. We also find that rhetoric was persuasive on this moralized issue and present suggestive evidence that it was most persuasive among those who endorsed the relevant moral foundation.

AB  - Combating prejudice against social minorities is a challenging task in current multicultural societies. Mass media can decisively shape prejudice, because it often represents the main source of information about social minorities. In 3 studies in the Czech Republic (N = 445) and Switzerland (N = 362; N = 220), we investigated how prejudice against negatively and positively perceived minorities (the Roma in Study 1, Kosovo Albanians in Study 2, Italians in Study 3) is influenced by a single exposure to a print news report, by manipulating the valence of reports about minority members (positive vs. negative vs. mixed) and linguistic forms for minorities' ethnicity (nouns vs. adjectives). Positive and negative reports shaped prejudice in the respective directions; the effect of mixed reports mostly did not differ from positive reports. Labeling ethnicity with nouns (e.g., a male Roma) resulted in more prejudice than adjectives (e.g., a Roma man), independent of report valence. Report valence influenced the affective part of prejudice (i.e., feelings toward a minority), whereas language consistently shaped the behavioral part of prejudice (i.e., preferred social distance from a minority).

AB  - Background: Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a recently emerged and rapidly growing public health emergency. Adequate knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice among different sections of the society, including health-care workers, are quintessential in prevention and control of this deadly disease. Hence, the present study was undertaken with the objective of determining the knowledge, attitude, and practice among health-care workers (HCWs) including ancillary support staff, their family members, and patients toward COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional 40-item survey was conducted among HCWs, family members, and patients in a dedicated tertiary care COVID-19 hospital during May 2020-June 2020.The responses were tabulated and regression analyses were performed to determine the significance of each parameter among different groups. Results: Of 596 participants, among health-care professionals, ancillary support staff, family members, and patients, most were graduates (72.9%, 74.6%, and 50.6%, respectively), while 50% of the patients were educated up to high school. Social media and Internet was the main source of information for health-care professionals, while it was news media for others. Younger age was significantly associated with knowledge and attitude among HCWs (P = 0.001, P= 0.006) and ancillary support staff (P = 0.01, P < 0.001), while younger age and education were positively associated with knowledge among family members (P = 0.007, P < 0.001). Among patients, only education related to better knowledge (P < 0.001) and younger age with better practice (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, HCWs and ancillary support staff have better knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19. Education was associated with better practice among patients. Health education programs to improve the awareness and encourage appropriate practices toward this global hazard, especially among the general public, are required to conquer this virus and limit the spread of infection.

AB  - Wildlife managers and researchers have suspected that urine-based lure products collected from captive cervids could be potential media contributing to the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer (Odocoileus spp.). Although personnel in multiple wildlife agencies have taken the precautionary approach to prohibit the sales or use of urine-based lure products, it is not well understood whether hunters will accept and willingly cooperate with these policies. To address this gap in the literature, we examine hunters' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward a hypothetical policy proposing to ban urine-based products and how risk beliefs, trait psychological reactance, and hunting experience affect these responses. In May 2017, we recruited 739 members of an online advocacy group of deer hunters to complete a web-based survey with experimental elements. Overall, participants held positive attitudes toward the proposed policy to ban these products and high intentions to cooperate. Participants also characterized CWD as an increasing risk that was associated with dread, well known to science, and observable. These risk beliefs were positively related to attitudes and behavioral intentions to comply with the policy. In contrast, trait psychological reactance and prior experience using urine-based scents were negatively related to attitudes and behavioral intentions. Findings indicate that wildlife management agency personnel communicating with the public may find better acceptance of controversial CWD policies by first establishing a shared understanding of its risks through thorough risk communication.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to test the protection motivation theory (PMT) in the context of fear appeal interventions to reduce the threat of phishing attacks. In addition, it was tested to what extent the model relations are equivalent across fear appeal conditions and across time.
   Design/methodology/approach A pre-test post-test design was used. In the pre-test, 1,201 internet users filled out an online survey and were presented with one of three fear appeal conditions: strong fear appeal, weak fear appeal and control condition. Arguments regarding vulnerability of phishing attacks and response efficacy of vigilant online information-sharing behaviour were manipulated in the fear appeals. In the post-test, data were collected from 786 internet users and analysed with partial least squares path modelling.
   Findings The study found that PMT model relations hold in the domain of phishing. Self-efficacy and fear were the most important predictors of protection motivation. In general, the model results were equivalent across conditions and across time.
   Practical Implications It is important to consider online information-sharing behaviour because it facilitates the occurrence and success of phishing attacks. The results give practitioners more insight into important factors to address in the design of preventative measures to reduce the success of phishing attacks. Future research is needed to test how fear appeals work in real-world settings and over longer periods.
   Originality/value This paper is a substantial adaptation of a previous conference paper (Jansen and Van Schaik, 2017a, b).

AB  - Orientation: Compliance culture within the South African local government context is perceived to be critical to sustainable municipality service delivery. Improving compliance culture is therefore important.
   Research purpose: This article therefore developed a compliance framework based on deterrence theory (DT) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to identify human behavioural factors to be considered in the development and use of work procedures as a way to improve workers' compliance with work procedures.
   Motivation for the study: Reports (e.g. Auditor General reports) on municipality service delivery fall short of providing a clear assessment and study of work and human behavioural dynamics in relation to compliance with work procedures.
   Research approach/design and method: This article tested a conceptual model focused on the effect of deterrence initiatives on workplace compliance as mediated by the theory-planned behaviour. Data were collected from 119 workers in two municipalities of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa through a structured questionnaire and analysed using structural equation model.
   Main findings: Findings show that a positive attitude towards compliance to work procedures cannot be achieved through intimidation; reinforcement has a positive effect on attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC). However, only the PBC aspect of the TPB explains significant mediation between deterrence and compliance.
   Practical/managerial implications: The study demonstrates how compliance culture can be engendered by non-intimidating deterrent measures and PBC.
   Contributions/value-add: The negative effect of intimidation on compliance culture and the positive effect of PBC on compliance attitude of workers are critical contributions.

AB  - The Internet has become the main information and data provider since its appearance at the end of the 20(th) century. Currently, all over the world, universities, as the main generators and consumers of information, stand at the top of the privileged organizations that have access to the Internet. Hence, being a tertiary student means not only having easy, quick, and cheap, even in most places free, access, but also being bombarded with information. This led to a considerable body of research into the attitudes and habits of using the Internet by the university students in the world as well as Turkey and North Cyprus.
   The present study sets out to explore the attitudes of students, studying at the Faculty of Communication and Media Studies, Eastern Mediterranean University, towards the use of the Internet as a source/tool for obtaining information for their course work, communication and otherwise. Data have been collected through a questionnaire designed in two parts: the first part seeks to collect information about the participants' genders, ages, departments, the year of studies, and their practice related to the use of the Internet and the second part related to their attitudes towards the use of various aspects of the Internet. The results indicate that students hold a positive attitude towards the use of the Internet both for academic and communication purposes. The Internet is considered as the best and fastest information provider and is necessary for tertiary students. Both the lecturers and students should have web-sites. They are, however, undecided about the trustworthiness of the information they find on the web or printing everything they find on it before reading. Furthermore, they are undecided about the fact that the Internet makes them feel lonely. The students also stated that they are undecided about online shopping, online banking, playing games on the Internet rather than doing any other hobby.

AB  - Purpose
   Unconscious biases against certain groups aid in forming assumptions which may be promulgated in the USA via popular news media linking rare but memorable violent acts with specific groups. However, the relationship between marginalized group association, assumptions regarding the motive for violent acts and individual media consumption has never been directly examined. This study aims to directly examine this relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In the present study, individuals read a vignette of a mass shooting in which the perpetrator's implied religion (i.e. Islam or unknown religion) was manipulated. Participants then indicated their assumptions regarding motive (i.e. terrorism or mental illness) and personal media consumption habits.
   Findings
   Contrary to hypotheses, differences in assumed motive based on implied religion were not found; participants were not more likely to associate an assumed Muslim perpetrator with terrorism as a motive or consider the assumed non-Muslim perpetrator to be mentally ill.
   Originality/value
   These unexpected findings are discussed in the context of the data-collection period, which coincidentally overlapped with a well-publicized act of domestic terrorism that led to a unique national debate regarding biased news coverage and associations between religion, ethnicity, terrorism and mental illness.

AB  - Objectives To conduct an independent study investigating how adults perceive the usability and functionality of the 'National Health Service (NHS) COVID-19' application (app). This study aims to highlight strengths and provide recommendations to improve adoption of future contact tracing developments. Design A 60-item, anonymous online questionnaire, disseminated through social media outlets and email lists by a team from Imperial College London. Setting England. Participants Convenience sample of 1036 responses, from participants aged 18 years and above, between December 2020 and January 2021. Primary outcome measures Evaluate the compliance and public attitude towards the 'NHS COVID-19' app regarding its functionality and features. This included whether participants' expectations were met, and their thoughts on the app privacy and security. Furthermore, to distinguish how usability, perception, and adoption differed with varying demographics and user values. Results Fair compliance with the app features was identified, meeting expectations of the 62.1% of participants who stated they downloaded it after weighted analysis. However, participants finding the interface challenging were less likely to read information in the app and had a lesser understanding of its functionality. Furthermore, little understanding regarding the app's functionality and privacy concerns was a possible reason why users did not download it. A readability analysis of the text revealed information within the app was conveyed at a level that may be too complex for up to 43% of the UK population. The study highlighted issues related to the potential of false positives caused by the design choices in the 'Check-In' feature. Conclusion This study showed that while the 'NHS COVID-19' app was viewed positively, there remained issues regarding participants' perceived knowledge of app functionality, potentially affecting compliance. Therefore, we recommended improvements regarding the delivery and presentation of the app's information, and highlighted the potential need for the ability to check out of venues to reduce the number of false positive contacts.

AB  - Background: We aim to determine the level of general knowledge and attitudes among the population of Saudi Arabia regarding sexually transmitted illnesses (STI). In addition, we aim to educate participants about the most common STIs, and explore how this influences the participants' attitudes and perceptions. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional web-based survey of the general population of Saudi Arabia. The sample was enrolled randomly by distributing the survey through social media over a two-month period. 420 subjects between the ages of (15.-60) participated in the study. Results: Among the 420 total responses, 405 (96%) participants were included based on the absence of missing data in their answers. Most of the participants (77%) were females. More than half of the respondents were single (59%), 24 years old or more (57%), Saudi (52%), and had a bachelor's degree (65%). Forty-eight percent (48%) of the participants were related to the medical field. Only 11% knew someone previously diagnosed with STIs. The mean score of overall knowledge about STI was 8.79 +/- 3.17 (median - 9) out of a maximum score of 20. The scores ranged from 2-16. A higher percentage of the participants (48.6%) had a low level of knowledge. Two-hundred eighty-one participants showed interest in viewing the attached educational material and subsequently completed questions on attitude regarding STI education. The mean score for attitude was 5.89 +/- 1.52 out of a total of 7 (median - 6). Around 73% of all participants had a positive attitude towards ST1 education. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that targeting the younger population by incorporating STI-related educational material into school curricula would overcome the stigma associated with these illnesses by raising awareness and improving attitude towards them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing community awareness about the transmission and treatment of COVID-19 will stop the spread of the virus. Pharmacy students are the potential facilitator to give community education about COVID-19 treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacy students' knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information about COVID-19 treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional study, recruiting 429 pharmacy students from three schools of pharmacy in Indonesia. The questionnaire about the knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information on COVID-19 treatment met the validity and reliability criteria. We defined the proportion of knowledge, behavior, and attitude of the students using SPSS (R) version 22. RESULTS: Most of the students are in the earlier years (46.63%), female (84.15%), find the information about COVID-19 from many sources of media (85.08%) including scientific articles and know information about COVID-19 transmission around their life area (76.46%). The students' knowledge about antiviral and plasma convalescent is good (>70%), the positive behaviors are related to the COVID-19 treatment information regarding to the antiviral and the provision of Vitamin C (>50%), and the positive attitude are related to giving information about the use of avigan (R), plasma convalescent, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and immunomodulator (>50%). CONCLUSIONS: As a future pharmacist, the knowledge of pharmacy students about COVID-19 treatment needs to be improved since earlier years. Furthermore, using the good knowledge about COVID-19 treatment, the positive behavior and attitude of providing information of the students, the community behavior and attitude will be improved. The high year students have a tendency for the good knowledge and positive behavior and attitude of providing the information.

AB  - Aims and objectives
   To examine the impact of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours and to test the mediating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between ageing-related stereotypic beliefs and health-promoting behaviours in older Korean people.
   Background
   Despite the growing attention given to ageing-related beliefs that can lead to better health outcomes in old age, little is known about the associations between ageing-related stereotypic beliefs, self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours.
   Design
   A cross-sectional, descriptive study.
   Methods
   A total of 123 community-dwelling older women were recruited from three cities in south-east Korea. Direct and indirect effects of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours were examined using path analyses.
   Results
   Ageing-related stereotypic beliefs significantly predicted self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours. A significant indirect effect of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on health-promoting behaviours through self-efficacy was detected, indicating that self-efficacy mediated the detrimental impact of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on health-promoting behaviours.
   Conclusions
   Ageing-related stereotypic beliefs function as a factor lowering self-efficacy as well as decreasing health-promoting behaviours. Self-efficacy mediates the influence of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on health-promoting behaviours, indicating that ageing-related stereotypic beliefs decrease self-efficacy which, in turn, could lead to fewer health-promoting behaviours. The findings demonstrate the significance of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs and self-efficacy in guiding the health-promoting behaviours of older people.
   Relevance to clinical practice
   Healthcare providers should play an active role in understanding ageing-related stereotypic beliefs and decreasing the perceptual barriers to health-promoting behaviours of older people. The development of nursing interventions to improve positive attitudes towards old age and self-efficacy is essential for enhancing health-promoting behaviours.

AB  - Background: The increasing development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in medicine driven by researchers and entrepreneurs goes along with enormous expectations for medical care advancement. AI might change the clinical practice of physicians from almost all medical disciplines and in most areas of health care. While expectations for AI in medicine are high, practical implementations of AI for clinical practice are still scarce in Germany. Moreover, physicians' requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the usage of anonymized patient data for clinical and biomedical research have not been investigated widely in German university hospitals.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate physicians' requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the secondary usage of patient data for (bio)medical research (eg, for the development of machine learning algorithms) in university hospitals in Germany.
   Methods: A web-based survey was conducted addressing physicians of all medical disciplines in 8 German university hospitals. Answers were given using Likert scales and general demographic responses. Physicians were asked to participate locally via email in the respective hospitals.
   Results: The online survey was completed by 303 physicians (female: 121/303, 39.9%; male: 173/303, 57.1%; no response: 9/303, 3.0%) from a wide range of medical disciplines and work experience levels. Most respondents either had a positive (130/303, 42.9%) or a very positive attitude (82/303, 27.1%) towards AI in medicine. There was a significant association between the personal rating of AI in medicine and the self-reported technical affinity level (H-4=48.3, P<.001). A vast majority of physicians expected the future of medicine to be a mix of human and artificial intelligence (273/303, 90.1%) but also requested a scientific evaluation before the routine implementation of AI-based systems (276/303, 91.1%). Physicians were most optimistic that AI applications would identify drug interactions (280/303, 92.4%) to improve patient care substantially but were quite reserved regarding AI-supported diagnosis of psychiatric diseases (62/303, 20.5%). Of the respondents, 82.5% (250/303) agreed that there should be open access to anonymized patient databases for medical and biomedical research.
   Conclusions: Physicians in stationary patient care in German university hospitals show a generally positive attitude towards using most AI applications in medicine. Along with this optimism comes several expectations and hopes that AI will assist physicians in clinical decision making Especially in fields of medicine where huge amounts of data are processed (eg, imaging procedures in radiology and pathology) or data are collected continuously (eg, cardiology and intensive care medicine), physicians' expectations of AI to substantially improve future patient care are high. In the study, the greatest potential was seen in the application of AI for the identification of drug interactions, assumedly due to the rising complexity of drug administration to polymorbid, polypharmacy patients. However, for the practical usage of AI in health care, regulatory and organizational challenges still have to be mastered.

AB  - Digitalisation in transport services offers many benefits for travellers. However, not everyone is willing or able to follow the new, more or less formal requirements digitalisation has brought along. Existing reviews on the intersection between Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and mobility cover a range of vantage points, but the perspective of how various levels of engagement with digital technologies affect access and navigation of transport services has not been addressed yet. In communication science, studying disparities in terms of ICT appropriation and their consequences is known as digital inequality research. This review paper aims at shedding light on what digital inequality in the context of transport services consists of and what its consequences are. To do so, we define and use a conceptual framework for the analysis of digital inequality in transport services. The review of the twenty-five papers, as selected in our systematic literature search, shows that there is a burgeoning interest in this topic. Vulnerability to digitalisation in transport services exists along dimensions of age, income, education, ethnicity, gender and geographical region. We find that motivations and material access get more attention than digital skills and effective usage. Nevertheless, literature acknowledges that having material access to technology does not mean that people benefit from what technology has to offer. Furthermore, the characteristics of ICTs impact one's possibilities to access digital technologies, such as how user-friendly a technology is. Data-driven and algorithm-based decision-making present a particularly pernicious form of digital exclusion from transport services. As digital technologies are progressively becoming indispensable to navigate the world of transport services, low levels of digital engagement may create a new layer of transport disadvantage, possibly on top of existing ones. Although digitalisation can be part of the solution to transport disadvantage, it can also be part of the problem. With network effects at play, what might start as a relative disadvantage may turn into an absolute disadvantage. Given the nascent state of research on digital inequality in transport services, much remains to be understood. Suggested research avenues include mechanisms of digital exclusion from transport services, the contribution of digital inequality to transport disadvantage, and importantly, solutions to mitigate its impacts.

AB  - Based on a qualitative scoping exercise in three British prisons, this article discusses digital inequalities experienced by prisoners and the potential opportunities that digital media in prisons offers for offender rehabilitation and resettlement. As they are currently denied access to online and social media that most of us take for granted, physically cut off from their communities, and unable to communicate with family and friends in ways that have become normal in society, we argue that prisoners experience profound social isolation and constitute one of the most impoverished groups in the digital age. Our results show that prisoners display high levels of both curiosity and enthusiasm as well as fear and reservation toward Internet-enabled technologies, depending on age and gender as well as the length of their sentence. On release from prison, they are not only faced with prejudice and poorer job prospects than the average citizen due to their criminal record, but their digital exclusion during incarceration may have compound effects and lead to supercharged digital and social exclusion. We argue that secure access would be highly beneficial to prisoners who pose a low risk to society, especially during the rehabilitation and release phases.

AB  - Objective To describe reported changes in sexual behaviours, including virtual sex (sexting and cybersex), and access to HIV/STI testing and care during COVID-19 measures in Panama. Methods We conducted an online cross-sectional survey from 8 August to 12 September 2020 among adults (>= 18 years) residing in Panama. Participants were recruited through social media. Questions included demographics, access to HIV/STI testing and HIV care, and sexual behaviours 3 months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes. Results We recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender. The median age was 28 years (IQR: 23-37 years), and 531 of 957 (55.5%) were of mixed ethnicity (mixed Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181 of 470) of cis-women, 58.4% (184 of 315) cis-men and 45.0% (27 of 60) non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% of cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, 230 of 800 (28.8%) participants reported decreased casual sex compared with pre-COVID-19 measures. Compared with pre-COVID-19 measures, decreased casual sex was reported more frequently during COVID-19 measures by cis-men compared with cis-women (39.2% vs 22.9%, urban/rural adjusted OR (AOR)=2.17, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.01), and by Afro-descendant compared with participants of mixed ethnicity (40.0% vs 29.8%, AOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.94). Compared with no change in virtual sex (16.8%), increased virtual sex (38.5%, AOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.88) and decreased virtual sex (86.7%, AOR=16.53, 95% CI 7.74 to 35.27) were associated with decreased casual sex encounters. During COVID-19 measures, HIV/STI testing could not be obtained by 58.0% (58 of 100) of the participants who needed a test, and interrupted HIV care was reported by 53.3% (8 of 15) of participants living with HIV. Conclusions COVID-19 measures in Panama were associated with a decrease in casual sex among cis-men and Afro-descendant people, while access to HIV/STI testing and care was seriously disrupted.

AB  - Objective To assess the association between public attitudes, beliefs, and information seeking about the COVID-19 pandemic and willingness to participate in contact tracing in Michigan. Methods Using data from the quarterly Michigan State of the State survey conducted in May 2020 (n = 1000), we conducted multiple regression analyses to identify factors associated with willingness to participate in COVID-19 contact tracing efforts. Results Perceived threat of the pandemic to personal health (B = 0.59, p = <.00, Ref = No threat) and general trust in the health system (B = 0.17, p < 0.001), were the strongest positive predictors of willingness to participate in contact tracing. Concern about misinformation was also positively associated with willingness to participate in contact tracing (B = 0.30, p < 0.001; Ref = No concern). Trust in information from public health institutions was positively associated with willingness to participate in contact tracing, although these institutions were not necessarily the main sources of information about COVID-19. Conclusion Policy makers can enhance willingness to participate in public health efforts such as contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks by helping the public appreciate the seriousness of the public health threat and communicating trustworthy information through accessible channels.

AB  - Anti-Roma prejudice is characterized as a unique form of prejudice because of its blatant nature. News about Roma has been overlooked as a key explanation for anti-Roma prejudice. This study aims to offer insight into news messages about Roma in a systematic and longitudinal way. To this end, I conducted a content analysis of 15 years of all television news stories (N = 181) about Roma in Flanders (2003-2017). Findings suggest a shift in patterns in news coverage of Roma. Although Roma are still underrepresented as a minority group on television and get a voice in only about one third of all news stories, uniformly negative news stories about Roma are on the decline in favor of more balanced news stories. Frames referring to blatant threats posed by Roma, such as criminal frames, are being replaced by more subtle frames. Journalists also more often portray Roma presence in society as a policy issue.

AB  - Research indicates that rejected individuals are better than others at discriminating between genuine (Duchenne) and deceptive (non-Duchenne) smiles (i.e., true versus false signals of affiliative opportunity). We hypothesized that rejected individuals would show a greater preference to work with individuals displaying Duchenne versus non-Duchenne smiles. To test this, participants wrote essays about experiences of inclusion, exclusion, or mundane events. They then saw a series of 20 videos of smiling individuals (10 with Duchenne and 10 with non-Duchenne smiles). Participants then indicated how much they would like to work with each target. Analyses revealed that compared to included and control participants, excluded individuals showed a greater preference to work with individuals displaying "real" as opposed to "fake" smiles. This effect was partially mediated by threats to "relational needs" (Williams, 2007) and fully mediated by threats to self-esteem. These results suggest that exclusion yields adaptive responses that could facilitate reconnection with others. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose/objectives More and more creative applications are used in the field of dentistry for clinical practice, patient orientation, teaching, and learning, in order to awake the students' interest and to enable a deep learning and its retention. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the impact and the effectiveness of the current simulation laboratories on the practical dental education. For this purpose, a survey on a new developed "AR-Demonstrator-App" was conducted during the orthodontic technical courses in 2017, 2018, and 2020 in the Department of Orthodontics (C.G. Carus, TU Dresden, Germany). Methods With this application, the students had the opportunity to see every single step with instructions on how to manufacture a removable orthodontic device in a compulsory technical course. At the end of these courses, the students were asked to anonymously fill out a printed questionnaire with 12 questions regarding the learning progress related to the app. Results The yearly mean Likert scores and their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals as well as the yearly median Likert scores suggest a very positive feedback about the use of the new application as an educational instrument. Despite the recognized predominant benefits of this app, the students concluded that they do not prefer the total replacement of the physical plaster casts and that a combination of conventional and computer-based education provided the optimum approach to acquisition of dental practical skills. Conclusions This survey indicates a generally positive attitude toward computer-assisted simulation systems, providing the facility for acquisition of knowledge and practical skills in a multimedia environment.

AB  - Rationale The gap between the nutrition education provided to medical students and the nutrition competences and attitudes needed for doctors to provide effective nutrition care is a global concern. The goal of this study was to investigate the curricular content on nutrition education in Latin American medical schools and to evaluate the self-perceived knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to nutrition practice of final-year medical students.
   Methods Eighty-five public and private medical schools from 17 Latin American countries were invited to participate in the study. Two close-ended online questionnaires consisting of 25 and 43 questions were sent to medical school directors. Quantitative variables were expressed as frequencies, percentages, mean +/- standard deviation, medians, and ranges.
   Results A total of 22 (26%) medical school directors responded, of which 11 schools (50%) offered stand-alone mandatory nutrition courses in preclinical and 8 (36%) in clinical years. The mean hours dedicated to nutrition education was 47 (range: 0-150). A total of 1530 of 1630 (94%) students from 12 countries responded. Students' average age was 25 +/- 3 years, and 59% were female. Most students agreed that improving patients' health through nutrition (91%) is important and that nutrition counseling and assessment should be part of routine care provided by all physicians (89%), but they lack the level of education and training required to address nutrition-related issues.
   Conclusions Positive attitude and interest in nutrition among final-year medical students is high, but nutrition education is not perceived as sufficient to adequately prepare doctors in the field of nutrition.

AB  - We investigate, through a fractional mathematical model, the effects of physical distance on the SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. Two controls are considered in our model for eradication of the spread of COVID-19: media education, through campaigns explaining the importance of social distancing, use of face masks, etc., towards all population, while the second one is quarantine social isolation of the exposed individuals. A general fractional order optimal control problem, and associated optimality conditions of Pontryagin type, are discussed, with the goal to minimize the number of susceptible and infected while maximizing the number of recovered. The extremals are then numerically obtained. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on behalf of Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

AB  - High levels of economic inequality are widely viewed as a key challenge facing both advanced industrial and developing economies. Country-level studies have consistently shown a negative link between income inequality and trust in others. This is typically attributed to greater social distance within unequal societies. Do we observe similar relationships within organisations? This is an important question because employee trust is associated with important outcomes for workers and organisations. We answer it by investigating the relationship between pay inequality and employee trust in managers at the workplace level using large-scale nationally representative matched employer-employee data from Britain. The article uses innovative machine learning methods to demonstrate a curvilinear relationship between pay inequality and trust. When pay inequality is at low to moderate levels, increasing inequality is associated with increasing employee trust but when pay inequality passes a certain threshold the relationship turns negative. The relationship is mediated by employees' perceptions of manager fairness and moderated by employee collective voice. The implications of these findings for theory, research methodology, practice and future studies are discussed.

AB  - Human resources are frequently emphasized as being critical to the school social system's survival. This study examined the effects of teachers' negative attitudes toward the organization for which they work at the level of school effectiveness. The study sought to determine how negative attitudes of secondary school teachers toward their schools harmed school effectiveness in one of Turkey's eastern provinces. The analyses revealed that organizational cynicism may reduce perceived school effectiveness by reducing teachers' participation in school decision-making. In terms of understanding how the negative effects of organizational cynicism on school effectiveness occur, the findings of this study had a wide range of implications in research, practice, and policy.

AB  - High rates of mental health problems are a growing concern in Czech higher education, negatively impacting students' performance and wellbeing. Despite the serious nature of poor mental health, students often do not seek help because of negative attitudes and shame over mental health problems. Recent mental health research reports self-compassion is strongly associated with better mental health and reduced shame. However, relationships between those constructs remain to be evaluated among Czech students. This study aims to appraise the relationships between mental health problems, negative mental health attitudes, mental health shame, and self-compassion in this population. An opportunity sample of 119 psychology students from a Czech university completed questionnaires regarding these constructs. Correlation, regression, and path analyses were conducted. Mental health problems were positively associated with negative mental health attitudes and shame, and negatively associated with self-compassion. Self-compassion negatively predicted mental health problems, while negative attitudes and shame did not. Last, self-compassion fully mediated the negative attitudes-mental health problems relationship, and partially mediated the shame-mental health problems relationship. Findings suggest self-compassion is essential for mental health in Czech students and associated with negative mental health attitudes and mental health shame. Czech universities can benefit from incorporating self-compassion training into their curricula to protect students' mental health.

AB  - The power of social networking sites increases in direct proportion with their functionalities so that the popularity and sweep of these sites greatly affect the users' prejudice and thoughts towards them. It is clear that social networking and social media have a large influence on the way people think and behave. In particular, Facebook has a broad participation all over the Internet. Through the years, the interface and functionality of Facebook have changed and transformed from a university-only communication tool to one of the most well known websites online. Educational institutions are increasingly using Facebook to connect with registered students and to grasp the potential one. This paper aims to demonstrate how the use of Facebook has changed over a time. That is to say, the purpose is to examine how the university students' opinions and usage of Facebook in education changed from the year 2009 to 2013. This research involves 382 students from two different universities in North Cyprus. The "Facebook Usage Ouestionnaire" was used to collect data. The result of this research indicated that perceptions and usage of Facebook have changed and expanded over the years and also Facebook has become an important tool for education.

AB  - This study investigates stereotypical portrayals of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGBs) on Dutch television and whether these portrayals relate to people's attitudes towards LGBs. Previous research shows that television programs in the U.S. contain many stereotypical portrayals of LGBs. These portrayals are both negatively and positively related to people's attitude towards LGBs. Because the Dutch culture is relatively accepting of LGBs it is interesting to see if they are portrayed differently than in the U.S. A content analysis showed that there are stereotypical representations on Dutch television but there are also people who 'just happen to be gay'. A survey among 272 participants showed that people who more frequently watch programs with stereotypical portrayals of LGBs do not have a more positive or negative attitude than people who do not. A mediation analysis showed that people who watch more television in general have a more stereotypical view of gay men, which is related to more negative attitudes towards LGBs.

AB  - Communication scholars have conducted a significant amount of research to explore the conditions under which exposure to narrative messages affects individuals' attitudes and behaviors. Perceived character typicality, defined as the degree to which characteristics of a character are perceived to be present among the portrayal's real-world counterparts, as well as cued typicality, defined as statements about a population that indicate whether the character or the narrative is typical or not, have not been examined in understanding the effectiveness of health messages. The present research explored the effects of perceived character typicality and contextually-embedded typicality cues on persuasive outcomes. It also investigated the underlying mechanisms mediating the impact of narratives with character or cued typicality. A 2 (character typicality: typical vs. nontypical character) x 3 (typicality cues: typical cues vs. nontypical cues vs. no cues) between-subjects experiment was conducted, focusing on the risks of sun exposure without applying sunscreen. The findings showed that a narrative with a character perceived as typical led to higher perceived realism, more positive attitude toward sunscreen use, and less message novelty than a narrative with a character perceived as nontypical. Typical cues had more positive impact on issue attitude than nontypical cues.

AB  - This study compares public attitudes toward nanotechnology in the United States and Singapore, using large-scale survey data in both countries. Results indicate that Singaporeans tend to be more knowledgeable about and familiar with nanotechnology than the U.S. public. Singaporeans tend to perceive greater benefits and fewer potential risks of nanotechnology, and to indicate greater support for government funding for nanotechnology than the U.S. public. Between the two countries, perceived familiarity with nanotechnology and the benefits and risks of the emerging technology tend to be interpreted differently through the lens of value predispositions (religiosity and deference to scientific authority) and therefore they indirectly affect public support. Specifically, the U.S. public tends to use religiosity to interpret benefits and Singaporeans are inclined to use religiosity to think about risks. Deference to scientific authority also moderates the impact of perceived familiarity with nanotechnology on funding support for the technology among the U.S. public.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine residents' attitudes about the influence and characteristics of academic radiology role models.
   Method: A Web-based survey was sent to the 35 residents in the 2007 Siemens AUR Radiology Resident Academic Development (SARRAD) program and to all other residents at their institutions. The survey contained questions regarding experiences with and desirable characteristics of role models, as well as the influence of role models in career decisions. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess associations between responses and expressed career choice.
   Results: Thirty of 35 SARRAD participants (85%) plus 103 non-SARRAD participants responded. Only 46% felt that there were enough role models at their institutions and 56% that there were sufficient role models in academic radiology. More than two-thirds of residents surveyed stated that they would be more likely to stay in academic radiology if there were more role models. The most desired characteristics of role models included availability, enthusiasm, integrity, and a positive attitude toward residents. Residents stating that they would choose academic careers were more likely to be research track (P = .0001), have more publications (P = .01), be less concerned with salary (P = .003), and be less concerned about politics (P = .047). Level of debt was not different between residents planning to choose academic careers and those with other career plans (P = .80).
   Conclusion: Role models in academic radiology play an important role in influencing residents to stay in academic radiology. Increasing the number of role models in academic radiology with characteristics valued by residents will encourage residents to stay in academic medicine.

AB  - Introduction: A growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to tobacco advertising among adolescents increases the likelihood of subsequent tobacco use. It is important to understand the process by which this occurs, in order to appropriately target factors for intervention. The objective of this study was to test whether attitudes towards tobacco advertising mediates the impact of advertising exposure on tobacco use. Methods: From an ongoing prospective cohort study of male adolescents (aged 11-16 at baseline), we recruited a subset of tobacco users and non-users to participate in an additional ecological momentary assessment (EMA) project (N = 164). Adolescents completed smartphone-based surveys 2-3 times/day over a 10-day period with items assessing their exposures and attitudes towards tobacco-related advertising. If participants reported exposure to tobacco advertising, they were asked about their attitudes toward it (how much they enjoyed it, liked it, and found it appealing). Results: Adolescents who reported a greater amount of advertising exposure during the EMA period were more likely to report past-30-day tobacco use at their next cohort follow-up (6-12 months later). Moreover, the impact of advertising exposure on subsequent use was mediated by attitudes toward the tobacco advertisements, as reported during the EMA. This effect remained after controlling for baseline tobacco use. Conclusions: By pairing EMA with long-term follow-up, we identified attitudes as a mediator between adolescent advertising exposure and subsequent tobacco use. Interventions to lessen adolescents' positive attitudes toward tobacco advertisements may help disrupt this impact.

AB  - Low family income during childhood is associated with multiple enduring negative outcomes, including poorer cognitive functioning in adulthood. However, mechanisms linking low family income during adolescence to adulthood cognitive outcomes are relatively unclear, as mediators of income-cognition links have mostly been examined separately. To address this, we conducted a longitudinal multiple mediation analysis of associations between adolescent family income and adulthood working memory and long-term memory using a large, national dataset (N = 6337). The data were sociodemographically representative of the United States (48.1% male, Madult age=29.01). Potential mediators were education attainment, family education attitudes, stressful life experiences, inflammation, and perceived parental warmth. We found that education attainment mediated the associations between adolescent income and adulthood working memory and long-term memory. Additionally, stressful life events mediated the association between adolescent income and adulthood long-term memory, whereas inflammation and family education attitudes mediated the association between adolescent income and adulthood working memory. These findings suggest that limited education, less positive attitudes toward education, more stress, and heightened inflammation in low-income families predict poorer cognition in adulthood, and that intervening on each of these factors may mitigate detrimental cognitive sequelae of low family income during adolescence.

AB  - In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), women's participation in breast cancer screening is low, and women are commonly diagnosed in advanced stages. This study investigated women's attitudes towards breast cancer screening, their use of health services in the UAE emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, and their preferred medium for breast cancer information. In this qualitative study, six focus groups were conducted with Emirati (n = 28) and non-Emirati (n = 26) women as Ras Al Khaimah is a highly multi-cultural region. Women were separated into different age groups (25-34, 30-44, 44+) so as to obtain perspectives of young (n = 16), middle (n = 19), and older women (n = 19). The focus group transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Women recognised that any breast change should be checked by a doctor, and that women with symptoms or those at higher risk may need to have breast screening earlier than the recommended starting age. However, participants wanted more information from doctors or other health personnel. Women had observed breast cancer information and campaigns advertisements in multiple media but recommended greater use of social media and WhatsApp to disseminate information. Overall, women had positive attitudes towards breast cancer screening but wanted more breast cancer awareness campaigns year-round and better access to screening.

AB  - Although many Veterans and active duty service members experience mental health problems, most do not seek out any sort of mental health help. Stigma (a significant predictor of treatment-seeking) has been documented among Veterans and active duty service members; however, previous research on stigma in these groups has primarily utilized correlational and qualitative designs. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of stigma toward mental health problems in Veterans and active duty service members using an experimental design. One hundred sixty-five Veterans and active duty service members were randomized to read a vignette that described a Veteran who either did or did not experience a mental health problem and did or did not seek psychotherapy. Results indicated that the participants held more stigmatizing attitudes toward the Veteran who was described as having a mental health problem, but not toward the Veteran who was described as seeking psychotherapy. Additionally, participants held more positive attitudes toward the Veteran, compared to the attitudes that they believed other military members would hold. Last, with this sample of Veterans and active duty service members, self-stigma toward seeking psychotherapy was found to partially mediate the relationship between perceived public stigma and attitudes. Implications for addressing stigma in military service members and Veterans are discussed.

AB  - We study the effects of consumer perceptions of four types of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities on their behavioral loyalty toward retailers. The four activities are environmental friendliness, community support, selling locally produced products, and treating employees fairly. Behavioral loyalty is measured by share-of-wallet (SOW). We control for other retailer attributes that drive attitudes and SOW, and examine how the market is segmented in terms of consumer response. We partition the total effect of CSR on SOW into a direct effect and an indirect effect mediated through attitude towards the store. These effects differ by CSR activity and customer segment. The effects on attitude are positive and positive attitude enhances SOW, so the indirect effects on SOW are positive. While we generally find positive total effects, the total effect of one of the CSR activities, environmental friendliness, is significantly negative for one group of consumers. The magnitude of CSR's total impact on SOW is not only statistically significant but also managerially meaningful in an industry where every share point carries a substantial dollar amount We characterize the customer segments and conclude with implications for how best a retailer can manage its CSR initiatives.

AB  - Immigration attitudes are influenced by types of patriotism and the perceived threat that immigrants pose. Previous research indicated realistic and symbolic threat mediates the relationships between blind and constructive patriotism types and anti-immigration attitudes in different ways. In two studies, the purpose was to replicate the mediating role of realistic and symbolic threat for the relationship between patriotism types and anti-immigration attitudes, and to determine if inducing threat in constructive patriots would result in immigration attitudes like that of blind patriots. In both studies, hypotheses were confirmed. Blind patriotism predicts realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anti-immigration attitudes. Realistic and symbolic threats provided moderated mediation between blind patriotism and anti-immigration attitudes. Constructive patriotism negatively predicts anti-immigration attitudes, but realistic and symbolic threats provide complete mediation for this relationship. The introduction of threatening information on future demographic changes had no impact on the relationship between blind patriotism, realistic and symbolic threats, and anti-immigration attitude. However, the introduction of demographic threat modified the relationship for constructive patriots, leaving no predictive negative relationship with realistic threat, symbolic threat, or anti-immigration attitude. The findings are important for understanding ethnic threat and the motivations to oppose immigrants in a changing United States.

AB  - Nowadays, companies who want to engage environment-friendly consumers increasingly rely on green-economy oriented campaigns. Such categories of (ethical) consumers are numerically increasing, and expressions evoking environmental friendliness are becoming particularly trendy. In this vein, words such as 'sustainability' have been variously recontextualized/reframed and have become an 'ought to' for media-savvy companies 'with a vision' - Walmart, the American multinational retail corporation, being a relevant case in point. It is no accident that, on the first Google page for 'sustainability', 'Walmart' proudly surfaces: http://corporate.walmart.com/global-responsibility/sustainability. The company has made an explicit commitment not just to expand the business but also to improve communities and enhance the sustainability of the products they sell, by encouraging more responsible production practices, while at the same time making product choices more affordable for customers, as reported on its website. However, as the world's largest company, Walmart is an easy target for attack mainly by environmentalists. Sometimes, Walmart gives its critics grounds for some legitimate criticism in a variety of fields ranging from the supply chain emissions to renewable energy and preserving habitat. Such criticism resonates across the media, owing to their 'lack of closure' (Laclau and Mouffe 1985), finalized to offer an unbiased perspective. Against this 'complexified' (Macgilchrist 2007) background, our study aims to examine, from a broadly Multimodal and Positive Discourse Analysis perspective, the Walmart website 'sustainability' pages with their variety of communicative strategies, advertising 'responsible' Walmart positive attitudes to fundamental issues like Energy, Waste, Products and Responsible Sourcing.

AB  - During the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, transmission chains were controlled through contact tracing, i.e., identification and follow-up of people exposed to Ebola cases. WHO recommendations for daily check-ups of physical symptoms with social distancing for 21 days were unevenly applied and sometimes interpreted as quarantine. Criticisms arose regarding the use of coercion and questioned contact tracing on ethical grounds. This article aims to analyze contact cases perceptions and acceptance of contact monitoring at the field level. In Senegal, an imported case of Ebola virus disease in September 2014 resulted in placing 74 contact cases in home containment with daily visits by volunteers. An ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with all stakeholders performed in September-October 2014 showed four main perceptions of monitoring: a biosecurity preventive measure, suspension of professional activity, stigma attached to Ebola, and a social obligation. Contacts demonstrated diverse attitudes. Initially, most contacts agreed to comply because they feared being infected. They adhered to the national Ebola response measures and appreciated the empathy shown by volunteers. Later, acceptance was improved by the provision of moral, economic, and social support, and by the final lack of any new contamination. But it was limited by the socio-economic impact on fulfilling basic needs, the fear of being infected, how contacts' family members interpreted monitoring, conflation of contacts as Ebola cases, and challenging the rationale for containment. Acceptance was also related to individual aspects, such as the professional status of women and health workers who had been exposed, and contextual aspects, such as the media's role in the social production of stigma. Ethnographic results show that, even when contacts adhere rather than comply to containment through coercion, contact monitoring raises several ethical issues. These insights should contribute to the ethics debate about individual rights versus crisis public health measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since entrepreneurship was conceptualised as a panacea for achieving inclusive growth in the "base of the pyramid" (BoP) regions, various ways have been explored to leverage this powerful tool, such as helping potential entrepreneurs build the resource base and capabilities. However, given the severe resources constraints in the BoP regions, such a goal is difficult to achieve. Besides, due to the high demands on personal competence, only a few people can benefit from this method, which fails to solve the problem of social exclusion in the BoP regions. Therefore, we aim to find a better way to leverage entrepreneurship to tackle the problem of the BoP regions by calling for more attention to the inclusiveness of entrepreneurship. Based on data of inclusive entrepreneurs in Zhejiang, China, we construct a three-stage model for inclusive entrepreneurship. We also apply Transaction Cost Economics to look for determinants that foster inclusive entrepreneurship and validate our main assertion that decreasing transaction cost significantly helps to increase the inclusiveness of entrepreneurship, and different phases of inclusive entrepreneurship (i.e., opportunity inclusiveness, participation inclusiveness, and sharing inclusiveness) are influenced by different sets of determinants of transaction costs.

AB  - This paper studies the influence of entrepreneurial spirit on college students' entrepreneurial ability and entrepreneurial values. Firstly, the impact of entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial spirit on entrepreneurial values is analyzed. Secondly, the role of entrepreneurial values in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Education (IEE) is analyzed and summarized under new media. Then, based on entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial spirit, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to investigate the entrepreneurial values of students in one university in Shaanxi Province, China. The QS analysis suggests that most respondents hold a positive attitude, and their attitude is on the rise. The QS results of "Reasons for entrepreneurial failure" show that 40.37, 31.9, 25.98, and 11.75% of respondents think they lack financial support, business skills, ability, and understanding of policies and laws, respectively. The QS results of "What factors influence entrepreneurial values?" reveal that 39.43% of the respondents chose the "Models of successful entrepreneurs," successful entrepreneur models can effectively encourage students to receive IEE, followed by 28.94% who choose "Achieve their own life goals.". In terms of "Solutions against entrepreneurial risks," nearly 70% of the students have chosen the negative options. In terms of "Which is the most important entrepreneurial quality?", more students choose entrepreneurial values rather than entrepreneurial quality, proving that students generally lack entrepreneurial values. Given these problems, corresponding countermeasures are put forward to strengthen entrepreneurial psychology and IEE, in an attempt to cultivate college students' entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability under the new media. The results provide some data support for the impact of college students' entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability.

AB  - By providing information on society at large, the media help to establish and maintain relations between various social groups, such as between younger and older people. They may also disturb the formation or maintenance of such relations, e.g. by stimulating the 'othering' of the out-group members. The aim of the present study was to trace how the different strategies of 'othering' are applied by Dutch news media in their portrayal of older and younger citizens. The analysis showed that the most notable discrepancies in the media coverage of the two age groups appear in (the nature of) their evaluation. While the negative descriptors of older characters relate more frequently to their (alleged) incompetence, the negative depictions of younger actors refer predominantly to their lack of benevolence. In the case of positive evaluations the reverse is true: older characters are more often presented as warm and younger people as competent. The results of the study are interpreted in the light of literature on social distance and (social) practices of 'othering'.

AB  - Phubbing is a kind of social exclusion and is used to indicate the interruption mobile phone usage has on a social relationship. Theoretical and practical evidence illustrates that parents' behavior have a strong influence on adolescents' deviant behaviors. The present study aimed to determine if adolescents' mobile phone addiction increase after being phubbed by parents, and examine effects of the mediating roles of parent-child attachment, deviant peer affiliation, and moderating role of gender. The study sample comprised 1007 adolescents (518 girls and 489 boys). Multivariable regression with bootstrap sampling was executed to test the moderated mediation. Results revealed that parents' phubbing was positively related to adolescents' mobile phone addiction (beta = 0.30, p < .001). Parent-child attachment and deviant peers was found to mediate the relationship between parents' phubbing, ab = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.04, 0.09], and adolescents' mobile phone addiction ab = 0.03, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.05]; while gender was found to moderate the indirect effect of parents' phubbing on mobile phone addiction through deviant peers; the indirect effect was stronger for boys than for girls. These findings illustrate that parents' phubbing is a risk factor for adolescent mobile phone addiction.

AB  - Direct training of selected individuals as disseminating farmers (DFs) can help to implement a farmer to farmer extension approach. This study systematically examines the relationship between social distance and the likelihood of information exchange, subsequently evaluating effects on awareness, knowledge, and adoption of drought-tolerant (DT) varieties of maize, disease-resistant varieties of groundnuts and conservation farming. Using a panel dataset from northern Uganda, the study combines matching techniques with difference-in-difference (DID) approach and employs two-stage least squares regression (2SLS) to identify causal effects. The study finds an increased likelihood of information exchange when the DF is female, regardless of the sex of the neighbour. The likelihood of information exchange increased when distance in farm size cultivated with maize was larger than the median in the sub-village. In terms of non-agricultural assets index, there was an increased likelihood of information exchange both when the distance was smaller and greater than the village median. Information exchange links improved awareness and knowledge for all of the technologies, but only increased adoption of maize varieties. Together, these findings suggest that social distance shapes the diffusion of agricultural knowledge even when DFs are selected by the community to be "representative" and reinforces that social learning can help to address informational constraints to adoption of agricultural technologies.

AB  - Digital tools facilitating everything from health to education have been introduced at a rapid pace to replace physical meetings and allow for social distancing measures as the Covid-19 pandemic has sped up the drive to large-scale digitalisation. This rapid digitalisation enhances the already ongoing process of datafication, namely turning ever-increasing aspects of our identities, practices, and societal structures into data. Through an analysis of empirical examples of datafication in three important areas of the welfare state - employment services, public service media, and the corrections sector - we draw attention to some of the inherent problems of datafication in the Nordic welfare states. The analysis throws critical light on automated decision-making processes and illustrates how the ideology of dataism has become increasingly entangled with welfare provision. We end the article with a call to develop specific measures and policies to enable the development of the data welfare state, with media and communication scholars playing a crucial role.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that conflicts between local people and Protected Areas (PA) can undermine conservation goals. This study explores attitudes towards Vieques National Wildlife Refuge (VNWR), Puerto Rico, USA, a former military site with a controversial political history, high ecological values and a toxic legacy including unexploded ordnances as a results of the area's former use as a naval bombing range. Our objective is to evaluate how residents perceive VNWR and to elucidate conflicts associated with former and current uses of the area through semi-structured and key informant interviews. Socio-economic factors and misconceptions about management were among the variables influencing attitudes about the refuge. Overall, many residents did not express particularly strong attitudes, but there were many significant differences among demographic groups. Older and less educated individuals, and those living longer on Vieques Island, had poorer attitudes about the refuge and its management while younger, more educated, short-term residents, and those employed in the tourism sector, had more positive attitudes. The most common reasons for expressing discontent were restrictions on access and rules limiting resource extraction. Some negative concerns were false impressions of current restrictions (i.e. many resources can be legally removed from VNWR), while some others were issues not under the control of the Fish and Wildlife Service (i.e. fishing rules are set by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). The results suggest that much more public outreach and education are urgently needed. We recommend that VNWR expand public uses where feasible and better-publicise formal regulations and the reasons for them.

AB  - The risk of COVID-19 transmission increases when an uninfected person is less than 6 ft from an infected person for longer than 15 minutes. Infectious disease experts working on the COVID-19 pandemic call this high-risk situation being Too Close for Too Long (TCTL). Consequently, the problem of detecting the TCTL situation in order to maintain appropriate social distance has attracted considerable attention recently. One of the most prominent TCTL detection ideas being explored involves utilizing the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to determine whether the owners of two smartphones are observing the acceptable social distance of 6 ft. However, using RSSI measurements to detect the TCTL situation is extremely challenging due to the significant signal variance caused by multipath fading in indoor radio channel, carrying the smartphone in different pockets or positions, and differences in smartphone manufacturer and type of the device. In this study we utilize the Mitre Range Angle Structured (MRAS) Private Automated Contact Tracing (PACT) dataset to extensively evaluate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in comparison to classical estimation theory techniques to solve the TCTL problem. We provide a comparative performance evaluation of proximity classification accuracy and the corresponding confidence levels using classical estimation theory and a variety of ML algorithms. As the classical estimation method utilizes RSSI characteristics models, it is faster to compute, is more explainable, and drives an analytical solution for the precision bounds proximity estimation. The ML algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM) utilized thirteen spatial, time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical features extracted from the BLE RSSI data to generate the same results as classical estimation algorithms. We show that ML algorithms can achieve 3.60%similar to 19.98% better precision, getting closer to achievable bounds for estimation.

AB  - In response to Covid-19, governments have imposed substantial restrictions on people's mobility. To encourage compliance, political actors have deployed direct communication strategies on social media. In this paper, we evaluate the legitimacy of the Swiss government's crisis communication on Twitter during the first wave of the pandemic. We examine and compare tweets regarding international and domestic travel, as well as social distancing. Using content and network analysis, we analyze the legitimacy of crisis communication by measuring its timeliness, consistency and congruence. We find that communication on domestic mobility restrictions has enjoyed a higher level of consistency and congruence, but has suffered from a disengagement of political parties, while the communication of international travel restrictions has become increasingly politicized.

LA  - English
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents were issued numerous, sometimes changing, safeguarding directives including social distancing, mask use, hygiene, and stay-at-home orders. Enacting these behaviors for the parent presented challenges, but the responsibility for children to follow protocol properly was an even more daunting undertaking. Self-efficacy is one of the most power predictors of health behavior and has been adapted to a context-specific crisis self-efficacy scale conducted on March20, 2020, captures real-time perceptions of parents as coronavirus anxieties peaked. The study reveals a relationship between self- and protective efficacy that is mediated by parents' assessments of how informed they are about COVID-19. It also examines the role of perceived knowledge on information-seeking and scrutiny of pandemic information found online. Important directions for future research to develop the protective efficacy construct emerge as well as evidence of the rich applied and theoretical value of a deeper understanding of the perceived ability to perform recommended actions to protect another.

AB  - A common feature among populist parties and movements is their negative perspective on the media's role in society. This paper analyzes whether citizens with a populist worldview also hold negative attitudes toward the media. From a theoretical point of view, the paper shows that both the anti-elite, anti-outgroup and people centrism dimension of populism contradicts the normative expectations toward the media. For instance, the assumption of a homogeneous people and the exclusion of a societal outgroup is incompatible with a pluralistic media coverage. The results of a representative survey in Germany predominantly confirmed a relation between a populist worldview and negative media attitudes. However, the three populism dimensions influenced the evaluations not in a consistent way. A systematic relation could only be found for antielite populism, which is negatively associated with all analyzed media evaluations such as media trust or satisfaction with the media's performance. This indicates that in a populist worldview, the media are perceived as part of a detached elite that neglects the citizens' interests. However, the results confirm the assumption of a natural ally between populism and tabloid or commercial media. Individuals with people centrist and anti-outgroup attitudes have higher trust in these media outlets.

AB  - A critical interpretive synthesis of strength-based models to promote youth resilience was undertaken to look for themes relevant to policy and practice in bettering youth wellness. A first round of analysis generated eight major themes. Critical analysis questioned the assumptions upon which models of youth resilience were built and what influenced proposed solutions. Additional literature on youth identity was explored to better critique the issue of normativity in relation to youth identity-formation, youth studies and youth work. The intersections that shape youth identity are mirrored against concepts of normativity devised by adults, and reinforced at multiple levels and spaces. Despite the best intentions of authority figures, institutions, the media and society at large, youth identities are often oppressed. Anti-oppression approaches and training are needed in institutions and programmes that serve youth to address the multiple intersections that can lead to marginalization, social exclusion, negative self-identities and poor mental health.

KW  - Burnout
AB  - Introduction: End-of-life care (EOLC) is necessary for patients who are not expected to live long. Nurses have positive attitudes toward EOLC, but they encounter difficulties in practice. That situation creates conflict, which can affect burnout. It is essential to manage nurses' conflict about their ability to practice EOLC by enhancing their individual strengths. Focusing on the role of self-compassion may help to prevent burnout related to the conflict about ability to practice EOLC.
   Objective: The study aim was to assess the mediating effect of self-compassion on the association between conflict about ability to practice EOLC and burnout.
   Methods: A correlational study was conducted with emergency department nurses who practiced EOLC. Selfreport measures of conflict about ability to practice EOLC, burnout, and self-compassion were obtained.
   Results: Negative aspects of self-compassion mediated the relationship among conflict, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization (burnout). Self-compassion did not mediate the association between conflict and reduced personal accomplishment (burnout).
   Conclusions: Negative aspects of self-compassion mediated the relationship between conflict and burnout (excluding reduced personal accomplishment). To prevent burnout, it is necessary to screen for nurses with low selfcompassion and to provide opportunities to change their cognitive recognition and disclose their conflicts.

AB  - Introduction: Radiographers' engagement in research is important for the development of evidence-based practice in radiography; however, radiographers' interest in research has rarely been reported. This study sought to ascertain radiographers' opinions about radiography research and investigate their involvement in research activities in four Nordic countries.
   Methods: This study was conducted in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. A study-specific questionnaire was developed in English and adapted to each language of the study sample, and the content and face validity of the adaptations were evaluated. An online tool was used to collect the study data. The questionnaire link was distributed in September 2019 to radiographers working in clinical settings in four Nordic countries (n = 4572).
   Results: The overall response rate was 14% (n = 662/4572). Research involvement was reported by 33% of the respondents; data collection was the main type of contribution. Radiographers who contributed to research were more likely to be male, have longer work experience, hold a master's or doctoral degree, work as managers and be employed in university hospitals. Nearly all agreed that radiography research is needed to promote the radiography profession and provide the evidence base for radiographic practice. However, only 14% were aware of the current research evidence regarding their professional field of specialisation, and 19% indicated that they developed current practices based on research evidence.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that, although radiographers had positive attitudes towards radiography research, their involvement in research and utilisation of research evidence in practice is low.
   Implications for practice: Strategies should be developed to improve knowledge and skills related to evidence-based practice and stimulate radiographers' engagement in research. (C) 2021 The College of Radiographers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected from children in eight Dutch elementary schools by means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire administered in the classroom. All children (mean age 11.47; N = 229) lived in the Netherlands; 50.2% had non-Western and 49.8% Western ethnic backgrounds. Children with non-Western ethnic backgrounds reported more negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians. These children perceived more parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender and showed more negative attitudes toward gender-nonconforming behavior by peers. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that cultural differences in attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women are partly mediated by differentially perceived parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender.

AB  - Background: Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 4.8 children per a woman and contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) of 29 %. The overall prevalence of modern family planning in a pastoralist community, like Afar region, is low (9.1 %). This study aimed to assess family planning utilization and associated factors among married women of Afar region, Eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 10-28, 2013 among 602 women. Multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Descriptive and multiple variable logistic regression analyses were done to isolate independent predictors on utilization of family planning using SPSS 20.
   Results: The overall prevalence of family planning utilization in Afar region was 8.5 % (6.2-10.7). Majority of the women (92.2 %) had used injectable. The most common reasons mentioned in the non-use of family planning methods were religion-related (85.3 %), desire to have more children (75.3 %), and husband's objection (70.1 %). Women who had a positive attitude towards family planning utilization (AOR = 4.7, 95 % CI: 2.1, 10.3), owning radio (AOR = 1.8, 95 % CI: 1.02, 4.18), and literate (AOR = 4.4, 95 % CI: 1.80, 11.08) were more likely to use family planning methods as compared to their counterparts. The increase of monthly income was also associated with the likelihood of family planning methods utilization. The odds of using family planning methods were higher among those with monthly income of $27-$55.5 (AOR = 2.0, 95 % CI: 1.9, 4.7) and > $55 (AOR = 4.6, 95 % CI: 1.23-17.19) as compared to women with the lowest category of monthly income ($27 and less).
   Conclusion: The low coverage of family planning in the region could be due to the influence of husband, religious and clan leader. Attitude of women towards family planning methods, possession of radio, monthly income, and educational status could influence family planning utilization.

TI  - Use of Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA for Assessment of Allograft Injury in Kidney Transplant Recipients During the Time of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
KW  - ANTIBODY-MEDIATED REJECTION
AB  - Background. Kidney allograft biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of rejection. Under the current extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which social distancing is key to limiting the spread of the virus, the model used to provide care to transplant recipients has undergone a very rapid transformation. In the spirit of medical distancing, we have been using the donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) test for screening for rejection.
   Methods. This article describes our experience with this approach between March 15th and May 20th, 2020.
   Results. This test was obtained for-cause in 23 patients and for monitoring in 9 patients. Normal results aided in forgoing biopsy in 63% of the patients for whom the test was obtained in the outpatient setting. The test is neither 100% sensitive nor specific for rejection; however, when used in combination with the available clinical information, it can be used for determining whether bringing in a transplant recipient into a medical facility is necessary.
   Conclusions. In the event COVID-19 becomes a long-term challenge for our community, noninvasive biomarkers such as the dd-cfDNA may become more relevant than ever in enhancing our ability to care for our transplant patients while maximizing the distancing measures.

AB  - This study investigated parental involvement in five Korean American families where there was evidence of successful heritage language (HL) maintenance in the second generation. The data in the current study were drawn from interviews of five Korean women who were first-generation immigrants to the U.S. and their daughters who were raised in the U.S. for most or all of their lives and were able to successfully acquire a high degree of competence in their HL. The data were analyzed for evidence of parental involvement in the children's HL education, which was categorised according to Grolnick and Slowiaczek's (1994, Parents' involvement in children's schooling: A multidimensional conceptualization and motivational model' Child Development 65: 237-252. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8624.1994.tb00747.x.) framework. The findings demonstrate that parental involvement in HL education was wide-ranging, taking the form of behavioural involvement (for example, speaking Korean at the home, teaching Korean to their children, watching Korean television shows with their children), cognitive-intellectual involvement (for example, exposing their children to formal Korean language instruction), and personal involvement (for example, explicitly expressing positive attitudes toward the Korean language and culture, expressing high expectations for their children's Korean language competence).

AB  - According to the theory of planned behavior (TPB), intentions to perform a specific behavior are the result of attitudes, norms, and perceived control, and in turn, intentions and perceived control are the main predictors of the behavior. This study aimed to test the applicability of TPB in predicting alcohol use in normative pre-adolescents. The sample was composed of 755 Spanish adolescents aged 11 to 15 (M = 12.24; SD = 0.56), 47.1% females, from 12 state secondary schools in Spain. The results of path analysis indicate that positive attitudes towards alcohol, favorable norms towards alcohol, and offer vulnerability (perceived control) are significantly positively related to intentions to use alcohol as well as negatively related to actual behavioral control (i.e., actual strategies to avoid alcohol use). In turn, intentions to use and actual control predict higher alcohol frequency and heavy drinking. Significant indirect effects of these antecedents were found on alcohol outcomes through the mediation of intentions and actual control. The findings suggest that the validity and applicability of the TPB in normative pre-adolescents depend on the severity of alcohol use and point to a need to consider negative social influence in decision making processes in early adolescence.

AB  - Objective Inappropriate use of antibiotics is one of the main causes of antibiotic resistance around the globe. The present study was aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among consumers. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2019 to September 2019. The participants visiting community pharmacies to buy the antibiotics were approached by data collectors. The descriptive analysis, Kruskal Wallis, and Mann-Whitney statistical tests were used for data analysis through SPSS. Results 399 participants at three pharmacies with male (n = 352, 88.2%), age (years) group between 34 to 41(n = 138, 34.6%), uneducated (n = 128, 32.1%), and higher education (n = 76, 19.0%) level of the participants were noted. Poor to moderate knowledge were observed; participants were unaware of the risk and misuse of antibiotics at all three pharmacies. By some means, a positive attitude noted, but the storage of antibiotics at home (Median = 2, IQR = 2) was preferred to use when needed. Most of the respondents didn't follow the actual dosage regimen as prescribed (n = 266, 66.7%, p < 0.05). Conclusion A lack of knowledge and malpractices toward antibiotics use among consumers were observed. Education and awareness of the public about antibiotic resistance is the need of the hour.

AB  - Introduction Clinical audit is an important component of safe and ethical practice but many clinicians cite barriers to engagement in audit. Methodology A total of 81 basic specialist trainees in psychiatry were surveyed in terms of their basic demographic details and their knowledge, direct experience and attitudes in relation to clinical audit. Results Among the 49 (60.5%) who responded, 57.1% had received formal training in audit, but only 20.4% had received more than four hours of training in their whole career. The medianpositivity scorewas 30 out of a possible 54 (range 12-40), suggesting that participating trainees were barely more than 'undecided' overall when it comes to positive attitudes to clinical audit. Age, nationality and specific training did not predict attitudes to clinical audit. Gender, years of clinical experience and direct experience of clinical audit did not significantly predict attitudes to clinical audit, but these findings are at odds with some previous research. Discussion Much work is needed in improving postgraduate trainees' attitudes to clinical audit, given that clinical audit is essential for good medical practice. Ours is an initial study of this area of training limited by sample size and the narrowness of the group tested. Further study of other specialities, higher trainees and consultant trainers would further enhance our understanding.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As interprofessional education opportunities become more prevalent within family medicine residency clinics, the benefit of the integration of pharmacy students is unclear in the current literature. Our study objective was to determine the impact of pharmacy student integration into a family medicine residency clinic on family medicine residents' attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration and satisfaction.
   METHODS: Twenty-two pharmacy students on clinical rotation were individually paired with family medicine residents for approximately 4-5 half days per week over a 10-month period. Residents and students were given a pre/post-validated survey on attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration. Satisfaction surveys were also administered to the residents at the end of the study period. Written components of satisfaction surveys were evaluated for commonly occurring themes.
   RESULTS: Matched survey responses were available for over 80% of the residents. Both pre- and post-survey responses showed positive attitudes toward physician-pharmacist collaboration. A statistically significant positive change was seen for one item in the family medicine resident surveys. Favorable written comments revealed positive themes toward pharmacy students providing mediation reviews, therapeutic recommendations, and patient education.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy students can be integrated into family medicine residency clinics while maintaining positive levels of interprofessional collaboration and providing a perceived benefit to the family medicine residents.

AB  - Background: Pain neuroscience education (PNE) programs have become popular among clinicians and are widely promoted through social and mainstream media.Purpose: To test the hypothesis that people with persistent pain are likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements and compare their responses to other social media user groups.Methods: A total of 1319 respondents completed an online survey and were directed into four groups: persistent pain, healthcare professionals with persistent pain, pain-free healthcare professionals, and pain-free controls. The survey included ten statements of popular PNE concepts. Feedback was invited by offering seven attitudinal response categories (three positives, three negatives, and one neutral). A two-step hierarchical regression model was used to assess the likelihood of reporting negatively.Results: Compared to controls, respondents from the persistent pain group were more likely to report negatively towards all statements (OR 1.6-2.16), except for two statements (#3 and #5). Healthcare professionals were less likely to report negative attitudes for 4 out of 10 statement (OR 0.35-0.58). Health care professionals living with persistent responded to most statements like the pain-free controls (besides statement #2, OR 0.59).Conclusion: People living with persistent pain are more likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements on social media, unlike healthcare professionals who were less likely to express negativity. Healthcare professionals living with persistent pain responded to most PNE statements like the pain-free control group. The study's main weaknesses include the lack of psychometric information of the questionnaire used, selection bias, small samples of the healthcare professionals and the overrepresentation of young social media users.

AB  - Prior studies have shown that bullying victimization is common during childhood and may have negative effects over the short term. Evidence is also emerging that childhood bullying victimization in the form of teasing may precipitate social anxiety in adulthood. The present study extended the field by testing for associations between adults' recall of four common subtypes of childhood bullying victimization and their current social anxiety. It also provided the first test of whether coping moderated those associations, if they were indirect effects through self-blame, and if sex differences existed. Data were collected from 582 students aged 23+ years at two universities in the UK. Collectively, and for social exclusion and relational victimization uniquely, the subtypes of bullying victimization did predict social anxiety. Evidence for hypothesized moderation and indirect effects was obtained but these varied by subtype of victimization (but not sex). The theoretical and practical implications of these results were discussed.

AB  - Snakes are controversial animals, therefore a better understanding of public attitudes is critical for their effective protection and future survival. The attitudes towards snakes of 951 adults in Greecewere investigated in personal interviews. Factor analysis revealed a dualmode of attitudes: respondentswere highly intolerant of snakes, while they supported their conservation at the same time. Respondents had high knowledge about the behavior of snakes, medium knowledge of their biology and were strongly affected by folklore. Structural models revealed that tolerance was a positive mediator of conservation. Knowledge about snake behavior and biology was positively correlated with attitudes towards snakes. Moralistic and naturalistic attitudes were positively, and dominionistic attitudes negatively, correlated with snake tolerance and conservation attitudes. Younger, more educated people were more snake-tolerant than older, less educated people. Females were less snake-tolerant and more conservation-oriented than males. These findings increased the understanding of human attitudes towards snakes and helped identify factors critical for their conservation. As such they could be used to design environmental education programs incorporating both information-based and experiential activities that will improve attitudes, behaviors and, eventually, the chances for the survival of these uncharismatic animals.

AB  - UNICEF's new Millennium Development Goals and Beyond (2015. http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/) focus on the needs of the largest marginalised minority, individuals with disabilities, challenging us to examine issues related to exclusion and develop strategies for making an authentic sense of belonging and high-quality early childhood education a reality for over 93 million children with disabilities (United Nations Children's Fund. 2006. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=150). A first step in addressing stigma and the exclusion of individuals with disabilities is to examine materials in environments, given that positive representation in books and media contributes to a sense of belonging, increased self-esteem, and greater understanding of and attitudes towards others. Historically, the portrayal of individuals with disabilities in the literature and media has been absent or negative while the number of children with disabilities in early childhood classes has steadily increased. In this study, the representation of individuals with disabilities in school materials was examined in 32 kindergarten classes using the Inventory of Disability Representation (Favazza, P. C., and S. L. Odom. 1997. Promoting Positive Attitudes of Kindergarten-Age Children Toward People with Disabilities. Exceptional Children 63: 405-418). Two classrooms (6%) had moderate representation, 22 classrooms (69%) had low representation, and 8 classrooms (25%) had no representation of disabilities. Implications for practice and research are presented in light of the current focus on disability rights and becoming a more inclusive society.

AB  - Both popular media and research often frame mass shootings as an individual issue having to do with mental illness or other individual differences. This work has unfolded in much the same fashion as that on other negative or anti-social behaviors-such as the individual pathologization of suicide or rape. However, what this work has shown empirically is that there are often a set of circumstances that are uniquely social that motivate such actions. Following work in sociology, which offers social psychological and cultural explanations for gun violence, we argue that mass shooter motivations reflect social conditions-especially those that instantiate toxic masculinity, social exclusion, and racism-conducive to these events. This article uses a computational textual modeling approach to analyze the distinct social logics that motivate mass shooters. To do this, we identify a sample of 27 publicly available mass shooter "manifestos," or documents left behind by shooters following their actions. Using topic models, we show that mass shooters exhibit a variety of preoccupations that underlie their actions. While shooters can exhibit a multitude of possible motivations, we find that expressions of masculine overcompensation, ritualistic responses to exclusion, and racialized status threat are prominent features of mass shooter manifestos, corroborating recent sociological explanations of mass shootings.

AB  - This article traces the shifts in German discourses about multiculturalism and the failed experiment of multiculturalism from the early 1990s into the 21st century by analyzing anxieties about emerging 'ethnic ghettos' and 'parallel societies' in Europe. In these discourses, 'Europe' functions simultaneously as an example for the failures of multiculturalism and as a bastion of western values in need of protection. The second part of this article shifts to a discussion on creative political interventions that expose these tensions and contradictions and emphasize the historic dimension of racialized exclusion in Germany and the European context. They describe the effects of social exclusion and propose (often syncretic) translocal forms of solidarity and activism. In their irreverent, playful and performative interventions, activists and artists develop strategies to counter the essentialist culturalisms that underpin the debates about European integration, multiculturalism and the crisis of multiculturalism in the German context.

AB  - Millions of people have been impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. High infection rates and death tolls, combined with social distancing measures, may have unintended psychological consequences on individuals. The goal of this study was to examine the interrelations between COVID-19 exposure, fear of COVID-19, and depression among a community-based sample of adult twins. We further explored whether fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between COVID-19 exposure and depression. 732 same-sex adult twin pairs (78.1% MZ, 21.9% DZ) completed an online survey examining their feelings in May 2020. About one-fifth of the participants reported having any COVID-19 exposure. Most participants (>80%) were somewhat concerned about themselves or their household members being infected by COVID-19. The average depression level was relatively low (M = 0.9 out of 6). We found that COVID-19 exposure was related to increased fears of COVID-19 and depression, and that depressive feelings increased with fear of COVID-19. The correlation between COVID-19 exposure and depression was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19. However, these associations were confounded by familial influences. As society navigates through the pandemic, it is essential to implement public health strategies to help individuals cope with the concerns and fears about COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Attitudes to aging have not previously been assessed in people with dementia. The possession of positive life attitudes into older age has the potential to induce resilience to health changes and may explain the discrepancy between self-reported and proxy ratings of quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to explore the attitudes of people with dementia to determine the main factors that predict these attitudes and any relationship that exists with self-reported QoL.
   Methods: Fifty-six participants with dementia were recruited from a memory clinic setting. The Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia, Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ), Memory Functioning Scale, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory, and Mini-Mental State Examination were administered. The AAQ was also completed by 86 community-dwelling older adults without dementia.
   Results: Participants with dementia displayed a significantly stronger endorsement of the negative attitude that aging is a time of psychosocial loss than those without dementia. Regression analyses suggest this negative attitude acts as a partial mediator in the relationship between the person's level of insight and self-reported QoL.
   Conclusions: Negative attitudes to aging had a direct impact on the self-reported QoL ratings of people with dementia. The view of aging as a time of psychosocial loss was most significant for people with dementia and suggests that negative stereotypes of dementia need to be challenged. In order to promote QoL, care should focus on abilities that the person retains rather than what has been lost.

AB  - Introduction: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement some containment measures to flatten the curve of the diffusion of the virus. The current study aims to investigate individual differences in compliance with these restrictive behaviors. In a sample of Italian individuals (N = 300), we examined whether sociodemographic factors, personality traits, fatalism, and fear could be considered as possible predictors.
   Methods: We performed a series of standard multiple regression analyses and proposed a mediation analysis to test the associations among variables.
   Results: Overall, our results suggested that men are less likely to engage in preventive behaviors, younger individuals are more reluctant to adhere to social distancing mandates, and fear has a functional role in predicting positive outcomes.
   Conclusion: The results of our analyses are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which infects the immune cells CD4, leading to its destruction. The disease develops in people with HIV to AIDS when the number of CD4 cells in the blood is less than 200. About 230,000 people are diagnosed with AIDS in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including about 10000 cases in Saudi Arabia. AIDS stigma is the social link between AIDS and negative perceptions and attitudes towards an individual or a group in a specific community. The collective evidence on the prevalence of the HIV stigma in the MENA region remains insufficient. Hence, this review aimed to evaluate the published evidence on the extent of AIDS stigma in the MENA region and the related outcomes. Searching of Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases was done up to June 2020. The majority of retrieved studies reported low levels of knowledge, as well as negative attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Some studies noted an inverse correlation between the level of knowledge and the negative attitudes of the participants. This stigma leads to denial, self-blame, self-isolation, failure to disclose HIV status, violence, and even suicide. Educational interventions are needed to raise knowledge and change attitudes in the media, schools, and healthcare professionals' communications. More studies are also needed to assess the prevalence and impact of AIDS-related stigma at the patient and society levels.

AB  - Menopause is an inevitable developmental event that women encounter at an age of 42-54 years. The drop of estrogen levels that accompanies cessation of menstruation is associated with multiple vasomotor, physical, neuropsychological, and sexual symptoms, which may hamper quality of life. This study aimed to examine the severity of psychological symptoms and their correlates among peri- and postmenopausal Emirati women (N = 60, mean age = 54.88 +/- 6 years). Participants were interviewed using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) and attitudes toward menopause scale (ATMS). In four path analysis models, vasomotor symptoms, weight gain, and fatigue had significant direct effects on symptoms of anxiety, depression (only weight gain and fatigue), and psychological distress. Fatigue significantly mediated the effects of vasomotor symptoms and weight gain on symptoms of anxiety, depression (only vasomotor symptoms), psychological distress, and memory problems. These models explained 47.6%, 44.5%, 56.6%, and 29.1% of the variances in anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and memory problems, respectively. Participants with more severe menopausal symptoms expressed more negative attitudes toward menopause though regression analysis revealed that only vasomotor symptoms could significantly contribute to ATMS scores. In conclusion, psychological distress is widespread among menopausal women, and it is associated with vasomotor symptoms, fatigue, and change of body composition (obesity). Psychological symptoms, along with vasomotor symptoms, express a key link to negative attitudes toward menopause. Therefore, interventional strategies that target psychological distress may promote coping with midlife transition and improve mental health among menopausal women.

AB  - Globally, the use of biopesticides is growing annually while the use of traditional pesticides is on the decline. North America uses the largest percentage of the biopesticide market share at 44%, followed by the EU and Oceania with 20% each, South and Latin American countries with 10%, about 6% in Asia and India. Although biopesticide growth is projected at 10% annually, it is highly variable among the regions constrained by factors such as regulatory hurdles, public and political attitudes, and limitations for market expansion. Microbial biopesticides have been registered in Canada for 35 years, but the number of registrations for commercial, restricted-industry and domestic uses has significantly increased over the past 10 years. The early Canadian biopesticides registered by pest control category were Bacillus thuringiensis in 1972 as the first bioinsecticide, Agrobacterium radiobacter in 1989 as the first biobacteriocide, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f.sp. malvae in 1992 as the first bioherbicide, and Streptomyces griseoviridis in 1999 as the first biofungicide. Between 1972 and 2008, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency approved registration of 24 microbially active substances with 83 formulations. The majority of the registrations (55/83) occurred since 2000 and at the beginning of 2008 there were 10 new products (a combination of new active substances, strains, formulations, and uses) under regulatory evaluation. This paper examines the evolution of microbial biopesticides in Canada illustrating how the actions of the government, the people, and the industry have led to changes in legislation, policy, and programming that spurred momentum for new microbial pest control products in recent years and created a model system for future microbial biopesticide discovery, development, and implementation that could be adopted throughout the world.

Representatives can use email, their political party's website, personal websites, Facebook, e-newsletters, weblogs and Twitter simultaneously to bypass the traditional political media. The author asks, what are the usage patterns of these web applications? What are the characteristics of the representatives who use these technologies? What are their attitudes about their use? Most previous studies have concentrated on one perspective (representatives or voters) or used one research method (questionnaires, interviews, hard data). This article is unique in that it combines several research methods: interviews with representatives regarding their attitudes toward the new technology and hard data from the Israeli Knesset's website regarding the MKs' use of web applications. The findings demonstrate that the Israeli representatives are no different than their colleagues in other parliaments. Young MKs and junior MKs are more likely to use web applications than older MKs and those with more seniority. However, coalition MKs use web applications differently than opposition MKs. Furthermore, the representatives have positive attitudes toward the use of web applications and consider them useful for communicating with the voters.

AB  - Background: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a major burden to individuals, impacting their physical, mental and social wellbeing. While PU prevention is traditionally regarded as a nursing issue, an interprofessional approach has been promoted as best practice. However, little is known about current practice or the knowledge and attitudes of the wider interprofessional team (IPT).
   Purpose: Pre-designed questionnaires were used to explore knowledge and attitudes with healthcare staff in the community.
   Methods: Questionnaires were disseminated to all healthcare staff within a community healthcare Trust predominantly via an online tool. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
   Results: The median values of all professional groups demonstrated satisfactory attitudes (>75%) and levels of knowledge (>60%) to PU prevention. However, there were differences within and between groups. Management staff demonstrated the most positive attitude to PU prevention (89%), followed by occupational therapists (OTs) and healthcare assistants (HCAs) (87%, IQR: 75%-> 89%). OTs demonstrated the highest scores for knowledge (69%, IQR: 62%-> 73%), while healthcare and rehabilitation assistants scored the lowest (58%, IQR: 58%-64%).
   Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that the majority of healthcare staff in a UK community setting have satisfactory levels of knowledge and attitudes in relation to PU prevention overall. Nevertheless, there were some differences between groups, albeit non-significant. There were also differences between sub-themes of the questionnaires, indicating a greater focus of pressure ulcer treatment over prevention. While PU prevention is widely regarded to be a nursing issue, these findings provide some indication of the potential for an interprofessional approach.

AB  - Annual vaccination is effective in reducing the harms associated with seasonal influenza. However, the uptake of influenza vaccine has historically been low in children. This paper reports a descriptive survey that sought to explore the beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge of general practitioners (GPs) and general practice nurses (GPNs) towards influenza vaccination in young children. Both GPs and GPNs working in the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD) in NSW, Australia, were invited via email, fax and social media to participate in the study. A total of 121 participants completed the survey. Most participants had a high level of support and knowledge of influenza immunisation in young children. Barriers to influenza immunisation in young children included perceived hesitancy in parents and competing clinical demands. The participants strongly supported funding of the vaccine, with 90.9% feeling that parents would be less likely to vaccinate their children if the vaccine were no longer free. Both GPs and GPNs differed in the use of influenza vaccination resources. The participants had a positive attitude to influenza immunisation in young children and strongly supported continued funding of the vaccine. Dedicated young children's influenza vaccination clinics run by general practices or in the community could reduce the impact of competing clinical demands.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to examine the multi-functional relationship among pre-service teachers' art appreciation, attitude toward science, technology acceptance, creative convergence competency, and teaching competency in STEAM education. Data were collected from 238 pre-service teachers in Korea and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that pre-service teachers' art appreciation, attitude toward science, and technology acceptance had a significant effect on their creative convergence competency. In particular, their attitude toward science had the greatest effect on the creative convergence competency, which had a significant effect on the teaching competency in STEAM education. In addition, individual characteristics (i.e., art appreciation, attitude toward science) had indirect effects on the teaching competency in STEAM education mediated by the creative convergence competency. Overall, the results of this study show the criticality of supporting pre-service teachers to develop positive attitudes toward art appreciation and science to foster creative convergence skills. In conclusion, we suggest that the current fragmented approach with strict disciplinary boundaries at teaching education institutions does not adequately prepare pre-service teachers to be competent in teaching STEAM education. More holistic and systemic approaches are necessary to support the trajectory of pre-service teachers' development of STEAM teaching competency.

AB  - Background: Common factors are important for the therapy outcome and also mediate the specific factors of therapy. As one of the common factors, client's expectations towards treatment have been understudied. Aims: The aim was to examine the pre-treatment expectations of outpatient substance abuse treatment clients (N = 327, 111 females, 216 males) and its impact on retention, effectiveness and satisfaction at 6-month follow-up. Method: Dependent variables included the clients' attitudes towards the twelve-step principles and participation, medical treatment and therapists' role. Results: An emphasis on the importance of medical treatment at baseline predicted dropping out. Similarly, it predicted a lower percent days abstinent (PDA(6)) at 6 months follow-up in comparison to those who did not consider medical treatment important for recovery. Percent days abstinent increased with a more positive attitude to mutual support. At follow-up, those who had assessed the therapist's role in recovery to be most important at the baseline were most satisfied with the treatment. Conclusions: The client's pre-treatment expectations have an impact on treatment retention and effectiveness. Further effort should be made to study how clients' image of treatment could be improved and also how the commitment of the clients with multiple problems could be improved.

AB  - Purpose - Cause-related marketing - linking product sales with donations to a cause - are popular with consumers because they produce warm-glow feelings (the positive route). But when they involve large donations, they may trigger consumer scepticism, reducing the warm glow (the negative route). Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether large donations in cause-related marketing can produce consumer scepticism and reduce the warm-glow effect and positive attitude towards the retailer.
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment varying the donation size (large, medium, small) in a cause-related marketing offer run by an office equipment retailer is set up. Hypotheses are tested using bootstrapping regression analyses.
   Findings - The negative route has the greater effect: scepticism towards the offer mediates the relationship between donation size and the warm glow. Furthermore, scepticism towards a large donation is higher (lower) for respondents scoring low (high) on altruism and high (low) on familiarity with cause-related marketing.
   Practical implications - When using cause-related marketing, retailers should choose their features and target audience carefully in order to reduce scepticism, e.g., small donations should be offered in promotions targeting consumers who are familiar with cause-related marketing and show low altruism.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the recent research examining the negative effects of cause-related marketing by explicitly conceptualising and measuring scepticism towards cause-related marketing. The findings are also valuable because they indicate the importance of a shift in focus, away from the conventional question of cause-related marketing effectiveness to the more specific and under-investigated problem of the appropriate core target consumers.

AB  - BackgroundIt has been argued that interpersonal contact is the best intervention for reducing negative attitudes and discrimination toward individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). In Israel, the Equal in Uniform project makes it possible for individuals with ID to serve alongside soldiers without ID in ordinary military units in the Israeli Defense Forces. The project provided the opportunity to examine the effect of contact on the attitudes of soldiers without ID.
   MethodsData analyses are based on data collected from 220 soldiers without ID via a self-administered questionnaire based on the Multidimensional Attitudes Scale. Of these, 138 were in contact with soldiers with ID as part of the project.
   ResultsA mediation model showed that the impact of contact with a soldier with ID on withdrawal behaviour was mediated by cognitive attributions and negative affect. Contact was directly associated with prosocial behaviour.
   DiscussionResults support the importance of contact between soldiers with and without ID to bring about improved attitudes toward the former.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding the importance of factors influencing the choice of active transportation modes (i.e. walking/cycling) may be misleading if we only concentrate on the direct and independent impacts of background variables (i.e. demographic, social environment and built environment factors). We hypothesised that background variables not only have a direct effect but also indirectly (through mediating roles of satisfaction with active travel and attitudes) associate with the choice of active mode. Previous studies have overlooked such indirect effects. Our contribution to the literature is to investigate direct and indirect effects of background variables on active commuting in university trips through developing an integrated structural model.
   Method: The data were collected through a questionnaire and in-person interviews with 682 students of Isfahan University, Iran. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to test the hypothesised model.
   Results: The results of SEM showed that the important psychological aspects of travel (satisfaction and attitudes) mediated the link between background variables and active commuting. SEManalysis highlighted that students who reported more positive attitudes and were satisfied with walking and cycling were more likely to commute by active modes. Female and working students were more stressed and hurried when commute by active modes, and demonstrated unfavourable attitudes towards walking and cycling, which was associated with diminished choice of active modes. Besides, students who travelled long distances or owned a private car were less likely to walk and ride bicycles.
   Conclusions: Policymakers could promote the culture of active travel in the university campus through training and advertising in the mass media or launching attitude campaigns at the university scale to mitigate the current restrictions. Policymakers could also strengthen infrastructure for cycling and walking to improve student satisfaction and attitudes towards active travel modes in the study area.

AB  - Undergraduate research (UR) is a high-impact practice (HIP) to engage undergraduate student in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), especially from underrepresented groups. UR experiences (UREs) can be integrated into the classroom, making authentic research experiences inclusive and available to all students. However, developing UR pedagogy can be challenging for faculty in resource-limited labs, such as community colleges and small liberal arts colleges. Often molecular biology research methods are expensive, time-consuming and need equipment not readily available or affordable in small schools. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most commonly used techniques in research labs and many UREs. We have investigated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as an inexpensive, accessible alternative to PCR for DNA amplification enabling the identification of microorganisms in the context of UREs. LAMP does not require expensive instrumentation or reagents and uses equipment commonly found in teaching labs. By performing the technique, students learn several key scientific skills that will be useful in their undergraduate or graduate STEM careers. We designed guided independent research experiences for several undergraduates that included the use of LAMP. Students successfully applied the technique to culture samples of common environmental bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus, and were in addition, able to detect both Salmonella and Enterococcus in directly sampled environmental waters. To highlight the accessibility and affordability of this URE, a simple boiling method was used for DNA preparation from environmental samples. Student response data show positive attitudes toward UR when LAMP is utilized as a research tool to tackle relevant biological questions. The feasibility of using simplified LAMP in UREs points to a potential, more expanded application to public engagement with science and broader and more inclusive interactions with the research community.

AB  - We used a nationwide demographic survey to study the relation between television exposure and women's empowerment in India. Ordinary least squares (OLS) results suggested that TV exposure improved Indian women's status. We used the propensity score matching (PSM) method to mitigate the potential threat of endogeneity. The results indicate that TV exposure is correlated with greater awareness of autonomy, greater financial independence, less unwanted pregnancy (birth control), negative attitude toward beating, a lower tendency of giving birth, a smaller family, and a lower preference level for sons.

AB  - Data availability is a persistent constraint in social policy analysis. Web 2.0 technologies could provide valuable new data sources, but first, their potentials and limitations need to be investigated. This paper reports on a method using Twitter data for deriving indications of active citizenship, taken as an example of social indicators. Active citizenship is a dimension of social capital, empowering communities and reducing possibilities of social exclusion. However, classical measurements of active citizenship are generally costly and time-consuming. This paper looks at one of such classic indicators, namely, responses to the survey question contacts to politicians'. It compares official survey results in Spain with findings from an analysis of Twitter data. Each method presents its own strengths and weakness, thus best results may be achieved by the combination of both. Official surveys have the clear advantage of being statistically robust and representative of a total population. Instead, Twitter data offer more timely and less costly information, with higher spatial and temporal resolution. This paper presents our full methodological workflow for analysing and comparing these two data sources. The research results advance the debate on how social media data could be mined for policy analysis.

AB  - BackgroundMany migrants suffer from discrimination and poor health in China. We sought to examine the associations between experiences of discrimination and self-reported health among internal migrants in China, as well as the mediators of social integration and perceived stress.MethodsThe data was obtained from a specific survey of migrants, as a part of the National Health and Family Planning Dynamic Monitoring for Migrants conducted in 2014. A total of 15,999 migrants aged 15 to 59years were recruited by a stratified, multistage clustered sampling procedure in eight Chinese cities. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was conducted.ResultsThe results indicated that experiences of discrimination were associated with worse self-reported health (beta=-0.32, P<0.001), less social integration (<beta>=-0.25, P<0.001), as well as higher perceived stress (<beta>=0.21, P<0.01). Both objectively measured socioeconomic status (<beta>=0.21, P<0.001) and subjective social status (<beta>=0.21, P<0.01) had significantly positive correlations with self-reported health.ConclusionsThe discrimination, social exclusion and perceived stress experienced by migrants have significant implications on their health.

AB  - Background Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of carbohydate metabolism characterized by recurrent hypoglycaemia and hepatomegaly. Management of GSD I is demanding and comprises a diet with defined carbohydrate intake and the use of complex carbohydrates, nocturnal tube feeding or night-time uncooked cornstarch intake, regular blood glucose monitoring and the handling of emergency situations. With improved treatment, most patients nowadays survive into adulthood. Little research has been performed on the impact of GSD I on daily life, especially in adult patients. Results In this multi-centre study we assessed the impact of GSD I on adult daily life in 34 GSD I patients (27 GSD Ia, 7 GSD Ib) between 17 and 54 years (median 26 years) using a self-designed questionnaire that specifically focused on different aspects of daily life, such as job situation, social life, sports, travelling, composition of the household, night-time and day-time dietary management and disease monitoring as well as the patient's attitude towards the disease. At the time of investigation, the majority of patients either attended school or university or were employed, while 3 patients (9%) were out of work. Most patients ranked GSD I as a disease with moderate severity and disease burden. Dietary treatment was considered challenging by many, but the vast majority of patients considered life with GSD I as well-manageable. Conclusions Although the management of GSD I poses a significant burden on daily life, most patients live an independent adult life, have a positive attitude towards their disease and seem to cope well with their situation.

AB  - Background: News media coverage of antimask protests, COVID-19 conspiracies, and pandemic politicization has overemphasized extreme views but has done little to represent views of the general public. Investigating the public's response to various pandemic restrictions can provide a more balanced assessment of current views, allowing policy makers to craft better public health messages in anticipation of poor reactions to controversial restrictions.
   Objective: Using data from social media, this infoveillance study aims to understand the changes in public opinion associated with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (eg, business and school closures, regional lockdown differences, and additional public health restrictions, such as social distancing and masking).
   Methods: COVID-19-related tweets in Ontario (n=1,150,362) were collected based on keywords between March 12 and October 31, 2020. Sentiment scores were calculated using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) algorithm for each tweet to represent its negative to positive emotion. Public health restrictions were identified using government and news media websites. Dynamic regression models with autoregressive integrated moving average errors were used to examine the association between public health restrictions and changes in public opinion over time (ie, collective attention, aggregate positive sentiment, and level of disagreement), controlling for the effects of confounders (ie, daily COVID-19 case counts, holidays, and COVID-19-related official updates).
   Results: In addition to expected direct effects (eg, business closures led to decreased positive sentiment and increased disagreements), the impact of restrictions on public opinion was contextually driven. For example, the negative sentiment associated with business closures was reduced with higher COVID-19 case counts. While school closures and other restrictions (eg, masking, social distancing, and travel restrictions) generated increased collective attention, they did not have an effect on aggregate sentiment or the level of disagreement (ie, sentiment polarization). Partial (ie, region-targeted) lockdowns were associated with better public response (ie, higher number of tweets with net positive sentiment and lower levels of disagreement) compared to province-wide lockdowns.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a rapid and flexible method of evaluating the public response to pandemic restrictions using near real-time social media data. This information can help public health practitioners and policy makers anticipate public response to future pandemic restrictions and ensure adequate resources are dedicated to addressing increases in negative sentiment and levels of disagreement in the face of scientifically informed, but controversial, restrictions.

AB  - How does Eastern Europe contribute to the debate over EU's democratic deficit from an electoral perspective? Does Eastern Europe challenge our theoretical understanding of what motivates European citizens to participate and express their opinions in European Parliamentary elections? While there is no overarching consensus in the academic community regarding these questions, this essay aims to illustrate how a deeper understanding of one post-communist case and a bottom-up perspective on attitudes and political behavior in one locale, Romania, allowed the researcher to delve deeper into the taken-for-granted dynamics that European citizens from the South, East, and West engage in when voting in European Parliamentary elections. The approach of ethnographic sensibility mentioned in the workshop's discussions and illustrated in several contributions to this volume (see e.g. Kubik 2013; Knott 2015) constitutes then a useful starting point in deconstructing conventional knowledge. Moreover, during the process of moving up the ladder of generality and building inferences from one case study to a region, Eastern Europe still shares enough characteristics to deserve its own dummy variable, so to speak, in large-N continent-wide analyses covering the 2004 and 2009 European Parliamentary (EP) elections. Yet, as Joshua Tucker (2015) mentions in his contribution, it is unclear whether the historical legacies discussed at the workshop and further elaborated on by Grigore Pop-Eleches (2015) will continue to play a role in a priori distinguishing Eastern Europeans' political attitudes and behaviors from other EU citizens in the South or West in future EP elections.

AB  - The global outbreak of COVID-19 has led to governments and local authorities implementing nationwide lockdowns in an attempt to encourage social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus. Only essential businesses have been able to remain open, with non-essential businesses and activities either closing or restricting services. With no group training sessions allowed, canceled matches, an inability to work and the closure of eating establishments, Rugby Union players have experienced disruption to their daily lives. Two surveys were distributed among Rugby Union athletes to explore (1) the influence of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on Rugby Union players' nutrition and training habits and (2) how nutrition habits in New Zealand Rugby Union players change after lockdown restrictions were lifted. In total, 258 respondents completed Survey 1 (84.1% male, 26.4% professional/semi-professional). Of the respondents, 58% indicated they lived with family during lockdown. Total food intake was reported to be higher in 36% of respondents. Fruit and vegetable intake was lower (17%) and packaged/convenience food intake higher (26%) in a minority of respondents. In total, 106 respondents completed Survey 2 (84.9% male, 34.0% professional/semi-professional). Of the respondents, 72% prepared and 67% purchased their own food. Less than half of respondents consumed high-protein food more than twice daily either during or following lockdown. Compared to during lockdown, motivation to train and exercise was greater in 58% of respondents following lockdown. Dieticians and nutritionists within clubs provided most of the nutrition knowledge to athletes however other unreliable sources were identified, such as social media and family members. The ongoing pandemic has presented significant challenges for athletes concerning training and nutrition habits and the current study provides some insight into these. Coaches and performance staff should ensure athletes receive appropriate nutritional and training support whilst being aware of the unique demands the individuals' may face.

AB  - Background and Objective: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has exerted great efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This research aims to scrutinize the outlook, awareness, and customs of Saudi undergraduate students regarding COVID-19.
   Methods: The current cross-sectional study comprises 178 undergraduate students in the Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences. The data were collected from online Google form questionnaires. The differences were picked out of the questionnaires, and the mean scores of the differences were duly assessed. The variables associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were evaluated; moreover, a comparative study was conducted on these variables in different faculty departments. ANOVA, Student's t-test, and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess the data on knowledge, attitude, and practice.
   Results: Most of the undergraduate students were well acquainted with COVID-19. We obtained the mean knowledge score for COVID-19 to be 3.08 +/- .82 (range: 1-5), indicating good knowledge. The attitude means the score was 3.02 +/- .61 (range: 0-4), implying good positive attitudes. On assessing the mean score of practices, it was found 5 +/- .47 (range: 0-7), pointing towards perfect practices. There were no significant differences between males and females regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward COVID-19 (p-value < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Students of Applied Medical Sciences are knowledgeable about COVID-19. Health education programs should be focused on protection and safety from COVID-19 for Applied Medical Sciences students, especially Medical Rehabilitation Sciences and Radiology. Hand hygiene awareness programs must be conducted for undergraduate students. Infection control should be part of the undergraduate applied for medical sciences curriculum program.

AB  - Although the rapid progress of the global economy and technology has advanced human civilization, it has also caused tremendous damage to the global ecological environment. Therefore, humans are thinking seriously about the environment and its sustainable development. One of the solutions to environmental problems is new energy vehicles. Since the promulgation of the Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2012-2020) by the General Office of the State Council, the Chinese government has determined a strategy of pure electric driving technology. The electric vehicle market in China has expanded rapidly, making China the largest electric vehicle market in the world. Hence, research on the situation of electric vehicles in China is highly necessary and of reference value for other countries to develop electric vehicles. As a result, it is a critical issue to develop low-carbon, energy-saving, and intelligent electric vehicles to reduce the environmental impact. This paper establishes a theoretical framework based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), technology acceptance model (TAM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT), and explores the key factors influencing consumers' purchase of electric vehicles. The results show that: The application of the key factor model constructed in this study to consumers' behavioral intention regarding electric vehicle purchase is acceptable. According to the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis results, (1) In terms of behavioral intention: Consumers' control over the resources required to purchase electric vehicles has the highest influence on their behavioral intention, while consultation opinions from consumers' surroundings also significantly affect their behavioral intention to purchase electric vehicles. In addition, consumers' environmental awareness and acceptance of technology products will also influence their behavioral intention. (2) In terms of attitude toward behavior: When consumers believe that electric vehicles are more beneficial at the individual, environment or national level, or they believe that the usage of electric vehicles is simpler and more convenient, they will show a more positive attitude towards the purchase of electric vehicles. Consumers consider electric vehicles as forward-looking technology products with similar driving operation and usage cost compared to traditional vehicles. (3) In terms of regulations: The opinions of consumers' family members, friends, colleagues or supervisors do not significantly affect the attitude or behavior of consumers regarding electric vehicle purchase. The key factors influencing consumers' purchase of electric vehicles are not only applicable to the design and development of electric vehicles that better suit consumer demands, but also serve as a theoretical basis for the popularization of electric vehicles, and provide a reference for consumers' choice and purchase. Therefore, the government and relevant manufacturers need to consider increasing the publicity of electric vehicles and launch more attractive battery and charging schemes to attract consumers and promote the sustainable development of the automobile industry.

AB  - Background A gap between the attitude towards evidence-based medicine (EBM), knowledge and awareness has been reported among physicians from different parts of the world. However, no investigation on Romanian physicians is available in the scientific literature. Our study aimed, firstly, to assess EBM awareness and the knowledge used by Romanian physicians, and, secondly, to compare resident trainees with specialists. Methods Romanian trainee and specialist physicians were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. The study tool was an online questionnaire designed to explore their awareness, knowledge, usefulness, the attitude in medical documentation, and the use of professional EBM resources. Data were collected by Google Form from January 1st to April 30th, 2017, respecting the responders' anonymity. Two groups of physicians were investigated as trainees and specialists, respectively. Descriptive statistics (number, percentage, median and interquartile range) was used to describe the survey-related variables. Statistical significance on qualitative data was calculated with the Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or the Z-test for proportions. Results Two hundred and 50 physicians participated in this study (68% trainees vs. 32% specialists). In both groups, a significantly high percentage was represented by women as compared to men (trainees 72.4%, specialists 70%). The correct definition of EBM was identified by most respondents (75.6%). Affirmatively, both trainees and specialists always looked at levels of evidence when reading scientific literature, but a small percentage (6.5% trainees and 3% specialists) adequately identified the uppermost types of evidence in the hierarchy. Almost a quarter of the respondents shared the name of mobile EBM resources that they used to support the daily practice. Only six out of the 49 listed mobile resources met the EBM criteria. Conclusions The participants proved to have limited knowledge of EBM and a positive attitude towards the concept. They made use of mobile medical resources without understanding which of these were evidence-based.

AB  - Objectives Positive attitudes towards end-of-life care are essential among nursing students to adequately support terminally ill patients and enable students to feel confident about providing end-of-life care. This study aimed to determine nursing students' attitudes towards caring for terminally ill patients, as well as the associations between these attitudes and year of study, exposure to terminally ill people, self-perceived nursing skills and subjective impact of instruction. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting A health sciences school in Switzerland. Participants All preparatory students, first-year nursing students and third-year nursing students were invited to participate; 178 agreed to participate. Primary outcome measure Attitudes towards terminally ill patients were assessed using the Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale, Form B (FATCOD, Form B), as the primary outcome. Secondary measures were gender, age, year of study, number of terminally ill persons encountered, self-perceived palliative care nursing skills and subjective impact of instruction. Results Mean FATCOD, Form B score was 117.7 (SD: 9.8, median: 118.0). Better attitudes towards terminally ill patients were significantly associated with being aged 24-26 years (beta=6.97, 95% CI 2.00 to 11.95, p=0.006), year of study (beta=3.47, 95% CI 1.69 to 5.25, p<0.001), professional encounters with terminally ill patients (beta=3.59, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.95, p<0.001) and self-perceived palliative care nursing competence (beta=1.23, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.04; p=0.003). In the multivariate analysis, professionally encountering terminally ill patients remained significant (beta=3.00; 95% CI 1.43 to 4.57; p<0.001). Conclusions Nursing students' attitudes towards caring for terminally ill patients were positive and improved as their year of study progressed. Professional exposure to terminally ill patients was the strongest factor, followed by private encounters, self-perceived palliative care nursing skills, year of study and age.

AB  - The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) The Real Cost campaign advertisements (ads) have targeted U.S. youth with messages designed to prevent and reduce tobacco use. This study examined exposure to The Real Cost campaign, including ad and slogan recall, and associations with attitudes and risk perceptions among U.S. adolescents. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 13 to 17 years (n = 1125) surveyed by phone from October 2014 to June 2015. We assessed aided recall of and attitudes toward four campaign ads and the one slogan. Logistic regression models assessed whether aided recall of The Real Cost ads or slogan was associated with perceived likelihood of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking. Most (88%) adolescents reported seeing or hearing at least one of four ads for The Real Cost, and 54% recalled The Real Cost slogan. The majority of adolescents reported more negative attitudes toward tobacco products after seeing or hearing the ads. Recall of any The Real Cost ad was significantly associated with greater perceptions of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking (Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) = 5.58, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.20-25.90). The FDA's The Real Cost campaign has achieved very high reach and is associated with more negative attitudes toward tobacco products and greater risk perceptions of cigarette smoking among U.S. adolescents.

AB  - Introduction This study examined how health warning labels (HWL) on a waterpipe venue menu captured and held the attention of consumers and influenced waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Aims and Methods A randomized experiment (N = 96) of young adult waterpipe smokers was conducted in an immersive virtual reality laboratory. Participants viewed one of two virtual reality scenarios, a menu with an HWL and nicotine concentration or menu without an HWL and nicotine concentration. Eye-tracking metrics were collected, and participants completed posttest questionnaires on demographics, tobacco use history, and WTS attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. T-tests were used to assess group differences, and a mediation analysis conducted to examine the relationship between the HWL and intention to quit WTS. Results Participants in the HWL group demonstrated greater visual attention to the warning and nicotine areas and less visual attention to the flavor and ingredients areas of the menu compared to the control group. The HWL group demonstrated greater negative attitudes toward WTS (p = .002), greater perceived risk of decreased lung function (p = .026), and greater intention to quit WTS (p = 0.003). The mediation model indicated the relationship between the HWL on a menu and intention to quit WTS was mediated by an increase in negative attitudes toward WTS. Conclusions The HWLs on a menu captured and held the attention of consumers and increased negative attitudes, perceptions of health risk, and intention to quit WTS indicating potential benefit of including a warning label or nicotine concentration on menus to correct misperceptions of WTS. Implications The study contributes to the broader literature on communicating the harms and risks of WTS. The findings suggest that HWL and nicotine concentration on waterpipe venue menus attract attention from consumers in environments comparable to the real world and the strategy warrants further exploration as a targeted policy intervention to educate the public and reduce the health burden of WTS.

AB  - This study investigated the interplay of consumer involvement, NFC, and emotional reactions when exposed to fake news on social media, and subsequently to an organizational rebuttal. In doing so, a 2 (rebuttal evidence type: story vs. informational) x 2 (involvement: low vs. high) x 2 (need for cognition, NFC: low vs. high) experiment was conducted. Results showed that individuals high in involvement and NFC perceived favorably the rebuttal message as well as exhibited positive attitudes and higher donation intentions toward the affected organization when it responded to the rumors. A significant two-way interaction between rebuttal evidence type and involvement indicated that highinvolved consumers reacted positively toward the informational evidence, whereas low-involved ones preferred storytelling evidence and this increased their donation intentions. Following an organizational refutation, it was demonstrated that the effects of negative emotions (e.g., anger, fear, sadness, disgust, anxiety) were mitigated while those of positive emotions (e.g., hope, happiness, empathy, contentment, interest) increased, leading to favorable attitudinal, donation, and social media engagement reactions. Also, individuals high in involvement and NFC displayed more positive affective reactions after receiving a rebuttal message than their low-involved and low-NFC counterparts. The mediation analyses revealed that positive emotions were significant mediators of the effects of the storybased refutation, high-involved, and high-NFC consumers on the latter's evaluations of the targeted organization.

AB  - Online news is often associated with high interactivity but low credibility. The increase in online news consumption suggests that people turn to the Internet for news because of the attractiveness of digital media even though some content is less than credible. Does web interactivity outweigh news credibility? This study aims to uncover which factor has a greater effect on how people consume online news in Malaysia; a country known for its media control. Using purposive sampling to recruit Malaysian news audience, we conducted an online survey on 520 respondents and later used Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyse the data. The findings show that both interactivity and credibility were significant predictors to people's positive attitude towards online news and its consumption. The strength of the relationship linking credibility and news consumption was higher than the relationship between interactivity and news consumption. We also found that attitude towards online news was a significant mediator for both relationships; suggesting its influence on the increasing use of the Internet for news. Our data confirmed the importance of web interactivity and news credibility. However, news credibility is of greater importance than interactivity in predicting online news consumption among Malaysians. Finally, implications of the study are discussed in relation to the practice of media control and the threat of fake news dissemination on social media in Malaysia.

AB  - The global impact of dementia is a key healthcare priority, and although it is possible to live well with dementia, public perception is often negative. Serious digital games are becoming a credible delivery method to educate/train individuals in the business and health sectors and to challenge perceptions. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital game prototype on individual attitudes towards dementia. A digital game to improve public knowledge and understanding about dementia (www.dementiagame.com) was co-designed with people living with dementia and student nurses. The Game was evaluated using a pretest-posttest design. Participants for the evaluation were recruited via social media in one UK university and completed the Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) before and after playing the game. Overall, 457 individuals completed both pre and post test questionnaires. The total ADQ score demonstrated a significant improvement in positive attitudes (p < 0.001), and both subscales of Hope and Recognition of Personhood also saw significant improvements (p < 0.001). The use of a serious digital game has demonstrated a significant effect on the respondents' perceptions of dementia. Overall, there was a more positive view of the abilities of people with dementia and what their capabilities were. They were also more likely to be recognised as unique individuals with the same values as any other person. The benefit of using digital gaming to improve perceptions of dementia has been demonstrated, nonetheless further research is required to reach a more diverse population and test as a Randomised Control Trial to provide definitive evidence for use in policy and practice.

AB  - Imparting a positive attitude toward social determinants of health among medical students has remained a challenge in medical education. 'ibis pedagogical exercise attempted to use a toxic tour with participant photography technique to impart environmental health education as part of the community medicine curriculum for medical students. In collaboration with a local environmental health nongovernmental organization, faculty from two medical colleges took a set of 13 medical students to Elmore thermal power plants as a part of a toxic tour to view the air and water pollution caused due to the operation of the power plants. The students were instructed to capture photographs of the environmental hazards using their mobile phone cameras and share them on a social media platform. Immediately after the tour, the students discussed their experiences with the faculty: Two weeks after the toxic tour, the students engaged in a focus group discussion in which they discussed their experiences, advantages, and disadvantages of the toxic tour and participant photography method and their attitudes toward environmental health. This pedagogical exercise led to the active engagement of the students with the environmental hazards in the area. 'lhey shared 70 photographs on the social media platform. In reflection, students described that they found the method very useful to actively engage with the environment, look for and find the hazards, revisit, and reflect on the photos, and use the photos to share the knowledge and experience. They also demonstrated a positive social determinants and public health attitude during the discussions. Participant photography technique during a toxic tour can impart affective domain of learning related to environmental health among medical students.

AB  - Background: An emerging model for sexuality education is the rights-based approach, which unifies discussions of sexuality, gender norms, and sexual rights to promote the healthy sexual development of adolescents. A rigorous evaluation of a rights-based intervention for a broad population of adolescents in the U.S. has not previously been published. This paper evaluates the immediate effects of the Sexuality Education Initiative (SEI) on hypothesized psychosocial determinants of sexual behavior.
   Methods: A cluster-randomized trial was conducted with ninth-grade students at 10 high schools in Los Angeles. Classrooms at each school were randomized to receive either a rights-based curriculum or basic sex education (control) curriculum. Surveys were completed by 1,750 students (N = 934 intervention, N = 816 control) at pretest and immediate posttest. Multilevel regression models examined the short-term effects of the intervention on nine psychosocial outcomes, which were hypothesized to be mediators of students' sexual behaviors.
   Results: Compared with students who received the control curriculum, students receiving the rights-based curriculum demonstrated significantly greater knowledge about sexual health and sexual health services, more positive attitudes about sexual relationship rights, greater communication about sex and relationships with parents, and greater self-efficacy to manage risky situations at immediate posttest. There were no significant differences between the two groups for two outcomes, communication with sexual partners and intentions to use condoms.
   Conclusions: Participation in the rights-based classroom curriculum resulted in positive, statistically significant effects on seven of nine psychosocial outcomes, relative to a basic sex education curriculum. Longer-term effects on students' sexual behaviors will be tested in subsequent analyses.

AB  - People with disabilities face multiple forms of social exclusion, discrimination, and oppression, including in the domain of sex and sexuality. From a critical psychoanalytic viewpoint, social responses to persons with impairments are strongly unconsciously mediated, and often dominated by projections based on archaic anxieties about dependency, vulnerability, and shame. Where disability meets sexuality, these defenses may be more prominent still, resulting, for one example, in the prejudiced myth that people with disabilities are disinterested in, or not capable of, sex. Using this theoretical stance, this paper examines how the developmental role of family and societal influences on the social constructions of sexuality and disability are internalized, resisted, and negotiated by two South Africans with physical disabilities. Data are drawn from interview material elicited via photovoice methodology. The interview narratives and photographic images are used to explore how sexual oppression may be internalized, creating intra-psychic barriers to inclusion for this already structurally disadvantaged group.

AB  - Question Was there an association of public health interventions with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China? Findings In this cohort study that included 32 & x202f;583 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan from December 8, 2019, through March 8, 2020, the institution of interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home quarantine, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey was temporally associated with reduced effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (secondary transmission) and the number of confirmed cases per day across age groups, sex, and geographic regions. Meaning A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.
   Importance Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and it is unknown whether a combination of public health interventions can improve control of the outbreak. Objective To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 & x202f;583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification. Exposures Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey. Main Outcomes and Measures Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods. Results Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (>= 80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1. Conclusions and Relevance A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.
   This population epidemiology study examines associations between phases of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions (social distancing, centralized quarantine, home confinement, and others) and rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, China, between December 2019 and early March 2020.

AB  - Participants read a crime news story featuring two perpetrators. Building on subjective group dynamics, we predicted that a perpetrator would be evaluated differently depending on the partner's ethnicity and participants' prior media use. Results show that heavy news consumers were more likely to (a) give a harsher sentence to a white perpetrator acting with a white (vs. Latino) partner, and (b) develop more negative attitudes toward Latinos when members of that group were portrayed in intergroup criminal partnerships. The implications of intergroup portrayals for perceptions of the ingroup, as well as the outgroup, and the moderating effects of news viewing on such effects, are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes towards the religious out-group. It uses unique survey data collected by the authors among Christian and Muslim students in Maluku and Yogyakarta (Indonesia) and Mindanao and Metro Manila (the Philippines). Even after taking self-selection effects into account, interreligious friendships reduce negative attitudes towards the religious out-group. However, casual interreligious contact increases negative out-group attitudes. Also individuals who experienced interreligious violence have more negative out-group attitudes than those without such experience. The experience of interreligious violence has no influence on the effect of interreligious friendships but it further deteriorates the relationship between casual interreligious contact and out-group attitudes. Perceived group threat is an important mechanism explaining the effects of both positive and negative interreligious contact. [125]. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous research indicated that negative attitudes about the body and appearance are common among men and demonstrated that negative body attitudes are associated with negative sexual experiences. The present study investigated the association between body attitudes and sexual dissatisfaction and the mediating role of body self-consciousness during physical intimacy. In a cross-sectional design, 201 Dutch men completed an online survey regarding body attitudes toward muscularity, body fat, height, and genitals, body self-consciousness during physical intimacy, and sexual dissatisfaction. Hypotheses were tested using correlation analyses and a mediation analysis with body attitudes as predictors, body self-consciousness as mediator, and sexual dissatisfaction as outcome. Correlation analyses showed that negative body attitudes and body self-consciousness during physical intimacy were significantly related to sexual dissatisfaction. The mediation analysis revealed that negative attitudes toward muscularity, body fat, and genitals had indirect effects on sexual dissatisfaction through body self-consciousness during physical intimacy. Negative attitudes toward genitals additionally had a direct effect on sexual dissatisfaction. These findings indicate that body image interventions focused on male body attitudes may be beneficial in improving men's body image, which may ultimately increase sexual satisfaction.

AB  - Aim: To study nurse managers' perceptions and experiences of staff nurse structural empowerment and its impact on the nurse manager leadership role and style.
   Background: Nurse managers' leadership roles may be viewed as challenging given the complex needs of patients and staff nurses' involvement in both clinical and organizational decision making processes in interdisciplinary care settings.
   Design: Qualitative phenomenological study.
   Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 8 medical or surgical nurse managers in a 600-bed Belgian university hospital between December 2013 and June 2014. This hospital was undergoing conversion from a classical hierarchical, departmental structure to a flat, interdisciplinary model.
   Results: Nurse managers were found to be familiar with the structural empowerment of clinical nurses in the hospital and to hold positive attitudes toward it. They confirmed the positive impact of empowerment on their staff nurses, as evidenced by increased responsibility, autonomy, critical reflection and enhanced communication skills that in turn improved the quality and safety of patient care. Structural empowerment was being supported by several change initiatives at both the unit and hospital levels. Nurse managers' experiences with these initiatives were mixed, however, because of the changing demands with regard to their manager role and leadership style. In addition, pressure was being experienced by both staff nurses and nurse managers as a result of direct patient care priorities, tightly scheduled projects and miscommunication.
   Conclusion: Nurse managers reported that structural empowerment was having a favorable impact on staff nurses' professional attitudes and the safety and quality of care in their units. However, they also reported that the empowerment process had led to changes in the managers' roles as well as daily practice dilemmas related to the leadership styles needed. Clear organizational goals and dedicated support for both clinical nurses and nursing unit managers are imperative to maintaining an empowering practice environment which can ensure the best care and healthy, engaged staff.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to gain insight into factors that impact employee readiness to change and organisational change management. Therefore, an integrative research model is developed with the combination of perceived competence, perceived relatedness, perceived autonomy, codification strategy and personalization strategy to investigate employee readiness to change. The research model tests the mediating role of employee readiness to change between factors underpinned self-determination theory, knowledge management strategy and organizational change management. In addition to the moderating role of self-efficacy is examined between the relationship of employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research is conducted under a positive paradigm, and therefore, a quantitative research approach is incorporated to design a research strategy. The research model is empirically tested with a sample size of 361 employees working in commercial banks of Pakistan. For data analysis, the structural equation modelling approach is applied.
   Findings - Empirical findings indicate that altogether perceived competence, perceived autonomy, perceived relatedness, codification and personalization strategies had explained 76.8% variance in employee readiness to change. The effect size analysis shows that codification strategy has the largest impact in determining employee readiness to change. Therefore, the relatedness of employee tasks stands at the second stage in determining employee readiness to change. The predictive relevance of the research model is computed through blindfolding procedure and revealed substantial predictive relevance in measuring employee readiness to change. The findings of the research confirmed that the relationship between employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation will be stronger when self-efficacy is higher.
   Practical implications - The current research has several contributions to theory and practice. Theoretically, this research extends the self-determination theory with knowledge management strategy and enriches literature in employee readiness to change and organizational change management context. Practically, this research suggests that policymakers should focus on factors underpinned by self-determination theory and knowledge management model to develop a positive attitude among employees towards readiness to change. Similarly, self-efficacy is another important factor that moderates the relationship between readiness to change and change implementation and should be considered for managerial implication.
   Originality/value - This research is significant as it integrates two unique models, namely, the self-determination framework and the knowledge management model to investigate employee readiness to change. In addition to that, the research model is extended with the moderating effect of self-efficacy between the relationship of employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation.

AB  - Flagships remain a key approach for motivating and mobilizing conservation actions and interests. This study quantified attitudes towards two endemic globally threatened Amazona parrots, one of which was developed as a popular flagship in the 1980s. We used a mixed methods approach that included qualitative and quantitative interviewing and a newspaper content analysis to provide empirical evidence that the process of creating this conservation flagship inadvertently fostered negative attitudes and behaviors towards its non-flagship congener. We argue that, similar to other commercially branded goods and services, popular conservation flagships can produce powerful standards of comparison that may decrease the attractiveness and public acceptance of non-flagship species. These results parallel findings from the fields of consumer research and marketing psychology showing that "top-of-the-line" products may hurt sibling models. We therefore suggest that this is an important unintended consequence of the flagship approach and encourage the conservation community to learn from commercial brand developers who have been wary of the potential for exclusionary contrast effects of flagship brand deployment.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of the current study is to advance understanding of sponsorship effectiveness by investigating the impact of the quality of the relationship between a consumer and a sport property on sponsorship effectiveness.
   Design/methodology/approach - A model was developed to examine linkages among relationship quality, sincerity, attitude toward sponsor and intention to purchase a sponsor's product. The measurement model was tested using confirmatory factory analysis. The relationships in the hypothesized model were tested using simultaneous equations.
   Findings - The results indicate that positive attitude toward a sponsor and intention to purchase said sponsor's product(s) are more likely to occur among the customers who perceive a higher degree of relationship quality with the sport property and believe the sponsor motives are sincere.
   Research limitations/implications - A conceptual model of sponsorship effectiveness was developed and empirically tested. The tested model provides an expanded view of relationship quality and its impact on key variables of sponsorship effectiveness.
   Practical implications - Provided in this study is a framework for both sponsors and sport teams that can be used to understand some of the ways in which sponsorship works. The findings suggest that sponsors should leverage their activities to communicate sincere motives, not just "doing business". For the sport property, the implication is developing quality relationships with consumers, and being able to promote such relationships to prospective sponsors.
   Originality/value - Relationship quality has been previously shown to influence various behavioral aspects related to partners in business-to-business relationships. This study extends the literature by examining the effect of business-to-consumer relationship quality on the expected outcomes associated with a business-to-business relationship.

AB  - Understanding how newspapers depict fatal shootings of minority men by police, and how this affects implicit biases, may offer insight into why such shootings continue to occur. Through an analysis of national newspaper articles immediately following the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, we investigate how these events are framed regarding the use of victim-supporting, social justice frames or law enforcement-supporting, law and order frames. We then theorize how this might contribute to the perpetuation of implicit biases. We find social justice frames appear more frequently than law and order frames during this period. This shift in the presentation of information might affect the reinforcement of implicit biases that the news media is often accused of causing.

AB  - Public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as business restrictions, social distancing and lockdowns, had social and economic impacts on individuals and communities. Caremongering Facebook groups spread across Canada to support vulnerable individuals by providing a forum for sharing information and offering assistance. We sought to understand the specific impacts of Caremongering groups on individuals 1 year after the pandemic began. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach that included semi-structured interviews with group moderators from 16 Caremongering groups and survey data from 165 group members. We used a constant comparative approach for thematic analysis of interview transcripts and open-ended text responses to the survey. We used source theme tables as joint displays to integrate interview and survey findings. Our results revealed five major themes: providing food, sharing information, supporting health and wellness, acquiring goods and services (non-food), and connecting communities. Respondents of our survey tended to be 35-65 years of age range, but reported helping adults of all ages. Our findings illustrate the potential of using a social media platform to connect with others and provide and access support. The Caremongering initiative demonstrates a community-driven, social media solution to issues such as isolation, loneliness and community health promotion.

AB  - Objective: Disparities in U.S. breastfeeding rates persist among Black mothers according to birth country and between Black and White mothers, necessitating further investigation of modifiable mediating factors to inform interventions. This study seeks to examine the extent that social, maternal, infant factors and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) domains (attitudes, perceived control, and subjective norms) mediate the association of maternal race/birth country and breastfeeding continuation.
   Methods: A national cohort of 2,050 mothers self-identifying as U.S.-born non-Hispanic Black (n = 689), foreign-born non-Hispanic Black (n = 139), and U.S.-born non-Hispanic White (n = 1,222) was analyzed. Using logistic regression, associations of race/birth country and any/exclusive breastfeeding at 2-6 months were examined. Structural equation modeling was used to determine whether social, maternal, and infant factors and TPB domains mediate these relationships.
   Results: 40.0% of U.S.-born Black, 82.2% of foreign-born Black, and 57.3% of U.S.-born White mothers reported any breastfeeding at 2-6 months. Compared with U.S.-born Black mothers, odds of any breastfeeding were sevenfold higher among foreign-born Black mothers (odds ratio [OR] = 7.04 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.80-10.31), which was explained partly by social/maternal/infant factors and TPB domains. Compared with U.S.-born White mothers, any breastfeeding was lower (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.40-0.73) among U.S.-born Black mothers and higher (OR = 3.81, 95% CI = 2.48-5.87) among foreign-born Black mothers; these differences were also mediated by the aforementioned factors.
   Conclusions: Among Black mothers in the United States, breastfeeding continuation varied substantially by birth country. Promotion of interventions targeting positive attitudes, perceived control, and subjective norms may reduce disparities among Black and between Black and White mothers.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of transformational leadership (TL) on organizational commitment (OC) with the mediating role of organizational justice (OJ) in the higher education (HE) sector in Syria. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from 502 employees from six HE institutions. Two measures of organizational outcomes were selected for this study, namely, job satisfaction (JS) and OC. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), the authors tested four alternative models to indicate the relationship between leadership and organizational outcomes. Findings TL has both direct and indirect effects on OC through interactional justice (IJ). TL has an impact on JS through procedural justice (PJ) and IJ as intermediate variables, while transactional leadership (TrL) has an impact on JS through distributive justice (DJ). The three types of OJ have an impact on OC through JS. The authors found that the national culture may not influence the impact of the leader in the current globalization context, as the results were similar to the Western studies. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide managers of the HE sector with insights into the formations of employees' fairness perceptions, and with some guidelines for managing employees by documenting OJ to draw positive attitudinal and behavioral responses from employees. Originality/value While most previous research has focused on exploring the relationship between leadership and OJ or between OJ and JS in the business sector, the study, however, seeks in addition, to pinpoint the effect of OJ as a mediate variable between the leadership and JS and OC in HE.

AB  - Since the 2000s, a rapidly expanding Muslim marketplace has offered faith-centred digital content produced by and aimed at Muslim women. In geopolitical events post 9/11, adoption of the term 'Muslim women', especially by younger generations, has grown in an act of supra-national identification with the Muslima - Muslim female community - that crosses race, ethnicity, sects and class. This is reflective of a wider prioritisation of religion in the construction of personal identity by ethnic minorities and in particular by Muslims, understood as a response to unfair treatment, stigmatisation, and higher levels of social and economic exclusion (McGhee, 2008, Khattab, 2009). In the UK social exclusion has most impacted on sense of belonging for Muslim women (Karsen and Nazroo, 2016). Yet the professional and civic roles of Muslim women in challenging negative representations and discrimination are often overlooked, along with the personal impacts of performing this labour. This article highlights the experiences of Muslim women working in media as they attempt to build new Muslim female identities and spaces of belonging, and renegotiate their own position in the process.

KW  - IMMUNIZATION
AB  - Background: More and more countries are discussing the introduction of mandatory vaccination policies. Yet, little is known about individuals' actual preferences for voluntary vs. mandatory vaccination policies, and the psychological processes underlying such preferences. Objective of the present research was to investigate the development of individual preferences for voluntary and mandatory vaccination policies. Methods: We conducted a controlled laboratory study (N = 168) using a repeated interactive vaccination game with decision-contingent monetary incentives. In each round, participants decided in favour of either a voluntary or a mandatory vaccination policy, followed by the vaccination decision (voluntary policy) or vaccination (mandatory policy) which both resulted in actual (financial) consequences. Results: We observe large heterogeneity in participants' preferences for the voluntary vs. mandatory policy. Under voluntary vaccination, the preference for the mandatory policy increased with decreasing vaccination rates (and increasing risk of infection). In contrast, experiencing vaccine-adverse events under mandatory vaccination increased the preference for the voluntary policy. The latter effect was larger for individuals with a negative (vs. positive) attitude toward vaccination. Overall, as individuals gathered experiences under both the voluntary and the mandatory policy, the preference for voluntary vaccination policy increased over time. Conclusions: Individuals are more willing to accept mandatory vaccination policies when vaccination rates are low. In the long run, the occurrence of vaccine-adverse events may spark opposition to mandatory vaccination.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   The frontline workers including nurses need to be focused in creating awareness and reducing the cultural and emotional barrier about breast screening among the female patients and community they come across. The objective of the study is to determine the knowledge and attitude regarding risk factors, symptoms and screening of breast cancer among nursing students and staff of a tertiary care centre.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   A cross sectional survey was conducted among 300 nursing students and staff of Dr. Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, Kangra at Tanda, Himachal Pradesh in 2016. A semi-structured predesigned study tool was introduced to assess the demographic profile and knowledge and attitude regarding risk factor and symptoms pertaining to breast cancer.
   RESULTS
   The adequate knowledge about all risk factors was observed among 15.3% nurses. Around 40% of nurses had correct knowledge about ways of preventing BC and even higher proportion about techniques of early BC detection (63.3%). The age and year of practice duration did show a difference; with younger age and students being more knowledgeable but this distribution was not significant. The serious and positive attitude towards seeking medical help of BC was higher among married and higher age group nurses.
   CONCLUSION
   Along with increasing knowledge we have to strengthen emotional status of women in our country. The frontline workers can prove to be a great asset in creating community awareness.

AB  - Objective: Examining factors influencing food label use among Singapore's supermarket shoppers using the Theory of Planned Behavior.
   Design: A point-of-purchase survey among general shoppers in 2 supermarkets.
   Setting: Singapore, a country whose population is exposed to a wide range of food labeling formats because of the import-dependent nature of the food industry.
   Participants: A total of 200 shoppers (Chinese [75.5%], Malays [8.5%], and Indians [7.0%]) participated in the survey.
   Main Outcome Measures: Independent variables composed of attitudes and subjective norms (both 5-point Likert); perceived behavioral control and diet-health concern (both 5-point semantic differential); and knowledge (18-item index). Dependent variables were intention to use food labels (5-point differential scale) and actual use of food labels (19-item index).
   Analysis: Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, mean analysis, and multivariate linear regression.
   Results: Low levels of knowledge and health literacy were found. Attitudes, subjective norms, and behavioral control differed significantly by age and ethnicity. Subjective norms and diet-health concern were significant predictors of intention to use food labels.
   Conclusions and Implications: Lack of knowledge but positive attitudes toward food labels make Singapore's consumers vulnerable to misusing or being misled by food label information. Demographic differences demonstrate the need to develop targeted educational interventions and enhance awareness of and ability to use food labels.

AB  - Internal customer of hospital information system(HIS) are typically called the users. These customers using this system every day, also evaluate the quality of the system. Users' understanding of the information system is important for acceptance and evaluation of the information system. Their satisfaction of the practical aspects of the system is very essential. This study evaluated nurses' attitudes of clinical departments towards hospital information system to introduce the effect of mechanized information system in nursing care. This study was conducted in teaching hospitals affiliated with Semnan university of medical sciences in Semnan, Iran. A questionnaire was developed to measure attitudes of nurses toward the effect of HIS on nursing care. Data analysis was performed by descriptive and Inferential statistics. Results showed notwithstanding most nurses had positive attitude to the information system. But some believed that the information system has had less effect on some nursing activities. Significant relationship was observed between attitude and participation status of nurses in information system development. According to the results obtained should be noted that the main element of an information system is the user. His satisfaction affects on the growth and survival of the information system. On the other hand, It seems that the understanding of the usefulness of an information system is related to users' knowledge and awareness about Information systems.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of social media on researchers' work attitude at IITA, Ibadan, Oyo state, Nigeria. Proportionate sampling technique was used to select 82 respondents for the study through the use of questionnaire. Data collected were analysed using percentage, Chi-square and Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC). Results showed that the frequently used media on a daily basis, were emails (87.7%), Facebook (76.6%) and WhatsApp (71.6%) while Skype (24.7%) and Twitter (21.0%) were used on weekly basis. Researchers used social media to source for journals (14.8%), collaborative research (38.2%) and connection with families and friends (41.9%) as well as for online dating (7.4%). Furthermore, 38.0% of the respondents accessed social media from their departmental office, personal office (29.7%) and their individual homes (13.6%). Researchers agreed that social media were essential office tools (37.0%), retarded their work (3.7%) as well as wasted their time (1.2%). Chi- square analysis showed that there was significant relationship between the usage of social media and religion (chi(2)=8.336, p <= 0.05), marital status (chi(2)=14.81, p <= 0.05) and rank/cadre of respondents (chi(2) =23.03, p <= 0.05) while PPMC analysis results showed a significant relationship between social media usage and age (R = 0.245, p=0.05) as well as work experience (R= -0.33, p <= 0.005). Social media has both positive and negative effects on researchers' attitude to work. Social media usage should be controlled during working hours to improve the positive attitude of researchers towards work at IITA.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine the knowledge and attitude of Indonesian community nurses regarding Pressure Injury (PI) prevention. A cross-sectional design was used and included the community nurses permanently working in the Public Health Center (Puskemas) in Bandung, West Java Indonesia. Knowledge was measured using the Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Assessment Tool (PUKAT 2.0). Attitudes were measured using a predesigned instrument which included 11 statements on a five point Likert scale. All data were collected using paper-based questionnaires. The response rate was 100%. Respondents (n = 235) consisted of 80 community nursing program coordinators (34.0%) and 155 community nurses (66.0%). Regarding knowledge, the percentage of correct answers in the total group of community nurses on the PUKAT 2.0 was 30.7%. The theme "Prevention" had the lowest percentage of correct answers (20.8%). Community nurses who had additional PI or wound care training had a higher knowledge score compared with community nurses who did not have additional PI training (33.7% vs 30.3%; Z = -1.995; P = 0.046). The median attitude score was 44 (maximum score 55; range 28-55), demonstrating a positive attitude among participants towards PI prevention. Further, the higher the education status of participants, the more positive the attitudes (H = 11.773; P = 0.003). This study shows that community nurses need to improve their basic knowledge of PI prevention. Furthermore, research should be performed to explore what community nurses need to strengthen their role in PI prevention.

AB  - Organically-certified wild plant foods are rarely addressed in scientific or public discourses on organic food even though 30% of the world's organically-certified land is dedicated to wild plant gathering. This oversight may leave organic consumers unaware of the market relevance of wild plant foods. The aim of this study was therefore to understand organic consumers' attitudes, knowledge and purchasing and gathering practices with respect to wild plant foods, and how sociodemographic variables and attitudes can predict knowledge and practices. A purposive sample was drawn from 22 urban and rural food markets across Austria and 497 organic consumers were interviewed using successive freelists and four-point Likert scale questions on attitudes. Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regressions. Organic consumers knew a median of nine wild food plants, and reported five as being gathered and one as being purchased. They valued food quality and the responsible harvest of wild food plants, but assigned them a low economic relevance, with some respondents sceptical about their suitability as food. Rural residence, a higher share of organic consumption and a greater emphasis on responsible harvesting predicted knowledge and gathering of a larger number of plant species. These results confirm that organic consumers know, gather and have positive attitudes with respect to wild plant foods, although they are hardly aware about their market relevance. We argue that consumers need to be better informed about the wild origin of food ingredients and the added value of organic certification of wild plant foods.

AB  - A 3D ultrasound image reconstruction technique, named probe sector matching (PSM), is proposed in this paper for a freehand linear array ultrasound probe equipped with multiple sensors, providing the position and attitude of the transducer and the pressure between the transducer and the target surface. The proposed PSM method includes three main steps. First, the imaging target and the working range of the probe are set to be the center and the radius of the imaging field of view, respectively. To reconstruct a 3D volume, the positions of all necessary probe sectors are pre-calculated inversely to form a sector database. Second, 2D cross-section probe sectors with the corresponding optical positioning, attitude and pressure information are collected when the ultrasound probe is moving around the imaging target. Last, an improved 3D Hough transform is used to match the plane of the current probe sector to the existing sector images in the sector database. After all pre-calculated probe sectors are acquired and matched into the 3D space defined by the sector database, a 3D ultrasound reconstruction is completed. The PSM is validated through two experiments: a virtual simulation using a numerical model and a lab experiment using a real physical model. The experimental results show that the PSM effectively reduces the errors caused by changes in the target position due to the uneven surface pressure or the inhomogeneity of the transmission media. We conclude that the PSM proposed in this study may help to design a lightweight, inexpensive and flexible ultrasound device with accurate 3D imaging capacity.

AB  - Young adulthood is a major and significant stage in life encompassing various life transitions which may increase the risk of developing emotional crises. Receiving mental health treatment and turning to nonprofessional resources for support can ease such emotional burdens. However, many of those in need of such help do not turn to professional services and, rather, tend to rely on themselves. The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help, self-stigma, anticipated risk, anticipated utility, and social support to the intention to seek professional and nonprofessional emotional help among Jewish young adults in Israel. Participants included 282 Jewish Israeli young adults aged 18-30, recruited in person or online. They filled out a self-report questionnaire, between March and June 2017, regarding intention to seek professional and non-professional emotional help, attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help, self-stigma towards seeking professional emotional help, anticipated risk and anticipated utility of self-disclosure when seeking professional help, perceived social support and sociodemographic questions. A path analysis model was used to analyse the data. Intention to seek professional help was positively associated with positive attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help and anticipated utility and negatively with self-stigma and social support. Intention to seek nonprofessional help was positively associated with anticipated utility and social support and negatively with anticipated risk. In addition, indirect effects were found between religious affiliation and previous mental health treatment, and intention to seek professional help, through the mediating effects of attitudes and anticipated utility. Interventions for increasing intention to seek professional and nonprofessional support are important and should include reference to attitudes, anticipated utility, anticipated risk and self-stigma, and should promote mutual support and highlight the importance of support from close ones. In addition, a model for predicting intention to seek non-professional help should be developed.

AB  - Objectives: Critical illness can have a significant psychological impact on patients and their families. To inform the design of a larger trial, we assessed feasibility of ICU diaries and psychoeducation to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety following ICU stays.
   Design: Four-arm pilot randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: A 10-bed tertiary ICU in Winnipeg, MB, Canada.
   Patients: Critically ill patients greater than 17 years old with predicted ICU stays greater than 72 hours and mechanical ventilation duration greater than 24 hours.
   Interventions: Patients were randomized to usual care, ICU diary, psychoeducation, or both ICU diary and psychoeducation.
   Measurements and Main Results: Our primary objective was to determine feasibility measured by enrollment/mo. Secondary outcomes included acceptability of the ICU diary intervention and psychological distress, including patients' memories 1 week post ICU using the ICU Memory Tool, posttraumatic stress disorder (Impact of Events Scale-Revised), depression, and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) 30 and 90 days post ICU. Over 3.5 years, we enrolled 58 patients, an average of 1.9 participants/mo. Families and healthcare providers wrote a mean of 3.2 diary entries/d (sd, 2.9) and indicated positive attitudes and low perceived burden toward ICU diary participation. A majority of patients reported distressing memories of their ICU stay. Those who received the diary intervention had significantly lower median Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety (3.0 [interquartile range, 2-6.25] vs 8.0 [interquartile range, 7-10]; p = 0.01) and depression (3.0 [interquartile range, 1.75-5.25] vs 5.0 [interquartile range, 4-9]; p = 0.04) symptom scores at 90 days than patients who did not receive a diary.
   Conclusions: ICU diaries are a feasible intervention in a tertiary Canadian ICU context. Preliminary evidence supports the efficacy of ICU diaries to reduce psychological morbidity following discharge.

AB  - Background. Although transplantation has gained more support and acceptance, there are still many ethical, moral, and legal barriers associated with this form of treatment. The demand for organs is higher than what can be accommodated. Current medical students are forming their views about transplantation.
   Methods. The aim of this study was to investigate the perspectives of 569 students from the Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland, with regard to their beliefs about organ donation.
   Results. Respondents included in this study were 21.77 +/- 2.03 years of age (73.6% female, 80.1% living in an urban setting). Organ procurement and transplantation from living donors was found to be acceptable by 97.54% of respondents, and 98.77% found deceased donor procurement to be acceptable. More than 90% of respondents agreed with organ donation from family members after death, and agreed to donation after their own death. However, only 54.77% indicated an agreement to donate in their lifetime for nonrelatives. It was found that 70.74% believe the final decision on cadaveric organ donation should be made by the family. A positive attitude toward organ transplantation was expressed by 96.47% of respondents, but 2% submitted an objection to placement on a central registry. Refusals for organ donation included emotions associated with death (88%), religious beliefs (42%), and lack of knowledge of medical terminology (24.78%). According to respondents, the concept of transplantation should be managed by patients and donors (65.38%), universities (49.56%), or the media (44.64%).
   Conclusion. Medical students generally agree on procurement of organs from deceased and living donors. However, their enthusiasm for organ donation after death diminished with regard to their family members. An educational campaign promoting organ transplantation should be considered.

AB  - Background. Unless effective tobacco control is in place, most tobacco-related deaths in the coming decades are likely to be seen in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco surveillance among medical students offers an opportunity to assess the preparedness for tobacco control among future healthcare professionals in India.
   Methods. We did a cross-sectional survey in two cities (Bangalore and Coimbatore) of India. The participants were third year undergraduate students from 7 medical colleges and 6 nursing colleges. A self-administered questionnaire was used to elicit information on tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, knowledge on disease burden and attitudes towards tobacco control.
   Results. Overall, 829 of 985 eligible students (84.1%) participated in the survey. About 14.5% (95% CI 12.0-17.0) of students had ever used tobacco. Current tobacco use was reported by 1.6% (95% CI 0.8-2.4) of students; 1.5% (95% CI 0.7-2.3) were current smokers and 0.4% (95% CI 0.1-0.7) were current chewers. The rates of smoking among male medical, female medical and female nursing students were 4.0%, 0.3% and 0%, respectively (p < 0.001). About 1 in 6 students reported frequent exposure to environmental tobacco smoke within their homes and over 1 in 4 reported frequent exposure outside the home environment. Median knowledge score on tobacco-related burden was 5/10. More than 80% favoured ban on tobacco sales to adolescents, tobacco advertising and tobacco use in public places. Over 90% reported interest in further training in tobacco control.
   Conclusion. This scenario of comparatively low levels of tobacco use, positive attitudes towards tobacco control and suboptimal levels of knowledge coupled with a high interest in having further knowledge on tobacco control points to the need for a comprehensive curriculum for training in tobacco control that meets national requirements.

AB  - Background: Mental health disorders have identified as being one of the public health issues throughout the world. Recent evidence reveals that more than 21 million people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, there is little information about community perception and attitude towards people with Schizophrenia in Ethiopia.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the community perception and attitude towards people with Schizophrenia among residents of Arba Minch Zuria Districts, Southern Ethiopia.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected adults. Interviewer-administered standard tool was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics like frequency, mean, and median computed. A binary logistic regression model used to identify factors affecting community perception and attitude towards people with schizophrenia.
   Results: Of the study population, 469 (76%) of respondents had good perception and 390 (63.2%) had positive attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. The study participants identified talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors as the most common manifestations of schizophrenia. Besides, this study identified substance misuse and head injury as the perceived cause and spiritual or traditional methods as a preferred treatment for people with schizophrenia. Moreover, the study participants preferred spiritual or traditional methods for the treatment of schizophrenia. Young age [AOR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.21, 3.40], females [AOR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.58, 3.41], good perception towards people with schizophrenia [AOR=4.95, 95% CI: 3.25, 7.54] and no formal educational status [AOR=2.75, 95% CI: 1.33, 5.70], and primary education [AOR=3.72, 95% CI: 1.87, 7.39] were significantly associated with the attitude towards people with schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that approximately one-third of the residents had unfavorable attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. Therefore, giving special attention to male, elders and those who were educated, and individuals who have poor perceptions of people with schizophrenia is crucial.

AB  - This paper explores individuals' motives for using social media when living under 'social distancing' conditions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, where they were instructed to physically distance from other people. Adopting a 'uses and gratifications' approach, and using a previously established five-factor scale, we examine the relationship between individuals' motives for using social media and their personality traits. Hundred and eighty-nine social media users living in the United Kingdom completed surveys assessing their motives for using social media and their personality. Our findings demonstrate that participants were generally motivated to use social media to 'pass time' and to 'maintain relationships.' Further, we find that those high in extraversion in particular use social media to 'maintain relationships.' By comparing our findings to previous studies where face-to-face interaction was not restricted, our findings indicate that individuals' motives for using social media change when they are placed under physical distancing restrictions. We reflect on the potential application of our findings for others experiencing similar conditions, such as those working in remote locations, as well as the potential implications for living in a post-pandemic world with increased virtual 'meetings' using social media.

KW  - social work
AB  - Dominating headlines in the last few months, global attention has been fixed on the coronavirus pandemic given its rampaging impact on social events and human affairs. More than any other groups, older adults have been disproportionately affected by the deadly contagion. This situation poses legitimate concerns to the social work profession, whose mandate is to liberate vulnerable people and promote social development. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to take a devastating toll on older adults in the short-term, its long-term consequences may be far more profound unless urgent attention is directed to mitigate this situation. Given the promulgation of social distancing and shutdowns among a number of African countries, many social workers have found it increasingly difficult to address the difficulties faced by older adults. This article canvasses for the utilization of the mass media in initiating policy response to the challenges of older adults throughout the continent.

AB  - In 1992, when vice president of the United States Dan Quayle lashed out against fictional television personality Murphy Brown for glamorizing single motherhood and mocking the importance of fathers, many observers found the public dialogue surrounding this incident absurd. After all, Quayle was criticizing the actions of a fictional character in a weekly sitcom, not a real person (see, e.g., "Dan Quayle," 1992). Likewise, in 2005 when a vice president of the National District Attorneys Association railed against the drama In Justice on the editorial pages of the New York Times, he was complaining about a fictional television drama, not about events that had actually happened (Marquis, 2006). Political leaders and the general public often express concerns about the influence of fictional programming on public attitudes toward real-world political issues (Montgomery, 1990). Nonetheless, purely dramatic fictional television has been largely ignored by scholars interested in the political impact of mass media; studies of media and politics focus almost exclusively on news and public affairs programming.
   There is a variety of explanations for what might be considered an oversight, but foremost among them is an assumption that fiction is processed differently from nonfictional content. In other words, people store information about the world that is implied by fictional programming in a way that compartmentalizes it from information about the world that comes from nonfiction sources (see a critical discussion of explanations that suggest a "toggle" between fiction and nonfiction, in Gerrig, 1993, pp. 201-207). When forming political attitudes, viewers presumably discount what is known to be dramatic fiction and rely strictly on information about the real world, using only the latter in forming perceptions and policy preferences.
   Although this assumption seems plausible at one level, scholars also pointed out a contrary expectation. People "often search for the real-world point" of works of fiction (Gerrig, 1993, p. 201), and spontaneously draw on television imagery and fictional television characters in conversations about current events (Delli Carpini & Williams, 1994, 1996). There are other theoretical arguments predicting that fictional television content should have as much, if not more, influence on the formation of political preferences as nonfiction television. The sheer amount of fictional content viewers consume makes it a likely source of information that affects political and social views. Americans spend more than one third of their free time each week watching television-much more than they spend socializing, reading, or participating in religious activities (Robinson & Godbey, 1999, chap. 9). What is less often noted is that the time is overwhelmingly spent watching entertainment programming: sitcoms, game shows, reality shows, and dramas, but not the evening news, political talk shows, or public affairs programming (Nielsen Media Research, 2008). Although we do not address the relative amounts of influence from these kinds of content in this study, we ask whether fictional content can have consequences for politically relevant attitudes and beliefs. Does it matter what kinds of fictional content Americans watch regularly on television? Or does such content function purely as a diversionary enjoyment, without any consequences?

AB  - This study aims to examine how covid-19 affect consumer behaviors within gastronomy tourism and the mediating role of destination satisfaction in this relationship. The research data was collected from 812 con -sumers through questionnaires. The collected data was analyzed through IBM SPSS 25 (Hayes, 2009) and PROCESS v3.4 macro. The study found that the perception of gastronomy tourism has a positive and significant effect on destination satisfaction and consumer behavior and that destination satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on consumer behavior. It was also found that destination satisfaction has a partial mediating role between the perception of gastronomy tourism and consumer behavior. Due to social distancing, the pandemic has greatly affected the interest in gastronomy tourism. The fact that people avoid eating in crowded places has led to a decrease in the interest in gastronomy tourism. As destination satisfaction has a mediating effect between gastronomy tourism and consumer behavior, more emphasis should be put on destination satisfaction in the field of gastronomy tourism. This study answers the critical question of how gastronomy tourism affects consumer behavior and reveals the role of destination satisfaction in this relationship.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate occurrences of confirmation bias existing for sponsors whose brand is congruent to a sport. More specifically, this research investigates: if confirmation biases for congruent brands occur in the absence of exposure, the impact audience segmentation has on sponsorship evaluations by comparing highly identified fans to non-fans, and if congruent sponsors are recalled more often than incongruent sponsors after exposure.
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment was conducted to measure how exposure, type of sponsor, and fan identification impacts recognition, attitude, and purchase intention.
   Findings - The results confirm sport-congruent brands are more likely to be falsely recognized as a sponsor than non-congruent sponsors in the absence of sponsorship participation. Sport consumers' confirmation biases yield positive attitudes and purchase intentions for congruent brands even in the absence of immediate exposure. Lastly, exposure has no impact on recall or sponsor outcomes, suggesting the need for articulating the brand's connection prior to the event to build stronger memory traces.
   Practical implications - Congruent brands should carefully consider investment costs and expected return on investment, noting benefits of participation might be marginal as a result of confirmation biases. Potential sponsors should also understand cognitive benefits begin before exposure to the sponsorship occurs, and therefore need to articulate a connection to the event prior to exposure by consumers.
   Originality/value - The findings suggest the importance of confirmation biases when attempting to reach sport consumers. Some brands may be able to increase recall and recognition even in the absence of exposure, thus helping decision makers when managing budgets.

AB  - This research explores influential factors of using narratives of Chernobyl in media reporting about the Fukushima nuclear accident: radiological consequences, geographical distance from the accident, status of a nuclear energy production, public opinion about nuclear energy and the level of a nuclear accident (INES scale). This study applies a large-scale media content analysis of newspapers articles (N = 1340) published in the first two months of the accident in twelve press opinion leaders in Belgium, Italy, Norway, Russia, Slovenia and Spain. The results show that the memory on the Chernobyl nuclear accident appeared in more than in every third article reporting of the present Fukushima nuclear accident despite the fact that Fukushima carried no direct radiological hazard for the newspaper's audience and, a frequent use of narratives is related to negative attitudes towards nuclear energy, a higher risk perception of nuclear power plants and to an active nuclear energy industry in the newspaper's country.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common mental disorder that is widely seen among adolescents suffering from mobile phone addiction. While it is well known that both positive emtions in adolescents wiotions and social support can have a positive impact by helping individuals to maintain a positive attitude, the correlation between positive emotions, social support, and depression among these adolescents remains to be investigated. This study examined the mediator effects of positive emotions on the relationship between social support and depression among adolescents suffering from mobile phone addiction.
   Subjects and methods: For this study, conducted in 2016, we selected 1,346 adolescent students from three middle schools (ranging from Junior Grade One to Senior Grade Three) in Hunan Province of China, to participate in the survey. Participants were selected using the stratified cluster random sampling method, and all participants remained anonymous throughout the study. Each participant completed the Self-made General Situation Questionnaire, the Social Support Rating Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale.
   Results: There was significant positive correlation between positive emotions and social support. Both positive emotions and social support demonstrated significant negative correlation with depression. Positive emotions had partial mediator effects on the relationship between social support and depression (P<0.01).
   Conclusions: Both social support and positive emotions can lower levels of depression among adolescents suffering from mobile phone addiction. Social support contributes to positive emoth mobile phone addiction, thereby reducing their levels of depression. These findings suggest that more support and care should be given to this particular adolescent population.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused major societal changes worldwide, with the most notable being lockdowns and restrictions on social contact. We conducted a longitudinal study (total n = 1907) in Germany with two time points to (1) identify demographic risk factors of impaired social contact during the pandemic, as well as investigate potential consequences of (2) impaired social contact and (3) different modes of communication on individuals' well-being during the first lockdown in spring 2020. Results indicate that particularly individuals living alone and being unable to work reported a lower frequency of (face-to-face) contact in comparison with participants living with others or working. Impaired social contact was indirectly associated with a negative development in well-being (life satisfaction, anxiety and depression) over time, and this relation was mediated via relatedness. Moreover, the frequency of face-to-face and phone communication during lockdown was positively associated with relatedness and well-being; however, digital communication was not. The findings stress the importance of maintaining social contact in times of social distancing and of fostering reconnection between individuals once the pandemic is over.

AB  - Maintaining high-quality care for urological patients is a challenge during and after the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We observe an increasing volume of postponed elective visits at our tertiary care hospital, holding the risk for deterioration of non-emergency disease conditions. As it is unclear for how long the pandemic will last, we propose to implement telehealth as a solution to provide regular symptom monitoring compatible with social distancing guidelines during the pandemic and beyond. Telemedical assessment and prioritizing of high-risk patients for individual consults at outpatient services will have to be aligned with available outpatient capacity and local outbreak severity.

AB  - Identity fusion with the community has been previously found to mediate altruism in post-disaster settings. However, whether this altruistic response is specifically triggered by ingroup threat, or whether it can also be triggered by global threats remains unclear. We evaluated willingness to sacrifice in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic across three survey waves. Against expectations, participants fused with the nation (vs. non-fused) did not differentially respond to a national versus global threat condition. Conversely, social norms decisively influenced willingness to sacrifice in this sample, with fused individuals with stronger norms about social distancing reporting the highest altruistic response during the first weeks of the pandemic. Longitudinally, after an initial peak in the altruistic response, deteriorating social norms mediated decreases in willingness to sacrifice in individuals fused with the nation (vs. non-fused). Implications of these results for the development of interventions aimed to address global challenges are discussed.

AB  - During 2015, New South Wales (N.S.W), Australia experienced an unprecedented spike in human-shark interactions. These interactions saw the escalation of public anxieties surrounding water safety and the implementation of the state's $16 m Shark Management Strategy. Of the 14 human-shark interactions that occurred in N.S.W, eight were recorded on the state's North Coast. The interactions ignited considerable public debate, which sought to explain the spike in interactions and how to best manage the risk of human-shark interaction. This controversy was documented by the media. This study takes its lead from McCagh et. al (2015) to examine the media's reporting of public and political response to human-shark interactions in N.S.W. Discourse analysis was used to investigate two newspaper's reportage of human-shark interactions on the North Coast. This paper outlines that the discourse used by the media examined was not fear-laden, sensationalized or emotive, which previous studies have emphasized. It highlights the importance of investigating local media as means of investigating public and political response to environmental issues. The W.A shark cull seems to be a turning point in public and political attitudes towards shark management. The N.S.W government did not offer lethal or seemingly knee-jerk policy, but insisted on the investigation of non-lethal, scientifically and conservationally focused management. The N.S.W government appeared to be successful in consulting the local community and delivering policy that reflects the values and interests of the North Coast public. Our research reflects Neff & Wynter's (2018a) suggestion that the 'save the sharks' movement has indeed arrived.

AB  - In this essay I intend to tell a story of media studies and mass communication research as a field, based on the work of the late Denis McQuail - and that of editing the new edition of his seminal handbook McQuail's Media and Mass Communication Theory (McQuail & Deuze, 2020). Using McQuail's historical storytelling method, I specifically look at the challenge for the field in the context of a global pandemic alongside an infodemic, at a time when the whole world faces the consequences of recurrent lockdowns, social distancing measures, and institutional pressures to stay at home. Media studies and (mass) communication research, while having a distinct narrative, as a field has only just begun to articulate its relevance to society - we have only just started to tell our story. Using developments in understanding the self as a research tool, the implementation of integrative research designs, and calls for engaged and public scholarship, the paper outlines challenges and opportunities for what we can do with our field.

AB  - Purpose
   Purpose of this study is to investigate the role of learner readiness in enhancing transfer of training by empirically testing a moderated mediation mechanism in which learner readiness influences transfer through motivation to transfer, and this indirect impact is moderated by supervisor support.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The perception of trainees about the constructs considered has been captured through a survey of 250 employees of a unit of a manufacturing organization in India. For hypotheses testing, PROCESS macro developed by Hayes (2013) has been used.
   Findings
   Results have confirmed the significant role played by learner readiness in predicting transfer. This apart, supervisor support has been proved to moderate the indirect impact of learner readiness on transfer.
   Practical implications
   Trainees need to have pre-requisite knowledge to learn the content of a training programme, which would enable them to grasp such content and transfer the same subsequently to work. It is also essential that trainees are willing to attend any training voluntarily. Specific interventions may be designed for supervisors to bolster their catalytic role in training transfer.
   Originality/value
   An interactionist approach has been adopted by focussing on learner readiness as a less-studied trainee characteristic and supervisor support as a situational factor of transfer. This is construed as a significant contribution of this study to training literature. The potential overlap between learner readiness and motivation to transfer as trainee characteristics is seen to be neutralized by the presence of supervisor support as a moderator. Findings help in understanding how a trainee's readiness and motivation, together with supervisor's positive attitude, can enhance transfer.

AB  - Many people had to stay at home with their families during the pandemic because of social distancing guidelines and lockdowns. This study aims to explore the content of 'sharenting' of parents during the early COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine periods in Turkey. In total, 401 posts were collected from public Instagram accounts of parents who shared their own children's photos or videos between 18th30th April 2020, via the most commonly used hashtags of #korona (#corona) and #evdekal (# stayhome). Descriptive content analysis was conducted within identified categories. Results revealed that the popular hashtag #stayathome is particularly important for its optimistic representation of the lockdown process in society. Content analysis results show that with the inclusion of social media shares, family members spent more time together, which can be seen as one of the positive consequences of this period. In the results of continued sharenting during the early pandemic, children's faces were mainly kept visible, which might concern children's privacy. Additionally, mothers shared more during this period. Consequently, education to increase awareness of such concepts gains importance, especially for the well-being and privacy of children and any future implications.

AB  - The lack of knowledge of current public attitudes towards basic research into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a serious problem when considering appropriate ways of governance regarding research and its clinical applications. We therefore conducted an internet-based survey to determine public opinion regarding the research and development of iPSCs and regenerative medicine (RM). A total of 14,908 valid responses were collected, which revealed that the Japanese public were familiar with the terms iPSCs and RM, and many of them had received information about iPSCs and RM through the television and newspapers. They also generally accepted the need for extra funding for research into iPSCs, but also decided to adopt a "wait and see" approach and thought that research and development of iPSCs and RM should be conducted under proper governance in accordance with an international regulatory framework. It will be necessary to discuss an internationally consistent regulatory system and effective mechanisms for information flow.

AB  - This study examined core belief violation and meaning making as mechanisms mediating the relationship between adherence to social isolation policies for mitigating coronavirus transmission and reduced coronavirus anxiety (CA). Adherence to social isolation policies (social distancing, sheltering in place, and cessation of long-distance travel), use of nonsocial precautionary measures (handwashing, wearing a mask), core belief violation, meaning made of the COVID pandemic, and CA were assessed in a sample of 408 North Americans. Process analysis revealed that adhering to social isolation policies predicted lower levels of CA and that this effect was largely mediated by conservation of core beliefs (e.g., in predictability, control, and self-agency) and ability to make meaning of the pandemic. In contrast, exclusive reliance on nonsocial protections such as handwashing and mask wearing was associated with high levels of CA. These results suggest that social isolation policies support the integrity of adherents' meaning systems, thereby mitigating distress, which carries useful implications for both policy and psychological intervention.

AB  - Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is postulated as the most effective measure to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the use of other protection measures is necessary to efficiently combat the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study was to determine the attitudes and intentions toward COVID-19 vaccination among non-regular social media users in Spain and to analyze how these factors could condition the acceptance of other personal protective measures once an individual has received the COVID-19 vaccine. A cross-sectional design was used in this work. In total, 719 subjects, >= 18 years old and of both sexes, were recruited from primary public healthcare centers to self-complete a questionnaire between March and April 2021. The majority of participants had a positive attitude toward vaccination and showed high levels of intention to be vaccinated. Likewise, except those participants who considered the vaccine to be the most effective measure to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the rest of the participants highlighted the importance of continuing to limit social interactions and/or wearing masks even after being vaccinated. Since vaccination can create a perception of total immunity against SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary that healthcare staff organize effective awareness campaigns on the importance of maintaining personal protective measures until vaccination coverage is greater.

AB  - This research examines the implications of COVID-19 on the relationship between organisational learning and operational performance in service organisations. By using social learning theory and transactive memory system theory, we developed competing hypotheses on how organisational learning and COVID-19 outbreak interact with each other to explain 10 their impact on operational performance. To test our hypotheses, we surveyed 106 employees of service organisations who have been remotely working during COVID-19 outbreak. The collected data were analysed through multivariate data techniques. We specifically measured operational performance to assess the organisation's performance as they were the ones immediately affected by the outbreak of COVID-19, which then is expected to have a lagged 15 impact on financial performance. Through exploratory factor analysis, we identified two bundles of COVID-19 work implications, namely home office work environment and social distancing. Results confirmed that home office work environment positively mediates the relationship between organisational learning and operational performance of service organisations. Our research adds to theory, since we evidenced that individuals' behaviours and work environment reciprocally influence each other, even when individuals are actually apart from the usual work environment, asobserved during the pandemic.

AB  - The entire globe is facing a dangerous pandemic due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The medical and scientific community is trying to figure out and adopt effective strategies that can lead to (i) preventing virus expansion; (ii) identifying medications for the management of critical care and reducing rates of mortality; and (iii) finally discovering the highly anticipated vaccine. Nutritional interventions have attained considerable scientific evidence in disease prevention and treatment. The main question, "What is the role of nutrition and food science in this scenario?" requires urgent answer as many theories suggesting that specific food or dietary supplements can fight coronavirus infection have received extensive coverage in most popular social media platforms. In this editorial, we focus on some frequent statements on the role of nutrition and food science in the battle against COVID-19, distinguishing between myths and facts. We highlight that social distancing and hygiene precautions are the best practices for reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We further underline the importance of nutrition in its wholistic concept, pointing out the risk of unproven dietary options that could lead individuals to weaken effective precautionary measures.

AB  - Given the profound role that media play in public opinion, there exists an ongoing necessity to understand the portrayal of mental illness by journalists. There is a plethora of studies that have examined how mental illness is portrayed in the media, but few studies have sought to understand what journalist opinions about mental illness are, and none could be found regarding journalism students' opinions. This study aimed to bridge this gap by examining journalism student's attitudes towards mental illness using the Social Distance Scale (SDS). This study adheres to STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduate journalism students (n = 172) completed the SDS with findings suggesting that students had moderate stigmatizing attitudes, with varying degrees of stigma present depending on the social context. Positively framed reporting and constructive media coverage surrounding mental illness may be improved by shared communication and education with health professionals who specialize in mental health: mental health nurses.

AB  - This article addresses how mainstream media are conceptualised as a site for mediated recognition in the city of Sydney, Australia. Utilising the notion of political listening, the analysis investigates how participants position certain media outlets as misrecognising the value of diverse voices. Through in-depth interviews, the article explores how audiences discuss perceived issues of significance to society in their recall of news coverage spanning politics, migration, international conflict and local crime. First, the article clarifies how participants construct specific racialised notions of Otherness by situating their use of mainstream media discourses in the context of their everyday communicative interactions. Second, it examines how racialised frameworks are mobilised by participants to evaluate certain news media as spaces of exclusion. This article posits that the participants' discussions of these media spaces as being integral in fostering inclusion endows the media outlets with a capacity for enhancing everyday mechanisms of mediated recognition.

AB  - Background: The measurement of nurse perception on safety, and the factors associated to safety climate, direct the development of effective strategies in reducing adverse events, and patient safety improvement.
   Design and Method: This research was quantified, using the teamwork and safety climate domains of an Indonesian translated version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ-INA). The teamwork and safety climate domain scores were calculated, using the published SAQ-INA scoring algorithm. The univariate and multivariate median regression models were performed to examine the association between potential predictors and safety climate.
   Result: The results showed that 279 nurses responded to the survey (82% response rate). While most of them had a positive attitude towards teamwork (n=170, 61%), fewer possessed the same mentality towards safety climate (n=109, 39%). The lowest level of teamwork was perceived by nurses working in the emergency department (median 71, interquartile range 12.5), and safety climate (median 64, interquartile range 14.2). Furthermore, those that worked in the private hospitals, also reported lower levels of safety climate, compared to nurses in the public health centres (median difference=-3.571, p=0.009).
   Conclusion: Ward and hospital type were associated with the level of safety climate, perceived by nurses. Understanding the key areas, the intervention is best directed to target hospital wards with poor safety climate, in a bid to reduce adverse events, and improve patient safety.

AB  - This study takes place from the idea that the personal usage of mobile technologies can bring positive outcomes to the user and to their society in an indirect way. Technologies studied in this work are defined as persuasive technologies (Fogg, 1997) because they are intentionally designed to modify the users' attitude or behavior. This research is aimed to evaluate if the intention to use the application can be influenced by positive attitudes toward technology, by the persuasive power of the application and by the perceived fun. Participants (N = 118; M = 55; F = 63; mean age = 27.4; range age = 1569) filled in an online questionnaire that was partly based on the Media and Technology Usage and Attitude Scale (MTUAS - Rosen et al., 2013). An additional eight items were added to the scale, aimed at evaluating participants' technophobia, technophilia, perceived technology pervasiveness and perceived persuasive power of technology. By using linear regression analysis, it was found that the application's informational power and the perceived entertainment positively influenced the usage intention. Another interesting result, obtained through ANOVA, concerns a generational difference: baby boomers tended to trust more the fact that the single individual action through the application can have an effective impact on the environment. These results represent a basis for future in-depth investigations about socially relevant use of the ICT.

AB  - Several factors affect the use of maternal health care services in developing countries. The aim was to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women in a rural area of the Moroccan High Atlas regarding aspects of maternal health, and to identify the determinants of use of maternal health care services. A cross-sectional study of 87 participants was conducted in a mountainous area near Marrakech utilizing two sampling methods (a door-to-door approach, and a mobile health caravan). Fisher test was used to compare two proportions, and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to compare two means (p value was 0.05). Median participants' age was 24 years old [15-60]. Findings indicated that husband's education (p=0.005), woman's age (p=0.011), awareness of warning signs during pregnancy (p=0.01) and use of health center for other purposes other than pregnancy (p=0.007) were important influencing factors for use of prenatal consultation services. Factors that influenced supervised birth outcomes were the age of the woman (p=0.013), her education (p=0.027) and a positive attitude towards monitoring her pregnancy by a health professional (p=0.006). To improve utilization rates for maternal health services, these factors must be considered when designing interventions that aim to improve the quality of these services in the community.

AB  - In order to explore the impact of potential new technologies in the area of prenatal screening, we conducted a baseline study using qualitative interviews to explore women's attitudes and knowledge regarding current and future prenatal screening technology and methods. Three cohorts were interviewed, including healthy women without children, healthy women with healthy children, and healthy women with children who have de novo genetic disorders. This study aimed to assess the baseline understanding and attitudes of women in Western Australia. Women from each cohort demonstrated adequate knowledge of the differences between screening and diagnostic tests, but were mostly unaware of the conditions for which screening is currently available except Down syndrome. Women who had children with de novo genetic conditions were generally aware of more genetic conditions than women with or without healthy children. Most women recognised the genetic basis for the conditions mentioned. Two thirds of women understood that Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition; just one third recognised that the phenotype is variable. Most women expressed a positive attitude towards Down syndrome. Social acceptance of children with Down syndrome was commonly mentioned as a concern. While the majority of women with children supported screening for Down syndrome, they emphasised that it must be an autonomous choice. General knowledge of genetic conditions illustrated that women are exposed to diverse conditions from lived experience as well as the media.

AB  - BackgroundBurnout among nurses is a worldwide public health epidemic that adversely affects nurses' quality of life as well as the patient's outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of stress on nurses' burnout and to identify the mediating effects of secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction among clinical nurses in South Korea.MethodsA quantitative, cross-sectional study evaluated the survey data from 10,305 female registered hospital nurses who participated in the Korea Nurses' Health Study (KNHS) Module 5. The survey included a demographic questionnaire and the Professional Quality of Life version 5 (ProQOL 5). Bootstrap analyses (using the PROCESS macro) were employed to evaluate the mediating effect between variables.ResultsStress was significantly associated with burnout and mediated by secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction (beta (indirect 1)=0.185, Bootstrap confidence interval (BS CI) [0.175, 0.194]; beta (indirect 2)=0.226, BS CI [0.212, 0.241], respectively). In addition, the magnitude of the indirect effects of compassion satisfaction was significantly greater than the magnitude of the indirect effects of secondary traumatic stress (beta (indirect 1)-beta (indirect 2)=-0.042, BS CI [-0.058, -0.026]). The findings of this study indicate that the positive aspect (compassion satisfaction) of work experiences can offset the negative aspects (secondary traumatic stress), consequently reducing burnout level.ConclusionsOur study findings suggest that a multidimensional approach to assessing nurse burnout and implementation of proper management will improve quality of life for nurses and help maintain positive attitudes and quality of patient care.

AB  - Officer-involved shootings have become an unfortunate regular part of news coverage. After such events, the media often select expert sources to explain the news to the public. Social media has changed this media-source dynamic. Today, laypeople-often African Americans-can go online and provide information that counters the media's narrative. This analysis examines the effect people's perception of sources has on their opinion of the Black Lives Matter Movement (#BLM). It also tests what other factors shape audiences' beliefs about this issue. It finds that people who oppose #BLM have a strong orientation toward social dominance, are less likely to view America as the land of opportunity, and have ideas akin to those of modern racists, in that they oppose Affirmative Action and other race-based programs. This analysis also proposes a change to the Elaboration Likelihood Model, which serves as its theoretical basis. On racially charged issues, the personal relevance of an issue does not appear to matter; people will evaluate such topics via central processing.

AB  - Purpose Despite the importance of sustainability, some conservative religious groups do not believe and support climate change. There is a continuous debate on the role of religion on people's attitudes toward the environment. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to (1) explore the impact of consumers' religious orientation on motivation and commitment toward recycling; (2) examine the impact of economic motivation, commitment and love for nature toward intention to recycle; (3) investigate the mediating effect of motivation, commitment and love for nature on the relationship between consumer religiosity and their intention to recycle; and (4) examine the impact of consumers' intention toward its subsequent behavior. Design/methodology/approach Using convenience sampling methods, participants were recruited through an online survey platform (MTurk). The total completed respondents are 827 participants. Findings The results show consumers' religiousness influence their motivation, commitment and love for nature. This study shows that consumers with high intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness are more likely to be motivated by economic motivation. Being religious does not make consumers more environmentally friendly. Research limitations/implications This study did not separate religion and between religious and non-religious consumers. Each religion may perceive environments differently. Future research may investigate each religion separately. Originality/value This paper has several contributions: (1) it contributes to the debate on the impact of religiousness on consumers' attitudes toward sustainable-related behavior such as recycling. Does it matter? (2) the results show the most effective way to increase people's intention to recycle; and (3) the results of this study will have implications for government, religious institutions on how to increase positive attitude toward the environment especially among religious consumers.

AB  - This study investigated predictors of sense of campus belonging among postsecondary students with psychiatric disabilities. Participants were 566 current or past students with self-reported diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. Descriptive statistics, multiple regression, and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data. Regression results showed that campus engagement and psychosocial inclusion variables accounted for substantially more of the variance in sense of campus belonging than available symptomatological variables. Follow-up path modeling demonstrated the strong mediating role of sense of social exclusion, sense of opportunity, student relationships, and participation in clubs and organizations in the relationship of symptoms factors with sense of belonging. Implications for future research and program development are discussed, with an emphasis on moving beyond symptom-centered interventions to those that stress robust campus integration and engagement.

AB  - No previous studies have examined how negative brand placements influence consumer behavior. According to this study's theoretical framework and empirical results, the effectiveness of these placements varies with the type of negativitythat is, either intrinsically or extrinsically connected to the brand. Based on the elaboration likelihood model, an intrinsically (extrinsically) negative placement will be very (barely) relevant to the viewers who, having (lacking) enough motivation, will process the information through the central (peripheral) route of persuasion. Under the central route, a careful consideration of the intrinsically negative information will discourage the viewers from consuming the brand, especially when they perceive the movie content as being realistic. Under the peripheral route, the extrinsically negative information will not be strong enough to discourage the brand users from consuming the product but will stimulate the brand nonusers to consume it, especially when these people like the movie and have a positive attitude to advertising. The hypothesized effects were confirmed in an experiment with 1103 moviegoers that viewed the film Good Bye, Lenin! under natural conditions in Santiago, Chile. To isolate the influence of two brand placements (Burger King with intrinsic negativity and Coca-Cola with extrinsic negativity), the participants were randomly assigned to two groups, each one of which viewed the movie with only one of the two placements (the other had been removed).

AB  - This study measured the impacts of failure in Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) during the outbreak of a contagious Corona viral disease. The study measured the impacts by the number of individuals and hospitals exposed to the virus. The 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea was used to investigate the consequences of CERC failure, where the names of hospitals exposed to MERS-CoV were withheld from the public during the early stage of virus diffusion. Empirical data analyses and simulated model tests were conducted. The findings of analyses and tests show that an early announcement of the hospital names and publicizing the necessary preventive measures could have reduced the rate of infection by approximately 85% and the number of contaminated healthcare facilities by 39% at maximum. This level of reduction is comparable to that of vaccination and of social distancing.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant social distancing measures offer a compelling context through which to understand the changing relationship between journalism and place. Through an ethnography of news making at a major Indonesian news broadcaster, this study explored the material settings of news making during the pandemic and the consequences of the place-based realignments on journalistic practice, professionalism, and authority. Four main findings emerged. First, we found that as far as broadcast journalists are concerned there are no alternatives to the newsroom; making news in the newsroom was synonymous with their professional journalistic identity. A second finding is to highlight the key role of place in shaping press-source relations. In our case, the loss of physical proximity to government sources had major consequences for power relations between journalists and authorities. Third, certain news objects held particular meaning for journalists, and that when disrupted, can have deleterious consequences for their professional identity. Finally, our study witnessed an important shift in journalistic routines that favoured the live field report over pre-recorded packages or in-depth analysis. Findings are discussed in the context of ongoing debates about journalistic routines, identities, and the "material turn" in journalism studies.

TI  - Men's Response to Obulamu Campaign Messages about Male Involvement in Maternal Health: Mukono District, Uganda
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
KW  - BEHAVIOR
AB  - Men?s involvement makes a difference in maternal health. Well-informed and supportive men may encourage their wives to get more complete and regular antenatal care. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, however, men?s involvement with their wives? health during pregnancy is minimal. This study investigated men?s response to Obulamu: How?s Your Pregnancy radio campaign messages about attending antenatal care with their wives, delivering at a health facility, being tested for HIV, maintaining maternal nutrition, and using malaria prevention. We conducted eight focus group discussions ranging from six to ten participants each: two groups of men from a rural area, two groups of men from a peri-urban area, and two groups each of expectant or recent mothers from the same rural and peri-urban areas. We also conducted six key informant interviews of midwives and other healthcare providers. Findings revealed that participants were highly exposed to the Obulamu campaign and knowledgeable about campaign messages. Most men expressed positive attitudes toward behaviors promoted by the campaign and voiced an intention to change their behaviors. Key informant interviews confirmed that since the start of the campaign an increase in male involvement with maternity visits had taken place. However, a sizeable minority of men, mostly rural residents, resisted involvement in their wives? antenatal visits because of poverty, gender and cultural stereotypes, fear of HIV testing, and incongruity between messages and the realities of antenatal clinical practice. An interaction between individual and institutional-level factors as posited by the social ecological model was clearly evident; there was an incongruity between encouraging Obulamu messages about men?s involvement and the discouraging realities of antenatal clinical practice.

AB  - Objective: To examine women's experiences with sexual assault screening by health care professionals and identify factors that influence women to disclose their sexual assault history to providers.
   Design: Cross-sectional descriptive survey with correlational analysis.
   Setting: On-line survey distributed nationally.
   Participants: One hundred forty-three women.
   Methods: Participants were recruited through social media; the authors e-mailed organizations across the nation and asked them to share links to a Facebook page connected to the survey. Descriptive statistics, Spearman's rho, and contingency tables were calculated, and qualitative content analysis was performed by thematic analysis. Results: Most (n = 103, 72.5%) participants reported that they felt comfortable with being asked about sexual assault, but only 41 (28.7%) participants were screened for sexual assault by health care professionals. Positive attitude and increased comfort level with screening were associated with increased intention to disclose past assault (p < .05). A total of 113 (82.5%) women reported intentions to disclose sexual assault to a provider if asked, whereas only 35 (24.6%) women would voluntarily disclose. Women identified prevention of medical and physical consequences as main facilitators to disclosure, and provider attitude and demeanor as the main barriers. Sixty-nine (48.9%) participants were victims of sexual assault. Women with a history of sexual assault were no more likely than women not victimized to have been screened for sexual assault.
   Conclusion: Study findings suggest that women are often not screened for sexual assault despite being receptive to inquiry. Health care professionals often do not identify those who have been sexually assaulted because they do not ask. Thus, many victims do not receive needed sexual assault resources and support.

AB  - Objectives: The present study aims to determine the attitudes of care providers including obstetricians, paediatricians and midwives working in perinatal, obstetric and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) wards of the selected teaching hospitals in Tehran in 2019. In addition, the challenges of providing palliative care from the perspective of these individuals have been examined.
   Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, the research population was selected through convenience sampling based on the inclusion criteria. To assess care providers' attitude toward the perinatal palliative care and the challenges of its implementation, in addition to the questionnaire of demographic characteristics, a researcher-made questionnaire was also used.
   Results: Most of the care providers (90.5%) believed that parents should be involved in decision-making to select the treatment type. Most of the care providers (90%) believed that the lack of prepared infrastructures is one of the major challenges in providing these types of care.
   Conclusion: Care providers have almost positive attitudes toward the various dimensions of providing perinatal palliative care, but it has not been properly implemented yet due to the insufficient knowledge of this type of care, the lack of required infrastructures (appropriate conditions in NICUs to provide this type of care, the sufficient number of staff and experts in this field), as well as the health authorities' neglecting this type of care.

AB  - Purpose Corporate scandals involving senior executives plague many businesses. Although customers and noncustomers may be exposed to news of the same scandal, they may appraise dimensions of the transgression differently, thereby affecting post-scandal patronage intentions. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether and how consumer-firm affiliation affects future patronage intentions by examining nuances in customers' vs noncustomers' reactions toward the transgressor's professional performance and immoral behavior. Design/methodology/approach Four between-subjects experimental studies were used to test whether performance-relevant and/or immorality-relevant pathways drive customers' vs noncustomers' post-scandal patronage intentions. The results were analyzed using analysis of variance, parallel mediation and serial mediation. Findings The results demonstrate that performance judgment, and not immorality judgment, drive the relationship between consumer-firm affiliation and post-scandal patronage intentions (Study 1a), regardless of the order of information presented (Study 1b). Customers form more positive performance judgments because they give more weight to performance-related information (Study 2), demonstrating a sequential effect of consumer-firm affiliation on post-scandal patronage intentions only through the performance-relevant, and not immorality-relevant, pathway (Study 3). Research limitations/implications This research contributes to the literature on social distance and moral judgments. Future research should examine other deleterious outcomes such as brand sabotage and negative word-of-mouth, as well as potential moderators including repeated transgressions and prevalence of the infraction in other firms. Practical implications This research offers important nuances for understanding how performance and immorality judgments differentially operate and affect post-scandal patronage intentions. The findings highlight the strategic value of communicating the leader's performance (e.g. professional contributions) as a buffer against potential declining patronage. Originality/value Offering new insights into the extant literature and lay beliefs which contend that harsh moral judgment reduces patronage intentions, this research uncovers why and how exposure to the same scandal can result in varying moral judgments that subsequently influence patronage intentions. Importantly, this research shows that the performance-relevant pathway can explain why customers have higher post-scandal patronage intentions compared to noncustomers.

AB  - The Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) has been shown to have good psychometric properties for English-speaking populations, but it has not been validated among low-risk pregnant women in Spain. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the translated version of the IIFAS in order to examine infant feeding attitudes in Spanish women with an uncomplicated pregnancy. Low-risk expectant women (n = 297) were recruited from eight primary public health care centres in Galicia (Spain). Questionnaires including both socio-demographic and breastfeeding characteristics and items about infant feeding were administered during the third trimester. Participants were contacted by telephone during the postpartum period to obtain information regarding their infant feeding status. Prediction validity and internal consistency were assessed. The translated IIFAS (69.76 +/- 7.75), which had good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha = 0.785; area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve = 0.841, CI95% = 0.735-0.948), showed more positive attitudes towards breastfeeding than towards formula feeding, especially among mothers who intended to exclusively breastfeed. This scale was also useful for inferring the intent to breastfeed and duration of breastfeeding. This study provides evidence that the IIFAS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing infant feeding attitudes in Spanish women with an uncomplicated pregnancy.

AB  - Mental health stigma can be detrimental not only for the recipient, but also for the stigmatizer. As mental health stigma is often conceptualized as a multidimensional construct. Study 1 first examined the factor structure of mental health stigma as assessed by the Stigmatizing Attitudes-Believability (SAB: Masuda, Price, Anderson, Schmertz, & Calamaras, 2009). Study 2 investigated differential relations between the factor-analytically derived components of mental health stigma and psychological distress and psychological flexibility. Results of Study 1 revealed that mental health stigma consisted of two related, yet separable components: Exclusion and Course/Origin. The Exclusion component was characterized by negative emotions and cognitions associated with an increased desire for social distance. Course/Origin was marked by pessimistic views toward treatment prognosis and recovery. Results of Study 2 suggested that these two components have differential associations with psychological distress and flexibility. The Course/Origin component of stigma, but not Exclusion, was associated with psychological distress of the stigmatizer. Furthermore, this association was fully mediated by lower levels of psychological flexibility. These findings suggest the importance of conceptualizing mental health stigma multidimensionally.

AB  - Due to a sex ratio imbalance and marriage squeeze in China, many males of marriageable ages cannot find wives. To meet their sexual needs, those bachelors tend to use the internet to find sexual partners in recent years. However, studies on the psychosocial mechanisms underlying having sex with partners met online are scarce. This study examined the relationship between attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, and having sex with online partners based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of bachelors (with rural household registration, at least 28 years old and never married) (N = 735) in several regions of China. Logistic regression models show that attitudes and subjective norms were significantly associated with having sex with online partners. The mediation analysis further indicated that the intention of seeking sex partners online partially mediated the relationships across attitudes, subjective norms, and having sex with partners online. This study provides a better understanding of factors associated with having sex with partners met online. It also extends research concerning a population that is understudied. Additionally, it shows the applicability of the TBP model in explaining the factors associated with having sex with partners.
   LAY SUMMARY This study explores the psychosocial mechanism of having sex with partners met online among Chinese bachelors, guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior. We found that bachelors who hold more positive attitudes and subjective norms are more likely to have sex with partners met online. The findings extend knowledge from the studies of MSM and adolescents in western societies to bachelors in China.

AB  - Background: Palliative care is predominantly accessed late in the course of an illness, despite evidence to suggest the benefits of early engagement. Strategies are required to reduce the barriers to the delivery of palliative care. Aim: To describe community understandings of and attitudes to palliative care and explore characteristics significantly associated with favourable attitudes towards palliative care. Design: Cross-sectional survey data were collected including several sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of palliative care and attitudes to palliative care. Correlational analyses identified factors related to positive attitudes to palliative care. Those of significance (p <= 0.01) were examined using a multiple regression model to determine their predictive value. Setting/participants: A community-based sample of consecutive English-speaking adults who volunteered their participation in response to a study advertisement distributed online through established community groups. Results: A total of 421 participants (75% female, mean age: 51 +/- 15.1) reported a median of at least three misperceptions of palliative care. Older age, previously undertaking a caregiving role, knowing someone who had received palliative care and reporting more accurate knowledge of palliative care significantly predicted favourable attitudes to palliative care (adjusted R-2 = 0.24, F(8, 333) = 13.2, p < 0.001). Other factors typically associated with health literacy such as tertiary education, working at a medical facility and speaking a language other than English at home were not predictive. Conclusion: Gaps in knowledge about palliative care exist in community, which may limit citizen's potential access to quality care in the event of serious illness. These results point to a role for public education programmes, which may, in turn, also shift attitudes to palliative care.

AB  - This article elaborates on different modes of reflecting and on the significance of these differences for educational and educational-psychological practice. It contrasts exemplary materials from two research projects at schools where students share experiences of social exclusion, poor performance in mainstream educational settings, economic challenges, and family-related problems. These materials stem from my own ethnographic research that took place at an experimental vocational school in Germany in 2004 and 2005, and an a posteriori analysis of a school project that took place at the Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California from 1994 to 1998. Echoing Foucault as well as Vygotsky, the article demonstrates how diaries and narrations by young women written in different educational contexts promoted different forms of communication between teachers and students as well as qualitatively distinct modes of reflection. The analysis advances received scholarship by differentiating between introspection about oneself and reflection on the societal relations within which one is positioned. The focus on marginalized populations strengthens the argument by virtue of addressing challenging cases where this second kind of reflection is even more critical to one's development.

AB  - Robotization of work is progressing fast globally, and the process has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing integrated threat theory as a theoretical framework, this study investigated affective attitudes toward introducing robots at work using a four timepoint data (n = 830) from a Finnish working population longitudinal study. We used hybrid multilevel linear regression modelling to study within and between participant effects over time. Participants were more positive toward introducing robots at work during the COVID-19 pandemic than before it. Increased cynicism toward individuals' own work, robot-use self-efficacy, and prior user experiences with robots predicted positivity toward introducing robots at work over time. Workers with higher perceived professional efficacy were less and those with higher perceived technology-use productivity, robot-use self-efficacy, and prior user experiences with robots were more positive toward introducing robots at work. In addition, the affective attitudes of men, introverts, critical personalities, workers in science and technology fields, and high-income earners were more positive. Robotization of work life is influenced by workers' psychological well-being factors and perceived as a welcomed change in the social distancing reality of the pandemic.

AB  - Sharing the stories of people whose lives are impacted by Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) can be a promising strategy to reduce stigma and increase support for beneficial public policies. Since a story can be told from a first-person or third-person point of view (POV), this study sought to (1) determine the relative persuasive effects of narrative POV and (2) identify the underlying psychological mechanisms, including character identification and psychological reactance, of such narratives. A one-way between-subjects experiment was conducted among a college student sample (N = 276). Narrative POV was manipulated by describing a college student's OUD experience from either the first- or third-person POV. Findings demonstrated that POV did not influence identification but had a significant effect on reactance. Specifically, the first-person (vs. third-person) POV narrative led to lower reactance, which was associated with participants' decreased desire to socially distance themselves from people with OUDs and stronger support for public health-oriented policies regarding OUDs. This study sheds light on the mixed findings revealed in the literature and has practical importance in health message design in the current opioid epidemic.

AB  - COVID-19 affects the paediatric population less frequently than adults. A retrospective study was performed in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Mexico City in children <18 years of age who were hospitalized with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. Included in the study were 86 patients with a median age of 10 years old (IQR 2.6-14.3 years), who were classified in three groups: previously healthy, with chronic disease and immunosuppressed patients. The principal signs and symptoms were fever (81%), cough (51%) and headache (35%). A total of 20 patients (23%) required management in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and 17% needed mechanical ventilation for an average of 12.7 days (IQR 2-29 days). There was no statistically significant difference between the three clinical classification groups in those patients admitted to the PICU, most of which were previously healthy patients. The mortality rate was 5% (four patients). Given that the paediatric population is susceptible to infection, potential transmitters and to clinical presentations with variable degrees of severity, it is important to continue reinforcing social distancing measures.

AB  - Objective This pre-registered study was designed to test whether reminders of death and coronavirus would have similar or different effects on health behavior intentions concerning COVID-19 (e.g., mask wearing, social distancing) and whether the type of framing of these behaviors would moderate these effects. Design The study utilized a 3 (threat: mortality salience vs. coronavirus reminder vs. control topic) x 3 (framing: autonomy-supportive vs. controlled vs. neutral) design. Measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, reactance proneness, and political orientation were included as individual differences. Results Although the interaction between threat and framing conditions was not significant, the data revealed that (1) lower perceived threat of COVID-19 was associated with lower health behavior intentions to reduce the spread of the virus; (2) after an induction to express their thoughts and feelings about COVID-19, participants with low perceived threat of COVID-19 significantly increased their health intentions; (3) perceived threat of COVID-19 moderated the relationship between reactance proneness and health intentions, such that those high in reactance proneness reported lower intentions unless they had high perceptions of threat; and (4) politically conservative participants reported lower intentions to engage in healthy behaviors, and this relationship was mediated by their lower perceived threat of COVID-19.

AB  - Recognizing that powerholders operate in dynamic relational and interdependent work contexts, we posit that the effects of psychological power on powerholders are more complex than currently depicted in the literature. Although psychological power prompts behaviors and perceptions that harm the powerless, these reactions are not without consequence for the actor. We integrate the social distance theory of power with consent-based theories of power to posit that, although psychological power elicits negative behaviors and perceptions, these same reactions hurt leaders' subsequent well-being. To explore this possibility, we conducted an experimental experience sampling study with a sample of managerial employees whom we surveyed for 10 consecutive workdays. We find that leaders enact more abusive behavior and perceive more incivility from others on days when they are exposed to psychological power compared to days when they are not. Leaders higher in agreeableness are less affected by psychological power. In turn, abusive behavior and perceived incivility harm leaders' subsequent well-being as indicated by their reduced need fulfillment and ability to relax at home. We discuss theoretical implications for research on psychological power, abusive leadership, perceived incivility, and leader well-being, as well as practical implications for employees and their organizations.

AB  - This article studies the influence of entrepreneurial spirit on college students' entrepreneurial ability and entrepreneurial values. Firstly, the impact of entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial spirit on entrepreneurial values is analyzed. Secondly, the role of entrepreneurial values in innovation and entrepreneurship education is analyzed and summarized under new media. Then, based on entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial spirit, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to investigate the entrepreneurial values of students in one university in Shaanxi Province, China. The QS analysis suggests that most respondents hold a positive attitude, and their attitude is on the rise. The QS results of "Reasons for entrepreneurial failure" show that 40.37, 31.9, 25.98, and 11.75% of respondents think they lack financial support, business skills, ability, and understanding of policies and laws, respectively. The QS results of "What factors influence entrepreneurial values?" reveal that 39.43% of the respondents chose the "Models of successful entrepreneurs," successful entrepreneur models can effectively encourage students to receive entrepreneurship education, followed by 28.94% who choose "Achieve their own life goals." In terms of "Solutions against entrepreneurial risks," nearly 70% of the students have chosen the negative options. In terms of "Which is the most important entrepreneurial quality?" more students choose entrepreneurial values rather than entrepreneurial quality, proving that students generally lack entrepreneurial values. Given these problems, corresponding countermeasures are put forward to strengthen entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurship education, in an attempt to cultivate college students' entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability under the new media. The results provide some data support for the impact of college students' entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability.

AB  - The theory of symbolic annihilation or symbolic violence has been used in academic literature to describe the way in which sexual minorities have been ignored, trivialized, or condemned by the media. This article aims to de-center research from issues of media representation to consider the capacity for minority groups to proactively use new media and its various avenues for interactivity, social networking, and feedback to fight social exclusion. This work suggests that new media has become a space in which the nominally marginal in society may acquire social artillerya term used to describe how sexual minorities utilize their expanding and more readily accessible social connections in digital space to combat instances of homophobia. The research draws on the results of an inquiry into the relation between media and a regional youth social justice group in Australia tackling homophobia. The research demonstrates that the group is becoming increasingly adept and comfortable with using a cross-section of media platforms to fulfill their own objectives, rather than seeing themselves as passive subjects of media representation. This article argues that this sets an example for other socially excluded groups looking to renegotiate their relation with the media in regional areas.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose an unprecedented challenge for the world as people strive to cope with this significant threat to their well-being. This intensive longitudinal study of the first 94 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea (Phase 1: initial outbreak, Phase 2: intense social distancing) examined individuals' changes in well-being, in relation to their use of coping strategies and fear of infection. A sample of 10,464 South Koreans participated in surveys during Phase 1 and Phase 2, resulting in 35,846 observations. Multilevel growth models revealed a decrease in well-being while different coping strategies moderated the individual rate of change in well-being. Although preventive measures were associated with a greater decrease in well-being, cognitive appraisal and behavioral strategies predicted stable well-being during the pandemic. Coping strategies further mediated the association between fear of infection and deterioration of well-being.

AB  - Why have the effects of COVID-19 been so unevenly geographically distributed in the United States? This paper investigates the role of social capital as a mediating factor for the spread of the virus. Because social capital is associated with greater trust and relationships within a community, it could endow individuals with a greater concern for others, thereby leading to more hygienic practices and social distancing. Using data for over 2,700 US counties, we investigate how social capital explains the level and growth rate of infections. We find that moving a county from the 25(th) to the 75(th) percentile of the distribution of social capital would lead to a 18% and 5.7% decline in the cumulative number of infections and deaths, as well as suggestive evidence of a lower spread of the virus. Our results are robust to many demographic characteristics, controls, and alternative measures of social capital.

In a between-subjects design, participants were exposed to (a) a media story in which a murderer was labelled with autism spectrum disorder (media exposure condition) or not labelled with any disorder (control) and (b) an autism spectrum disorder-education condition attacking the myth that people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder are likely to be violent criminals or a no-autism spectrum disorder-education condition. Participants attitudes towards three different crime perpetrators (one with autism spectrum disorder) described in separate vignettes were probed. The media exposure linking crime and autism spectrum disorder promoted more negative attitudes towards individuals with autism spectrum disorder, whereas the positive autism spectrum disorder-related educational message had the opposite effect.

AB  - Objective. To measure the impact of a depression training day for pharmacists that included a 75-minute session with a consumer educator.
   Design. The training day included interactive lectures on depression; the effects and side effects of and indications for the use of antidepressants; adherence issues; non-drug treatment options for depression; and basic skills in communication. Pharmacists also participated in a session with a consumer educator and in counseling exercises that included role playing.
   Assessment. The study used a randomized, clustered, comparative design to measure pharmacists' stigma, attitudes, and current practice related to the provision of pharmaceutical care to people with depression. Mean scores for depression-care practice after the training session were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group. Analysis of the changes between baseline and postintervention measures in both the control and intervention groups confirmed a significant difference in the change in both social distance and practice but no significant difference in the change in attitude between the 2 groups of pharmacists.
   Conclusion. A continuing-education depression training day for pharmacists that involve consumer educators may improve the care delivered in the community pharmacy to people with depression.

AB  - The last decade has witnessed a burgeoning interest in studies exploring the link between psychosis spectrum disorders (PSD) and altered immune function. While epidemiological and clinical studies point to evidence for increased peripheral inflammatory markers in PSD, it is not clear whether peripheral inflammation correlates with central inflammation in the brain. Furthermore, these studies are confounded by multiple methodological and disorder-related factors such as antipsychotic medications, smoking, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, all of which independently contribute to altered inflammation. Clinical and animal studies provide encouraging evidence that inflammatory processes can define-trans-diagnostic neuropsychiatric domains such as-positive/negative valence, affective dysregulation, and cognitive impairment. In this commentary, we speculate on whether inflammation-mediated pathways may serve as a final-common pathway for environmental risk factors of early-childhood adversity, adolescent cannabis use, social exclusion, and on the possible mechanisms mediating the pathophysiology of PSD. We propose an integrative framework and suggest future research strategies that may help disentangle the link between immune dysfunction and PSD.

AB  - Patriotism and threat have been shown to predict immigration attitudes. We suggest that patriotism is influential in producing threat, and such threat drives anti-immigration attitudes, but this relationship is different for Whites and Latinos. All participants completed a patriotism scale (blind and constructive patriotism measures), a threat scale (realistic and symbolic threat), and anti-immigration attitude scale. Latinos showed lower blind patriotism, realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anti-immigration attitudes compared to Whites, with no differences in constructive patriotism. Threat partially mediated the relationship between blind patriotism and anti-immigration attitudes for Whites and fully mediated the relationship for Latinos. Threat partially mediated the relationship for cultural patriotism and anti-immigration attitude for Whites but not for Latinos. Implications for public policy and education concerning immigrant attitudes are discussed.

AB  - Ethnic-based rejection, especially when prolonged over time, can result in withdrawal (e.g., resignation) and antisocial (e.g., delinquent) behaviors. Rejection (dis)identification literature suggests that identification with the minority (ethnic) group and disidentification with the majority (national) group mediate the relationship between rejection and different dimensions of well-being. Through secondary analyses of survey data from an international sample of adolescents with a migrant background (N = 1,163) we tested the predictions that, following chronic experiences of rejection, disidentification from the national (rejecting) group will increase withdrawal and feelings of resignation whereas identification with the ethic (rejected) group will have a protective role toward delinquent behaviors. Results of the path analysis were consistent with these hypotheses without significant differences between immigrant generations. The study sheds light on the multifaceted nature of identification processes following social rejection and contributes to the integration of the rejection-identification model with classical theorizations of social exclusion.

AB  - With the rapid growth and popularity of Social Streaming Apps (SSAs) worldwide, it is valuable for scholars to understand the links between immersive experience provided by SSA, users' attitudes towards SSA, and the resultant SSA dependency. Although unexplored in the SSA context, previous research has indicated the significance of immersive experience and its influence on user's specific behavior through user attitude. The present study employs Structural Equation Modelling, by using 459 samples from a survey, to explore how the intensity of immersive experience can influence the degree of user dependency on SSA. Results indicate that immersive experience is positively associated with users' positive attitudes towards SSA, which would lead to SSA dependency. In addition, this study also found out that users' favorable attitude partially mediates the relationship between immersive experience and solitary play dependency. Whereas, attitude fully mediated the relationship between five out of six dimensions of SSA dependency. Furthermore, to better comprehend the intervening relationships between immersive experiences, user attitude, SSA dependency, the study also conducted a moderation analysis taking frequency of use as a moderating variable. The results illustrate that a high frequency of use is a strong psychological indicator for SSA dependency. This supports the importance of considering actual behavior along with their psychological states when examining users' immersive experience and their SSA dependency.

KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - Immigration is a highly polarized issue in the United States, and negative attitudes toward immigrants are common. Yet, almost all Americans are descended from people who originated outside the country, a narrative often evoked by the media and taught in school curricula. Can this narrative increase inclusionary attitudes toward migrants? We draw from scholarship showing that perspective-taking decreases prejudice toward out-groups to investigate whether reminding Americans about their own immigration history increases support for immigrants and immigration. We propose that priming family experiences can indirectly stimulate perspective-taking and induce empathy toward the out-group, which we test with three separate survey experiments conducted over two years. Our findings show that priming family history generates small but consistent inclusionary effects. These effects occur even among partisan subgroups and Americans who approve of President Trump. We provide evidence that increased empathy for immigrants constitutes one mechanism driving these effects.

AB  - Objectives: The present study examined Australian ED nurses' practices in asking patients about alcohol and assisting them to manage their alcohol consumption. It also investigated strategies to support ED nurses in these interventions.
   Methods: A two-stage survey was administered to ED nurses. The first questionnaire measured theoretical and organizational predictors of behaviour, and underlying beliefs, and the subsequent questionnaire explored rates of asking and assisting patients.
   Results: A total of 125 nurses returned the first questionnaire. Participants held generally positive attitudes, perceived norms, feelings of legitimacy and perceived ability to ask about and intervene for alcohol, but lower role adequacy. The 71 ED nurses who completed the second questionnaire had intervened with almost 500 patients concerning alcohol in the previous week. Participants asked approximately one in four patients about alcohol (median = 26.3% of patients, 1095/4279 total patients asked). The Theory of Planned Behaviour did not predict rates of asking or assisting patients. Several strategies were identified that might increase rates: identify environmental factors that prevent nurses acting on their intentions to ask and intervene, raise confidence and skills, make asking about alcohol part of routine assessment, make supports such as drug and alcohol units or nurses available, and implement organizational policies on alcohol.
   Conclusions: Nurses appear positively disposed to engage with patients in regard to alcohol. However, greater support is needed to achieve the considerable significant public health benefits from this engagement. The findings point to several practical strategies that could be pursued to provide this support.

AB  - The present paper examined the relationship between everyday experiences of ostracism and psychological distress by focusing on the potential moderating role of psychological flexibility. As expected, data from a two-wave survey of 299 internet users (Study 1) indicated that perceived ostracism was positively related to psychological distress. However, the findings revealed that when psychological flexibility was low, the relationship between perceived ostracism and psychological distress was significant. By contrast, we found that for those with high levels of psychological flexibility the relationship between perceived ostracism and psychological distress was no longer significant. This pattern of findings was replicated in a separate two-wave survey of 231 internet users (Study 2). Implications of the present research suggest that strategies to increase psychological flexibility may help individuals cope with everyday experiences of ostracism.

AB  - Since 1965, in Indonesia, people labelled as communists and their descendants have been mistreated. Recently, there has been an issue to apologize to them, but up until now, no official apology has been offered by the Indonesian government. The present study aims to understand how communism is perceived in Indonesia and why communism attributes labelled to a person can lead to negative effects, such as social exclusions. We interviewed 23 Muslims living in Jakarta (i.e., majority group) and used a thematic analysis to organize and describe the data. We found that Muslims who see communists as non-believers view communist members as dangerous and a threat for the unity of the Republic of Indonesia. Among participants with such beliefs, the past maltreatments to accused communists are justified and legitimate; any apology toward the victims is considered not needed. The findings are discussed in the context of collective blaming and group essentialization, and ways to solve the problems are suggested.

AB  - As societies become more connected and digitalised, evidence shows that differences in infrastructure quality are growing between urban and rural areas. The constant catch-up of infrastructure and existing social exclusion factors create a double jeopardy in rural areas. Furthermore, as digital technologies are increasingly embedded into economic, political, social, and personal lives, the disadvantages that occur from disconnection manifest differently depending on the social context of an individual, organisation or community. There is a need to improve our understanding of specific contexts of digitally excluded groups and develop targeted policies and programmes. Drawing from fieldwork in rural communities in Australia, this article examines the relationship between limited connectivity, the local context and socio-economic outcomes in rural areas. We suggest a customised policy framework that is responsive to the diversity and uniqueness of local contexts in connectivity and digital inclusion.

AB  - Background: Dengue fever has been a major health threat to Malaysia over one century since 1902. This situation is getting worse every year so that the government has taken an affirmative action to tackle this particular issue. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of government support, climate changes, public attitude, population growth, and environment on dengue infection. Also, this study considered the environment as a mediator construct as the past literature revealed its role in dengue infection model.
   Methods: In order to identify the relationship between exogenous and endogenous constructs, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. Also, in order to identify the factors affecting dengue infection, measurement and structural model evaluation were applied. Using stratified sampling method, 670 questionnaires were distributed among prospective respondents from eastern region, but in turn, only 505 cases could be used after data cleaning process.
   Results: Considering environment factor as a mediator, the results show that public attitude and population growth have a significant impact on the environment, while government support, public attitude, and environment factors have a significant impact on dengue infection. Population growth was the most important factor affecting dengue fever.
   Conclusion: According to the results, dengue fever that emanating from four exogenous and one mediator constructs are adequate to discuss on respondent perception of dengue fever in Malaysia.

AB  - Weight stigma, a negative attitude toward persons who are overweight, can lead to emotional detriment (increased vulnerability to depression and anxiety, decreased self-esteem) and discriminatory practices (denial of employment, lower wages, refusal of job promotion or college admission, healthcare deprivation), which have increased dramatically in the United States over the past decade. We report two experiments that implicate nostalgia as a resource or strategy for weight stigma reduction. We hypothesized and found that nostalgia about an encounter with a person who is overweight improves attitudes toward the group "overweight." Undergraduates who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) interaction with an overweight person subsequently showed more positive outgroup attitudes. The effect of nostalgia on outgroup attitudes was mediated by greater inclusion of the outgroup in the self and increased outgroup trust (Experiments 1 and 2), as well as reduced intergroup anxiety and greater perceptions of a common ingroup identity (Experiment 2). The findings have interventional potential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study extended the scope of previous findings in human-computer interaction research within the computers are social actors paradigm by showing that online users attribute perceptions of moral qualities to Websites and, further, that differential perceptions of morality affected the extent of persuasion. In an experiment (N = 138) that manipulated four morality conditions (universalist, relativist, egotistic, control) across worldview, a measured independent variable, users were asked to evaluate a Web site designed to aid them in making ethical decisions. Web sites offered four different types of ethical advice as participants contemplated cases involving ethical quandaries. Perceptions of the Web sites' moral qualities varied depending on the type of advice given. Further, the Web sites' perceived morality and participants' worldview predicted credibility, persuasiveness, and attitudes toward the Web sites.

AB  - Twenty-five years after George Gerbner and colleagues' seminal report on television and science attitudes, there is a need to update the data on television's portrayals of science and to revisit the cultivation question. We address this need by analyzing 21st-century television depictions of science and examining the relationships between exposure to television and attitudes toward science with an analysis of 2006 General Social Survey data. Content results show that scientists appear infrequently in prime-time dramatic programs, are typically White males, and are frequently cast in good or mixed roles rather than as evil scientists. Regarding the cultivation effect, we do not find a significant direct relationship between television viewing and negative attitudes toward science after relevant controls are taken into account. Additional results, however, indicate a displacement effect of television viewing on science attitudes and show significant interaction effects consistent with mainstreaming.

AB  - Vascularized composite allograft (VCA) transplantation has emerged as a groundbreaking surgical intervention to return identity and function following traumatic injury, congenital deformity, or disfigurement. While public attitudes toward traditional organ/tissue donation are favorable, little is known about attitudes toward VCA donation and transplantation. A survey was conducted of 1485 U.S. residents in August 2016 to assess VCA donation attitudes. Participants also completed the Revised Health Care System Distrust Scale. Most respondents were willing to donate hands/forearms (67.4%) and legs (66.8%), and almost half (48.0%) were willing to donate the face. Three-quarters (74.4%) of women were willing to donate the uterus; 54.4% of men were willing to donate the penis. VCA donation willingness was more likely among whites and Hispanics (p < 0.001), registered organ/tissue donors (p < 0.001), and those with less health care system distrust (p < 0.001) and media exposure to VCA transplantation (p = 0.003). Many who opposed VCA donation expressed concerns about psychological discomfort, mutilation, identity loss, and the reaction of others to seeing familiar body parts on a stranger. Attitudes toward VCA donation are favorable overall, despite limited exposure to VCA messaging and confusion about how VCA donation occurs. These findings may help guide the development and implementation of VCA public education campaigns.

AB  - Background: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly boosted the implementation of digital services worldwide, it has become increasingly important to understand how these solutions are integrated into professionals'routine work. Professionals who are using the services are key influencers in the success of implementations. To ensure successful implementations, it is important to understand the multiprofessional perspective, especially because implementations are likely to increase even more.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to examine health and social care professionals' experiences of digital service implementations and to identify factors that support successful implementations and should be considered in the future to ensure that the services are integrated into professionals' routine work.
   Methods: A qualitative approach was used, in which 8 focus group interviews were conducted with 30 health and social care professionals from 4 different health centers in Finland. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The resulting categories were organized under the components of normalization process theory.
   Results: Our results suggested 14 practices that should be considered when implementing new digital services into routine work. To get professionals to understand and make sense of the new service, (1) the communication related to the implementation should be comprehensive and continuous and (2) the implementation process should be consistent. (3) A justification for the service being implemented should also be given. The best way to engage the professionals with the service is (4) to give them opportunities to influence and (5) to make sure that they have a positive attitude toward the service. To enact the new service into professionals' routine work, it is important that (6) the organization take a supportive approach by providing support from several easy and efficient sources. The professionals should also have (7) enough time to become familiar with the service, and they should have (8) enough know-how about the service. The training should be (9) targeted individually according to skills and work tasks, and (10) it should be diverse. The impact of the implementation on the professionals' work should be evaluated. The service (11) should be easy to use, and (12) usage monitoring should happen. An opportunity (13) to give feedback on the service should also be offered. Moreover, (14) the service should support professionals' work tasks.
   Conclusions: We introduce 14 practices for organizations and service providers on how to ensure sustainable implementation of new digital services and the smooth integration into routine work. It is important to pay more attention to comprehensive and continuing communication. Organizations should conduct a competence assessment before training in order to ensure proper alignment. Follow-ups to the implementation process should be performed to guarantee sustainability of the service. Our findings from a forerunner country of digitalization can be useful for countries that are beginning their service digitalization or further developing their digital services.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the multifaceted socio-cultural functions of Australian children's television. As social distancing measures forced school students to study from home, local children's TV producers and distributors contributed to home-based learning. Yet, in response to the pandemic, the Federal Government has indefinitely suspended Australian children's television quotas, the regulatory framework that sets minimum hours of local children's content for commercial television broadcasters. In response to government imposed budgetary restraints, public broadcaster, the ABC, has also made redundances in its children's content department. Such changes have occurred at a critical juncture in which the sector's long-standing contributions to the education of Australian children and pedagogy of local teachers, caregivers and parents have been brought to the fore. We argue that this pedagogical function is a core but often overlooked element of the socio-cultural value of the sector that has been highlighted during the pandemic.

AB  - This paper analyzes the relation between gender role beliefs and prejudice toward gay men and lesbians in Chile. Participants were Chilean university students (N = 283). Results indicate that men are more prejudiced than women and religious people are more prejudiced than non-religious people. On the other hand, gender role beliefs mediate sex differences in prejudice. The participants' more traditional gender role beliefs hold more negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Men are more prejudiced than women, particularly in their attitudes toward gay men. In addition, sex differences in attitudes toward lesbians and gay men are mediated by gender role beliefs.

AB  - Background: Condomless anal intercourse (CAI) is the major risk factor for HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM who are heavier cannabis users engage in CAI more frequently. However, little is known about the processes that may underlie this association. This study sought to understand the potential role of condom attitudes and condom-related planning in the association between cannabis use and CAI.
   Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of a study on alcohol use and sexual decision-making among MSM. Two hundred and fifty-eight MSM with moderate to heavy drinking were enrolled. Measures included CAI, cannabis use, attitudes about the influence of condoms on sexual pleasure, condom use planning, age, heavy episodic drinking, and use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
   Results: We conducted a negative binomial regression analysis controlling for age, PrEP, and heavy episodic drinking. Cannabis use frequency was a significant predictor of CAI (b =.333, p <.001). Indirect effects showed that while heavier cannabis users exhibited less condom-related planning (b = 0.106, p = 0.015) and more negative attitudes toward the impact of condom use on pleasure (b= -0.177, p = 0.004), cannabis use had a significant indirect effect on CAI only through attitude ratings.
   Conclusions: MSM who are heavier cannabis users engage in more frequent CAI and exhibit an indirect effect on CAI through negative attitudes toward the impact of condoms on pleasure. These findings suggest the potential importance of addressing these condom attitudes in HIV-prevention interventions among MSM who use cannabis.

AB  - Contact tracing applications have been deployed at a fast pace around the world to stop the spread of COVID-19 and may be key to containing future pandemics. This study aims to explain public opinion toward cell phone contact tracing using a survey experiment. We build upon a theory in evolutionary psychology-disease avoidance-to predict how media coverage of the pandemic affects public support for containment measures. We report three key findings. First, exposure to a news item that shows people ignoring social distancing rules causes an increase in support for cell phone contact tracing. Second, pre-treatment covariates such as anxiety and a belief that other people are not following the rules rank among the strongest predictors of support for COVID-19 apps. And third, while a majority of respondents approve of the reliance on cell phone contact tracing, concerns for rights and freedoms remain a salient preoccupation.

AB  - Nonprofit soccer clubs are currently facing many ethical challenges, such as abuse, doping and match fixing. While research suggests that organizational (board) ethical leadership may be effective to tackle these ethical issues, empirical support in the context of sport remains limited. Drawing on the perceptions of a sample of nonprofit soccer players (n=438) and coaches (n=106), we indicate that the coaches play an important mediating role regarding the associations between board ethical leadership and ethical climate. The theoretical underpinnings of ethical leadershipformed by social learning theory and social exchange theoryand the social distance between the board and the players in nonprofit soccer clubs provide support in this regard. In sum, our results demonstrate that the influence of board ethical leadership in nonprofit soccer clubs partly trickles down to the players via coach ethical leadership. Finally, practical implications for nonprofit soccer club management are discussed.
